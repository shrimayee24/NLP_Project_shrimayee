SC reserves order on Saranda Sanctuary area; Jharkhand for non-inclusion of tribal habitation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-reserves-order-on-saranda-sanctuary-area-jharkhand-for-non-inclusion-of-tribal-habitation/articleshow/124863046.cms,"SC reserves it order (agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday reserved its verdict on the Jharkhand government’s plea to reduce the expanse of to be notified Saranda sanctuary from its earlier 310 sq km to 250 sq km to exclude 60 sq km of forest inhabited by tribals to protect their forest rights as well as schools and educational institutions there.Amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar told a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran that the tribal rights are always protected in a sanctuary and the real reason for Jharkhand govt in seeking exclusion of 60 sq km was to cater to lobbies interested in mining in the area. He said that the mines already in operation by steel authority of India (SAIL) are already exempt by the SC.Parameshwar said that the earlier affidavit of the state placed an unequivocal stand that all the 126 blocks of Saranda forest, earlier a game reserve comprising pristine Sal tree forest with wildlife, was free from tribal habitation. Notifying a forest as sanctuary does not erase the forest rights of tribals, he said citing the statutes.Appearing for Jharkhand, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said that the state has to handle a restive situation arising from its proposal to notify Saranda forest as a sanctuary, which contrary to amicus curiae’s claim has no wildlife. The forest rights of the tribals require protection as much as the schools where the tribal children study, he said.The bench said the state had been taking contradictory stand before the court on the expanse of the Saranda Sanctuary but clarified that it would protect the forest rights of the tribals. Appearing for tribal population, senior advocate Gaurav Sharma told the court that the forest dwellers want to harvest seasonal produce like resins, mahua flowers and other forest products to sustain themselves.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for SAIL, said the court would also protect the mining interests of the public sector company and allow ancillary activities linked to mining. The bench reserved verdict and asked the parties to submit written notes by Friday.",The Supreme Court on Monday reserved its verdict on the Jharkhand government’s plea to reduce the expanse of to be notified Saranda sanctuary from its earlier 310 sq km to 250 sq km.

'What Is Preached Not Necessarily Practiced’: Jaishankar Takes Veiled Swipe At West Over Trade

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar flagged what the Indian govt sees as US and Europe's double standards in pressuring India to stop buying Russian oil, as he addressed the East Asia Summit in Malaysia, filling in for PM Modi. He said energy trade is increasingly constricted, with resulting market distortions, and ""principles are applied selectively and what is preached is not necessarily practised"".Jaishankar, who delivered India's statement at the summit after meeting his US counterpart Marco Rubio, sought an early end to conflicts as he stressed how in current circumstances energy flows and food security were being undermined.

NEW DELHI: Cyclone Montha brewing over the Bay of Bengal is set to make landfall between Machilipatnam and Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh on October 28 evening, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.The storm is likely to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm, bringing wind speeds up to 110 kmph and heavy rainfall across Andhra and south Odisha.Also read: Cyclone Montha live updates: Odisha, Andhra Pradesh on high alert; 8 districts mapped as ‘red zones’ in Odisha As of early Monday, Montha lay centred about 680 km south-southeast of Kakinada (Andhra Pradesh) and 850 km south of Gopalpur (Odisha).According to IMD’s latest bulletin, the storm is likely to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm within the next 12 hours before crossing the Andhra coast between Machilipatnam and Kalingapatnam. Maximum sustained winds are expected to reach 90–100 kmph, gusting to 110 kmph, with a storm surge of up to one metre above astronomical tides in low-lying coastal areas.“People in coastal Andhra and south Odisha are advised to stay indoors once the cyclone nears landfall. We expect heavy to very heavy rainfall on October 28 and 29,” said S Jagannath Kumar, IMD scientist, Amaravati.Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu has placed the entire state administration on high alert, directing district collectors and SPs to ensure zero loss of life.Following a review meeting on Sunday, Naidu identified the Machilipatnam–Kakinada stretch as the most vulnerable zone and instructed departments to ensure seamless coordination in evacuation, relief, and restoration efforts.At least five districts — Kakinada, East Godavari, Konaseema, Eluru, and West Godavari — have swung into action, enforcing school closures, pre-positioning relief materials, and preparing cyclone shelters.In Kakinada, officials began moving residents from Hope Island to safer areas. All schools will remain closed from October 27 to 31 in anticipation of heavy rain and flooding.In Konaseema, collector R Mahesh Kumar ordered the closure of schools and said shelters had been arranged for over 6,000 residents in 34 coastal villages. Authorities have also shifted 428 pregnant women, who were due in the next 15 days, to health centres.NDRF teams and heavy earthmovers have been kept on standby for rescue operations.West Godavari authorities declared holidays for schools and colleges on October 27 and 28, and suspended all beach and resort activities. Officials have started relocating people from dilapidated buildings and low-lying areas to temporary relief camps.Neighbouring Odisha, though not directly in the path of landfall, is expected to face severe peripheral impact from Montha’s heavy rainfall bands.The state government has mapped eight southern districts—Malkangiri, Koraput, Nabarangpur, Rayagada, Gajapati, Ganjam, Kandhamal and Kalahandi—as red zones likely to face extremely heavy rainfall and strong winds.Revenue and disaster management minister Suresh Pujari said the state had begun evacuating vulnerable populations from hilly and landslide-prone areas.“Our goal is zero casualty. We have already deployed 128 response teams, including ODRAF, NDRF, and 99 Fire Service units, across eight districts. Evacuations from risk zones will be completed by Monday evening,” he said.Odisha has also cancelled all government employee leaves, activated round-the-clock control rooms, and directed hospitals to ensure uninterrupted power supply.Along the Odisha and Andhra coasts, fishing activity has come to a complete halt.Over 21,000 vessels, including 2,000 trawlers, have been anchored at fishing harbours and jetties in Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur, Paradip, and Kharinashi, following repeated warnings from the fisheries department.“Many boats returned to harbour on Sunday after we used loudspeakers to alert fishermen. Anyone venturing out will face strict action,” said Rabi Narayan Patnaik, joint director (marine), fisheries department.For the fishing communities, the cyclone adds to existing distress. “Continuous low pressure systems this season have already hit our earnings. Now Montha will keep us ashore again,” said Narayan Haldar, president, Odisha Matsyajibi Forum.The Andhra civil supplies department has drawn up a comprehensive action plan to ensure uninterrupted food, fuel, and essential supply chains during and after the cyclone.Minister N Manohar said Public Distribution System (PDS) commodities have been fully stocked at mandal-level points, while fuel stations in coastal districts have been directed to maintain 100% stock of petrol, diesel, and LPG.Telecom companies have been asked to set up generators to ensure mobile network continuity. Authorities have also granted GPS exemptions for emergency second-stage food grain movement across affected districts.In Gajapati, the district administration has ordered the closure of all major tourist spots and waterfalls, including Mahendragiri and Jirang monastery, to prevent accidents.Collector Madhumita said the district’s eight waterfalls and three tourist sites would remain closed until further notice.Government employees’ leaves have been cancelled, and officers have been appointed as nodal coordinators in each vulnerable block. “All cyclone shelters are functional, and control rooms are operating at panchayat level,” the collector said.In Visakhapatnam, the approach of Cyclone Montha has revived memories of the 2014 Cyclone Hudhud, which devastated the city with losses estimated at Rs 21,000 crore.Residents, recalling the week-long power and communication blackout, are stocking food, fuel, and medicines.“We don’t want another Hudhud situation. Our apartment association has arranged diesel for generators and stored drinking water bottles,” said Krishna, a resident of MVP Colony.The IMD has warned of widespread rain across Andhra Pradesh and southern Odisha from October 27 to 29, with wind speeds of 45–65 kmph even before the system makes landfall.","Cyclone Montha brewing over the Bay of Bengal is set to make landfall between Machilipatnam and Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh on October 28 evening.

Takeaway

NEW DELHI: A Dubai-based Indian traveller has won a legal battle at the Delhi High Court after Customs seized his luxury Rolex watch at the Indira Gandhi International Airport , wrongly classifying it as a “commercial quantity.” The passenger had challenged the Customs order, and the Court ruled that a single high-value watch cannot automatically be treated as goods meant for trade, allowing him to redeem it upon payment of the prescribed fine.The case centres around incident from March 2024, when Mahesh, an Indian citizen residing in Dubai, arrived at Delhi Airport wearing a Rolex Submariner worth around Rs 12.7 lakh. Believing he had no dutiable goods, he passed through the Green Channel- reserved for passengers without items requiring declaration. Customs officers intercepted him, seized the watch, and issued a detention receipt, claiming non-declaration and categorising the watch as a “commercial quantity.”A division bench of Justices Pratibha M Singh and Sahil Jain delivered the verdict, noting that while the Customs Department acted correctly in detaining the item for non-declaration, it erred in categorising one luxury watch as goods meant for trade.The case involved Mahesh, an Indian citizen residing in Dubai, who was intercepted by Customs officers at Delhi Airport in March 2024 after walking through the Green Channel.His Rolex watch was seized for alleged non-declaration. An Order-in-Original passed earlier this year allowed redemption of the watch after payment of a fine, but labelled it a “commercial quantity”- prompting Mahesh to challenge the decision before the High Court.The bench observed that although the Customs Commissioner correctly permitted redemption, the classification of a single Rolex as a commercial import was “unsustainable.”“Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use,” the judges said.However, the Court maintained that the declaration requirement and duty liability for high-value personal articles remain valid under law. The bench allowed redemption on payment of the existing fine by October 31, reiterating that travellers must exercise diligence when carrying luxury or high-value items through Indian airports.The ruling serves as an important clarification for both travellers and enforcement authorities — that while non-declaration attracts penalties, mere possession of an expensive personal item does not imply commercial intent.Under India’s customs baggage rules, every arriving passenger must declare dutiable, restricted, or high-value items, regardless of whether they are for personal use.A declaration is mandatory if a traveller carries:Travellers falling under these categories must use the Red Channel and fill out a Customs Declaration Form upon arrival, as opposed to the Green Channel which is for anyone not carrying any items that require declaration/customs duty.Children below ten years are entitled to half the adult limit, and pooling allowances within a family is not permitted.Luxury goods such as watches, designer accessories, and high-end electronics are not considered personal effects under Customs law. Even when used or worn, these must be declared if they exceed Rs 50,000 in value.For jewellery, men returning after a year abroad can bring up to Rs 10,000 duty-free, while women can bring jewellery worth Rs 20,000. Any excess is assessed for duty at arrival.Failure to declare dutiable or restricted goods can lead to:In Mahesh’s case, the court upheld that Customs acted within its powers in detaining the watch but clarified that the seizure should not have treated the item as a trade import.The High Court’s ruling provides relief in one individual case but carries a broader message for international travellers — high-value personal items like luxury watches must still be declared at Customs counters subject to conditions. Wearing such goods does not exempt them from declaration.In simple terms, declaration ensures lawful clearance and avoids the risk of confiscation, penalties, or prolonged litigation — as illustrated by the Rolex case itself.","The case involved Mahesh, an Indian citizen residing in Dubai, who was intercepted by Customs officers at Delhi Airport in March 2024 after walking through the Green Channel. His Rolex watch was seized for alleged non- declaration. The Delhi High Court ruled that a single high-value watch cannot automatically be treated as goods meant for trade. The bench allowed redemption on payment of the existing fine by October 31, reiterating that travellers must exercise diligence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124825040,imgsize-126110,width-400,resizemode-4/customs-inspects-luxury-watch.jpg"

'CM Mamata sensing trouble': BJP; TMC hits back



Key transfers



NEW DELHI: After the EC announced a pan-India SIR, including West Bengal, the Mamata Banerjee government went for one of the biggest one-day shake-up transferring over 500 bureaucrats. Though dated October 24, the transfer orders were uploaded in phases on the department’s website both before and after the Election Commission announced the SIR.Transfer orders for 61 IAS and 145 WBCS (Executive) officers were uploaded in the first half of the day, followed by postings of six IAS and 315 WBCS officers appearing online soon after the EC’s briefing.The officers will serve as key functionaries in the SIR exercise, and once the schedule is notified, any further transfers by the state would require EC approval, PTI reported citing an official.The SIR will run from November 4 to December 4, with draft electoral rolls slated for release on December 9 and the final list set to be published on February 7.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) questioned the timing of the transfers calling the ""last-minute bulk transfers"" an effort to ""disturb the process (SIR)"".""CM Mamata Banerjee is sensing trouble for her party once this exercise is successfully completed and a large number of fake voters are deleted from the electoral rolls.She is, hence, trying everything in her hand to disturb the process by making such last-minute bulk transfers,"" BJP leader Sajal Ghosh alleged.TMC rubbished the allegations saying it was a ""routine measure"". ""Such transfers take place in the government as a routine measure across the year. There's no reason why one should draw a connection between this and the SIR announcement.

'Some Nations Are Openly Violating...': Rajnath Singh Sends Strong Rule-Based World Order Message

NEW DELHI: India needs to be ""ready for a war-like situation"", with military preparedness being based on indigenous foundations, defence minister Rajnath Singh said Monday, asking the industry to further accelerate self-reliance in defence production.India gave ""a firm response with a firm resolve"" to Pakistan during the cross-border hostilities from May 7 to 10 and the armed forces are fully prepared to defend the country's borders, Singh said.""(But) we must continue to introspect. Operation Sindoor should serve as a case study from which we can learn and chart our future course.

""The established world order is weakening, and conflict zones are increasing in many regions.

NRC case pending in SC, Assam may sees summary rolls revision

NEW DELHI: : Election Commission on Monday ordered the next leg of the special intensive revision of electoral rolls — apan-India exercise covering a dozen states and Union territories, and 51 crore electors in all. Enumeration for this phase shall start on Nov 4 and the final electoral roll, with Jan 1, 2026 as the qualifying date, be published on Feb 7, 2026.Four of the five states/UT where assembly polls are due in April-May next year — West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry — are among the 12 that will witness SIR over the next three months. Assam, though also poll-bound, is not on that list.Chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said Assam cannot be covered by the same SIR norms applicable to other states/UTs as the Citizenship Act has an exclusive provision for Assam — Section 6A — with differential criteria for determining citizenship.Chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said Supreme Court is monitoring the matter relating to ‘citizenship verification programme’ — an apparent reference to National Register for Citizens exercise completed in Assam in 2019 — and it may reach finality soon. “A separate order shall be issued for Assam,” said Kumar.Sources said that since there has to be mandatory pre-poll roll updation in Assam, EC could, in the absence of a final SC order on NRC, go for a summary revision.“This will avoid complications arising out of conflict between electoral roll and NRC,” said an official.Other states/UTs covered in this phase of SIR announced on Monday are Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep. They have been chosen for having mapped a very high percentage of their electors as of Oct 27, with the last SIR roll and adequately prepping their machinery with posting/training of BLOs and training of district magistrates and EROs. The last two on the list are UTs without a legislature. Maharashtra, where SC has ordered conduct of local polls by Jan 31, 2026, is not on the latest SIR list, even as Kerala, where local polls are being discussed but are not notified yet, is.Kumar emphasised that EC would deliver an error-free roll in the 12 states/UTs. “SIR will ensure no eligible elector is left out and no ineligible elector is included,” he said. Citing the receipt of ‘zero appeals’ after publication of final roll in Bihar, he said it stands testimony to perfection with which SIR was carried out and cooperation extended by nearly 7.4 crore electors.Unlike Bihar, the pan-India SIR will not require residents to submit any documents during enumeration phase. Also, a separate box has been added to enrolment forms to record one’s own or parents’/relatives’ details from the last SIR in 2002/2003/ 2004. “Ones not linked to the last SIR roll will be issued a notice to prove their eligibility with one of the ‘indicative’ documents,” said Kumar.On pressure that BLOs may face in states opposing SIR, EC said it is confident that all states/UTs will discharge their constitutional duty under Article 326 by placing their personnel at its disposal for SIR, and maintaining law and order. On transfers of officers in states like West Bengal after announcement of SIR, a senior EC functionary said it signals that these states are ready for the exercise despite threatening to not allow it.Sources said nearly 70- 80% voters in the 12 states/ UTs may find a link to the last SIR roll as thanks to digitisation, an elector in one state/ UT can locate their parents’ name in any other state/UT roll from the last SIR. The CEC said an elector is required by law to sign and submit only one enumeration form.The ‘indicative’ list of documents accepted as proof remains the same as in Bihar. Aadhaar will be accepted only as proof of identity. “If during the hearing, a person offers an alternative document, it will be considered by the ERO,” the CEC said.","NRC case pending in SC, Assam may sees summary rolls revision.

With no response from MTNL over the weekend, he later discovered unauthorised debit transactions of Rs 2 crore during the intervening night of Oct 4-5. A cyber police probe revealed that a new SIM card had been issued by MTNL to an unknown person, and the siphoned amount was transferred to accounts across India. The bank denied any role in the fraud.Makhija lodged a complaint with the banking ombudsman on Nov 6, 2020, but it was dismissed on Jan 15, 2021.His advocates Harish Pandya and Pankaj Bafna informed the court that no hearing was given and the order was not even communicated; Makhija obtained a copy only through an RTI application. RBI's counsel said the central bank could not confirm whether a hearing was held.While restoring the complaint, the court directed the state to submit before the ombudsman a copy of the chargesheet or cyber report within four weeks. It also asked the ombudsman to consider Reserve Bank of India's July 2017 circular that limits customer liability if cyberfraud is reported within three days.The high court said banks must adopt a ""sensitive approach"" in such matters and ensure measures to prevent recurrence.

""We have discussed this with some private school associations.

‘Mumbai’s first underground metro a blessing for commuters’

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday took the Maharashtra govt to task for its poor execution and maintenance of compensatory afforestation sites as it had persuaded the court to permit several Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL) projects and grant in principle approval to tunnelled Goregaon-Mulund road link as part of East-West Connectivity project.Finding that only 50% of the 20,460 trees planted under the compensatory afforestation plan for Mumbai Metro projects have survived, a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said, ""If this is the status of implementation of the afforestation plan on ground, we will recall all previous permissions for felling trees to lay metro lines and stations.""The deputy director of Sanjay Gandhi National Park informed the court most of the surviving plants are between one and 20 feet in height and others have perished as there is little protection and maintenance of the afforestation sites, most of which do not have required fertility with the soil being rocky in character.CJI Gavai said, ""It is gross negligence by the state and its authorities. We had permitted felling of trees keeping in mind the principle of sustainable development by which the public interest is served through requisite infrastructure but causing minimal harm to existing tree cover. Your conduct shows otherwise. Is this the way afforestation plans are implemented?""SC, which had earlier given in principle approval for cutting trees at the entry and exit points of the tunnelled road, said the BMC application would be kept pending till the Maharashtra chief secretary files an affidavit on or before Nov 10 detailing the steps to be taken for effective implementation of compensatory afforestation plans, framed in lieu of development projects.The bench asked the chief secretary to consult all stakeholders, including BMC and MMRCL and related bodies, while framing the guideline for implementation of afforestation plans in letter and spirit. ""Unless we are satisfied with the plan, we will not allow any more projects requiring forest clearance,"" the bench said and warned the chief secretary that he would be held personally liable for future violations of the afforestation implementation guidelines.","Only 50% of the 20,460 trees planted under the compensatory afforestation plan for Mumbai Metro projects have survived.

Kenya’s sacred Mrima Hill turns into a real-world ‘Avatar’: The hidden $62 billion mineral war drawing in the US and China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/kenyas-sacred-mrima-hill-turns-into-a-real-world-avatar-the-hidden-62-billion-mineral-war-drawing-in-the-us-and-china/articleshow/124845288.cms,"Source: SCMP

Mrima Hill becomes ground zero in the global hunt for critical minerals



China FIRES WARNING SHOTS At Trump Before Xi Jinping Bilateral; 'You Cannot Stop...' | WATCH

Mrima Hill’s local community struggles to protect their sacred forest



Kenya’s mining reforms aim for growth amid corruption and governance concerns



Mrima Hill community split between hopes for development and fears of losing their land



Cultural heritage and environmental concerns





Mrima Hill in Kenya’s coastal region has emerged as a focal point of global interest and growing local tension. Vast deposits of rare earth minerals lie beneath its lush forest, vital for producing smartphones, electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. Major global powers like the United States, China and Australia have been attracted towards the valuable resources, all seeking to secure access to minerals critical for the world’s transition to advanced technologies and low-carbon industries. While the international race for these resources intensifies, the surrounding communities face uncertainty over their land, environment, and future, as Mrima Hill becomes a symbol of both opportunity and potential exploitation in Kenya’s quest for sustainable development, highlighting the urgent need for fair resource management and transparent benefit-sharing with local populations.Mrima Hill, located near the Indian Ocean in Kwale County, covers about 390 acres. It may look like an ordinary forest, but beneath the soil lies a treasure trove of rare earth minerals and niobium. A 2013 report by Cortec Mining Kenya, a subsidiary of the UK and Canada-based Pacific Wildcat Resources, estimated that these deposits were worth approximately 62.4 billion dollars. Niobium, one of the key minerals found in Mrima Hill, is used to make stronger steel and in advanced technologies that support green energy transitions.The hill’s enormous economic potential has attracted foreign attention. In June, Marc Dillard, then the interim US ambassador to Kenya, visited the site, signalling Washington’s growing interest in African mineral reserves. At the same time, reports emerged of Chinese nationals attempting to access the forest, though local guards prevented their entry. Recently, Australian companies RareX and Iluka Resources announced plans to explore rare earth mining in the region, further intensifying the international competition.This sudden global interest has brought both hope and anxiety to the people living around Mrima Hill.The communities surrounding Mrima Hill are primarily made up of the Digo people, an ethnic group with deep cultural and spiritual ties to the forest. For generations, the forest has provided food, medicine, and spiritual refuge. It is home to sacred shrines, medicinal plants, and wildlife that form an integral part of local traditions.However, the promise of mineral wealth has also become a source of fear and division. Many residents worry that they will lose their land or receive nothing from the profits that foreign companies hope to make. “People come here with big cars, but we turn them away,” said Juma Koja, a community guard. His words reflect a deep mistrust that stems from years of failed promises and opaque deals.In 2013, the Kenyan government revoked Cortec Mining Kenya’s licence, citing environmental and licensing violations. Cortec claimed it was punished for refusing to pay a bribe to the then-mining minister, Najib Balala, a charge Balala denied. The company’s repeated court appeals were unsuccessful. This controversy has left a lasting sense of betrayal in the community and reinforced the perception that mining often benefits outsiders rather than locals.Kenya’s mining sector has long struggled with corruption, poor regulation, and lack of transparency. In 2019, the government temporarily banned new mining licences to combat illegal activities and environmental damage. However, the rising global demand for rare earths, combined with China’s restrictions on mineral exports, has renewed Kenya’s interest in reviving the sector.This year, the Ministry of Mining announced a major reform programme to restore investor confidence and strengthen regulation. The reforms include tax incentives, simplified licensing procedures, and promises of greater transparency in the approval process. The government aims to increase mining’s contribution to Kenya’s economy from less than one percent of GDP to ten percent by 2030.Experts, however, caution that without strong institutions and fair enforcement of the law, the reforms could fail to bring lasting benefits. Daniel Weru Ichang’i, a retired economic geology professor at the University of Nairobi, warned that many Kenyans have an overly optimistic view of mining. “There’s a romantic idea that mining is a quick path to wealth,” he said. “But corruption and poor governance make this industry very risky. If Kenya wants to benefit, the law must be respected, and the national interest must come before personal gain.”Despite these fears, not everyone in the community opposes mining. Some see it as a rare opportunity to escape poverty. Domitilla Mueni, treasurer of the local community forest association, has been improving her land by planting trees and crops to increase its value in anticipation of potential land purchases by mining companies. “Why should we die poor while we have minerals?” she asked, expressing the hopes of those who believe mining could bring development, schools, and better infrastructure to the region.This divide reflects a broader dilemma faced by many resource-rich countries: how to balance economic growth with environmental protection and community rights. Kenya’s challenge is not only to attract foreign investment but also to ensure that the benefits of its natural wealth reach its people without destroying their heritage or environment. The conflict surrounding Mrima Hill is a microcosm of a larger global struggle for control over rare earth minerals. As the demand for these materials grows, Africa has become a new battleground for geopolitical influence between Western nations and China.For the people of Mrima Hill, mining threatens more than just land ownership. The forest is intertwined with their cultural and spiritual identity. It contains sacred groves used for ceremonies and healing, as well as unique plants and animals that have been part of their way of life for centuries.","Mrima Hill in Kenya’s coastal region has emerged as a focal point of global interest and growing local tension.

Right to work for H-4 visa holders stands as US Supreme Court declines appeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/right-to-work-for-h-4-visa-holders-stands-as-us-supreme-court-declines-appeal/articleshow/124848052.cms,"H-1B Visa Changes Explained: Indian Talent Could Gain Or Lose Depending On Policy





The decade-long legal battle over the right of H-4 visa holders to work in the United States reached closure in mid-October, after the US Supreme Court (SC) declined to hear an appeal by Save Jobs USA, effectively leaving intact lower court rulings that upheld employment authorisation for certain spouses of H-1B visa holders.The SC’s refusal to take up the case brings finality to a dispute that began in 2015, when the Obama administration introduced the H-4 Employment Authorisation Document (EAD) rule. to mitigate the problems faced by certain sections of immigrants (such as the Indian diaspora) who faced backlogs running into several decades to obtain an employment based green card.Under the EAD rule, in those cases where the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card or has got an extension beyond the permitted six years, the spouse holding an H-4 visa can apply for employment authorization.For thousands of families—many of them Indian—the decision ends years of uncertainty over whether spouses, largely women, would be forced to quit their jobs or leave the workforce.This Supreme Court development comes on the back of a key ruling in August 2024, when the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the authority to grant work permits to certain H-4 spouses.The district court had rejected arguments that DHS had exceeded its mandate under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Circuit Judge Walker, relying on earlier precedent in the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers case, had held that Save Jobs USA had failed to meaningfully distinguish its challenge, thereby upholding the district court’s summary judgment in favour of the government. This ruling had already solidified the legal footing of the H-4 EAD, providing relief to nearly a lakh Indian spouses who hold these work permits.With the Supreme Court’s refusal to intervene, the focus now shifts to the future of the H-4 work programme under a Trump administration. Steven Brown, partner at Reddy Neumann Brown, an immigration law firm, in his blog post emphasised that the program’s legal footing is stronger than ever. However, he pointed out that during Trump’s earlier tenure as President, the administration had attempted to end the H-4 EAD through rulemaking, but the proposal never reached final publication. “Under Trump 2.0, DHS could revive those efforts with sharper focus. Possible actions include issuing a new notice of proposed rulemaking to rescind or narrow eligibility for work authorization, or directing internal reviews that slow or suspend EAD adjudications while new regulations are developed. Although any change would still need to follow the notice-and-comment process, the administration might move swiftly and test the limits of executive authority to reshape employment-based immigration policy,” he said.",The US Supreme Court (SC) declined to hear an appeal by Save Jobs USA. The SC’s refusal to take up the case brings finality to a dispute that began in 2015.

"Delhi Signature View Apartments Demolition: No implosion, no blast: DDA opts for manual demolition of Signature View Apartments; residents bid emotional farewell",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/signature-view-apts-to-be-demolished-manually-due-to-its-poor-structure/articleshow/124857320.cms,"DDA opts for manual demolition of Signature View Apartments







NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) will demolish the Signature View Apartments in Mukherjee Nagar using the conventional floor-by-floor method, instead of adopting the implosion technique that was used for razing Noida's Supertech twin towers.Officials said the decision was taken after experts found the building's structural quality to be extremely poor, making drilling into weak walls to insert explosive materials unsafe. The complex, comprising 10 towers of stilt plus 10 storeys and two towers of stilt plus six storeys, is surrounded by the SFS Flats Society on one side and residential and commercial establishments on the other.Demolition is expected to begin soon, with DDA finalising the agency to carry out the task. ""Given the dense population and the geographical location of the apartments, it was decided that the structures should be demolished manually rather than through explosives,"" said an official.An official said while the work was proposed to start this week, a few residents have not fully complied with the Supreme Court's directions. ""Some people are yet to remove their belongings or submit documents confirming they vacated their flats.This, despite several circulars issued by DDA and repeated communication through the RWA about facilitation camps set up in the complex to assist residents. We urge them to cooperate with the redevelopment plan,"" the official added.According to sources, DDA has issued a final notice to vacate the complex, warning that any remaining flats would be treated as ‘deemed vacated'. The agency responsible for the demolition will be given four months to dismantle the towers and remove the debris. ""We are also taking into account any restrictions on construction activities that may arise under GRAP-II,"" the official said.On Monday, RWA members said no one is currently living in the complex, though a few residents still need to remove their belongings. Some gathered on the premises to celebrate Chhath Puja, marking an emotional farewell.""This is our last Chhath celebration before the redevelopment begins. We hope to return after 36 months and celebrate the festival here again. There are people who haven't yet removed their doors, bathroom fittings and electrical items. A few are facing issues as DDA has discontinued lift operations, but we request everyone to vacate the complex,"" said Gaurav Pandey, general secretary of the RWA. He added that a hearing on the floor area ratio of the complex is scheduled next month, after which the reconstruction of the complex will start.On Oct 13, a joint team of Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and DDA officials disconnected water and power supply to the apartments after several residents sought an extension of the deadline to vacate. SC had set Oct 12 as the final date for vacating all 336 flats.Constructed between 2007 and 2010 and allotted in 2011-2012, the Signature View Apartments began showing structural distress within a few years. Following complaints, DDA commissioned a structural audit by IIT-Delhi in 2021-22, which recommended the immediate vacating and dismantling of the complex due to safety concerns.DDA officials said the authority agreed to the RWA's demand for a facilitation allowance from July 2023, subject to proof such as zero electricity or water bills.",DDA will demolish Signature View Apartments in Mukherjee Nagar using the conventional floor-by-floor method.

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Read full Letter from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella

“Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:

Fifty years after our founding, Microsoft is once again at the heart of a generational moment in technology as we find ourselves in the midst of the AI platform shift. More than any transformation before it, this generation of AI is radically changing every layer of the tech stack, and we are changing with it.

Across the company, we are accelerating our pace of innovation and adapting to both a new tech stack and a new way of working. We are delivering our current platforms at scale while building the next generation, always striving to create more value for our customers, our partners, and the world.

Striking this balance is hard work, and few companies over the years have been able to do it. To succeed, we must continue to think in decades but execute in quarters, approaching each day with the humility and curiosity required to continuously improve, while being guided by our bold vision for the future.

Financially, it was a year of record performance. Revenue was $281.7 billion, up 15 percent. Operating income grew 17 percent to $128.5 billion. And Azure surpassed $75 billion in revenue for the first time, up 34 percent. These results reflect the growing demand for our platform and the trust customers are placing in us. We take neither for granted.

We must earn our permission to operate every day, in every country, every community, and every customer interaction. That's why we remain grounded in our mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

Imagine a world where every person can get help from a researcher, a coder, or an analyst on demand. Not just information, but deep, contextual expertise paired with action. Or where every organization, no matter its size or sector, can reinvent employee experiences, reimagine customer engagement, reshape business processes, and bend the curve on innovation for their people, businesses, and industries. This is the new frontier and how we will unlock the next level of productivity and growth for the world.

But it is not some far off vision—we are already seeing what's possible when AI reaches the frontlines of human potential, helping small businesses become more productive, multinationals more competitive, nonprofits more effective, governments more efficient, and improving healthcare and education outcomes.

To share just a few examples across industries: Mercy, one of the largest health systems in the US, has saved caregivers over 100,000 hours by automatically documenting physician-patient encounters. As one physician put it: ""the best thing to happen to my practice in 10 years."" A grandmother in Japan, who lost her hearing at age two, can now communicate with her voice, thanks to an AI app. A judge in Colombia is using Copilot to expedite due process and help tackle a backlog of court cases. Barclays Bank is putting AI in the hands of 100,000 employees, transforming the employee experience by simplifying how they access information and get things done. Ralph Lauren is helping customers find the perfect look for any occasion, thanks to a new conversational shopping experience. Carvana has reduced inbound calls per sale by 45 percent, freeing its staff to focus on complex, high-value support.

These examples, and so many others like them, are made possible by our clear focus on our priorities, our responsibility, and our culture.

OUR PRIORITIES

To deliver on our mission, we remain focused on three core business priorities as our North Star: security, quality, and AI innovation.

Security and quality are non-negotiable. Our infrastructure and services are mission critical for the world. This year, we made significant progress across both our Secure Future Initiative (SFI) and Quality Excellence Initiative (QEI), but we recognize our work here is never done. We must continuously raise the bar for ourselves and our customers.

Security

Through SFI, we have dedicated the equivalent of 34,000 full-time engineers to our highest-priority security work. We strengthened identity protections, secured our networks and systems, enhanced threat detection and response, and embedded security-by-design practices across everything we build.

Quality

With QEI, we created frameworks that increase accountability and accelerate progress against our engineering objectives to ensure we deliver durable, high quality-experiences at global scale. This includes improvements to change management, incident management, platform resiliency, and service health.

Together, these initiatives are laying the foundation for a renaissance of our engineering culture, where we build planet-scale systems that power the world, with the security and quality they require.

AI innovation

At the same time, we have made major advances in AI innovation, including across two foundational areas: our Cloud and AI infrastructure, and our family of Copilots and agents.

Our Cloud and AI infrastructure

We continue to lead the AI infrastructure wave. We opened new datacenters across six continents and now operate more than 400 datacenters in 70 regions, more than any other cloud provider. This year alone, we added over two gigawatts of new capacity. Every Azure region is now AI-first and can support liquid cooling, increasing the fungibility and the flexibility of our fleet. And just last month, we announced the world's most powerful AI datacenter, Fairwater in southeastern Wisconsin, which will deliver 10x the performance of the world's fastest supercomputer today.

We are also driving and benefiting from compounding improvements in silicon, systems, and models to improve performance and efficiency. And we continue to invest in sovereign cloud offerings to meet the unique data residency needs of governments and industries worldwide.

We have made meaningful progress on the next frontier in cloud systems: quantum. We announced Majorana-1, the first quantum chip with a topological core, and announced the world's first operational deployment of a Level 2 quantum computer in partnership with Atom Computing.

In data and analytics, Microsoft Fabric is becoming the unified platform for the AI era. It is now our fastest-growing analytics product ever, with 25,000 paid customers. OneLake spans all databases and clouds, including Power BI semantic models, making it the best foundation for building enterprise AI applications.

We also introduced Azure AI Foundry, a platform to design, customize, and run powerful AI apps and agents. Foundry includes access to more than 11,000 models from partners like OpenAI, Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and others, ensuring our customers can choose from the best frontier and open models in one place. Already, 80 percent of the Fortune 500 use Foundry for their AI workloads.

And this fall we introduced our first two in-house models: MAI-Voice-1, a super-efficient natural voice generation model that can generate a minute of audio in less than a second on a single GPU, as well as MAI-1 preview, our first foundation model trained end-to-end in-house.

Copilots and agents

Our Copilot family of products is helping people thrive at home, at school, and at work. This year, we surpassed 100 million monthly active users across both commercial and consumer.

We rolled out a major update to Microsoft 365 Copilot this spring, bringing together chat, search, create, notebooks, and role-specific agents like Analyst and Researcher into a single experience. And earlier this month, we announced Agent Mode, which allows you to start with a simple prompt and then work iteratively with Copilot—steering it as it orchestrates multistep tasks to deliver high-quality Office documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.

Give Copilot a prompt like, ""Run a full analysis on this sales data set. I want to understand some important insights to help me make decisions about my business. Make it visual."" Agent Mode gets to work deciding which formulas to use, producing new sheets, and creating data visualizations. It's pretty remarkable.

Copilot Studio continues to grow as well, with more than 230,000 organizations using it to extend Microsoft 365 Copilot or to build their own agents using no-code/low-code tools.

In software development, GitHub Copilot now has more than 20 million users and has evolved into a peer programmer, capable of executing tasks on our behalf asynchronously. In healthcare, Dragon Copilot is being used to document millions of clinical encounters, saving precious time that healthcare providers can spend on patients, not paperwork. And in security, we were the first in the industry to introduce AI agents that help defenders autonomously manage high-volume security and IT tasks.

On the consumer front, Copilot is now integrated across Bing, Edge, GroupMe, MSN,

Windows

, and

Xbox

. We also refreshed our Copilot consumer app this year as a more natural, conversational, and personal AI companion. One highlight is Copilot Mode in Edge, which lets you chat directly with your open tabs.

More broadly, we continue to expand our reach with consumers. LinkedIn is now home to 1.2 billion members, and we are bringing AI agents into the core workflows of sales, hiring, and learning. And across gaming, we have 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY

At Microsoft, we have always believed that we do well when the world around us does well. We demonstrate this, year after year, by making progress on our commitments to create technology that benefits everyone on the planet, along with the planet itself.

This means that as we drive the AI economy, we are also providing the skills and opportunities for everyone to participate in it. That's why we launched Microsoft Elevate this year, an initiative that unites our technology, skills, research, and philanthropic investments, so AI can benefit every classroom, community, and cause. Over the next five years, we will invest $4 billion in cash and AI cloud technology to schools, community and technical colleges, and nonprofit organizations. And we will partner with organizations like UNICEF, Code.org, and more to extend AI skilling opportunities to people around the globe.

Our skilling initiatives will help 20 million people earn AI credentials over the next two years, from foundational fluency to advanced technical training. And to support our work with deeper research and policy insights, our new AI Economy Institute will explore how AI is reshaping education and work, helping us bridge the gap between technological innovation and societal impact.

We are also focused on empowering teachers and students with the latest AI tools, making Microsoft 365 Copilot Personal free for 12 months for every college student in the United States. And we're introducing new LinkedIn courses for teachers and students, enabling them to earn LinkedIn certifications that will help boost their resumes and open doors.

Across all of this, one thing is clear: People want technology they can trust. That's why we are committed to driving responsible AI innovation and building safe and secure technology. As we do, we are guided by our values of respect, integrity, and accountability. They are built into the design of our software and services, the security of our data, our privacy protections, and our engagement with employees, customers, suppliers, communities, and governments around the world.

As a multinational company, we remain dedicated to creating jobs, promoting economic opportunities, and strengthening cybersecurity, digital stability, sovereignty, and resilience globally. In Europe, we announced five commitments to strengthen digital stability this year. They start with an expansion of our cloud and AI infrastructure, so every country can compete in the global economy. And they include a promise to uphold Europe's digital resilience regardless of geopolitical and trade volatility.

Responsible business practices are embedded across our operations and supply chain. Following the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we've strengthened our due diligence processes, expanded stakeholder engagement, and launched new governance mechanisms to ensure accountability. Our second annual Responsible AI Transparency Report highlighted our work to build and deploy AI responsibly. This includes developing new AI tools and resources to help our customers innovate within evolving regulatory requirements.

Another key component of earning trust is contributing to a safer online ecosystem, including protecting those who use our services from illegal and harmful content and conduct. We continue to take new steps to advance safety, especially for children, while balancing our commitments to free expression and privacy. Over the past year, we've focused on addressing risks related to abusive AI-generated content and partnered with StopNCII.org to detect victim-reported imagery in Bing.

Our solutions, partnerships, and programs reach people and organizations of all abilities to help them thrive. More than 5 million people have participated in our AI Skilling programs focused on accessibility. We launched new technology to help people with disabilities play, work, and live—through an Adaptive Joystick for Xbox, sign language detection in Teams, low-vision keyboards for Surface, and AI-powered visual descriptions in Windows.

2025 also marked the midpoint in our journey to become a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company, and to protect more land than we use. We are on track to meet many of our targets and continue to accelerate progress for others.

Our renewable energy procurement increased from 1.8 GW in 2020 to 34 GW in 2024, and we contracted nearly 30 million metric tons of carbon removal—playing a pivotal role in scaling the carbon removal market. We provided more than 1.5 million people with clean water and sanitation and plan to replenish more than 100 million cubic meters of water around the world. We are getting closer to zero waste through new Circular Centers, which contribute to the reuse and recycling of nearly 91 percent of servers and components decommissioned from our datacenters. And we've reached nearly 95 percent recyclability in our product packaging.

We are learning how to make AI more sustainable by design and improve AI-powered solutions. Platforms like our Planetary Computer and our AI for Good Lab are helping us find new ways to address the world's most pressing challenges.

Making progress on these commitments takes time. But here, too—we are guided by a bold vision, thinking in decades and executing in quarters.

OUR CULTURE

Amid this rapid progress, our culture is more important than ever. The AI platform shift is reshaping not just our products and business models, but how we work.

Our growth mindset is essential to our ability to continue leading this AI era. It enables us to innovate both within Microsoft and with those we serve. We must be learn-it-alls, willing to experiment, guided by evaluations, and committed to continuous improvement. I am continually impressed by how our people do just that.

We are focused on being Customer Zero, applying AI to reduce toil and improve flow in our own work while creating a playbook we can share with the world.

We're also embracing a new way of working—one that expands job scopes, reduces handoffs, and gives teams tools to scale productivity in nonlinear ways. This isn't just about driving efficiency. It's about empowering our people to dream bigger and get to ""job complete"" faster, with less friction and greater impact than ever before.

Our employees also continue to find ways to bring their purpose and passion to the causes and communities they care deeply about. This year, they volunteered over 1.2 million hours and gave $263 million (including company match) to 37,000 nonprofit organizations in 110 countries.

In July, after we reported our earnings results—including surpassing $75 billion in annual Azure revenue for the first time—I shared a reflection with all employees. Fifteen years ago, when we set out on our cloud journey, we had a bold vision, and we persisted through all the ups and downs.

I asked our team: What are you working on today that, 15 years from now, you will look back on and say, ""we got it right""? Hundreds of answers poured in spanning near-term priorities and long-term ambitions alike:

""Helping the world be safe from cybercrime"" ""Speech is now a standard human-machine interface"" ""Using AI to improve the lived experience for people with disabilities"" ""We changed the way people learn"" ""Access to millions of agents powered by orders of magnitude larger models"" ""Medical knowledge has become ambient, embedded in clinical workflows""

""We helped billions become skilled in AI""

These responses and so many others reflected a deep sense of purpose and belief in what's possible. And that is precisely what is needed for us to succeed. Microsoft has an immense opportunity and responsibility—not just in building these futures, but in helping shape the world's future. And I'm confident that together, we can continue to think in decades and execute in quarters on this journey to empower us all.

Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Liberal arts graduates find new tech opportunities

From STEM-focused to problem-finding roles, Cognizant’s approach to hiring graduates









Cognizant is ramping up entry-level hiring as artificial intelligence reshapes the workforce, with CEO Ravi Kumar S telling Fortune the company is bringing on more school graduates this year than ever before—and he's looking beyond traditional tech majors to liberal arts colleges and community colleges.Kumar's unconventional hiring strategy stems from his belief that AI will widen the base of corporate employment rather than shrink it. ""I can take a school graduate and give them the tooling so they can actually punch above their weight,"" he told Fortune. ""AI is an amplifier of human potential. It's not a displacement strategy.""The CEO of the 350,000-employee IT consulting firm is actively recruiting non-STEM graduates, including anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and journalists. His rationale: as expertise becomes accessible at everyone's fingertips through AI, specialisation loses its premium. ""Intelligence is not the asymmetry. Applying intelligence is the asymmetry,"" Kumar explained.He urged students to ""start to focus on interdisciplinary skills,"" citing examples like historians blending computational skills to become futurists or biology majors using AI to crack drug development cycles.According to Kumar, the corporate pyramid is becoming ""broader and shorter,"" with faster paths to expertise for those who can leverage AI tools effectively.Kumar sees AI handling the ""middle"" work—the execution and problem-solving—while humans focus on the beginning (prompting, conceptualising, finding purposeful problems) and the end (validation and verification). This shift means companies need more ""problem finders"" rather than just problem solvers, opening doors for disciplines traditionally outside tech's core.The shift extends beyond hiring. Cognizant has launched apprenticeship programs in 30 states and partnered with Merit America for mid-career shifts, offering a ""work, earn and learn"" model. Kumar acknowledges a critical caveat: AI's benefits must be ""distributed equitably"" rather than concentrated among a few to truly boost productivity and create wage distribution.""As people are living longer, the life of their skills is getting shorter,"" Kumar noted, emphasising that future workers will need multiple careers in one lifetime—making adaptable, interdisciplinary skills more valuable than narrow expertise.","Cognizant is hiring more school graduates this year than ever before.

‘Musk’s demands to increase sales pushed resignations’







John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months. His exit marks the latest senior-level departure from Elon Musk ’s executive ranks and comes just months after he was viewed by industry insiders as a potential successor to former CEO Linda Yaccarino, a report has said.Nitti, a former Verizon executive, left X on Friday (October 24), The Financial Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. His departure follows Yaccarino’s resignation in July, after which her duties were divided among several leaders, including Nitti.Nitti’s exit reflects an ongoing wave of senior executive departures since Musk’s AI startup, xAI, took over the social media platform in March. The resignations have reportedly been attributed to frustration over Musk’s sudden strategy changes and the difficulty of executing objectives under his management style.Other recent high-profile departures include:It is also being reported that there has been a constant pressure to boost revenues, which, combined with Musk’s simultaneous spending of billions on infrastructure for the AI race, fueled the resignations.The report said that advertising executives like Nitti have faced intense demands from Musk to increase sales, even as many advertisers have pulled back. Brands were deterred by Musk’s decision to relax content moderation standards based on his ""free speech"" ideals.The report cites sources as saying that Nitti was among sales leaders who grew frustrated with Musk’s management of the advertising business. Following the CEO’s disengagement from the Trump administration this past summer, Musk began making more unilateral decisions around advertising without consulting his leadership team.While xAI has recently secured new media partnerships, including one with Disney, and claims improving advertising metrics due to its AI technology, some advertisers privately complain they felt pressured to spend after X sued several brands for allegedly undertaking an ""illegal boycott.""","John Nitti, the global head of revenue operations and advertising innovation at X (formerly Twitter ), has departed the social media platform after only 10 months.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky expressed interest in integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the travel platform but noted that the technology isn’t yet up to par. Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” recently, Chesky said the current software development kit “wasn’t quite robust enough for the things we want to do. ” Said to be a close friend of OpenAI founder Sam Altman , Chesky added that Airbnb would “probably” incorporate ChatGPT in the future.Airbnb already leverages 13 AI models, including those from OpenAI and Google, to power its service bot. However, Brian Chesky’s remarks underscored a growing trend: open-source AI models, which developers can customize, are gaining ground against proprietary systems like OpenAI’s. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and DeepSeek are driving this shift, releasing advanced, cost-effective open-source AI systems. At Alibaba’s recent Apsara conference, the company reported hosting over 300 open-source AI models, supporting more than 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem.Alibaba’s Qwen 3 series, launched in May, supports over 100 languages, earning praise for its natural multilingual capabilities. In a report by South China Morning Post, Nicolas de Cameret, founder of BotBot Robotics, called Qwen’s models the best for such applications.Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai argued that AI success hinges on rapid adoption, not just building the most powerful models. He contrasted China’s focus on affordable, open-source AI with the U.S.’s heavy investments in trillion-parameter models, suggesting China’s approach fosters faster global uptake.To date, Alibaba has released more than 300 open-source AI models that underpin over 170,000 derivative models, making it the world’s largest open-source AI ecosystem, according to data reportedly released during the company’s annual Apsara conference late last month.",Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky expressed interest in integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the travel platform.

Charlie Javice vs JP Morgan case





JPMorgan Chase is reportedly quite annoyed. Reason: The America's largest bank wants a way out of paying for Charlie Javice's legal bills. This despite the fact that 32-year-old founder of fintech company Frank, Charlie Javice, has been found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million. As a clause in JPMorgan's contract with Javice, tied to the original sale of her startup, Frank, has kept the bank liable for her legal fees.In a Friday court filing, JPMorgan requested an end to its obligation to fund Javice’s legal defense as she appeals her guilty verdict before beginning a seven-year prison sentence. The bank described the legal fees as “patently excessive and egregious,” with $60.1 million already advanced to Javice for her criminal defense. The filing further reads that Javice has ""unreasonably"" hired five law companies, including one that received $35.6 million, calling the arrangement “overlapping, duplicative, and excessive. ”Pablo Rodriguez, a JPMorgan spokesperson, told Business Insider, “The legal fees sought by Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar are an abuse, and we look forward to sharing details with the court in coming weeks.” The bank’s lawyers argued that without court intervention, JPMorgan faces “irreparable injury” from what they described as Javice’s legal team treating the fee arrangement as a “blank check.”Javice’shigh-profile defense team includes Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel, known for representing clients like Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, with an hourly rate reportedly reaching $3,000.In March, a federal jury in Manhattan has found Charlie Javice guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Prosecutors said that she tricked JPMorgan into believing her fintech had data for over 4 million students. JPMorgan’s move comes as the bank seeks to limit its financial exposure tied to the controversial acquisition of Frank, which prosecutors say was inflated by fraudulent misrepresentations.Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.","Charlie Javice, founder of fintech company Frank, found guilty of defrauding JPMorgan Chase of $175 million.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
‘No idea how long people can hold out’: US govt shutdown continues; federal workers feel brunt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-idea-how-long-people-can-hold-out-us-govt-shutdown-continues-federal-workers-feel-brunt/articleshow/124861871.cms,"'Trump Trusts Us To Fix…’: Johnson Goes Ballistic On Dems For ‘Appeasing Marxists’ | Shutdown Day 27





When Jill Hornick woke up on a recent Monday morning, her first thought was that her timecard would be submitted that day for her job with the Social Security Administration in Chicago. But this Monday was different. The federal government was locked in a shutdown, and she received a paycheck for $0. ""This is the only income I have,"" she said. ""And I just started crying. I had a meltdown.""Hornick, 59, is one of 730,000 federal employees working without pay because of the impasse. Another 670,000 federal workers are furloughed without pay, according to data from the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank.As the shutdown stretches toward its fifth week, those govt employees are confronting an increasingly acute scenario. Their bills are mounting, and there is no clear resolution in sight.Some are turning to side hustles such as delivering food, walking dogs and selling personal items to bring in a bit of income. Others are relying on food banks that have been organised to provide federal workers and contractors with free groceries - efforts that community service providers say reflect food insecurity caused by the shutdown.The widespread anxiety is punctuating what has already been a gruelling year for federal workers as the Trump administration has raced to shrink and reshape govt, and moved to eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs.The last shutdown, which came during Trump's first term, was the longest ever, lasting 34 full days. The current standoff, which began Oct 1, could stretch even longer. There are no negotiations for a deal to reopen govt, which Democrats say must include an agreement to extend expiring subsidies for health insurance.The impact of the political paralysis could be seen early Friday morning as hundreds of cars lined a road in Northern Virginia, filled with federal workers and govt contractors waiting for boxes of food being distributed by a local non-profit group. It was one of five sites set up in partnership with the Capital Area Food Bank, a hunger relief organisation, to distribute groceries in the Washington region, which is home to nearly 20% of federal workforce.Casey Perez, a mother of five from Maryland who is furloughed from her civilian job at Fort Belvoir, said the last three weeks had been tough. ""I don't know how to get the mortgage paid,"" Perez, 34, said as three of her children waited patiently in the back seat of her car.Some federal workers are seeking creative ways to string together enough money to cover their bills. Imelda Avila-Thomas, a furloughed labour department employee in Texas, said she had been going from room to room inside her home to see what she could sell to help make ends meet. One piece of furniture jumped out: a tan pullout sofa that her late mother slept on when she visited. Avila-Thomas said that her mother had died in 2022, and that she had held on to the sofa as she was still processing her death. ""I don't think I was ready to get rid of it,"" she said. But she sold it for $40.Under federal law, govt is required to pay back federal workers once funds become available. But Trump has said that may not be the case for everyone. Not all federal workers are going unpaid. Around 830,000 federal employees are still receiving their salaries because their offices are self-funded or there is other money to use, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.As the shutdown continues, govt workers will have to make more tough decisions. Some said that they had called creditors seeking a reprieve. Others said that they were looking to take a loan out of their pension plans.","730,000 federal employees are working without pay because of the impasse.

Justin Trudeau dating Katy Perry: Where is his ex-wife Sophie?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/justin-trudeau-dating-katy-perry-where-is-his-ex-wife-sophie/articleshow/124821950.cms,"Katy Perry Confirms Justin Trudeau Romance? ‘48 Hours Ago’ Comment Stuns Fans

The Life After “Sunny Ways”





The Rise of Roar and Order





The Sophie Question





The Optics of Affection





The Liberal Love Arc









There’s an old rule in politics: you can lose an election, but never lose the plot. Justin Trudeau , the man who once embodied Canada’s moral optimism and salon-ready hair, seems to have followed that advice with evangelical zeal. While Canada debates the price of maple syrup and the future of liberalism, the former prime minister is busy trending for something far more cinematic—his rumoured romance with Katy Perry Yes, that Katy Perry, the pop deity who once sang “I Kissed a Girl” and made an entire generation of millennials question their playlists and sexuality. In a twist that sounds like it was storyboarded by Netflix’s marketing team, she’s apparently been welcomed into the Trudeau household with open arms. His kids, the tabloids coo, are “smitten.” The insiders murmur that Justin is “serious.” The headlines scream “wedding bells. ”But before we cue the fireworks and champagne, there’s an obvious ghost at this glossy banquet: Sophie Grégoire Trudeau.Sophie Grégoire wasn’t just Justin’s partner in photo-ops; she was his emotional translator, the one who made the Trudeau brand human. A former TV presenter with a yoga-teacher calm and a charisma that could sell both self-care and social reform, she stood beside him through the selfie years, the scandals, and the slow-motion implosion of Canada’s liberal fairy tale.When they announced their separation in August 2023, the statement was painfully Canadian in its politeness: “After many meaningful and difficult conversations, we have made the decision to separate.” No vitriol, no tell-all memoir, no courtroom drama—just the quiet unravelling of a modern marriage conducted under fluorescent political light.Since then, Sophie has retreated from the paparazzi and leaned into purpose. She published a wellness-themed book, Closer Together, in 2024, half memoir and half meditation on mindfulness, and became a sought-after speaker on empathy and mental health. In short, while Justin’s life turned into an internet soap opera, Sophie quietly reinvented herself as the kind of grounded, post-marital heroine Oprah would applaud.Her most recent social media post captures that evolution perfectly. “Real love isn’t about carrying it all. It’s about learning when to give, when to receive, and when to simply be,” she wrote, in a caption that reads more like a closing chapter than a cryptic comment. “Reciprocity means allowing space for both people to grow, to rest, to rediscover themselves within the relationship. Because love that breathes is love that lasts. ” It’s the sort of message that could only come from someone who has made peace with both endings and beginnings.Meanwhile, Justin’s post-political evolution has been less meditative and more MTV Unplugged. Enter Katy Perry: global superstar, part-time activist, and full-time headline magnet. The two were reportedly first seen together in Montreal this summer, later photographed on a California yacht, laughing, cuddling, and giving the internet enough serotonin to last three news cycles.“Justin loves how easily Katy fits in with the family,” said one insider, presumably between spin classes. “His kids adore her.” Another claimed he’s “serious about building something lasting.” The narrative practically writes itself: the widowed prince of progressivism finds solace in the queen of empowerment pop.It’s hard to ignore the political irony. Trudeau, once roasted for being too performative, has now become the star of his own romantic reboot. The man who apologised for blackface, bad pipelines, and budget overruns is finally living in technicolour, and the world can’t look away.So, what did happen to Sophie? The answer, it turns out, is refreshingly normal. She’s thriving—privately. Her social media remains measured and warm, filled with reflections on love, self-worth, and balance. Friends describe her as “at peace.” There’s no bitterness, no back-channel sniping, no quiet PR war.In a culture that monetises every breakup, Sophie’s restraint feels almost radical. She isn’t auditioning for relevance or competing with Perry’s glitter. She’s doing what many political spouses dream of but rarely achieve: reclaiming her narrative.Her latest Instagram post, now viral for its understated grace, seems to say it all: love isn’t ownership; it’s space. A philosophy that, in retrospect, might be the most sophisticated response to her ex-husband’s new chapter.Still, the Perry-Trudeau affair raises a few questions. Not moral ones, but cinematic ones. How does a former world leader date a pop star without turning it into a trailer? What happens when diplomacy meets choreography? Does she serenade him with “Unconditionally” before bedtime? Does he counter with an apology drafted in both English and French?It’s hard not to see the symbolism. Trudeau’s political brand was always part rock concert, part sermon. Perry’s music, too, thrives on idealism and spectacle. Together, they’re a duet of self-reinvention, two brands trying to age gracefully in a world that devours sincerity.And yet, there’s something deeply human here. Two middle-aged public figures, both famous for their performance of authenticity, may have finally stumbled onto the real thing. Perry, who has weathered the exhaustion of pop fame and the chaos of past relationships, reportedly finds Trudeau “grounding.” He, in turn, finds her “vital.”Maybe that’s all it is: two people meeting at the intersection of burnout and belief, trying to write a new story away from the noise.As for Sophie Grégoire, she’s no longer part of that story, but she’s certainly no footnote. If anything, she’s proof that grace after heartbreak is the rarest form of charisma.So what happened to Trudeau’s ex-wife?She moved on—quietly, intelligently, and without hashtags.And that, in the age of yacht selfies and engagement rumours, might just be the most Canadian ending of all.","Sophie Grégoire Trudeau and Justin Trudeau announced their separation in August 2023.

US Chaos: Leavitt’s Shutdown Warning Comes True; Tech Meltdown Grounds Alaska Airlines Flights

'Not bulletproof': FATF warns Pakistan against terror funding; greylist exit does not shield from scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/not-bulletproof-fatf-warns-pakistan-against-terror-funding-greylist-exit-does-not-shield-from-scrutiny/articleshow/124798444.cms,"FATF Issues Warning to Pakistan on Greylist Exit, Says Islamabad Still Vulnerable To Terror Funding

Terror funding for attacks in India









The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Saturday cautioned Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo in a press briefing said, “Any country that is on the greylist or has exited it is not bulletproof against criminal actions, whether by money launderers or terrorists. We invite all jurisdictions, including those who have been delisted, to continue their good work to prevent and deter crimes.”Madrazo emphasised that all countries, including those recently delisted, must continue tightening safeguards against illicit financial activities. Her remarks come amid reports that Pakistan-based terror groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammad, have been using digital wallets and crypto channels to fund terror operations while masking financial flows.While Pakistan met key compliance benchmarks to exit the FATF greylist, it remains under follow-up by the Asia Pacific Group (APG), as the country is not a FATF member. The follow-up ensures Islamabad continues aligning with FATF’s global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terror financing (CTF) standards.The greylist, formally known as the list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, identifies countries with “strategic deficiencies” in curbing financial crimes and terror funding. India’s National Risk Assessment 2022 has highlighted Pakistan as a high-risk source of terror financing, citing persistent threats despite formal FATF compliance. A recent FATF report also noted rising instances of state-sponsored terrorism and flagged Pakistan’s National Development Complex as a proliferation risk in South Asia.In July this year, the global terror funding watchdog reported that explosives used in terrorist attacks in India were procured through e-commerce platforms. The revelation came in connection with attacks in Pulwama and at the Gorakhnath temple in Uttar Pradesh.Digital platforms, including social media, messaging apps, and crowdfunding sites, are increasingly being exploited for terror financing. Reported forms of support range from direct financial contributions to logistical or material assistance, as well as the provision of training.The Pulwama attack in 2019, planned and carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed, saw transfer of large quantities of explosives in the country. A massive amount of the components used in the explosive devices used in the attack was acquired via electronic commerce platforms.The agency also said that the Pahalgam terror attack also could not have taken place without financial backing and without any route to transfer funds between terrorists and supporters.The FATF wrapped up its fourth plenary session in Paris under Madrazo’s presidency, attended by delegates from over 200 jurisdictions. The session approved the first mutual assessments under FATF’s new risk-based framework and removed Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa from the greylist after completion of their action plans.Reaffirming FATF’s global mission, Madrazo said, “FATF remains committed to strengthening standards and ensuring implementation so we can protect people by reducing terrorist financing worldwide.”","FATF warns Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.
