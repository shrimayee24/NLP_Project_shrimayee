Why India’s betting on new tactic against digital arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-indias-betting-on-new-tactic-against-digital-arrest/articleshow/126211416.cms,"AI image

Central teeth for national problem

Banking, telecom breaches

What’s the counterpunch?

Over to CBI

As another year winds down, a cybercrime epidemic of mindboggling proportions continues unabated in India. Striking with impunity and alarming frequency, there is seemingly no tactic that’s too bizarre and no target that’s out of reach for cyber fraudsters. Earlier this year, a doctor in Gujarat was kept under video surveillance for three months, reportedly losing Rs 19 crore during her digital-arrest ordeal. More recently, a former Punjab Police IG was defrauded of more than Rs 8 crore in an investment scam. The shock led him to shoot himself in the chest.While the law of the land does not specifically recognise the concept of “digital arrest”, cases are reported every day from across India — mostly, instances of cybercriminals impersonating police and central security officials and using panic and manipulation to wipe people’s bank accounts clean.But there are many more ways in which they come for your money (see box), like infecting your phone with forwards that transfer control, catching you by surprise with a video call and morphing the footage for blackmail, or ‘pig butchering’ you with texts about lucrative investment returns.The number of cases, and the swindled cash involved in those, has seen an exponential rise: 23 lakh cybercrime complaints were registered on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (NCRP) in 2024, a 42% jump over 2023.And the money lost to such frauds in 2024 was estimated to be Rs 23,000 crore, a 200% jump from Rs 7,500 crore in 2023. As a hydra-headed monster that takes new forms virtually every month, cybercrime is no longer a battle that state police can fight within their own limited jurisdictions and win. Which would explain why Supreme Court this month ordered CBI to launch a sweeping probe into all digital arrest scams.Bringing in the might of a central agency was an overdue move. As a senior cyber cell officer in Delhi pointed out, “the core challenge lies in the complex inter-state and geographical nexus of these operations, where the victim and the perpetrator are separated not just by distance but also by an intricate web of digital and financial layering.”Cybercrime presents a challenge entirely different from that posed by conventional crime. In a ‘digital arrest’ scam, which is perpetrated over a video call that can last hours, weeks, days, or even months, the money moves quickly through a series of what are known as ‘mule accounts’.These are usually located in places far apart and opened using forged documents or with the connivance of bankers. For example, money from a ‘digital arrest’ in Delhi, Gurgaon, Bengaluru or Hyderabad could be routed to mule accounts in West Bengal, Uttarakhand and Gujarat. That is why recoveries are only a fraction of the defrauded cash because, by the time the labyrinth of transactions has been decoded, the money has vanished.In India, two key hubs of cybercrime have been identified in Jharkhand’s Jamtara and the triangle of Bharatpur (Rajasthan), Mathura ( Uttar Pradesh ), and Nuh (Haryana). But an even more concerning dimension is the rise of large organised overseas operations in countries like Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and, of late, Myanmar.These are operations that run call-centre-style scam compounds, drawing their manpower from human trafficking victims, including Indians who are snared by local placement agents with the lure of foreign jobs in data entry, IT and management. “Once trapped, these recruits are held in prisonlike conditions and coerced into undertaking cybercrimes targeting their own countrymen,” said a Delhi Police officer.Several of these international operations have been traced to Chinese criminal syndicates that provide technical infrastructure like apps and VoIP. “CBI is uniquely positioned to connect these disparate dots: like a SIM card issued in one state, a bank account opened in another, and an IP address originating at a third location,” said a government official.The digital epidemic has fed on an explosive growth of the internet user base. While India has become an increasingly digital society, large sections of people remain digitally naïve because initiation to new technology and devices happened at a later stage in life. But cybercrime’s uncontrolled spiral has also exposed major vulnerabilities in two critical pillars — the telecom sector and the banking system. Both have failed to build adequate safeguards.“Fraudsters routinely exploit lax Know Your Customer (KYC) norms to illegally procure huge numbers of SIM cards. They are similarly also able to open mule bank accounts, the lifeblood of their operations,” said a Delhi cyber cell investigator. Systematic targeting of senior citizens with pension funds in their accounts and women makes it clear that scammers have access to banks’ customer data, investigators said.Recently, CBI arrested the manager of a prominent bank in Mumbai for allegedly accepting illegal gratification to process account-opening forms, creating channels for rapid layering of cybercrime proceeds. The accused is said to have facilitated the use of accounts that are linked to multiple cybercrime cases.Similar crackdowns across states, like ‘Operation Insider’ by Telangana Police, have led to the arrest of many bank officials for opening current accounts without due diligence in exchange for commissions from fraudsters.It’s the transnational cybercrime syndicates in Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam that execute the most complex frauds, increasingly deploying AI and deepfakes. These are the crimes that have so far proved the hardest to crack for police across Indian states. “Funds siphoned from Indian victims are quickly laundered, often converted into cryptocurrency and then moved internationally to accounts in countries like China, Singapore and Vietnam to evade detection,” explained a senior police officer.Sleuths may still have to play catch-up with new tactics, but the fight against cybercrime is much more organised now than it was two years back, which will help CBI.The Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C), through its Citizen Financial Cyber Fraud Reporting and Management System, has helped save around Rs 7,130 crore by facilitating rapid freezing of funds. NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India), too, has helped freeze scam proceeds in real time. A centralised toll-free helpline number, 1930, has been operationalised for quick assistance in lodging cybercrime complaints.Govt has blocked over 11 lakh SIMs and around 3 lakh IMEI numbers linked to frauds, underscoring the necessity of a coordinated, technological counteroffensive. Creation of a ‘Suspect Registry’ by I4C to flag suspect bank accounts and use of the ‘Pratibimb’ module to map criminal locations based on telecom and crime data are among other tech responses that have taken shape.“A state-of-the-art Cyber Fraud Mitigation Centre has been set up at I4C. It has brought together representatives of major banks, financial intermediaries, payment aggregators, telecom service providers, IT intermediaries and representatives of states/UTs and police to tackle cybercrime,” a government official said.By combining domestic reach and collaborations with security agencies globally, CBI can serve as the lead enforcer and nodal point for busting complex, transnational cybercrime networks. Through specialised initiatives like Operation Chakra, CBI has been coordinating simultaneous raids on financial nerve centres of cybercrime with organisations like FBI and Europol. This is something that no state police force can do.CBI can ensure that the digital trail of a crime — which might involve a victim in Delhi, a server in Europe, and a perpetrator in Southeast Asia — is traced and documented for prosecution. By utilising the Bharatpol portal and its Global Operations Centre, CBI can also create a bridge between state police forces and international intelligence, allowing real-time sharing of data. CBI’s strength also lies in its role as National Central Bureau for Interpol in India, which gives it a direct line to law enforcement in over 190 countries.The agency is also equipped to lead large-scale crackdowns on illegal call centres that have been operating as hubs for international extortion. Besides, it has extraterritorial mandate under Section 75 of the IT Act, which gives it legal authority to investigate any individual, regardless of nationality, whose digital actions impact systems within India.","The number of cases, and the swindled cash involved in those, has seen an exponential rise. 23 lakh cybercrime complaints were registered on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (NCRP) in 2024. The money lost to such frauds in 2024 was estimated to be Rs 23,000 crore, a 200% jump from Rs 7,500 crore in 2023.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126211438,imgsize-98250,width-400,resizemode-4/cybercrime39s-grip-on-india.jpg"

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: Delhi continued to struggle with toxic air on Sunday, with several areas recording ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ air quality levels, as a dense layer of smog blanketed the city.The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi on Sunday reached 391, entering the 'severe' category, with some regions exceeding 400, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Morning visuals from Akshardham Temple showed the iconic structure fading into a thick, dense layer of smog that drastically reduced visibility.The AQI (Air Quality Index) in the area stood at 445, placing it in the ‘severe’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Around AIIMS, the AQI was measured at 340, categorised as ‘very poor’. Meanwhile, visuals from the ITO area showed the city shrouded in a thick blanket of smog, with hazy conditions reducing visibility.The AQI there had crossed 400, also falling under the ‘severe’ category.Meanwhile, in Mumbai, a light layer of fog enveloped the Bandra Kurla Complex, where the AQI was measured at 123, classified as ‘moderate’.Authorities have invoked Stage III measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which include restrictions on construction and industrial activities.The ‘No PUC, No Fuel’ rule is being enforced to curb emissions.Officials attributed the worsening conditions to a combination of cold weather, calm winds, and dense fog that trap pollutants close to the ground. Experts warn that the cycle of poor air quality is expected to continue under current weather patterns.The Commission for Air Quality Management has advised vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, and people with respiratory issues, to limit prolonged outdoor exposure and wear masks.","The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi on Sunday reached 391, entering the'severe' category, with some regions exceeding 400.

Aravali mining row: Supreme Court takes suo motu cognisance; hearing set for Monday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aravali-mining-row-supreme-court-takes-suo-motu-cognisance-hearing-set-for-monday/articleshow/126208577.cms,"Supreme Court (Picture credit: ANI)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of concerns linked to the definition of the Aravali Range, signalling fresh judicial scrutiny of an issue that has sparked protests and debate over mining and environmental protection.According to news agency ANI, a three-judge vacation bench headed by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant will hear the matter on Monday.The court’s decision comes amid widespread concern over how the Aravali hills are being defined for regulatory purposes, particularly in relation to mining activities.The definition accepted earlier by the apex court has triggered objections from environmentalists and civil society groups, who fear it could weaken conservation safeguards for one of India’s oldest mountain systems.The Union environment ministry has moved to address some of these concerns by deciding to further expand areas where mining will be prohibited across the Aravali range.The ministry has directed the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) to identify additional landforms and zones where mining should be banned, beyond areas already under restriction.Currently, only about 0.2 per cent of the Aravali’s total area of around 1.4 lakh sq km is eligible for mining, and the new exercise could reduce this further.The ministry has said this step would “further enlarge the coverage of areas protected and prohibited from mining in the entire Aravalis, keeping in mind the local topography, ecology and biodiversity”.States spanning the Aravali range, including Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat, have also been told not to grant any new mining leases until a comprehensive Management Plan for Sustainable Mining (MPSM) is finalised.The controversy centres on a 100-metre height-based definition of Aravali hills adopted by the Supreme Court on November 20 for mining-related decisions.Under this definition, a hill is identified as a landform rising 100 metres or more from the lowest enclosing contour, with nearby hills within 500 metres grouped as a range.Environmentalists argue this approach could significantly shrink the area officially recognised as Aravali hills, as much of the range is low-lying.Despite the criticism, the environment ministry has maintained that the new definition does not dilute mining controls and that existing safeguards remain in place. It has also clarified that for mines already in operation, state governments must ensure strict compliance with environmental norms and Supreme Court directions.",The Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of concerns linked to the definition of the Aravali Range.

Unnao Rape Convict Kuldeep Sengar's Bail Triggers Protests In Delhi, Victim’s Mother Demands Hanging

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court is set to hear the Central Bureau of Investigation ’s (CBI) appeal on Monday (December 29) challenging the Delhi high court 's decision to suspend the life sentence of expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar in the Unnao rape case.A three-judge vacation bench led by Chief Justice of India Surya Kant will take up the CBI’s plea.The survivor in the Unnao case has levelled serious allegations against the investigating officer, claiming the IO ""colluded with the judge"" to ensure that ""the other party won."" Her accusations come days after the Delhi high court granted bail to Sengar and suspended his life term.The survivor and her mother met CBI officials on Saturday to submit a formal complaint on the matter.ANI quoted the survivor as saying, ""The complaint is that the investigating officer has wronged me. He colluded with the judge to ensure that the other party won, so that the rape victim would lose, her courage would be broken, and she would not be able to pursue the case further."" She added, ""Had the CBI stood with my lawyer, we wouldn't have had to see this day. We would have won, and they would have lost.""Sengar was convicted by a trial court in December 2019 for raping a minor in Unnao in 2017, and was sentenced to life imprisonment along with a Rs 25 lakh fine. He moved the Delhi high court in January 2020 challenging the conviction, and in March 2022 sought a suspension of his sentence. Throughout the legal proceedings, the CBI and the survivor strongly opposed any relief, citing the seriousness of the offence and potential risks to the complainant and witnesses.

"Salt Lines: A forgotten 4,000-km 'living border' reappears in a Mumbai museum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/salt-lines-a-forgotten-4000-km-living-border-reappears-in-a-mumbai-museum/articleshow/126206594.cms,".

In the open-air plaza of Mumbai's oldest museum, a long, zig-zag wall of cloth ripples in the breeze. At first glance, it looks like a giant curtain. Step closer to squint at the crimson prints on it and the cloth becomes a partition: neat plant patterns on one side and chaotic termite marks on the other.Block-printed deliberately with dyes from homegrown shrubs like babool and karonda, this 20-metre-long cotton wall at the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum quietly leads visitors back to a little-known 4,000-km hedge that once formed a thorny botanical border across India, buzzing with birds and bees.Part hedge, part fence, the Inland Customs Line — a forgotten boundary created by the British in the 19th century to enforce the Empire’s deadly salt tax— is the centrepiece of 'Salt Lines', the first Indian solo exhibition by artist duo Himali Singh Soin and David Soin Tappeser who go by Hylozoic/Desires.Created in collaboration with RMZ Foundation and India Art Fair and supported by Alkazi Foundation, the show revisits the colonial 4,000km long border of which 2,500km constituted a fence of plants also known as ‘The Great Hedge of India’.Stretching from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal and patrolled by thousands of customs staff, the hedge--described as ""utterly impassable to man or beast""--was built by the East India Company and later the British Raj to enforce the salt tax in the mid nineteenth century.“We first stumbled upon the incredible history of the Inland Customs Line when we were doing more general research on… salt,” the artists say. Its scale shocked them: “It seemed improbable to us that such a large botanical infrastructure could have existed for much of the 19th century without everyone knowing about it.”Salt, which had been lightly taxed under earlier Indian rulers and the Mughals, became one of the British Empire’s most lucrative revenue streams after Bengal Presidency governor Robert Clive’s victory at The Battle of Plassey in 1757.Through monopolies and price controls, the East India Company's officials forced peasants and merchants to buy salt from government depots at inflated rates. Even during the catastrophic Bengal famine of 1770, which killed an estimated ten million people, land revenue and salt taxes were collected in full.Originally consisting of thorny branches and deadwood piled into a crude fence, it was designed to stop smugglers from moving coastal salt into British-controlled territories, where it was heavily taxed. From the 1860s, the British began converting it into a living hedge, planting hardy native shrubs, digging trenches, building embankments, and maintaining a patrol road. Under officials such as AO Hume, entire teams tended the hedge, watering, pruning, and replanting it.Between 1867 and 1870, Hume oversaw a dramatic expansion of the hedge. By 1869 it stretched more than 2,300 miles from the Indus to the Mahanadi, patrolled by nearly 12,000 men. The line snaked through what is now Pakistan, skirted Delhi, passed Agra, Jhansi, Hoshangabad, Khandwa, Chandrapur and Raipur, and terminated in present-day Odisha. Where living shrubs failed due to rocky soil or frost, stone walls were erected instead; elsewhere, dry hedges of dwarf Indian plum had to be rebuilt constantly after damage from insects, fire and storms.At its height, the hedge was said to be up to 12 feet high and 14 feet thick, made of tightly trimmed trees and shrubs of babool, Indian plum, carounda, prickly pear, and thuer, depending on the soil and climate, with a thorny creeper woven throughout. By the 1870s, more than 14,000 men were employed to guard and maintain it, making it one of the largest security operations in the subcontinent.“On no branch of their duties have the whole establishment bestowed anything like so much time, labour, care, and thought, as on the rearing of this barrier...after all it must be remembered that our barrier is to the Line what the Great Wall once was to China: alike its greatest work and its chiefest safeguard,"" wrote Hume.The hedge was lost in the archives, say the artists who scoured the National Archives of India, the British Library, the South London Botanical Institute, the Alkazi Collections and more for its history. “We found textual evidence… but no imagery.”To fill the gap, they created speculative visual records such as re-enactments at Sambhar Lake, an important British salt outpost, and AI-generated images, printed using a 19th-century salt process and toned with gold.At the centre of 'Salt Lines' is 'The Hedge of Halomancy' (2025), a 23-minute film. It follows Mayalee, a courtesan known to history for resisting the British. “She refuses the British administrators… when they attempt to replace her traditional salt stipend with cash payments,” the artists explain.Salt, in the film, becomes material and metaphor. A three-dimensional salt crystal acts as “a magical talisman,” linking Mayalee to Hume and, symbolically, to Gandhi’s march to Dandi. In another room called the 'Salt Office', historical salt-tax objects including two photographs of Bombay’s salt satyagraha from the Alkazi Collection sit beside Salt Prints (2024). “Salt is an acid and a base, an amazing symbol of equilibrium,” the artists say.Sound underscores this tension. “The speculative chapters… are underpinned by bansuri and sitar,” says David. The archival sections use “tuba and percussion,” echoing British military bands and their transformation into Indian wedding music.How did the hedge disappear from public imagination? Nature played the first role. “Termites… begin to eat into the hedge,” the artists note. “Winds, rats, tigers stormed through parts of the hedge.” Human anger, it seems, finished the job. “During the 1857 mutiny, people burnt parts of the hedge down in fury.”When the British gained control over salt-producing regions like Sambhar Lake, they found a cheaper way to tax salt at its source. The hedge — expensive and unwieldy — was dismantled on April 1, 1879.Nature reclaimed it. The living shrubs died or were cut; deadwood was carted off by villagers; embankments eroded. Within decades, almost nothing remained. ""The natural world’s resistance not only contributed to the fall of the hedge but also to its utter erasure from history,"" say the artists.Many historians had never heard of it until British writer Roy Moxham rediscovered it in the 1990s, travelling across India to piece together its remnants for his book 'The Great Hedge of India'. “People seldom realise how critical salt is to health,” wrote Moxham. “And yet, it seems inconceivable to me how this incredibly painful part of history, the immense abuse people endured at this time, could be so utterly forgotten. ”When he set out to find the remnants of the Customs Hedge, Moxham had imagined the barrier as a piece of British whimsy constructed to collect a minor tax. Along the way, he realized that the men posted along it, mostly local recruits, worked in isolation for months, patrolling harsh terrain with sticks, whips, and firearms. Those caught bypassing the hedge faced imprisonment. Famine, he discovered, was worsened by the Salt Tax. In 1877–'78, crops failed from poor rains in the North-Western Provinces while grain was exported, causing starvation. Official reports recorded 1.3 million deaths, with most deaths attributed to disease rather than hunger, though salt deficiency increased mortality.""I had assumed it was merely a flamboyant boundary, perhaps fashioned by administrators with fond memories of English hedgerows,"" wrote Moxham. ""It was a terrible discovery to find that it had been constructed, and ruthlessly policed, so as to totally cut off an affordable supply of an absolute necessity of life,"" he concluded.The hedge entered public conversation again in recent years. In 2022, UK-based runner Hannah Cox set out to trace the forgotten border by running 100 marathons in 100 days, following the path of the Great Hedge across the country. Her journey — physically retracing a line most Indians have never seen — sparked renewed interest in how a structure so long, so intrusive, and so central to colonial revenue vanished almost without a trace.It is fitting that the exhibition sits inside the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, Mumbai’s oldest, built by the British in 1857 as the Victoria & Albert Museum, Bombay. For the artists, its vitrines and industrial models echo the themes of extraction in the exhibition while Tasneem Zakaria Mehta, the museum’s managing trustee and director, says 'Salt Lines' allows the institution to “engage with the nature of colonial artistic production… including local people who harvested and consumed salt. ”As visitors leave 'Salt Lines', Hylozoic/Desires offer a last thought — a reminder of what the exhibition ultimately attempts: “All we know is that the artist’s work is to research rigorously, and then… enter into the missing gaps of history and the doubt of the future, and imagine how else we can be.”","'Salt Lines' revisits the colonial 4,000km long border of which 2,500km constituted a fence of plants also known as ‘The Great Hedge of India’ Stretching from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal and patrolled by thousands of customs staff, the hedge was built by the East India Company and later the British Raj to enforce the salt tax in the mid nineteenth century.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126206642,imgsize-269872,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-2025-12-27t221614743.jpg"

NEW DELHI: An NRI’s praise for India after returning home following an eight-year gap has become viral.Investor Alok Jain wrote on X that a friend from New York had recently visited him. According to Jain, the visitor was struck by the energy in the country and how fast India appeared to be growing.“An outsider’s perspective can be so different from our own,” Jain wrote, comparing it to how people living here may see the country.In his post, Jain said his friend was particularly surprised by how affordable many things in India were. He mentioned medical care, transport, internet and mobile services.The visitor compared these with costs in the US. According to Jain, his friend ""pays $600 for mobile and data at his house Pays $30k for health insurance for 4!! Per annum Pays 2 percent as property taxes per year..!!""Jain added that while air quality was better in the US, many good things were happening in India.The post drew a range of responses from social media users. One person wrote that many of their friends living in Bengaluru preferred it to New York City.Another user commented that from an outsider’s point of view, India’s main problems came down to a lack of civic sense. ""I am an outsider and I can say that everything wrong with the country has to do only with lack of civic sense among the people,"" he wrote.Someone who said they had lived in the Bay Area and were currently based in New York, agreed that phone bills and insurance costs in the US was high, but said salaries were also much higher, making direct comparisons difficult.The user added that property taxes varied by state and often fund services like public schools and clean roads. They said India stood out in areas such as access to medical care for those who can afford it, digital public services, and the availability of affordable physical labour.",Investor Alok Jain wrote on X that a friend from New York had recently visited him.

"Government unveils Rs 44,700 cr shipbuilding push to boost domestic capacity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-unveils-rs-44700-cr-shipbuilding-push-to-boost-domestic-capacity/articleshow/126206538.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The shipping ministry has notified the guidelines for two major shipbuilding initiatives with an outlay of Rs 44,700 crore, aimed at boosting India’s shipbuilding capacity.The two schemes include the Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Scheme (SBFAS), with a corpus of Rs 24,736 crore, and Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SbDS), with an allocation of Rs 19,989 crore. These schemes are expected to provide a strong policy push to revive shipbuilding activity, attract investments and strengthen India’s maritime ecosystem.Under SBFAS, the government will provide financial assistance ranging from 15% to 25% per vessel, depending on the category of ships built. The scheme offers graded incentives for small normal, large normal and specialised vessels, with disbursement linked to clearly defined construction milestones and backed by security instruments. Incentives for series orders have also been included to encourage scale and efficiency.Under Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SbDS), greenfield shipbuilding clusters will receive 100% capital support for common maritime and internal infrastructure through a 50:50 Centre–state special purpose vehicle, while existing shipyards will be eligible for 25% capital assistance for brownfield expansion of critical infrastructure such as dry docks, shiplifts, fabrication facilities and automation systems.“These guidelines create a stable and transparent framework that will revive domestic shipbuilding, boosting forward and backward linkage amping ‘Make in India’ initiative, enable large-scale investment and build world-class capacity, positioning India as a major maritime nation on the path to Viksit Bharat and Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” port and shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal said on Saturday.A key feature of SBFAS is the proposed National Shipbuilding Mission, which will ensure coordinated planning and execution of shipbuilding initiatives. The scheme also introduces a Shipbreaking Credit Note, under which ship owners scrapping vessels at Indian yards will receive a credit equivalent to 40% of the scrap value, linking ship recycling with new ship construction and promoting a circular economy. Over the next decade, SBFAS is expected to support shipbuilding projects worth about Rs 96,000 crore and generate employment.The SbDS focuses on long-term capacity and capability creation, including establishment of an India Ship Technology Centre to support research, design, innovation and skills development. The scheme also includes a Credit Risk Coverage Framework, offering govt-backed insurance for pre-shipment, post-shipment and vendor-default risks to improve project bankability and financial resilience.","The shipping ministry has notified the guidelines for two major shipbuilding initiatives with an outlay of Rs 44,700 crore.

And I'm confident that the entire opposition is going to be aligned against this action.""The Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill that replaced the UPA-era MGNREGA was passed during the recently concluded winter session of Parliament. President Droupadi Murmu has already given her assent to it.The Congress and other opposition parties have taken strong exception to the new law replacing MGNREGA, stating that it is an insult to Mahatma Gandhi as his name has been removed from its title.The new law makes a statutory guarantee of 125 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to undertake unskilled manual work.However, instead of being a Central scheme, the new law provides that the Centre and the states will have to share a 60:40 per cent ratio funding for the scheme",Congress will launch a nation-wide protest against the Centre for replacing rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with VB G-RAM-G law. Party chief Mallikarjun Kharge said that replacing the scheme named after Mahatama Gandhi is insult to the father of the nation.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126202937,imgsize-608970,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Pakistan Embarrassed Globally As Saudi Deports 56000 Beggars Despite No Fly Lists And Warnings

Most Indians deported for staying beyond visa validity

HYDERABAD: Over 24,600 Indians were deported from 81 countries in 2025, as per the latest ministry of external affairs data tabled in Rajya Sabha. It wasn't the US but Saudi Arabia that recorded the highest deportations - over 11,000 in 12 months.While in comparison, only 3,800 Indians - mostly private employees - were deported from the US in 2025, these numbers are the highest recorded from the country in the last five years, the report says. Experts attribute it to the recent crackdown and increased scrutiny of documents, visa status, work authorisation, overstays, etc, by the Trump administration.Most deportations from the US were carried out from Washington DC (3,414) and Houston (234).Countries that saw a significant number of deportations of Indians include Myanmar (1,591), UAE (1,469), Bahrain (764), Malaysia (1,485), Thailand (481), and Cambodia (305). According to latest MEA data, common grounds for deportations, especially from Gulf countries, include overstaying visa or residency, working without a valid work permit, violation of labour regulations, absconding from employers, and involvement in civil or criminal cases.""This is a pattern with Gulf countries, which see a large migration of workers from India who either take up jobs as labourers in the construction sector, become caregivers, or work as househelp. Most of them are low-skilled workers who migrate through agents and, in many cases, in an attempt to earn extra money, end up involved in minor offences,"" said Bheema Reddy, vice-chairman of Telangana govt's NRI advisory committee. ""In other instances, lack of awareness about local laws and regulations proves costly,"" he added.In many cases, these migrant workers fall prey to fraud perpetrated by agents back home and are deported once caught by police abroad.Deportations from countries like Myanmar and Cambodia, however, follow a different pattern. ""Most of these are linked to cyber slavery. These countries have emerged as major hubs of a multi-billion dollar cybercrime industry where Indians are lured with promises of high-paying jobs but are later trapped, forced to work in illegal operations, and eventually detained and deported,"" Reddy explained.It is, therefore, important that workers are made aware of rules before they land on foreign shores, said Naga Bharani of Telangana Overseas Manpower Company. ""People should be told to closely track their visa timelines, and comply with local rules. There is always an option to apply for a visa extension,"" she said. Deportation of Indian students was the highest from UK, with 170 sent home in 2025. This was followed by Australia (114), Russia (82) and US (45).","Most deportations from the US were carried out from Washington DC (3,414) and Houston (234) Common grounds for deportations, especially from Gulf countries, include overstaying visa or residency, working without a valid work permit, violation of labour regulations, absconding from employers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126196015,imgsize-86626,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-image.jpg"

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

JAIPUR: Over 1,230 mining leases, most of them disputed, continue to exist across Rajasthan's Aravali region. Together, these leases cover 17,393 hectares within the Aravali system.""At present, most leases in the Aravalis are under dispute and pending before courts. Some mines are closed, while others continue to operate,"" a senior mining official said.Incidentally, Rajasthan mining department was considering a proposal to lease out additional pits for excavation in the Aravalis but the Centre invoked a blanket ban on the grant of new mining leases in the mountain range following public outcry over a proposed ""new definition"" of one of the world's oldest mountain ranges.An official source said, ""The mining department issued notifications for 126 new leases in Nov 2025. Of these, 50 are located within Aravali districts, while 76 fall outside the Aravali region.""District-wise data highlights the scale of concentration, with Rajsamand district alone accounting for over 540 leases. Udaipur follows with 162 leases and Jaipur has 139. Alwar, Sirohi, and Bhilwara together account for over 250 leases, reflecting how deeply mining has penetrated the Aravali belt.Mining expert Pradeep Singh said the new ban does not cancel existing permissions retrospectively, allowing hundreds of leases to continue, particularly in Rajasthan. ""In many areas where leases are operational, environmental degradation is visible and, in several places, irreversible. Hills have been hollowed out, forest cover has thinned, and natural drainage systems have been disrupted,"" he said.Across Rajasthan, the mining footprint extends far beyond the Aravalis. The state has 16,116 mining leases, of which around 10,060 are operational, along with nearly 18,000 quarry licences.Mining expert Kishore Kumawat said area-wise data within the Aravali region shows Udaipur accounting for 6,084 hectares under mining, followed by Sojat with 2,575.4 hectares, Bhilwara with 1,229 hectares, and Rajsamand with nearly 800 hectares.","Over 1,230 mining leases, most of them disputed, continue to exist across Rajasthan's Aravali region.

Aravalis would lose continuity and integrity, amicus had argued

NEW DELHI: As the controversy over its November 20 order on the Aravali hills refuses to die down and environmentalists and citizens oppose the verdict, Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of the issue and registered a case which will be taken up on Monday.The cause list put up on the Supreme Court website says suo motu civil case regarding 'Definition of Aravali Hills and Ranges and Ancillary Issue' will be taken up by a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices J K Maheshwari and A G Masih.The apex court, in its Nov ruling, had accepted the expert committee's definition of Aravali Hills and Ranges in the context of mining as any landform located in the Aravali districts having an elevation of 100m or more, measured from the local relief. Aravali Range has been defined as two or more Aravali Hills, located within 500m from each other.The definition of Aravali Hills and Ranges was given by a committee comprising secretary, MoEFCC; secretaries of the department of forests of NCT, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat; a representative from Forest Survey of India, central empowered committee, Geological Survey of India and joint secretary, MoEFCC.Raising questions on SC's ruling, environmentalists alleged that it would lead to massive mining as the activity would be allowed on hills with height less than 100m.During the hearing of the case, senior advocate K Parameshwar, who was assisting the court as amicus, had objected to the definition and contended that all hills below 100m would be opened up for mining and as a result the Aravali Hills and Ranges would lose their continuity and integrity. ""If the definition as suggested by the Committee is accepted, it would totally endanger the environment and ecology of the mountains,"" he had submitted, which was also incorporated in the order.Against his submission, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati had contended that if the definition of Aravali Hills and Ranges as suggested by the FSI (slope of 3 degree or more) is accepted, it would exclude large areas. If the definition suggested by the committee is adopted, she submitted, a larger area would be included as part of Aravali Hills and Ranges.","Aravali Range has been defined as two or more Aravali Hills, located within 500m from each other.

Unnao Rape Convict Kuldeep Sengar's Bail Triggers Protests In Delhi, Victim’s Mother Demands Hanging

CBI: HC ignored MLA vested with public trust, authority

NEW DELHI: Invoking Supreme Court 's verdict in L K Advani case in which it was ruled that anyone who holds public office, like MPs or MLAs, would be deemed a public servant, CBI has told Supreme Court that Delhi high court erred by declaring that Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an MLA when the offence was committed, was not a public servant to be prosecuted under Pocso and granted him bail.A vacation bench will take up CBI's plea Dec 29.Seeking quashing of HC's order, CBI said when lawmakers can be prosecuted under the Prevention of Corruption Act for being a public authority, then they should be deemed public servants to be prosecuted under Pocso.HC had ruled that Sengar's case was not covered under Section 5(c), which talks about aggravated penetrative sexual assault.The provision says the offence becomes severe when penetrative sexual assault is committed by specific individuals like police officers, armed forces, public servants, or staff of educational institutions/hospitals, leading to stricter penaltiesCBI said, “The HC failed to consider that a sitting MLA, by virtue of holding a constitutional office, is vested with public trust and authority over the electorate and that such position carries heightened responsibility arising from duties owed to the state and society… It has erred in law by failing to adopt a purposive interpretation that advances the object and intent of the Pocso Act…”It said HC “failed to correctly appreciate the judgment of this Hon’ble Court in the case of L K Advani v CBI wherein the accused MLA was held to be a public servant within the meaning of Section 2 (c) (viii) of Prevention of Corruption Act…”“It is submitted that the offences under Section 5(c) of the Pocso Act are of greater gravity than corruption offences by MP’s/MLA’s… The legislature has therefore provided for stringent mandatory penalties, protective procedural safeguards, and enhanced liability for persons in positions of trust or authority, reflecting the higher societal interest in protecting the vulnerable over abstract institutional harm,” the appeal said.“A comprehensive and meaningful reading of section 5(c) the Pocso Act leads to an irrefutable conclusion that it seeks to punish exploitation and sexual abuse of children from public servants, owing to use of their power, position or status be it political or otherwise,” it said.CBI said a life convict can be given the benefit of suspension of sentence only if, prima facie, the conviction appears unsustainable and there is a high chance of success in appeal. “Mere long incarceration or delay in hearing the appeal, by itself, does not automatically justify suspension in heinous offences; courts must balance individual liberty with societal interest and the gravity of the crime,” it said.","CBI: Delhi high court erred by declaring that Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an MLA when the offence was committed, was not a public servant to be prosecuted under Pocso.

'MGNREGA Bachao Abhiyan': Congress Announces Nationwide Protest Against VB-G RAM G Act

NEW DELHI: Calling ""decimation of MGNREGA "" a one-man decision of PM Modi like demonetisation, Congress brass of Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi announced a nationwide campaign from January 5 to force the government to restore the job guarantee scheme.They argued the disbanding of the job scheme will devastate the rural economy, seriously hurt the SC/ST/OBC/women/minorities/poor, burden the states, and divert the money to billionaires like Adani.The announcement came after a marathon meeting of Congress Working Committee that discussed the Modi government's contentious replacement of MGNREGA with VB-GRAMG.After discussing the issue over three hours, the CWC members read out a five-point pledge that Congress ""vows to lead a MGNREGA Bachao Abhiyan from January 5, 2026... to oppose by all democratic means possible the attempt to convert the rights of the workers to a government dole"".Following up on the elaborate brainstorming, Congress fielded its top duo of Kharge and Rahul to brief the press in a bid to send out a message of intent that would resonate beyond the party circles. Rahul expressed confidence that entire opposition will be united in the future course of action to seek restoration of MGNREGA.""Those dependent on MGNREGA are angry. That anger will cost this govt heavily. Remember, the government had to take back the three farm laws after the way the farmers and the opposition fought against them,"" Kharge warned.Rahul said MGNREGA was ""destroyed singlehandedly by the PM"" without studying the matter. ""I am told the PMO took this decision, even the minister and the Cabinet were not asked,"" he alleged, calling the move as reflective of ""one man show"" of present times in which ""Modi does whatever he wants to do"".""It will benefit Adani in full measure. That is the purpose of this - to take money from the poor and hand it to people like Adani,"" he said.CWC also discussed SIR, and Kharge spoke about the nexus between the BJP and the EC. It was said that party units and BLAs should take care that the votes of marginalised communities are not deleted.Kharge mocked the Modi government's claims to have made India the fourth largest economy, in which Adani, Ambani can take unlimited money as bank loans, but govt could not bear 30% of the MGNREGA budget that has now been shifted to the states under the new law. He said the extra financial burden will stall development work in states.","Congress brass of Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi announced a nationwide campaign from January 5 to force the government to restore the job guarantee scheme.

Prayers And Peace: PM Modi Joins Christmas Service, Shares Message Of Harmony And Unity

PM’s outreach part of continuous efforts to engage with minorities

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday joined a large congregation of Christians at a Christmas service at the Cathedral Church of the Redemption here, as he continued with his outreach to the minority community. ""The service reflected the timeless message of love, peace and compassion. May the spirit of Christmas inspire harmony and goodwill in our society,"" he said.As part of the governing BJP's concerted efforts to strengthen its connect with Christians, party president JP Nadda participated in celebrations at the Christian Higher Secondary School, organised by the Mao Naga Christian Fellowship Delhi (MNCFD), and dwelt at the govt's focus on development in the northeast, a region with significant population of the community.As part of his engagement with Christians, Modi had addressed a Christmas celebration organised by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India in 2024, attended an Easter event at the Sacred Heart Cathedral in 2023, and hosted a programme at his residence to mark Christmas the same year.Opposition was, however, quick to target him for incidents of vandalism and harassment aimed at Christians in some parts of the country.Congress posted on X a video purportedly showing members of right-wing outfits vandalising Christmas decorations in Raipur in BJP-governed Chhattisgarh, alleging it exposed the true face of BJP.BJP’s efforts to reach out to Christians over the last few years have met with limited success as a section of the community continues to harbour distrust due to the Sangh Parivar’s antipathy to conversion, which has led to the enactment of stringent laws in several states as the party’s influence surged since 2014.In terms of absolute numbers, Kerala has the highest Christian population in the country, and the state will be heading to assembly polls in a few months along with Tamil Nadu, which has the second highest population of the community.Their numbers in Kerala and Tamil Nadu are over 18% and 6% respectively, according to the 2011 census.With over 25%, Christians are a significant presence in Goa, but they wield maximum political influence in the northeast due to their dominant majority status in Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya.","PM Narendra Modi attends Christmas morning service at the Cathedral Church of the Redemption in Delhi.

The foundation's initiatives, like Read for 15 and Volunteer for 15, foster positive development in young people.

How Patrick Mahomes’ foundation became a source of pride beyond football

As the Kansas City Chiefs grind through a demanding NFL season, Brittany Mahomes has increasingly drawn attention for something far removed from wins, losses, or playoff math. While criticism and pressure often follow Patrick Mahomes on the field, his work away from football has continued to grow quietly and steadily.Recent recognition tied to his charitable efforts highlighted a side of the Chiefs quarterback that doesn’t show up on stat sheets. For Brittany, that impact appears to matter just as much, if not more, than the weekly noise surrounding the team.Patrick Mahomes’ 15 and the Mahomies Foundation has reached a stage where its influence is measurable, visible, and increasingly community-driven. Its partner organization, Youth Volunteer Corps has recently published annual estimates of 92, 714 hours of volunteer work done by young people equating to the community value of an estimated 3.2 million dollars. Brittany Mahomes made the most of such an achievement with a very modest yet informative gesture, as she interacted with the post, expanding its popularity.The numbers only tell part of the story. For many volunteers, Patrick Mahomes’ example has become personal motivation. Luke from Hampton explained why the quarterback’s leadership resonates with him.“Patrick Mahomes has inspired me to volunteer because of the way he uses his platform to give back to the community (being a core sponsor of Youth Volunteer Corps).“Beyond his talent on the field, he demonstrates leadership, generosity, and a commitment to helping others, showing success comes with the responsibility to make a positive impact,” Luke said.The philosophy has formed the growing programs of the foundation. Programs such as Read for 15 will help young children develop the reading habit on a daily basis, and Volunteer for 15 will expose older students to organized community service. Another branch, 15 for 15, provides funding across academics, science, athletics, and the arts.Earlier this fall, Patrick and Brittany Mahomes hosted the sixth annual 15 and the Mahomies Foundation Gala, drawing more than 900 supporters and raising $1.5 million for 27 local charities. As football narratives fluctuate, the foundation’s steady growth offers a reminder that Mahomes’ influence and Brittany’s pride in it extends well beyond Arrowhead Stadium.Also Read: Randi Mahomes’ powerful reaction to Brittany’s holiday surprise quickly caught fans’ attention","Patrick Mahomes' 15 and the Mahomies Foundation is making a significant community impact.

Sami Zayn’s wife on the most important match of his life: Elimination Chamber 2023 Diary

Originally named Rami Sebei, Sami Zayn has made a name for himself as one of the most respected and consistently pushed stars in the WWE Universe. Zayn has been a model of longevity, character work, and stable placement on premium live events, and his stability in that regard has equated to financial security. Industry-wide estimates have his individual net worth in the low millions as of the year 2025, primarily from his WWE contract and associated revenue streams like brand endorsements and deals.Khadija Sebei, wife of Zayn, lives under a very low profile, not being in any public business or entertainment business. It means any public appraisal of the couple's fortunes turns primarily on Zayn's professional earnings (no apparent records of independent commercial income linked to her name per se). Thus, their joint fortune is a poor reflection of the value the wrestler makes over a career, not of two parallel portfolios of income.Sami Zayn likely earned a WWE contract commensurate with his status as an invaluable veteran today who is not necessarily a marquee star. His annual WWE salary is estimated by various industry trackers in the range of $350,000 to $500,000. This number generally consists of a base salary that is guaranteed, bonuses that are based on performance, and pay that is based on premium live events and overseas tours.While it is rumored that emerging talent is on developmental deals, Zayn would be able to negotiate contracts that he has been earning with a consistent presence on television for years. When he is utilized in the many squad storylines and championship programs in a given year, or at the main event level for Pay-Per-Views, his earnings go up. Another benefit is that Zayn has built long-term sustainability as opposed to short-term surges.Sami Zayn also makes money off of merchandise royalties, which still plays an important role for veteran talent, on top of his WWE contract. Recurring revenue all year long comes from T-shirts, collectibles, and special event merchandise associated with major storylines. He has also ventured into limited media and entertainment work, including TV and streaming appearances, as additional sources of income.When all of the combined sources and standout earnings room are combined, responsible estimates place Sami Zayn's net worth at roughly $2 million in 2025. Aside from reportedly landing a three-year modelling contract with the major American brand this year, all fatigue to Khadija Sebei has proven to be a speculative wage, so combined, they can both expect a net worth in the ballpark of $2 million to $2.5 million at the most, to allow space for private investments and debts of others.Also Read: IShowSpeed’s latest YouTube drop features WWE legend Randy Orton","Sami Zayn has been a model of longevity, character work, and stable placement on premium live events.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

From December 26, mandatory biometric checking of all non-US citizens, including Green Card holders, at border points comes into effect. This means their photographs would be taken by US Customs and Border Protection officials at every entry and exit point across airports, land crossings and seaports. This new rule is applicable to all non-US citizens entering or exiting the country.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems.

Meet Google executive 'responsible' for Sam Altman sending 'Code Red' to OpenAI employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meet-google-executive-responsible-for-sam-altman-sending-code-red-to-openai-employees/articleshow/126187250.cms,"Google's Josh Woodward has jolted OpenAI, forcing a 'code red' with his Gemini app's rapid success. Gemini's user growth and image generation capabilities have challenged ChatGPT's dominance, leading to a significant shift in the AI landscape. Woodward's ability to cut through bureaucracy and his team's innovative approach are credited for Google's AI resurgence, impacting Alphabet's stock and OpenAI's strategic plans.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The numbers tell a brutal story for ChatGPT

The secret weapon: Breaking Google's legendary bureaucracy





Josh Woodward isn't a household name in Silicon Valley, but the 42-year-old Google veteran has accomplished what seemed impossible just months ago—he's made the world's most powerful AI company sweat. The executive leading Google's Gemini app triggered such alarm at OpenAI that CEO Sam Altman declared an internal ""code red"" in early December, forcing the startup to abandon lucrative projects and scramble to defend its eroding market position.Woodward's impact has been devastating for OpenAI. Since taking charge of the Gemini app in April while simultaneously running Google Labs, he's orchestrated a comeback that's transformed Google from AI afterthought to existential threat. His team's viral Nano Banana image generator crashed Google's own infrastructure in August, generating so much traffic that the company's custom AI chips nearly ""melted,"" according to CNBC reports from a November all-hands meeting.Google's resurgence under Woodward's leadership has fundamentally rewritten the competitive landscape. Gemini's monthly active users grew from 350 million in March to 650 million by October, coming close to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly users. By September, Gemini had dethroned ChatGPT atop Apple's App Store after generating 5 billion images.The impact runs deeper than raw user counts. Data from Similarweb reveals that Gemini has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months, surging from 5.4% to 18.2%.This gain came directly at ChatGPT's expense—OpenAI's flagship product plummeted from commanding 87.2% market share to just 68%, a staggering 19-point drop.The blow came in late November when Google announced Gemini 3, a LLM model that outperformed OpenAI's flagship products on industry benchmarks and sent Alphabet's stock soaring. Within days, Altman issued his ""code red"" memo, delaying OpenAI's planned advertising business, e-commerce expansion, and AI agent development to pour resources into improving ChatGPT's core experience. The desperation was palpable—this was OpenAI's most decisive admission yet of the competitive pressure threatening its $500 billion valuation.Woodward's success stems from an unusual talent in Google's notoriously slow-moving culture. Colleagues told CNBC he's mastered the art of demolishing bureaucratic barriers through systems like ""block,"" where employees flag roadblocks for his team to immediately resolve. Former Google Labs co-lead Clay Bavor says Woodward's ability to ""move fast, break down barriers and execute"" has landed him ""right at the center of the most important work at Google. ""His track record speaks volumes. NotebookLM became an instant hit after its July 2023 launch. His quarterly newsletter grew so influential that Google executives routinely seek his reading recommendations. He responds directly to user complaints on X and Reddit, bringing feedback to engineers for rapid fixes—a level of user engagement that's helped Gemini gain trust and momentum.OpenAI fired back earlier this month with GPT-5.2, claiming benchmark superiority once again. But Woodward holds structural advantages that terrify OpenAI: Google's massive cash reserves, custom AI chips, and nine products with over 1 billion users each. While OpenAI burns through funding rounds to survive, Woodward's operation runs on profits from YouTube and search. Alphabet's 62% stock surge in 2025 outpaced all megacap peers—a dramatic reversal from its brutal first quarter that vindicated Woodward's strategy.","Google's Gemini app has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months.

Mumbai's high rises springing up with no correlation to precincts or infra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbais-high-rises-springing-up-with-no-correlation-to-precincts-or-infra/articleshow/126212176.cms,"MUMBAI: Most global cities have regulations to control micro-skylines within precincts. These are conscious decisions taken to ensure that the ‘look’ of the city is managed in a controlled and planned manner, while simultaneously permitting development to take care of people’s needs. But unlike many global cities, Mumbai is perhaps the only one where the entire city (except areas governed by aviation rules) can go vertical without considering basic factors like infrastructure, design or density. So, a squat bungalow could sit next to a highrise, like two freaks in a circus, with little thought to aesthetic consistency within a neighbourhood.“Today, planning has been reduced to an arbitrary and ad hoc level with no correlation to infrastructure,’’ says Atul Kumar, founder trustee, Art Deco Mumbai Trust. “And there is no attempt to make it aesthetically viable.” Urban planners suggest that behind the emerging Dubai-like bling lies a vision that allows profit to override planning. A real estate-obsessed wave fuelled by what architect and urban planner Rahul Mehrotra calls “impatient capital”.There are many who caution against this approach that allows floor space index (FSI) to jump up “in leaps and bounds without any logical justification that takes into account the bigger plan”.Architect and urban planner Chandrashekhar Prabhu says, “There is no control on the height or shape of buildings coming up on threshold spaces like waterfronts, open spaces, prominent vistas etc. Ad hoc decisions are taken mostly to benefit builders. ” No thought is given to ensuring proportionate public open spaces or adequate roads, leading to traffic snarls across the city. And this despite sufficient precedents within the city itself that placed a premium on organic town planning.In 1912, the Bombay City Improvement Trust formulated stringent norms that mandated adequate widths between so that they are spaced out equally. The rule which was finally implemented in 1919 was based on the concept that the right to light and air must be equal to the resident on the ground floor and those living on the top floor.“This was determined by the 63.5-degree rule; the minimum open space between two buildings and the maximum height,” says Kumar. The city’s first development plan in 1967 introduced the concept of FSI, unlike previous by-laws that regulated built development by the number of floors and footprint limits.Urban designer and architect Harshad Mehta points to areas like Cumballa Hill and Malabar Hill, where the skylines were once marked by crowns of treetops. “Buildings like Usha Kiran, Woodlands and Kanchanjunga rose higher than the treetops and were called ‘skyscrapers’ then. Nonetheless, they were also spaced apart by a prescribed distance from their immediate neighbours. Today, it can be said that building development in Mumbai is rising up, both literally and liberally. What were once considered iconic skyscrapers, seem lost amid newer taller neighbours,’’ said Bhatia.According to him, the current rising twinkling skyline appears attractive from afar, even portraying a mirage of growing prosperity —say when seen from the new coastal road. “But come up close and what you saw is not what you get. “Therefore, this present trend of indiscriminate high-rise development, though policy-driven, is foolhardy. Continuing this mindless building spree will be a self-induced disaster in the years ahead,” he warns.New York-based architect Arzan Sam Wadia points out that the Manhattan skyline is shaped by strategic zoning laws.“For instance, when it comes to very tall towers going up next to low-rise buildings or neighborhoods, the city relies on ‘contextual zoning’. “This helps manage height and bulk to make sure new developments fit in better with their surroundings,” he explains.In New York, there are special rules in place, like “tower setbacks,” which require taller buildings to be set back from the street. This keeps them from overwhelming the lower buildings nearby and helps maintain light access. As Wadia says, “It’s all about balance”. Currently, Mumbai appears to be challenging the idea of balance, in more ways than one.","Most global cities have regulations to control micro-skylines within precincts.

Thailand–Cambodia clashes: Indian tourists scout safer New Year destinations; top picks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-year-vacations-to-thailand-cambodia-in-jeopardy-vietnam-sri-lanka-emerge-options-for-indian-tourists-check-list/articleshow/126211840.cms,"Indians are making changes to their travel patterns for the New Year, travelling to destinations beyond Thailand and Cambodia to regions like Vietnam, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Japan and parts of West Asia, travel industry executives said. The transition comes after the two south Asian nations have been at continued border violence.The clashes, which continued for nearly three weeks before a ceasefire came into effect from Saturday, reportedly left more than 100 people dead. The developments have dented demand for Thailand, a long-standing favourite for Indian festive travel, and Cambodia, which has increasingly featured as a cultural extension to Southeast Asian itineraries.According to Ravi Gosain, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators, the impact on Thailand has been visible but contained. “For Thailand, enquiries have softened by around 10-20%, with fresh bookings down in the range of 8–15%,” he told ET. While some travellers have postponed or altered plans, outright cancellations have remained limited at 3–8%, as many opted to reroute trips within the country.Cambodia has faced a stronger reaction. Gosain said enquiries are down 20–35% year-on-year, with cancellations in the range of 8–18%.He added that Indian travellers began revisiting their travel plans within 48–72 hours of the clashes breaking out, followed by another round of adjustments closer to departure dates.Different traveller segments have responded differently to the situation. Families, first-time international travellers and high-spending leisure customers have been more cautious, Gosain said, while younger group travellers and honeymooners have shown greater flexibility. “Safety perception, visa ease, flight availability and overall value are the key decision drivers,” he said.Despite the softer demand, spending levels for Thailand during the year-end period remain unchanged, with mid-market travellers typically spending Rs 1.1–1.8 lakh per person and premium travellers spending between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 4 lakh, ET reported.Rajiv Mehra, general secretary of the Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism and Hospitality, said Thailand has lost some momentum. “The aggressive demand witnessed earlier is missing now—about 5-10% lower demand,” he said. Cambodia, too, has seen reduced traction, though Mehra described it as more of a spiritual destination than a leisure-oriented one. At the same time, he noted that Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Malaysia are attracting interest with competitive pricing.Travel companies say the situation has led more to recalibration than disruption. Jatinder Paul Singh, chief executive and co-founder of Viacation, said booking behaviour reflects caution rather than withdrawal. “Enquiries have remained largely steady, with some travellers taking extra time to decide,” he said, adding that cancellations have been limited, with most customers preferring date changes or alternate destinations.Rising airfares are also shaping travel choices. Hari Ganapathy, co-founder of Pickyourtrail, said airline capacity constraints have pushed flight costs higher, leading travellers to focus more on affordability. “Flights remain the most variable cost, while on-ground pricing has moved only 5–7%,” he said. This has resulted in higher demand for short-haul destinations offering visa-on-arrival and shorter travel times, such as Malaysia, Singapore and Sri Lanka.Ganapathy also pointed to longer-term changes in travel behaviour. Paid activities per itinerary have increased by nearly 30% over the past two years, with a further 13% rise this year. He said around 65–70% of itineraries now include at least one customised experience, indicating a shift away from nightlife-centric holidays towards more personalised travel.Booking data from EaseMyTrip highlights this transition. A company spokesperson told ET that Vietnam has emerged as a major beneficiary, with Indian traveller traffic estimated to rise by about 125% in 2025. Sri Lanka, meanwhile, has seen at least a fivefold increase compared with last winter.“The focus has shifted from promoting large-scale, nightlife-led New Year celebrations to curating experience-driven and restorative travel options that better align with evolving traveller preferences,” the spokesperson said. “To retain interest and drive conversions, travel companies are also curating end-to-end experiences, such as bundling stays with activities like culinary workshops, local village dinners, heritage walks, farm tours, and personalised wellness programmes. ”Within India, destinations such as Goa, Kerala and the Andaman Islands continue to draw festive-season demand, offering alternatives for travellers opting to stay closer to home amid changing overseas plans.","Thailand and Cambodia have been at continued border violence. The developments have dented demand for Thailand, a long-standing favourite for Indian festive travel. Cambodia, too, has seen reduced traction, though it is more of a spiritual destination. Travel companies say the situation has led more to recalibration than disruption.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126211999,imgsize-227226,width-400,resizemode-4/this-is-an-ai-generated-image-used-only-for-representation-purpose.jpg"
"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

New York to require warning labels on TikTok and other social apps over youth mental health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/new-york-to-require-warning-labels-on-tiktok-and-other-social-apps-over-youth-mental-health/articleshow/126209084.cms,"Image Via ""X""

“Keeping New Yorkers safe has been my top priority since taking office, and that includes protecting our kids from the potential harms of social media features that encourage excessive use,”

New York law targets TikTok and similar apps over youth mental health concerns

“addictive”

“creating pathways comparable to those of an individual experiencing substance use or gambling addictions.”





New York is moving to tighten rules around social media use by young people, with a new state law requiring warning labels on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and others. Governor Kathy Hochul announced that the law targets features such as infinite scrolling, autoplay, and algorithm-driven feeds, which officials say can encourage excessive use. The labels will warn users about potential mental health risks, especially for children and teenagers. State leaders say the goal is to give families clearer information about how these platforms work and how they may affect young users’ well-being.Governor Hochul compared the new labels to long-standing warnings used on other consumer products.she said in a statement. The governor also said these warnings are similar to labels on tobacco products or plastic packaging, which clearly explain health or safety risks. The law is based on research that compares the stimulation caused by social media to the effects seen in substance use and gambling addiction.The new law requires social media platforms with features consideredto display clear warnings about possible mental health harm. According to the text of the law, research shows that social media exposure can overstimulate reward centers in the brain,The rule applies to platforms operating partly or fully in New York, but not when users are physically outside the state.If companies fail to follow the law once it takes effect, the New York state attorney general will have the power to take legal action. Platforms could face civil penalties of up to $5,000 for each violation. At the time of writing, companies including TikTok, Meta, Snap, and Alphabet have not publicly responded to the new requirement.Other states, like California and Minnesota, are already enforcing similar legislation to protect young people on social media. At a global level, worries about the effects that social networks could have on young people’s mental well-being are increasing steadily. Certain educational departments in the United States have sued social network providers. Other countries, such as Australia, have even banned anyone under 16 from using popular platforms. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Malaysia, and Denmark, are considering similar legislation.As the law is implemented, the emphasis is clearly on awareness and protection, explains a New York government representative about the new regulation that requires warning labels to be placed on social media websites, hoping that this effort will help young users exercise better judgment when using social media websites.Also Read: FaZe Clan situation explained: Creator exits, financial disputes, and new group rumors","New York is moving to tighten rules around social media use by young people.

Saudi Arabia is taking a firmer stance against banned and counterfeit pesticides, with a draft regulation proposing jail terms, hefty fines, and strict enforcement measures. The new rules aim to protect public health, the environment, and agriculture, while giving authorities clear powers to penalize repeat offenders.The proposed regulation introduces strict consequences for anyone involved in manufacturing or importing banned or counterfeit pesticides. Under the draft, violators may face up to five years in prison, fines reaching SR10 million, or one of these two penalties. The Public Prosecution will investigate all violations and bring the cases before the competent court to enforce the penalties outlined in the regulation. In situations where the offender repeats the violation, the prosecution is authorized to double the penalties to ensure stronger compliance and deterrence.Not all violations will lead to immediate jail time or fines. The draft clarifies that if a violation is minor and does not cause significant harm to humans, animals, plants, the environment, or public health, the violator will first receive a warning. Authorities may then provide a grace period for the issue to be corrected before applying penalties.The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) will play a central role in reviewing violations related to public health pesticides. Responsibilities of the SFDA under the draft include:Additionally, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture can require violators to remove the cause of the violation. Repeating the offense within three years of a previous violation is considered a repeat offense, which can lead to doubling of fines.The draft also outlines strict measures for dealing with the materials involved in violations. These include:Beyond fines, the draft also allows authorities to temporarily close the facility for up to six months or even permanently shut it down in severe cases. Those penalized have the right to appeal the decision in the Administrative Court in accordance with its regulations.","Saudi Arabia proposes up to five years jail and SR10 million fine for banned pesticides.

Why was the licence revoked?

What does this mean for you?

Knowing that the CBUAE is actively monitoring and ""pruning"" the market of non-compliant players means you can have higher confidence in the remaining licensed exchange houses.

These regulations are designed to prevent scams, fraud, and the misuse of financial platforms. A cleaner system means fewer risks for your personal hard-earned money.

By enforcing these rules, the UAE remains a globally respected financial hub. This keeps exchange rates competitive and ensures that international banks continue to work smoothly with UAE-based institutions.





The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has taken decisive action against Omda Exchange, revoking its licence and striking the company’s name off the official register of licensed entities. The regulator also imposed a financial penalty of Dh10 million on the foreign exchange firm. This enforcement follows supervisory examinations that uncovered multiple breaches of UAE banking laws and regulations.The move was carried out under the Decretal Federal Law on the Central Bank and the Organisation of Financial Institutions and Activities, which gives the CBUAE the authority to regulate, supervise, and enforce compliance across financial institutions operating in the country.According to official statements and regulatory findings, the CBUAE’s examinations revealed that Omda Exchange failed to comply with core legal and regulatory requirements. While specific details of each breach have not been fully disclosed publicly, the Central Bank’s action fits a broader pattern of strict enforcement against exchange houses that fall short of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and other compliance standards.The move underscores the bank’s mandate to ensure that financial service providers adhere to legal obligations and internal controls that safeguard the integrity of financial transactions in the UAE.You might wonder how a corporate fine affects the average resident sending money home. The impact is actually very positive for the ""common man."" When the Central Bank takes such strict action, it is working to ensure that every dirham you hand over at a counter is safe.This latest enforcement is part of a broader, ongoing trend. In recent months, we have seen the CBUAE impose various fines—ranging from Dh2 million to over Dh100 million, on different financial entities. This consistent ""watchful eye"" is part of the UAE's commitment to aligning with international standards set by global bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).The Central Bank has stated that it will continue to ensure that all exchange houses, their owners, and their staff strictly abide by UAE laws.This isn't just about punishment; it’s about prevention. By maintaining a transparent and high-standard environment, the UAE ensures that its financial system remains one of the most stable and secure in the world for residents and investors alike","The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has taken decisive action against Omda Exchange, revoking its licence and striking the company’s name off the official register of licensed entities.

They have been told that they won't be able to enter the US without a new stamp. Given the present situation, it may take at least six months in India. From December 15, H-1B and H-4 (H-1B dependent) applicants have been subject to social media vetting.Despite many MAGA activists calling for H-1B ban, the administration is overhauling the system and proposed a wage-based selection instead of random H-1B lottery. In the proposed wage-based selection, higher wage will get higher priorities.","Hundreds of H-1B visa holders flew to India to get their visa stamping done as the administration made it mandatory to get the stamping now in the country of origin.

"32,000 jobs offshored: Influencers claim H-1B visa crackdown backfired; jobs went to India owing to $100,000 fee",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/32000-jobs-offshored-influencers-claim-h-1b-visa-crackdown-backfired-jobs-went-to-india-owing-to-100000-fee/articleshow/126205982.cms,"H-1B Visa Delays: MEA Says India Has Flagged Issue With US

3 big H-1B changes introduced by Trump administration in 2025

$100,000 fee for companies to submit a new petition for hiring an H-1B. This fee will be applicable if the prospective employee is not inside the US.

Social media vetting for H-1B visa applications.

No random lottery for H-1B. Wage-based selection would give higher priority to higher wages. This is a proposal and may run into legal troubles.





Based on reports that US tech majors, including Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Google, added 32,000 employees in India, social media influencers concluded that the H-1B crackdown has actually backfired and instead of creating more jobs for Americans, these jobs actually exited America as big companies offshored these jobs to India. The figure has been reached according to data from Xpheno, a specialist staffing firm.The link between the visa fee and the offshoring of the jobs can be a little stretched as all these big tech majors can easily pay the $100,000 H-1B fee.""As US H-1B visa rules tightened this year with higher fees and wage requirements, Big Tech responded predictably: they hired offshore instead. Meta, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, and Google pushed their combined India workforce to 214,000, the fastest growth in three years. That's 32,000+ new hires that could have gone to Americans. These aren't call center jobs. They're AI, machine learning, cloud engineering, data science, and cybersecurity roles,"" entrepreneur and podcast host Mario Nawfal posted.""The irony is brutal: visa curbs designed to prioritize American workers just made it cheaper and easier for corporations to offshore the same jobs remotely. No visa required. No wage floor.No American hired. This is the loophole nobody closed. You can restrict who comes here to work. You can't restrict who works from there. Until policy addresses corporate offshoring directly, companies will keep doing the math and choosing the cheaper option overseas. American workers keep losing,"" Nawfal wrote.Another influencer James Blunt commented that he got to know about this offshoring directly from the executives who confirmed that they moved towards offshoring because of the uncertainty in the administration's visa rules.""I’m hearing this directly from executives, the uncertainty was the final shove. Offshoring offers certainty + scalability and zero U.S. regulatory risk. If the goal was to keep jobs in America, this did the opposite,"" James Blunt wrote.","US tech majors, including Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Google, added 32,000 employees in India.

Survival without transformation





How is Pakistan’s economy still surviving? The question continues to arise as the country grapples with prolonged economic stress despite years of weak growth and low human development indicators.In recent years, Pakistan has dealt with sharp currency swings, runaways inflation between 2022 and 2024, persistent balance-of-payments pressures and mounting external debt burden. Yet the economy has managed to dodge a complete collapse, largely due to repeated bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and emergency financing from external partners.China has been key to this survival. Chinese loans and infrastructure investments have provided short-term relief but have also deepened Islamabad's financial dependence on Beijing. At the same time, Pakistan has sought to rebuild ties with the United States, long regarded as a key economic and diplomatic backstop.In this outreach, both army chief Asim Munir, now seen as the Pakistan's de facto power centre, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have taken apparent steps to engage Washington. The two leaders went ahead to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in easing military tensions with India.However, New Delhi had turned down the claims of any foreign influence in peaceful agreement with Islamabad in May this year.And Uncle Sam responded with goodwill. Compared to several other countries, it was exempted from steep trade tariffs, with Washington announcing a lower levy of 19%. Trump has also spoken of possible cooperation in developing what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan.The power structure in Pakistan has also been a point of concern in its economic turmoil. The military's expanding role in governance has often overshadowed the civilian leadership, while former prime minister and a popular leader Imran Khan remains in prison, keeping political tensions high and weighing on investor confidence.Neighbouring countries have also added to Pakistan’s economic strain. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty has emerged as a major setback, while Afghanistan’s Taliban government has announced plans to build dams upstream, moves that could further affect water availability and pose another risk to Pakistan’s economy and GDP growth.For now, Pakistan’s economy continues to function through foreign assistance, administrative controls and short-term stabilisation measures. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, its economic survival remains fragile.One of the most important stabilisers of Pakistan's economy has been the continued support from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders.The Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) finalised in November 2025, was released ahead of the Fund's executive board's expected approval of a $1.2 billion disbursement, part of the ongoing 37-month, $7 billion programme started under the prime ministership of Shehbaz Sharif.With the latest approval, Pakistan has received around $3.3 billion from the IMF since last year. Under the bailout programme, Islamabad will continue to receive loan instalments over a 37-month period, contingent on meeting the agreed reform conditions.Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal, which was followed by the current longer programme. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most frequent borrowers.In 2025, IMF disbursements helped rebuild foreign exchange buffers, reassure markets and finance imports and debt servicing, according to Reuters.Pakistan's central bank has used monetary policy as a tactical tool to stabilise inflation while cautiously supporting growth.On December 15, the State Bank of Pakistan cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, breaking a four-meeting hold. The SBP said the move was aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth while keeping inflation within target.According to Reuters, all 12 analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the central bank to hold the policy rate at 11%, particularly after the IMF warned against premature easing under Pakistan's $7 billion loan programme.The rate cut highlighted Pakistan's effort to revive domestic economic activity without destabilising the IMF-backed stabilisation framework.Despite underlying weaknesses, Pakistan has seen improving sentiment in financial markets.Credit ratings agencies S&P Global, Fitch and Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s credit ratings in 2025, citing stronger finances and revenue gains. Investor appetite for Pakistan’s dollar bonds and equities has strengthened, with bonds delivering nearly 22% returns this year and the benchmark stock index gaining 44%, among the best performers in Asia.Bloomberg Economics estimates growth quickened to 3.4% year-on-year in the second quarter, with official data expected shortly.However, with the backdrop of political chaos, most notably the continued imprisonment of the country's most popular political figure, Imran Khan, investors have little confidence to make long-term plans in Pakistan.Pakistan has also moved to rebuild economic ties with the United States.According to Bloomberg, Islamabad is planning an investor conference in Washington to draw American investment in energy, mining and technology. Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the sectors where Pakistan seeks US investment are clearly identified.Economic links have improved following a new US-Pakistan trade deal setting a 19% tariff, lower than regional peers and well below the 50% tariff imposed on India.Meanwhile, Trump also promised to help Pakistan develop what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" on Pakistani soil. The remarks followed sustained praise and outreach from Pakistan’s de facto power centre, army chief Asim Munir, and were later echoed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who went on to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize on several occasions.“The first thing was to get the trade equation out of the way, which it is now,” Aurangzeb told Bloomberg.""Every single industry in Pakistan has to have an export component, because it’s the only way we're going to get out of this boom-and-bust cycle,"" Aurangzeb added.Beyond Western partners, Pakistan continues to rely heavily on China.According to the Middle East Institute, Pakistan’s strategic reliance on Beijing has deepened, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In January, Dawn reported that Pakistan and China reaffirmed their commitment to high-quality development of CPEC 2.0, focusing on industrialisation, special economic zones, clean energy, agriculture and livelihood projects.Chinese support has provided Pakistan with infrastructure investment, energy projects and diplomatic backing at moments of economic stress.While IMF financing has stabilised Pakistan, the IMF's own assessment paints a deeply troubling picture of governance in the Islamic Republic.The IMF's Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment concluded that corruption in Pakistan is driven by ""state capture"", where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The 186-page report described dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or protect public resources. Corruption, the IMF said, is persistent and corrosive, distorting markets, eroding public trust and undermining fiscal stability.The report warns that without dismantling entrenched structures of elite privilege, Pakistan’s economic stagnation will persist.According to the IMF, the most economically damaging corruption involves privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised Pakistan on reforms, told Al Jazeera that lack of accountability continues to erode economic potential.""Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,"" Dercon said.Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s findings mirror long-standing domestic research.""The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,"" Hasanain told Al Jazeera.A 2021 UNDP report found that economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of GDP.The IMF report also flags governance risks linked to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), created in June 2023 to promote investment and comprising both civilian and military leaders.The GCDA raises concerns over broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials and the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements.“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the IMF report said.The Fund urged greater transparency, including annual public reporting on investments facilitated and concessions granted.The World Bank has warned that macroeconomic stabilisation has not translated into meaningful improvements in living standards.""Business as usual is not good for the economy,"" said Mukhtar Ul Hasan, World Bank economist and lead author of a report on Pakistan.""Pakistan's growth potential has been declining for decades"" due to weak competitiveness, limited reforms and recurring crises, he added.The World Bank projects growth of 3% this year and 3.4% next year, far below what is needed to absorb 1.6 million new labour market entrants annually.The Bank’s poverty and resilience report shows poverty rising again to over 27% by 2023–24, with nearly half the population living below the lower-middle-income poverty line. Rural areas, especially Balochistan and interior Sindh, face far greater deprivation.Geopolitics has added new economic risks.After a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians, India answered strongly to its misadventure by putting the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. Islamabad responded by warning that any attempt to stop or divert water flows would be treated as an ""act of war.""Around 80% of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects. India had also identified hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir that could expand capacity to 12,000 MW from the current 3,360 MW, according to Reuters.In May 2025 India’s crossborder counterterror action under Operation Sindoor, marked a sharp escalation in India-Pakistan security dynamics. Military operations and reciprocal measures elevate defence spending, crowd out development spending, spook investors, and raise insurance and logistics costs for trade.Pakistan suffered a major setback after Indian strikes severely damaged nine of its key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan, dealing a significant blow to its military infrastructure.Pakistan’s economic capacity has been heavily drained by sustained military expenditure driven by its adversarial policies toward India, a burden that has come at the cost of investment in social sectors and has pushed the country down across multiple human development indicators.Reports indicate Afghanistan's new dam projects on rivers that feed Pakistan (Kunar/Kabul tributaries) will further diminish cross-border flows into Pakistan’s north-west. Combined with India’s measures, this convergence would be a ""double blast"" to Pakistani water security — concentrated in already drought-prone provinces that supply major agricultural output.Reduced river flows affect irrigation, livelihoods and hydroelectricity; they also fuel internal migration pressures and raise the social cost of adjustment. Regional cooperation mechanisms for water management have weakened, making unilateral upstream development a direct economic shock for downstream Pakistan.Pakistan’s economy is surviving due to IMF support, tactical policy moves, selective foreign investment and geopolitical manoeuvring, including heavy dependence on China and US.But without deep structural reform, dismantling elite privilege and restoring institutional accountability, survival may continue without delivering broad-based prosperity, leaving the country trapped in the same cycle of crisis and rescue that has defined its economic history.","Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal.
