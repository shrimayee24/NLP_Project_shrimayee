PNB loan fraud case: Belgium court rejects Mehul Choksi's bail plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pnb-loan-fraud-case-belgium-court-rejects-mehul-choksis-bail-plea/articleshow/120525920.cms,"Mehul Choksi (Photo credit - ANI)

A court in Belgium has rejected the bail plea of Mehul Choksi --a key accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case. A three-judge bench heard the arguments before ruling against granting bail.Choksi was arrested in Belgium last week following an official request from Indian authorities.Meanwhile, ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal had said during the weekly media briefing that India was working with the Belgian side for Choksi's extradition.""As you are aware, based on our extradition request, he was arrested in Belgium. We are closely working with the Belgian side for his extradition to India so that he can face trial in the country,"" Jaiswal had said answering a query.Earlier, Choksi's Indian lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, was seen in Antwerp ahead of the bail hearing and had also visited Choksi in jail.After his arrest, Aggarwal had stated that the legal team planned to appeal the decision, emphasizing ""Choksi's ill health and ongoing cancer treatment"" as the primary grounds for seeking his release. ""My client, Mehul Choksi, is currently in custody. We will initiate the process of filing an appeal and request his release from prison, citing his medical condition and the fact that he is not a flight risk,"" Aggarwal told ANI.During a press conference held in Delhi, Aggarwal had outlined the defence strategy to contest Choksi's extradition on two key grounds: the political nature of the case and concerns over the treatment of Choksi's health condition in India. He had argued that extradition could severely impact Choksi's human rights, ""particularly due to the lack of adequate medical care and the risk of harassment by political entities.""Aggarwal had claimed that Choksi had been cooperative with Indian investigative agencies and had expressed willingness to participate in investigations via video conferencing due to his health issues.The legal team had also pointed out procedural prerequisites for extradition, including the issuance of non-bailable warrants since 2018. Aggarwal had noted that previous attempts to extradite Choksi from Dominica had failed, and that Choksi had been receiving medical treatment in Antigua before traveling to Belgium for cancer care.","Mehul Choksi is a key accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case.

At the same time, the teams on door knocks will seek households' support through symbolic pledges to ""protect the Constitution"".The micro-level engagement is reminiscent of the ""ghar ghar guarantee"" campaign by state Congress units to take the party manifesto to voters in every household during the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, while also pushing the opposition INDIA bloc's charge of "" Constitution in danger "" against BJP.Before the door-to-door campaign in May, Congress has planned a 30-day three-stage protest rallies - ""Samvidhan Bachao Abhiyan"" - over national issues, including the ""witch hunt against Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and family of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra"". As per the communication sent out to states by Congress general secretary KC Venugopal, Congress units will hold state-level rallies from April 25-30 and district level rallies form May 3-10 and assembly level rallies from May 11-17.The elaborate exercise from state to assembly level will target the Modi govt and BJP but the conversation will shift with every rung. While the state level rallies will focus on national issues like ""subversion of Constitutional institutions, freedom of expression, attacks on federalism"", with eminent citizens to be invited to lend credence to the charges, the district protest agenda includes ""failures"" of the Modi govt - rising unemployment, inflation, collapse of MSMEs, rural distress and weakening of welfare policies - which would be buttressed by local narratives and testimonials of citizens.In contrast, the assembly protest rallies will talk about the ""collapse of local governance"" and ""targeting"" of opposition members through agencies and ""marginalisation"" of SC/ST/OBC/minorities, with focus on ""ideological betrayal"" of the constitutional promise of social justice.While the protests are devised to highlight the ""harassment"" of the Gandhi family by BJP, Congress strategists see it as an opportune vehicle to mobilise people, which fits well with the party's new-found interest in empowering the district units to rejuvenate the cadres and increase the voter outreach.","The party has planned a household-level political outreach between May 20 and May 30.

Urging India to consider acquiring F-35 fighter jets , the vice-president hardsold the fifth-generation American jets and said the aircraft would significantly enhance the Indian Air Force's ability to secure the country's airspace.Referring to India as the US's only ""major defence partner"" with whom the country shares defence infrastructure, technology, and planning on par with America's other allies, Vance pointed to ""dire"" consequences for the world if India and the US ""fail to keep pace"" with the need to scale up across sectors, including manufacturing, energy, cutting-edge technologies, and defence.Addressing a gathering of business leaders, diplomats, academicians, bureaucrats, state ministers, and students at the Rajasthan International Centre in Jaipur, his only public engagement during his maiden four-day visit to India since assuming office as vice-president, Vance set the tone for a future-ready US-India partnership rooted in mutual respect and shared strategic interests.He also contrasted Modi's assertiveness with the previous US leadership. ""President Trump and I know that PM Modi is a tough negotiator. He drives a hard bargain - it's one of the reasons why we respect him,"" he said. ""We don't blame Modi for fighting for Indian industry but we do hold previous American leaders accountable for failing to do the same for our workers.

""From Javelins to Stryker combat vehicles, our nations will co-produce critical equipment - not to provoke war but to secure peace through mutual strength,"" he said.Vance added, ""This designation means that India now shares with the UAE a defence in technology, infrastructure, and partnership with the US, on par with America's closest allies and friends."" ""It's fitting that India this year is hosting the Quad Leaders Summit this fall. Our interests in a free, open, peaceful, and prosperous Indo-Pacific are in full alignment.

""This is a vital step toward realising President Trump's and PM Modi's vision,"" he said, highlighting shared priorities of job creation, resilient supply chains, and prosperity for workers. Vance also urged India to ease non-tariff barriers that currently limit American market access and pitched increased US ethanol exports as a cleaner, cost-effective energy solution.Welcoming Modi govt's budget decision to amend India's civil nuclear liability laws, which currently inhibit US firms from exporting small modular reactors or constructing larger US-designed nuclear plants in India, he said, ""These reforms are vital for India's energy goals and AI ambitions. There is no AI future without energy security and dominance.""Vance, who is scheduled to fly back to Washington on Thursday, also stressed the importance of deepening energy ties.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi cut short his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia and returned to India late in the night after finishing his official engagements with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), following the Pahalgam terror attack. PM Modi was originally scheduled to return on Wednesday night but was back in India early morning. He also skipped the official dinner hosted by the de facto ruler of the country.PM Modi’s meet with MbS began with a mention of the Pahalgam attack . Both of them strongly condemned the attack and expressed solidarity with victims. The Jeddah meet also saw them discussing ways to enhance energy, trade, investment and defence cooperation. India has been looking to strengthen cooperation with Riyadh in combating terrorism and terror-financing. tnnBoth Saudi and the UAE are influential members of the OIC and have been supportive of India’s efforts to blunt Pakistan’s Kashmir agenda in the organisation. The Pahalgam attack seemed designed to attract international attention as terrorists targeted tourists while PM Modi was in Saudi Arabia and US vice-president J D Vance in India. It brought alive the memories of the 2020 Chittisinghpura massacre in which 35 Sikhs were killed by terrorists on the eve of then US President Bill Clinton’s visit to India.In their last meeting, PM Modi and MbS had emphasised that terrorism, in all its forms, remains one of the gravest threats to humanity and agreed that there cannot be any justification for any act of terror for any reason whatsoever. India has so far not officially blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack.Ahead of the meeting, PM Modi described Saudi Arabia as one of India’s most valued partners, a trusted friend and a strategic ally. “Our partnership has limitless potential. In a world full of uncertainties, our bond stands strong, as a pillar of stability,’’ PM Modi said in an interview to Arab News, describing MbS as “a strong advocate of our bilateral ties” and a visionary who has inspired global admiration through the reforms under Vision 2030.“Every time I have met him, His Royal Highness has left a deep impression on me. His insights, his forward-thinking vision, and his passion for fulfilling the aspirations of his people are truly remarkable,” he said.In his departure statement, PM Modi said India deeply valued its long and historic ties with Saudi Arabia that have acquired strategic depth and momentum in recent years. “Together, we have developed a mutually beneficial and substantive partnership, including in the domains of defence, trade, investment, energy and people-to-people ties. We have shared interest and commitment to promote regional peace, prosperity, security and stability,’’ he said.",PM Narendra Modi cut short his two-day visit to Saudi Arabia and returned to India late in the night after finishing his official engagements. PM Modi was originally scheduled to return on Wednesday night but was back in India early morning. He also skipped the official dinner hosted by the de facto ruler of the country.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120533198,imgsize-1554743,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

We will not leave our Kashmiri brothers in their struggle,” he said.

Ten infiltration bids were foiled along LoC last year, in which 25 terrorists were killed,” a senior officer told TOI.Though there is no major Army deployment in Pahalgam area, a unit of its specialised counter-insurgency force Rashtriya Rifles in the region dispatched a few columns as soon as news of the massacre came in the afternoon.Officers said the “low-cost, high-impact” strike was probably carried out to coincide with US Veep J D Vance’s trip in India as well as PM Modi’s visit to Saudi Arabia, the most prominent Islamic country around the globe, to garner global attention.With 144 terrorists being killed in J&K in last two years, terror outfits were looking for a big strike to mark their presence. “The terror infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK, with the so-called strategic assets like LeT, JeM, UJC and Al Badr, jihadi seminaries and madrassa networks, remains fully in place,” he added.“As was evident from Gen Munir’s recent rant against India, Pakistan was not happy with improving situation in J&K, with 2.9 million tourists visiting it last year surpassing previous records,” he said.","The massacre comes soon after Pak Army chief General Asim Munir last week claimed Kashmir was Islamabad’s “jugular vein” India had, of course, rubbished the comments. “Pak-trained terrorists are using other routes to sneak into J&K,” an officer said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120532086,imgsize-1141678,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Kash Patel NHL Games: From FBI sessions to NHL games: Director Kash Patel's frequent use of government jets has tongues wagging about personal travel decisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/from-fbi-sessions-to-nhl-games-director-kash-patels-frequent-use-of-government-jets-has-tongues-wagging-about-personal-travel-decisions/articleshow/120520778.cms,"<p><em>FBI Director Kash Patel (via Getty Images)</em></p><p><em><br></em></p>

Kash Patel under scrutiny for taking FBI jets to NHL games



Is the FBI's air travel policy overdue for an update?



Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel has come under scrutiny for his frequent use of government planes for travel that seems to mix official business with personal interests—such as high-profile sporting events and excursions to his girlfriend's hometown. Since becoming FBI Director on February 21, Patel, 45, has accumulated a travel schedule that includes Nashville and Long Island, raising questions about the intersection of professional duty and personal convenience.Kash Patel made at least three round-trip flights from Washington to Nashville, Tennessee, on Department of Justice-owned Gulfstream jets, The New York Times reported. Nashville is home to 26-year-old country singer Alexis Wilkins, Kash Patel's reported girlfriend. He also flew to Long Island on a DOJ Boeing 757 on April 6—to watch Washington Capitals forward Alex Ovechkin score NHL history.While it's true that FBI directors must travel on government planes because of secure communication requirements, the timing and nature of several of Kash Patel's trips are raising questions as to whether tax dollars are being spent wisely. While Patel did meet with local FBI personnel, Tennessee legislators, and law enforcement officials during the trip, the reason for the other two trips is unknown.Meanwhile, flight logs show a DOJ-owned 757 flying to New York on the same day that Alex Ovechkin broke Wayne Gretzky’s all-time goal-scoring record on April 6—just two days after tying the record in Washington, D.C., another game Patel reportedly attended. Both events were high-profile NHL matchups, and while there’s no confirmation that Patel’s presence was for official reasons, the correlation has sparked concerns.Government employees who use federal planes are expected to pay the government back at the rate of a commercial ticket, which is much lower than flying in a private plane. Critics say this difference opens up a loophole that enables a level of luxury travel at little personal cost.Kash Patel has stood out from his predecessors at the FBI by being bold and visible as a public figure. He has proactively shared news of FBI operations and victories, breaking from the historically behind-the-scenes tradition of his predecessors. From tactical vest photo opportunities to social media cameos, Patel has gone full-on public.Although Patel is not necessarily in breach of the current travel policy, the perception of his travels and the blurring of personal pleasure and official obligation will lead to additional examination of executive travel procedures. The FBI has just solicited proposals for a second jet to assist ‘required-use executive travel’, indicating present demand outstrips fleet size.Also read: 2025 NHL Playoffs: Winnipeg Jets ticket guide, full schedule, and key matchups for Stanley Cup run With Kash Patel still redefining the FBI Director position with his high-profile style and ambitious foreign travel schedule, there is growing pressure to be more open about how government resources are being expended—particularly in an era of heightened public concern regarding ethical governance.","FBI Director Kash Patel has come under scrutiny for his frequent use of government planes for travel that seems to mix official business with personal interests.

Travis Kelce’s competitive nature may be keeping him out of the spotlight

Taylor Swift’s loyalty might have lead her to skip major events too

In recent weeks, fans of both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have noticed their conspicuous absence from high-profile events like Coachella and various award shows. While the internet buzzed with speculation, a new theory has emerged — could Kelce’s lingering guilt from the Kansas City Chiefs ’ devastating loss in Super Bowl LIX be the real reason behind their low profile?Known for his fierce competitiveness and larger-than-life personality, Travis Kelce is no stranger to pressure. But after a crushing defeat in Super Bowl LIX, where the Chiefs fell short in a heart-wrenching overtime loss, sources close to the NFL star suggest he hasn’t quite shaken off the emotional weight.Despite putting on a brave face during post-game interviews, insiders reveal that Travis Kelce has been especially withdrawn since the loss. This self-imposed hiatus from the public eye could be a result of his personal disappointment and a desire to avoid media scrutiny.As Travis Kelce grapples with the aftermath, Taylor Swift has reportedly chosen to stay by his side rather than attend solo appearances. Her absence from Coachella — a festival she’s often rumored to attend — and notable award ceremonies has only fueled speculation.Swift, currently in the midst of her Eras Tour , is known for fiercely protecting those she loves. By skipping high-profile appearances, she may be signaling solidarity with Kelce during this rough patch.Fans worried about the status of their relationship can breathe a sigh of relief.

Could the Steelers draft a quarterback?



With the 2025 NFL Draft fast approaching, the Pittsburgh Steelers ’ quarterback situation remains one of the most pressing issues heading into the new season. While the team currently has veterans Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson on the roster, there’s still uncertainty surrounding the position. General manager Omar Khan has made it clear that he is exploring all options to strengthen the quarterback room, and the upcoming draft could play a significant role in shaping the team’s future.As the 2025 NFL Draft approaches, the Pittsburgh Steelers are preparing to move forward with the expectation of having Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson as their quarterbacks. Omar Khan said during a pre-draft press conference, “Right now, we have two on the roster” meaning Pittsburgh will need to add at least two more quarterbacks.While the team has met with veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers , no definitive decision has been made about whether or not he’ll be joining the Steelers. Rodgers’ potential impact on Pittsburgh’s quarterback strategy remains unclear. Khan emphasized that no matter the outcome, the team will have the right number of quarterbacks when training camp opens in Latrobe.The question remains that will Pittsburgh look to the draft to address its quarterback needs? Holding the 21st overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft gives the Steelers a solid position to either trade up for a highly regarded rookie or select one later in the first round. Adding a young quarterback could help the team build for the future, but it also means the Steelers may need to shift their focus away from veteran options like Rodgers.However, head coach Mike Tomlin has made it clear that the draft will not be influenced by Rodgers’ situation. ""It does not affect the draft,"" Tomlin remarked when asked about the veteran quarterback’s potential signing.

Justin Blackmon was arrested for public intoxication: A fallen star, another headline, and a fanbase still wishing for redemption

Fans react with shock, disbelief, and sadness as the viral mugshot reignites debate around wasted NFL potential

NFL fans woke up this weekend to a jarring blast from the past, Justin Blackmon , a name that hadn’t crossed most people’s minds in nearly a decade. Once hailed as a can’t-miss prospect out of Oklahoma State and the No. 5 overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, Blackmon's NFL journey was as brief as it was turbulent. But this time, he wasn’t trending for a surprise comeback, an inspirational update, or even a nostalgic college highlight. Instead, he was back in headlines for all the wrong reasons.Early Saturday morning, a new mugshot surfaced online showing Blackmon following his arrest for public intoxication, and it spread like wildfire across social media. The incident was both shocking and somber—especially for longtime fans who once believed Blackmon was destined to be a star. His sudden reappearance reminded the football world of a career derailed far too soon and sparked renewed conversations about what could’ve been.According to reports, Blackmon was arrested early Saturday morning in Payne County, Oklahoma, and charged with public intoxication. However, the publicly available information does not provide specific details about the circumstances leading to his arrest.Blackmon’s football story began with greatness. At Oklahoma State, he was a two-time Biletnikoff Award winner, known for his elite hands and aggressive play style. The Jacksonville Jaguars saw him as a franchise cornerstone and took him 5th overall in 2012.But after a solid rookie season, the problems quickly mounted. Blackmon faced multiple substance abuse suspensions, including a season-long ban in 2014. He never returned to the league.By 2015, he was arrested for DUI, and in 2016, he was sentenced to a year in jail though the sentence was suspended pending probation. Since then, he’s lived largely out of the spotlight… until now.The newly surfaced mugshot which spread rapidly on X (formerly Twitter) led to a wave of stunned reactions. Some fans said they didn’t even recognize him, while others remembered his talent and wondered how things could’ve gone so wrong.To add to the emotional weight of the news, Oklahoma State had reportedly planned to induct Blackmon into its Ring of Honor this year, according to fans and alumni. That moment, once seen as a redemption arc or a celebration of his college brilliance, now feels awkwardly timed amid his latest legal troubles.Also read - Fans go wild over Tom Brady’s throwback roast of Eli Manning only for the edit to roast him right back","Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Justin Blackmon was arrested for public intoxication early Saturday morning.

India's Rs 17,000 crore production-linked incentive programme for IT hardware is beginning to yield results as several brands previously reliant on China establish partnerships with domestic contract manufacturers for laptop production in India.These collaborations come against the backdrop of escalating trade tensions between China and the US. Despite the Donald Trump administration's current exemption on IT hardware imports from China, companies are hastening their discussions for local manufacturing arrangements with Indian firms, driven by concerns over potential sector-specific tariffs anticipated in May.Indian manufacturers are enhancing their production capabilities whilst offering global brands advantages through reduced tariffs and incentive schemes. Additionally, they provide opportunities to participate in government contracts requiring 20-50% local content.Industry sources told ET that present manufacturing capacity in India could replace approximately 10-20% of total laptop imports, which reached $11 billion in FY2024. Current domestic laptop production stands at roughly $1 billion, as per industry statistics.The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) 2.0 for IT Hardware, introduced on May 29, 2023, features a Rs 17,000 crore budget allocation across six years.The programme offers approximately 5% incentive on net incremental sales of locally manufactured products. Manufacturers must increase component localisation annually to secure additional incentives.The government anticipates that PLI 2.0 will attract Rs 3,000 crore in investments, generate Rs 3.5 lakh crore in production value, and create 47,000 jobs nationwide.Asus recently launched an assembly line at VVDN Technologies' Manesar facility after six months of discussions regarding scalability and localisation.

And the more backward integrations we can get, the better"".Gurugram-based Syrma SGS has established an agreement with Taiwan-based MSI for laptop manufacturing in India , responding to stricter import regulations. As a participant in the IT hardware PLI, the contract manufacturer recognises the opportunity for Indian companies to benefit from the shift away from high-tariff nations such as China and Vietnam.""We in the industry should catch the bull by its horns and take this opportunity to develop the ecosystem of components base in India,"" said Jasbir Singh Gujral, managing director, Syrma SGS, noting that the organisation will consider capacity expansion to attract additional laptop brands for exports. Dixon Technologies has allocated over Rs 1,000 crore towards establishing a new manufacturing unit in Tamil Nadu for HP Inc laptop production. The facility, scheduled to commence operations in May, will initially produce two million laptops yearly. Additionally, Dixon has contracted with Lenovo and Asus for laptop production at this location, whilst already producing 25-30% of Acer's domestic requirements at their Noida facility.Government statistics indicate that as of December 2024, PLI has attracted Rs 520 crore in investments, achieved Rs 10,000 crore in production value, and created 3,900 employment opportunities.The programme has experienced limited participation, as international companies continue importing most of their Indian sales volume, benefiting from China's 4-5% manufacturing cost advantage prior to tariff implementation.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Reasons for Trump’s changed stance

Market turmoil: One of the primary catalysts for Trump’s change in stance is the significant turmoil in financial markets. The initial imposition of steep tariffs led to a global market sell-off, causing a major drop in stock market value and surging bond yields. This volatility, described as the most intense since the Covid-19 pandemic, seemed to prompt Trump to reconsider the effectiveness of such an aggressive approach.

Domestic pressure: On the domestic front, US businesses and consumers began to feel the strain of the tariffs. Supply chain disruptions, including canceled freight orders and abandoned shipments, compounded the pressure on the administration. This created a growing sense of urgency to find a resolution before further damage was done to the US economy.

Bipartisan opposition to the tariffs, combined with instances such as public disputes between trade advisor Peter Navarro and Elon Musk, may have contributed to the growing pressure to reconsider the tariff strategy. Warnings from Bessent: Trump's statement came immediately after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly warned that the current trade standoff was untenable. His remarks at a private JP Morgan Chase event, where he described the trade status quo as unsustainable, appeared to be a turning point for Trump in softening his stance.

US president Donald Trump suggested on Wednesday that the 145% tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports will not last.Speaking from the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump told reporters the tariff rate would eventually ""come down substantially."" He acknowledged that the current rate was unsustainable but emphasised that it would not return to the “zero” levels it once was.“145% is very high, and it won't be that high,” Trump remarked. However, he reiterated his position that a trade deal with China was crucial, saying, ""Ultimately, they have to make a deal because otherwise they're not going to be able to deal in the United States.""Chinese imports are currently subject to a 145% tariff by US.

Trump Says He Doesn't Plan to Fire Fed Chair Powell

US president Donald Trump on Tuesday said he does not plan to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, even as he renewed his call for the central bank to lower interest rates. Speaking at a White House event, Trump tried to ease market concerns sparked by speculation about Powell’s future. ""I have no intention of firing him,"" said Trump responding a question by a news reporter.Financial markets had recently seen a sharp sell-off, as investors grew worried that Trump might try to force Powell out. Stocks, bonds, and the dollar all took a hit amid the uncertainty. According to reports, Trump’s advisers have warned him that removing Powell would not only be legally complex but could also worsen market instability.Trump has been unhappy with Powell’s stance on interest rates. The Federal Reserve has so far resisted lowering rates, citing inflation concerns. Last week, Powell said that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration were likely to raise inflation and lower economic growth. He also stressed that the Fed had a duty to keep price pressures in check, suggesting that interest rate cuts were not likely in the short term.Trump reacted strongly to Powell’s comments. On Monday, he accused the Fed chair of being ""too late"" and a ""major loser,"" insisting that the economy faced a slowdown unless rates were cut immediately.""With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a slowing of the economy unless Mr. too late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, now,"" Trump wrote on social media, referring to Powell.Although Trump now says Powell’s job is safe, his repeated public criticism has raised questions about the Fed’s independence. The matter could become even more significant, with the Supreme Court preparing to hear a case about the president’s authority to remove officials from independent federal agencies—potentially affecting the Federal Reserve as well.","US president Donald Trump says he does not plan to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

LONDON: More than 110 wildfires have raged in the UK since the start of the year, according to satellite data released Monday, making it one of the worst years on record.At least 111 fires have torched an area of nearly 24,500 hectares (94 square miles) across the country since January 1, according to data Monday from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).The number of wildfires and area affected by them is higher than average for this time of the year, and higher than the same period in 2024.Only 2019 was worse in terms of the area burned (28,700 hectares) and 2022 for the number of fires (151) for the same period, according to the Press Association news agency.Last week, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said fire and rescue services had already responded to 380 wildfires so far this year in England and Wales -- more than double the same period in 2022.The EFFIS data is based on satellite readings and only maps fires that are 30 hectares or larger -- accounting for the difference with records from the local authority.In comparison, the NFCC measures wildfires with an area of at least one hectare.""A particularly dry March, followed by warmer-than-average temperatures in April, has seen a number of significant wildfires across the UK over the last fortnight,"" the NFCC said in a statement.The UK and Ireland had a ""drier than average"" March, according to Europe's Copernicus climate monitor. Last month was also the hottest March ever recorded in Europe by a significant margin.""With the increase in extreme weather events, we know that fire and rescue services are stretched as they seek to keep their communities safe,"" said NFCC chair Phil Garrigan.The Met Office said the fires are due to dry and breezy conditions in spring which came after a damp winter, meaning there was ""fuel"" for the blazes because of plant growth.Firefighters in Northern Ireland have been battling dozens of blazes in the last week, with many residents having to evacuate homes and a weather warning for wildfires.The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) said it attended 296 wildfires between April 3-10, many of which were thought to be started deliberately.An ""extreme"" wildfire warning was issued for Scotland on Friday and Saturday, after multiple blazes broke out the previous week.According to Michael Humphreys from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS), wetter weather last year meant fewer blazes in 2024.","More than 110 wildfires have raged in the UK since the start of the year.
