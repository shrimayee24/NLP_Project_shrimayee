I must tell you, he is no Pappu.""""He is highly educated, well-read, a strategist with deep thinking on any subject and sometimes it is not very easy to understand him,"" he added.Pitroda further praised Rahul and said that his agenda is to celebrate diversity.""Rahul Gandhi has a different agenda which is more focused on something that we have been trying to address for a long time but have not been able to quite address well and that is inclusion, celebration of diversity..,"" he said.""When Rahul Gandhi was here last time visiting us at a major meeting in New York, there was a demand for him to come to Dallas and he promised them that during my next trip I will come to Dallas and he is keeping his promise. He walks the talk and I am delighted that from his busy schedule he could take three days off to come visit us where he is spending a day here and two days in Washington DC,"" he added.Pitroda's past statements have often provided the BJP with opportunities to criticize the Congress.

"A tiny flower nearly killed a tiger habitat, until a snip in time saved it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/a-tiny-flower-nearly-killed-a-tiger-habitat-until-a-snip-in-time-saved-it/articleshow/113177559.cms,"TN forest department’s Lantana weed eradication drive helped restore the dying Mudumalai reserve and while doing so reduced human-wildlife conflicts

It’s hard to believe that one of the biggest threats to a tiger’s survival could come from a small, beautiful flower. Yet, Lantana camara , a tropical American shrub, has invaded over 40% of India’s tiger range, with the Shivalik hills, Central India, and the Southern Western Ghats being the worst affected.Introduced by the British in the 1800s as an ornamental plant from Latin America, the weed quickly spread across the country.By 2020, it was estimated to occupy more than 40% of India’s tiger habitats.Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in the Nilgiris, home to more than 100 tigers, has also suffered from Lantana invasion, which has led to a decline in vegetation and green patches in its core and buffer zones. That’s when the question arose: Is MTR a dying forest?But then, in the last year, there has been a sudden transformation. Shoots of indigenous species began sprouting across the reserve, and the forest seems to be experiencing a complete regeneration of vegetation. Wildlife officials say the recovery is due to concerted efforts to remove the invasive weeds, which helped restore the ecosystem.The MTR comprises 32,100 hectares of core zone across six ranges, with an additional 36,700 hectares in the buffer zone spread over four ranges. Faced with a threat to the ecosystem, invasive and exotic species such as Lantana camara, Senna spectabilis, Prosopis juliflora and wattle are being removed. While the buffer zone— a shrub forest—is infested with various invasives, the core zone, a dense forest, is overrun by Lantana. The process of removing these invasives began in early 2022.In the buffer zone of MTR, about 20% of the area is en croached by invasive species , while the core zone sees at least 50% occupied mainly by Lantana. “Continuous removal of invasives has led to regeneration of natural grass and other indigenous species,” says D Venkatesh, conservator of forests and field director of MTR. “We maintain the cleared areas, but this process needs to continue for five years for the forest to be free from invasives.” He adds that while the invasives are initially fully uprooted, seeds or small roots left behind pose a threat as their dormancy period can last up to 50 years, potentially allowing them to sprout again even decades later.Lantana camara is a perennial shrub that grows about 2m-5m tall and forms dense thickets in various environments. “Lantana is the primary invasive species in MTR, suppressing the natural regeneration of grasses and indigenous species. Once it’s cleared, removing secondary invasives becomes easier,” says Venkatesh.MTR is home to 25 species of grasses and legumes, including a protein-rich variety of grass. “Wild animals help spread the seeds of these species across the forest, maintaining a natural cycle facilitated by wildlife in any forest land,” says Venkatesh.“Even after uprooting invasives, the forest will witness subsequent resprouting,” says Arun Kumar, deputy director of MTR-buffer zone. “This makes maintenance important. Without it, the initial efforts would be utterly wasted. The health of the habitat is important as regenerated grasslands attract herbivores, both small and large.”The forest department has identified key passages in the reserve for invasive removal. Arun Kumar says in the expansive 50-hectare area of the Singara range, where invasive removal has been done and second-year maintenance is underway, herds of elephants are frequently attracted by the fresh grasses. “The health of a forest triggers a chain reaction in the ecosystem. The natural regeneration of grasses and legumes can help reduce conflicts in fringe areas, as a healthy habitat tends to keep animals within their boundaries.”Tamil Nadu Newsprint & Paper Limited is involved in removing Senna spectabilis species, which is found in the buffer zone of MTR. “The bark of Senna is so resilient that even a small piece left behind can quickly resprout. Therefore, extra care is needed during the removal process,” he adds.C Vidhya, deputy director of the MTR-core zone, says the Senna species has only a scattered presence in MTR’s core area. “The real issue is Lantana. But we can’t say Lantana is all bad. It also provides ambush cover for carnivores and fruits for birds and monkeys. In some ways, it plays an eco-friendly role too. If we focus solely on tigers and herbivores, Lantana appears to be a threat.”Vidhya says 50% of the core area is infested with Lantana. “Our fight against Lantana focuses on crucial animal passages and riverines, ensuring removal does not open up the forest too fully. Riverines and water bodies are lifelines for animals during summer, and must be preserved.”The forest department has conducted individual assessments of every grid-compartment in the core zone. Officials say since herbivores don’t consume much Lantana, they don’t contribute to its propagation. Instead, Lantana fruits are primarily dispersed by birds and monkeys. After passing through their digestive systems, the seeds become even more viable, with a stronger tendency to sprout than through natural spread.Vidhya confirms the flourishing of grass and indigenous species is a direct result of Lantana removal. “When you remove invasive species, the ecosystem undergoes modifications, increasing the carrying capacity and utility index of the grasslands,” says Gajannan D Muratkar, advisor to 39 tiger reserves, including MTR and environmental science professor at Amaravathi University in Maharashtra. “An interconnected ecosystem forms between grasslands, modifying the diversity index of the ground flora. It helps contain small and large herbivores within these pockets.”Uprooting invasive species also corrects soil features such as moisture, colour and texture. The natural regeneration of grasses reflects the improved quality of the soil, he says.For Lantana removal, the forest department relies on local tribal communities, skilled in the techniques needed for this task. However, the department struggles with limited funds for the removal efforts, often using money generated from selling Senna species to support the work.In the core zone, 1,221 hectares have been identified as critical for Lantana removal, with about 355 hectares—29%—cleared. In the buffer zone, 1,615 hectares have been cleared and maintained into the second year. The process progresses stage by stage in other areas as well. “We’re seeing amazing results. Once fully completed, the forest ecosystem will sustain itself and support the wildlife,” says Venkatesh.","Lantana camara, a tropical American shrub, has invaded over 40% of India’s tiger range, with the Shivalik hills, Central India, and the Southern Western Ghats being the worst affected. Lantana is the primary invasive species in MTR, suppressing the natural regeneration of grasses and indigenous species.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113177618,imgsize-1460010,width-400,resizemode-4/113177618.jpg"
"52% of rape, Pocso cases cleared but pendency at FTCs already 2L",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/52-of-rape-pocso-cases-cleared-but-pendency-at-ftcs-already-2l/articleshow/113177486.cms,"NEW DELHI: Even though the fast-track special courts set up by govt on the Supreme Court 's directions for expediting trial have disposed of 52% (2,14,463) out of 4,16,638 rape and Pocso cases since the initiation of the FTSC scheme in Oct 2019 till the end of last year, a backlog of over two lakh cases remains.The existing FTSCs will need to dispose of nearly 554 cases every day - that's one case every three minutes - to clear the backlog as of Dec 2023 within one year.As of Aug 2024, 755 FTSCs including 410 exclusive Pocso courts, are functional out of the 1,023 earmarked courts under the scheme.The findings are part of the ' Fast Tracking Justice ' report that looks at the role of FTSCs in reducing case backlogs.The report states that at the current disposal rate of 76,319 cases in FTSCs per year, India would need approximately three years to clear the existing backlog if no new cases are added. ""These estimated years can go on an infinity if new rape and Pocso cases are added to the existing fast-track courts and no new courts of this category are set up,"" the report brought out by non-profit ' India Child Protection ' says. It calls for making the remaining 268 FTSCs functional under the scheme and setting up at least 1,000 more to deliver within the timelines wherein trial in rape cases need to be completed within two months after filing of chargesheet and within one year in Pocso cases.The report says the number of cases for trial before FTSCs each year has also risen - from 1,95,991 in 2020 to 2,78,494 in 2023 - reflecting both addition of new cases and continuing challenge of managing pending caseloads. ""Correspondingly, the number of cases disposed by FTSCs each year has seen significant improvement, with 37,148 cases disposed in 2020, rising to 76,319 in 2023. Also the percentage of cases disposed during the year out of the total cases for trial (pending and new) has also shown an increase, rising from 19% in 2020 to 27% in 2023,"" the report says.Asserting the need to deal with pending cases, the report also assesses year-wise data of the number of new cases instituted and cases disposed in that year to compare what would be the status of disposal if there were no pending cases and the data represented only disposal for that year itself. For instance in 2023, 81,471 new rape and Pocso cases were instituted, while 76,319 cases were disposed by FTSCs, which comes to a disposal rate of 94%.""While all of the number of disposed cases may not be the same that came to FTSCs that year itself, this data indicates that India is close to reaching the tipping point to justice, a point when the number of cases disposed in a given year is equal to or greater than the number of new cases instituted during the same year. In this backdrop this report calls for expediting disposal of pending cases by creating 1,000 new FTSCs so that India is able to build on the momentum seen in terms of disposal rate,"" said Bhuwan Ribhu, child rights activist and founder of India Child Protection.Stating that there is no real-time data available on acquittal and conviction in rape and Pocso cases, the report calls for provided this data on the FTSC dashboard to enable assessment of the success of the courts.","Fast-track special courts set up by govt on Supreme Court's directions for expediting trial have disposed of 52% (2,14,463) out of 4,16,638 rape and Pocso cases since the initiation of the FTSC scheme in Oct 2019.

I think normalcy may have been restored in this state much earlier if the caucus of the corrupt doctors was smashed & those guilty of taking improper administrative actions punished immediately after the scandalous incident happened,"" he added.Jawhar Sircar, who joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in 2021, expressed his shock at the open evidence of corruption involving former education minister Partha Chatterjee, which was widely reported on television and in print media. Sircar stated that he had made a public statement urging the party and government to address the issue of corruption, but he was met with heckling from senior party leaders.""But, in 2022, a year after I joined, I was quite shocked to see on TV and print the open evidence of corruption that the former education minister had indulged in. I made A public statement that corruption must be tackled by the party and government, but I was heckled by senior leaders in the party. I did not resign then as I had hoped that you would carry on your public campaign against 'cut money' and corruption that you had started a year earlier. Besides, everyone knows that there is no party anywhere that does not have a corrupt section. I was also persuaded by well-wishers to remain as MP in order to carry on the battle against a regime that is the greatest ever threat to Indian democracy and civil liberties,"" he said.""Though I carried on my task in parliament with fervour, I became increasingly disillusioned as the state government seemed quite unconcerned about corruption and the increasing strong-arm tactics of a section of leaders. As you know. I was the only prominent officer who was not given any plot in Salt Lake or anywhere by the previous regime - for speaking out too critically. I have grown up in a middle-class family in Kolkata and in my youth, I have travelled in suffocating public transport, hanging on to the footboards of buses. So,, after 41 years in the IAS, I can live without embarrassment in a small middle class flat, next to a big slum and drive a very ordinary 9 year old car. But I get amazed to see that several elected,"" he added.Reacting to Sircar's letter, TMC leader Kunal Ghosh said that the decision to quit was a personal one. While refraining from commenting directly on the contents of the letter, Ghosh expressed the party's alignment with the sentiments and questions raised by Sircar.""Jawahar Sarkar is a respected person...

The actress has decided to seek legal assistance. Leena Gangopadhyay , the chairperson West Bengal Commission of Women ( WBCW ), told TOI: ""The actor told us that since she was humiliated publicly, she wanted a public apology in writing.Sil had initially wanted to say that it was an unintentional act.

LUCKNOW: The bulldozer grunts on the shore of Ganga in UP's Unnao , baring its teeth. There are trucks and tractors waiting to be loaded with sand, and more almost certainly on the way.This is how it is here, where the sand mining mafia built a road that cuts through Ganga at Sumerpur Ghat. This unauthorised road has split the sacred river into two streams, creating a pathway for transporting their illicit cargo under cover of night.On another road of Unnao, shadows of a dark tragedy loom large over the Tripathi household.Shubham Mani Tripathi, a young journalist in his mid-20s, was gunned down in cold blood on June 19, 2020. His crime? Publishing a series of investigative articles exposing illegal activities of Kanhaiya Awasthi and his wife Divya Awasthi - known as ""bhu mafia"".""My brother was killed for speaking the truth,"" Shubham's elder brother Rishabh Mani said. ""In a town where silence once protected the corrupt, Shubham's voice - though silenced - was an example of courage and resistance. The least we can do is to ensure that his killers pay for their crimes."" Just three months before his murder, Shubham had married on Feb 26, 2020, marking what should have been the beginning of a new chapter in his life. Shubham's father died in March 2020, deeply affected by the threats his son received from the Awasthis.The family's home is now under round-the-clock security, with an armed policeman permanently stationed there - a grim reminder of the threats that still hang over them. But the administration provided no financial assistance or job offers.At 30, Rishabh runs a small cafe and online service centre. ""After my brother's death, I was responsible for managing everything for the family. My priority was seeking justice for Shubham and ensuring the killers were held accountable. I couldn't afford to spend time pursuing financial aid from govt offices.""The road to justice has been long and arduous. Of the 16 charged in connection with Shubham's murder, only five are currently behind bars. The incarcerated Awasthi couple's assets and properties, worth Rs 15 crore, have been seized.

PRAYAGRAJ: In an inspiring effort, over 30,000 people belonging to 20 villages in three blocks of Uttar Pradesh 's Pratapgarh district toiled for over 10 months to revive the earlier course of a seasonal river .Over the last decade, the Sakarni (Sanskrit for one who listens), a rivulet that feeds the Sai, a tributary of the Ganga, saw large-scale encroachment by farmers on its banks.Consequently, the rivulet changed its course and became shallow in stretches.A local green activist, Ajay Krantikari, who heads an NGO called "" Paryavaran Sena "", led a campaign to bring back the river to its natural course and first raised the issue before the district environment committee, which is headed by the district magistrate.On Oct 13, 2023, following Krantikari's efforts, the district authorities included the Sakarni river under the small rivers' rejuvenation list under MGNREGS .Old revenue records were scanned to ascertain the natural course of the river, which was almost lost to the local residents.Over the next 10 months, nearly 30,000 people worked under MGNREGS to bring the river back to its natural 27.7km-long course. Besides, they also found employment in their respective blocks during the rejuvenation work on the rivulet.The district administration spent Rs 1.35 crore to make this happen.Shri Krishna, Pratapgarh district development officer, said : ""The rejuvenation work of the small river Sakarni has been done with the help of villagers . Now, the river is flowing along its natural course.

GST on grants: Taxing blow to research?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gst-on-grants-taxing-blow-to-research/articleshow/113177449.cms,"It’s tax terrorism say academicians and could derail projects and curtail innovation

There’s a storm brewing in India’s academic circles , and it’s not about a new discovery or theory, but an unexpected tax on research grants .Seven Indian institutions – including the govt-run IIT Delhi, and Anna University in Chennai – recently got showcause notices from the directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGI) for unpaid taxes on research grants they received since 2017.While IIT Delhi faces a demand for ₹120 crore, including penalties over the past seven years, other universities have been asked to pay between ₹5 crore and ₹60 crore.“Tax terrorism” is what entrepreneur and Infosys co-founder T V Mohandas Pai called it on social media handle X, tagging GST India and PM Modi. While the DGGI says research and develop ment grants received by educational institutions are not exempt from tax, many academicians, scientists, and funding agencies disagree. They say grants, especially for educational institutions, are difficult to secure, and tax relief on these funds is a common practice in several countries.“GST on research grants will reduce money allocated for research. So, the govt must remove GST,” says Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan, a strong advocate for education, who funds research projects in institutions such as IIT and Indian Institute of Science (IISc). Experts say research is inherently a risky endeavour. Without the burden of taxes, institutions are more likely to invest in innovative and potentially high-risk projects that could lead to significant breakthroughs. “Some large and reputable research studies go on for several years.The Framingham Heart Study, for instance, is a long-term, ongoing cardiovascular co hort study of residents of Massachusetts that began in 1948,” says orthopaedic surgeon Dr George Thomas, former editor of the Journal of Indian Medical Ethics. “The National Institutes of Health invested USD 14 million in the Lower Extremities Assessment Project (LEAP), a comprehensive research initiative des igned to evaluate and improve outcomes in patients with severe injuries of the legs. Without large investments, breakthrough research is difficult. Taxing research grants reduces the already low investments.”Researchers also say funds for research have remained the same for years, though the scope of research has expanded. “It has not kept pace with inflation ,” says scientist Ashok Jhunjhunwala, who has chaired govt committees and boards of institutions such as IIT. He says GST on research could be covered by the grantee. “When researchers receive grant money from the ministry, the govt should pay the GST. Researchers would welcome it because they currently pay GST on equipment or components bought with grant funds. If grants were given with GST already paid, they could offset the GST costs they currently bear,” he says.Research grants are fully itemised with amounts allocated for equipment, components, travel, salaries and overheads. “Where is the GST money supposed to come from within this? Placing a GST demand on research institutions is just harassment.” While several universities are gearing up for litigation against the demand, legal experts say Centre should reconsider this issue before it reaches the courts.“GST is levied on the supply of goods and services,” says advocate K Vaitheeswaran, an expert on taxes and head of the taxation committee of the Madras Chamber of Commerce and I ndustry. “For example, at a shop there is a tax on sold goods. GST is on the supply of goods or services for consideration. When a university receives a research grant, there is no quid pro quo to provide any goods or services. A grant is not a consideration; it is akin to a donation.”Legal experts say there is no certainty in research outcomes, which may or may not result in saleable goods or services, and so, research grants and donations received from govt or private agencies should not be taxed based on anticipated outcomes but on monetised results. “When income tax provides an accelerated tax shield for research institutions notified under section 35(1)(ii), GST too should extend the same reasoning and logic for research grants,” they say.Academicians hope this issue will be discussed at the GST council meeting on Sept 9, chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. “Research grants to universities must be considered a subsidy as funds are used solely for delivering public good without any profit motive, making it a quasi-government endeavour by the university,” says an academician. Pai recommends setting up an expert co mmittee within GST India like the one at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.“Questions should be referred to this committee, position paper prepared, put out for publ ic comments and after that issued as the official view,” says the public policy advocate. “This will ensure uniform policy throughout the industry and eliminate arbitrary action by GST officers which harm the country and business as well as reduce tax terrorism. Officials must raise contestable questions and debate it out before they issue such notices. Tax on resear ch grants given to universities can have a chilling effect on research outputs. I hope it’s axed.”","Seven Indian institutions – including the govt-run IIT Delhi, and Anna University in Chennai – recently got showcause notices from the directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGI) for unpaid taxes on research grants they received since 2017.

CGST officials coerced bizman into arranging Rs 30L for release

MUMBAI: A central GST (CGST) superintendent, accused of detaining a businessman for 18 hours and demanding a bribe of Rs 60 lakh, was nabbed by CBI last week after a dramatic chase in the middle of the night near Oshiwara police station.In his bid to escape, the official, Sachin Gokulka, dumped one of his aides - a consultant who had allegedly accepted the bribe on his behalf - on the road but was soon caught by the CBI team in pursuit.The consultant and a chartered accountant (CA) were also arrested, and an FIR was filed against two IRS officers - additional commissioner, CSGST, Deepak Kumar Sharma, and joint commissioner Rahul Kumar -as well as three other CGST superintendents.Rahul Kumar, currently posted in another state but who previously worked in Mumbai, is accused of facilitating the deal by contacting Sharma. CBI has searched the premises of Sharma, the four superintendents and the other two aides.As per a complaint, Gokulka and the other three GST superintendents - Nitin Kumar Gupta, Nikhil Agrawal and Bijender Janawa - detained a Goregaon businessman for 18 hours on Sept 4 and threatened to arrest him if he failed to pay a bribe of 60 lakh - reduced from the original demand of 80 lakh - to settle a pharmaceutical company 's issue. The businessman was allegedly abused and slapped multiple times, and coerced into calling a relative to arrange 30 lakh, which was to be delivered to a middleman, chartered accountant (CA) Raj Aggarwal, throughhawala .After receiving the initial amount, the CGST officials released the businessman the following day, instructing him to arrange the remaining 30 lakh by that evening, which he was asked to deliver to Aggarwal.The businessman approached CBI. He could only arrange for 20 lakh, which he handed over to Aggarwal, who was supposed to pass on the money to a consultant, Abhisekh Mehta. CBI caught Mehta when he arrived to collect the money from the CA. He revealed that he was to hand over the bribe directly to Gokulka.In the presence of CBI officials, Mehta spoke to Gokulka over the phone, who asked him to turn up near Oshiwara police station for the bribe handover. CBI then set a trap.Gokulka, accompanied by two women, arrived in a car at the spot around 2.30am on Sept 6. He asked Mehta, who was waiting in another vehicle, to join him. When Mehta got into his vehicle with the amount, the official sensed something amiss and sped away. After a while, he asked Mehta to get out of the car with the money and drove away. The CBI team, which was in pursuit, managed to nab Mehta and subsequently traced Gokulka.CBI produced Gokulka, Aggarwal and Mehta in court on Sept 6. They were remanded in the agency's custody till Tuesday.",CGST officials coerced bizman into arranging Rs 30L for release of him.

NEW DELHI: As counter-Naxal forces brace to meet the March 2026 deadline set by home minister Amit Shah for ending Left-wing extremist (LWE) violence, the CRPF has augmented its strength in the Maoist bastions of south Bastar ( Chhattisgarh ) by deploying an additional 4,000 personnel.The force's four battalions, comprising 4,000 troops, were recently ordered to leave their stations in Jharkhand and Bihar - where LWE violence has been largely tackled with sustained, intelligence-based counter-operations over the past few years - and join the large number of battalions already fighting Maoists in south Bastar.While three battalions have been brought in from Jharkhand, one battalion is reaching from Bihar.The CRPF has set up over 100 forward operating bases (FOBs) in what once were Maoist strongholds inaccessible to governance and local administration. A CRPF source told TOI 10 FOBs have been established so far this year in south Bastar.Once FOBs are set up, administration moves in to reach benefits of government schemes to villages in the vicinity.The strategy has paid off by exposing local people to development and social sector benefits, while weaning them off the influence of Left-wing extremists. Shah had, during a recent visit to Raipur, declared March 2026 as the outer limit for ending Naxalism in the country.For this, he had emphasised on the need for a ""strong and ruthless"" plan of action.As per a reply given by the ministry of home affairs to a question in the Lok Sabha in Aug this year, incidents of LWE violence in the country have dipped 73% from the high level witnessed in 2010. The resultant fatalities among civilians and security forces too reduced by 86% in 2023 as compared to 2010.","The CRPF has augmented its strength in the Maoist bastions of south Bastar.

NEW DELHI: After a week marked by flip-flops over forging an alliance in Haryana, Sunday was marked by a 'take it or leave it' offer from Congress to AAP. A likelihood of a tie-up in Haryana between the two parties is hinged on AAP accepting Congress's twin conditions on number of seats and specific constituencies.Congress added a twist to the tail by releasing a list of nine candidates for Haryana elections .Though a small number after the initial list of 32, that does not seem to impact the alliance talks , but at the same time, added a sense of urgency for going ahead in the Congress camp and not be held hostage by negotiations with AAP, in a clear nudge to Kejriwal's party to make up its mind fast. A decision on a tie-up is likely to be sealed by tonight. AAP sources conceded that Congress had not responded to its offer till late.With AAP putting off its plan of announcing its first list of candidates on Sunday, it appears Kejriwal's party may be willing to climb down on its demand for 10 seats to move closer to agreeing to 4-6 seats that Congress is likely to cede, sources said.If the alliance works out, AAP sources said an announcement will follow on Monday. The last date to file nominations is Sept 12.Congress's Haryana in-charge Deepak Babaria and AAP's Raghav Chadha along with others were engaged in hectic negotiations till late. According to sources, AAP is likely to be offered seats where Congress does not think winnability will be a factor for its candidates or where it performed poorly in the past.""An alliance seems possible on 4-6 seats if AAP agrees to the nature of constituencies that Congress is offering,"" a Congress source said. The development comes amid strong opposition from the Haryana unit of the party.Meanwhile, sources said Congress may spare three seats for Samajwadi Party in Haryana. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has asked Congress for Hathin constituency in Palwal, Dadri in Charkhi Dadri and Sohna in Gurgaon district.Earlier in the day, Chadha said Congress and AAP were trying to forge an alliance by keeping aside their individual aspirations. He also said AAP will not proceed with the alliance ""if there is no win-win situation"".AAP's three-time MLA from Malviya Nagar in Delhi Somnath Bharti cautioned his party against an alliance with Congress by citing how the Congress leadership never campaigned for him when he was the candidate while AAP leaders went all out to campaign and garner support for Congress candidates.","AAP may be willing to climb down on its demand for 10 seats to move closer to agreeing to 4-6 seats that Congress is likely to cede, sources said.

On the other hand, the reduction of over 40% in the pollutant levels put Trichy, Tuticorin (both in Tamil Nadu) and Kadapa (Andhra Pradesh) in the list of 18 cities which meet those standards of being clean cities.Under NCAP launched in 2019, the ministry had planned to reduce PM10 levels by 40% by 2025-26 from the baseline year 2017-18. Overall, 95 out of 131 polluting cities have shown improvement by reducing levels of PM10 in varying percentages where 18 of them have, so far, reached the acceptable limit of this critical air pollutant. PM10 (particulate matters that do not exceed 10 micrograms in diameter) is small enough to enter the lungs through breathing causing serious health hazards.Data on improvement in air quality in these cities was shared by the ministry at a function to observe ‘International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies’ in Jaipur on Sept 7 where Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav awarded nine cities in three different categories for better implementation of different actions for mitigating air pollution under NCAP.Surat, Jabalpur and Agra were awarded for being the top three cities in the million-pluspopulation category, whereas Firozabad, Amravati and Jhansi received the award in the category of 3-10 lakh of population, and Raebareli, Nalgonda and Nalagarh in the category of less than three lakh of population. Except for Nalgonda in Telangana, none of these cities, however, figured in the list of 18 which met the national standards for clean air. The cities were awarded under the ‘Swachh Vayu Survekshan’ 2024 on the basis of different mitigation measures where the weightage of improving PM10 levels is merely 2.5% in this annual survey.High-polluting cities such as Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Nasik and Kota too recorded improvement in terms of reducing PM10 to an extent, but the levels of pollutant there are still quite far away from the acceptable limit. Delhi reduced the level of PM10 from 241 µg/m3 in 2017-18 to 208 µg/m3 in 2023-24 (nearly 14% decline) but the city continues to be highly polluting by recording pollutant levels by more than three times of the national standards.Under NCAP, city action plans (CAPs) have been prepared by all 131 ‘non-attainment’ cities and are being implemented by urban local bodies. The non-attainment cities are those which did not conform to the NAAQS during 2011-15.The Centre has earmarked nearly Rs 20,000 crore for these cities during 2019-20 to 2025-26, out of which 49 million plus population cities are funded under the 15th Finance Commission air quality grant and remaining 82 cities by the environment ministry. So far, over Rs 11,211 crore has been released to these cities to implement CAPs.","Greater Mumbai, Varanasi, Agra, Lucknow, Kanpur, Dehradun, Dhanbad, Trichy and Tuticorin have reduced the concentration of critical air pollutant PM10 by more than 40% in 2023-24 compared to 2017-18 levels.

'India does not have respect for ... '

Rahul on AI

NEW DELHI: Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , on his three-day visit to the United States, addressed pressing issues such as unemployment , education , and technology. He remarked that both the West and India are grappling with job crises and advocated for India to ""boost its own production "" to combat unemployment.Rahul said that while many countries are grappling with unemployment, some, such as China and Vietnam, are not facing such difficulties.Gandhi traced the roots of this issue to historical shifts in global production. “The West, including the United States and Europe, once led global production in the mid-20th century,” he said.He noted a significant change over the decades, with production gradually relocating from the US to South Korea, Japan, and eventually China. Today, China dominates global production, a shift Gandhi attributes to Western and Indian retreat from manufacturing.“The West, including America and Europe, has largely abandoned the manufacturing sector, leaving it to countries like China and Vietnam,” the LoP in Lok Sabha explained.The Congress MP added that India needs to reimagine its approach to production. “India cannot simply accept that manufacturing will be the domain of other countries,” he said. “We need to develop our own manufacturing capabilities in a way that aligns with democratic principles.”Reflecting on his recent Bharat Jodo Yatra, Gandhi shared how it reshaped his political outlook. “The Bharat Jodo Yatra fundamentally changed the way I think about my work,” he said. He discussed how the Yatra introduced the concept of love into political discourse, which is rare globally. “The most powerful thing that happened organically was the introduction of the idea of love in politics,” Gandhi mentioned.Talking about education and skills in India, Rahul suggested that the real issue is not a lack of skills but a lack of respect for skilled individuals. “India does not have respect for people who possess skills,” he remarked. He criticised the disconnect between the education system and the business sector, advocating for better integration through vocational training. “Our education system doesn’t connect with the business system. Bridging that gap through vocational training is fundamental,” Rahul said.Regarding Artificial Intelligence (AI), Gandhi acknowledged both its challenges and opportunities. “Every time you get a new technology, the argument is made that it’s going to take jobs away,” the Congress MP said. However, he also pointed out that while AI might displace some jobs, it will create new ones as well. “It’s going to hit different people differently. If you position it properly, it’s an opportunity; if not, you’re in trouble,” Gandhi explained.Rahul Gandhi made his remarks during a live interaction with students at the University of Texas in Dallas, USA.Gandhi arrived in Dallas on Sunday and was welcomed by Sam Pitroda, Chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress, and members of the Indian diaspora.","Congress MP Rahul Gandhi is on a three-day visit to the United States.

Correlated Events

Distinct Activity

BENGALURU: In multiple “firsts”, India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission has detected more than 250 seismic signals on the Moon’s south polar region , including 50 distinct ones that have no correlation to the activity of the rover’s ( Pragyan ) movement or operations of other instruments but could be possibly linked to Moonquakes .This marks the first collection of seismic data from Moon’s southern polar region and the first such data anywhere on the lunar surface since the Apollo era.This experiment by Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA), a scientific instrument aboard Vikram lander , was conducted at the landing site of 69.37° South and 32.32° East.ILSA, which operated for 190 hours between Aug 24 and Sept 4, 2023, is the first instrument to record ground accelerations from the south polar region of Moon and the first on the lunar surface that employed sensors fabricated by silicon micromachining technology.The findings have been analysed and published by a group of Isro researchers in ICARUS , a scientific journal dedicated to the field of planetary science.The paper has been published by J John, V Thamarai, Teena Choudhary, MN Srinivasa, Ashwini Jambhalikar, MS Giridhar, Madan Mohan Mehra, Mayank Garg, KV Shila, Krishna Kummari, SP Karantha, Kalpana Arvind and KV Sriram, from Isro’s Laboratory for Electro-Optics Systems (LEOS) in Peenya, Bengaluru.LEOS director Sriram told TOI: “Of the more than 250 seismic events recorded, approximately 200 signals correlate to known activities involving Pragyan’s movements or the operation of scientific instruments, the 50 others do not have any explanation. There needs to be further studies to understand what may have caused these activities.”Researchers say the longest and relatively large amplitude (maximum extent of a vibration or oscillation, measured from the position of equilibrium) records from ILSA are those corresponding to Pragyan’s navigation. The longest continuous signal record lasts for 14 minutes.About 60 signals catalogued correspond to Pragyan’s movement controlled by ground commands. The rover that weighed about 25kg had six wheels and was driven with motors. It moved at a typical speed of 1 cm per second. The dynamics of the rover and the wheel-soil interaction had been a source of complex ground vibration signal input to ILSA.“As the distance of the rover from ILSA was increased, there had been a systematic reduction in the amplitude of the signal under normal roving conditions. For example, when the rover was away from the lander by around 7m, the average peak to peak amplitude was around 200 μg (microgravity). This amplitude was halved when the distance became 12m and was one order less when the separation was 40m,” the paper, accessed by TOI, reads.Researchers further said that any event that could be classified as deep quake or shallow quake was beyond the targeted objectives and design specifications of ILSA and that they were aware of the very low probability of occurrence of those classes of events during the one lunar day operation of the instrument.However, from the data investigated as a part of the paper, there are about 50 instances where the amplitude of output from the instrument is distinctly different from its normal background level.“From the mission command history, it was confirmed that any activity that can cause ground vibration was not performed during this timeframe,” the paper reads. Hence, researchers classified these as ‘uncorrelated events’.Among the 50 uncorrelated events, the maximum peak to peak amplitude of the signal is as high as 700 μg in certain instances. “The frequency content in the signals are spread over a wide range up to 50 Hz. The signals discussed here lasted only for a few seconds. Although several distinct signals lasting less than a couple of seconds are also observed, they are not included in the count reported in this paper,” the paper read.","India's Chandrayaan-3 mission has detected more than 250 seismic signals on the Moon’s south polar region.

Two arch rivals, India and China, are likely to team up with Russia for setting up a nuclear power plant on the moon , according to a recent report in EurAsian Times referring to Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass, saying this was highlighted by Rosatom chief, Alexey Likhachev .Rosatom is Russia’s state nuclear energy corporation having ties with India.Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum recently at Vladivostok in Russia, Likhachev said: “… with the involvement of the international community, our Chinese and Indian partners are very interested in this,’’ he said.India’s interest in the project assumes significance in the context of the country planning a manned mission to the moon by 2040 and setting up a base.According to Tass, the lunar power project, led by Rosatom, aims to build a small nuclear power plant capable of generating up to half a megawatt of energy, providing the necessary power for the base.Likhachev reiterated that China and India are eager to be involved in creating this ground-breaking lunar energy solution.Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, had previously declared in May that work on this nuclear power plant was underway, intending to deploy it to the moon.The reactor will provide energy for a proposed lunar base, which Russia and China are jointly working on. India’s desire for a lunar base coincides with its possible participation in the lunar power project.The construction of this lunar nuclear power plant will be complex. Russia previously revealed that it would likely be carried out autonomously without the direct involvement of humans.In 2021, Russia and China announced plans to build a joint lunar base called the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) which could be commissioned in phases between 2035 and 2045.Experts said India is playing its diplomatic cards carefully with the US and Russia. While it is sending Shubhanshu Shukla of the Gaganyaan mission to the International Space Station in the US, it is now exploring the possibility of joining hands with China on the Russian lunar power project.","Two arch rivals, India and China, are likely to team up with Russia for setting up a nuclear power plant on the moon.

Focusing on quality now NHAI to hire firms with highest technical score to prepare DPRs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/focusing-on-quality-now-nhai-to-hire-firms-with-highest-technical-score-to-prepare-dprs/articleshow/113172680.cms,"NEW DELHI: National Highways Authority of India has decided that consultancy firms with the highest technical score and not those quoting the lowest price will get contracts for preparing detailed project reports ( DPRs ) for widening of NH stretches and building new highways and expressways.NHAI has made major changes in the bid document — Request for Proposal (RFP) — for DPR consultancy by fixing the cost and focusing more on quality of manpower deployed by firms in project preparation .Improvement in project preparation is crucial considering that bad DPRs result in delay in project completion and additional work at a later stage to deal with deficiencies. Unlike in developed countries where more time is given for project preparation, consultants get less time to carry out such work in India.Till now, the criteria for consultancy services for DPR was based on two scores — 80 for quality and 20 for cost — and both officials and senior executives of consultancy firms admitted that those who could not score better would quote a very low price to get contracts. “There have been cases where the price quoted would be as low as Rs 70,000 per km. At such low cost, no one can prepare a good DPR. Field surveys cost more than such quoted price. So, with NHAI fixing the cost, there will be no scope for non serious players to get work,” an official said.The modified contract conditions have specified deployment of more key personnel in projects and has also brought in a stricter regime of their attendance. Officials admitted there have been instances of consultants putting names of more experienced personnel for getting work but deploying less experienced or fresh manpower during execution. The new norms provide for two years debarment of a firm if its found that fake CVs were submitted to get projects.NHAI has also linked the bid capacity of firms to get the number of projects at any point of time.Though these changes are aimed at ensuring better quality, industry sources said there was huge scope of improvement. “Provisions such as investigation and traffic study should be delinked from DPR preparation. Even DPR consultants get them done by others to get good data and details. So, NHAI should get them done by empanelled vendors. DPR consultants cut corners in these works,” said a senior executive of a consultancy firm.He added that most DPR consultants were doing “clerical job” simply to keep the client happy rather than doing value engineering.",National Highways Authority of India has decided that consultancy firms with the highest technical score and not those quoting the lowest price will get contracts.

NEW DELHI/PUNE: The central govt has sacked controversial IAS probationer Puja Manorama Khedkar from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), just over a month after the UPSC cancelled her provisional candidature for Civil Services Examination 2022 (CSE) for fraudulently availing of exam attempts more than the permissible limit by faking her identity.Rule 12 of the IAS (Probation) Rules, 1954, allows the central govt to discharge an IAS probationer, after holding a summary enquiry, if it is satisfied that the probationer was ineligible for recruitment to the service or is unsuitable for being a member of the service.""Vide order dated 6th September, 2024 the Central Government discharges Ms Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar , IAS Probationer (MH:2023), from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) under Rule 12 of IAS (Probation) Rules, 1954, with immediate effect,"" sources in the department of personnel and training (DoPT) informed TOI on Saturday.On July 31, the UPSC had cancelled Khedkar's candidature for CSE 2022, based on which she had been recommended to the IAS, on the ground that she had exceeded the nine CSE attempts permissible in her category - OBC and person with benchmark disability (PwBD) - by faking her identity. It had also permanently debarred her from all future examinations or selections of UPSC.As per findings of the single-member committee set up by DoPT on July 11 to probe the complaint referred to it by Maharashtra govt, particularly allegations that she may have misrepresented her caste and disability status, as well as UPSC's own inquiry, Khedkar had exhausted her maximum permissible attempts at CSE (nine for OBC and PwBD category) between 2012 And 2020 itself.It was concluded that Khedkar was ineligible to be a candidate for CSE-2022, which was the year of her selection and appointment to the lAS. Therefore, she was also ineligible to be recruited to the Indian Administrative Service, said an officer.TOI made repeated attempts to call Puja Khedkar and her father Dilip Khedkar, a retired senior Maharashtra govt officer, on Saturday to seek their comments on the development but their phones were switched off. Messages sent to them on the phone evoked no response till the time of going to press.Khedkar was served a show-cause notice on July 18 based on the findings and a criminal case filed against her for having forged her identity papers and misrepresenting facts to obtain extra attempts at CSE. After she failed to file her response despite an extended deadline till July 30, UPSC on July 31 announced its decision to cancel her candidature for CSE-2022 and also debarred her from appearing for any future selections or examinations conducted by it.The final nail in the coffin came on Friday, with the Centre sacking her from IAS with immediate effect for being ineligible for recruitment to the service.Khedkar's alleged lies as a CSE applicant about her as well as her parents' credentials, had recently led UPSC to prescribe Aadhaar authentication, though voluntary, of candidates appearing for all its examinations.As regards the complaints relating to the submission of false certificates (specifically OBC & PwBD categories) are concerned, the UPSC had clarified that it does only a preliminary scrutiny of the certificates viz. whether it was issued by the competent authority, the year to which the certificate pertains, issuing date of the certificate, whether there is any overwriting on the certificate, format of the certificate etc. Generally, the certificate is taken as genuine, if it has been issued by the competent authority, it had claimed.",Puja Manorama Khedkar has been sacked from the Indian Administrative Service.

Why is it only she is precious to the country? Then if she is precious to you, then our family is precious to us.So we set a benchmark that had to be followed,"" Abdullah added.The Central government, led by VP Singh, had agreed to release five imprisoned terrorists of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front in exchange for Rubaiya Syed's release. This precedent, Abdullah said, played a significant role in shaping the demands made during the IC814 hijacking.The IC814 hijacking has garnered renewed attention, partially due to its depiction of hijackers in the Netflix series ""IC814: The Kandahar Hijack,"" directed by Anubhav Sinha. The series delves into the controversial decision to release terrorists in exchange for the safety of the hostages.Abdullah highlighted the difficult position the government found itself in, saying, ""I think the Government of India had an option.

NEW DELHI: Fissures have emerged in Maharashtra 's ruling Mahayuti alliance as a Shiv Sena minister raised objections against ally NCP and its president Ajit Pawar for omitting chief minister Eknath Shinde 's name from advertisements and promotional material for the ' Ladki Bahin Yojana .'State excise minister Shambhuraj Desai , from the Shiv Sena led by CM Shinde, accused deputy CM Pawar of virtually hijacking the 'Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin' scheme by not using its full name in his public outreach programs, which offers a financial assistance of Rs 1,500 per month to eligible women in the state.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Desai expressed disappointment with Pawar, who is also the state's finance minister. Pawar has been heavily promoting the scheme through his party's 'Jan Sanman Yatra ,' a public outreach narrative focused on the benefits of the financial assistance provided under the Ladki Bahin and other schemes.""The scheme has 'chief minister' in its name, and removing it from the scheme is inappropriate. It should not have been done,"" Desai alleged.He emphasised the importance of adhering to protocol and criticized the omission.“It is a state government scheme, and he (Pawar) should have taken everyone along,” the Excise Minister added.Ahead of the Maharashtra assembly elections expected to be held in November, Ajit Pawar's campaign has been using advertisements and promotional material that refer to the scheme simply as 'Majhi Ladki Bahin' instead of its full name, 'Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin' scheme. Videos released by the Pawar camp showed beneficiaries thanking Ajit Pawar specifically for the scheme.The Ladki Bahin scheme takes inspiration from the Ladli Behana scheme in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which was similarly launched ahead of assembly polls there. The Ladki Bahin scheme itself was officially launched last month.During his campaign rallies, CM Shinde has promised to double the financial assistance provided under the scheme to Rs 3,000 if the Mahayuti is re-elected to power.The controversy over the scheme’s branding highlights tensions within the Mahayuti alliance, as partners navigate their approach to voter outreach and credit-sharing amid the upcoming elections.

Implications of Anil Kapoor’s victory



When Hollywood actors had a problem with AI

Time Magazine ’s 2024 list of most Influential people in AI had a surprise inclusion this year. Among prominent names like Google’s Sundra Pichai, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, the list featured bollywood actor Anil Kapoor that came as a surprise to many. So much so that it has got the internet talking and wondering how Anil Kapoor made it to TIME magazine’s AI cover.If you are also curious to know the reason behind Kapoor’s inclusion in the list, then read on.Back in 2023, Kapoor filed a case with the Delhi High Court seeking protection of his own name, image, likeness, persona, voice and various other attributes of his personality against misuse of all hues over the internet. Delivered by Justice Prathiba M Singh, the high court passed an interim order then, restraining the misuse of the actor's name, image, voice and other attributes of persona, including his popular ‘jhakaas’ catchphrase.Reacting to the order, Kapoor then told Variety, “I’m very happy with this court order, which has come in my favor, and I think it’s very progressive and great for not only me but for other actors also.”“Because of the way technology and the AI technology, which is which is evolving every day [and] which can completely take advantage of and be misused commercially, as well as where my image, voice, morphing, GIFs and deep fakes are concerned, I can straight away, if that happens, send a court order and injunction and they have to pull it down,” he said.“Around the same time that SAG-AFTRA members were fighting big Hollywood studios over the use of their AI replicas without consent and compensation, one of India’s most famous actors was fighting a similar battle. Anil Kapoor won a landmark victory in a New Delhi high court in September over unauthorized AI use of his likeness,” says Time Magazine.Anil Kapoor knocked the court’s door when deepfake videos of popular Indian actors including Alia Bhatt, Rashmika Mandanna, Aamir Khan and Ranveer Singh alarmed the country. Kapoor’s victory has also paved the way for others to seek protection over their personality rights .In July this year, the Bombay High Court granted interim relief to singer Arijit Singh, noting that using his voice without permission was a legal violation. The case was heard after unauthorized AI platforms mimicked Singh’s name and likeness without consent, with one platform even using text-to-speech software to convert text into his voice.In 2023, the Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) demanded to limit the use of AI. The union then sought to ensure actors are informed if artificial intelligence systems were replicating their voices or performances.“It is with profound disappointment that we report the industry CEOs have walked away from the bargaining table after refusing to counter our latest offer,” SAG-AFTRA said in a statement. “These companies refuse to protect performers from being replaced by AI, they refuse to increase your wages to keep up with inflation, and they refuse to share a tiny portion of the immense revenue YOUR work generates for them,” the actors’ guild added.","Time Magazine’s 2024 list of most Influential people in AI had a surprise inclusion this year.

Anderson recently retired from Test cricket leaving Southee as the flag-bearer of a generation of “Test seamers”.Southee’s new-ball partner for more than a decade, Trent Boult too recently quit international cricket.In terms of a pacer’s longevity in the longest and most challenging format of the game, only the Australian duo of Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins have endured the red-ball rigours for more than a decade now.Southee feels with the rise and expansion of T20s, and the ODIs still having its relevance, the “Test seamer’s” longevity will be in doubt.“I am not sure. I don’t think the world will witness another James Anderson-like career in the future. I don’t think anyone will reach the heights that Anderson has been able to reach over his career,” Southee said on Sunday, before the one-off Test against Afghanistan here.“For me, I still love Test cricket. So, I am just excited to be back playing Tests after a bit of a break. The appetite for T20s and ODIs is increasing, but I would still like to think that there is a lot of Test cricket to be played.”“We will have to wait and see (whether pacers of the current generation can keep playing Tests for a considerable length of time).

Tata LCC to complete on October 1; mega AI Express to have 100 aircraft by year end,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ex-airasia-india-to-be-merged-into-ai-express/articleshow/113177707.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's low cost carrier ( LCC ) space is in for a major rejig with Tata Group 's mega Air India Express coming into being on Oct 1, 2024, when the process of merging erstwhile AirAsia India into it gets completed. The combined entity, with 7,000 employees, as of now has 84 aircraft (mainly Boeing 737s and a few Airbus A320s ) and this number will grow to 100 before end of this calendar year.Erstwhile AirAsia India was Tata Group's re-entry into the airline space for the first time after JRD Tata launching Air India in 1932. It started flying in June 2024 and from Oct 1 its designator code I5 will cease to exist. Tata's other JV airline, Vistara , which had started flying in Jan 2015, merges into AI on Nov 12.With India the fastest growing aviation market globally, the LCC market here is set to rise exponentially in coming years. ""The emergence of LCCs other than IndiGo should not be seen as competition to the latter as the market is too big for all but as choice for consumers. Having a strong alternate means players will have to improve in areas they are weak in. For IndiGo, it means improving the onboard experience for flyers. For AI Express, it means quickly expanding its network, frequencies and connecting city pairs. Akasa is to watch out for if it can arrange funding and get Boeing to deliver the ordered planes on time,"" said an industry observer.While market leader IndiGo is way ahead, the Tata LCC will position itself differently to appeal to passengers. ""Our two main differentiators are that we have hot meals on board and are less formal on the branding side, appealing more to today's traveller,"" said officials.Onboard meals are the biggest chink in IndiGo’s otherwise strong armour. The Big Blue currently has about 340 aircraft; will induct one plane every week for the next 10 years and double its fleet before the end of this decade. It will start getting long-range single aisles next year and then wide-body planes from 2027. It has about 1,000 aircraft on order which are going to be delivered till mid-2030s.The Tata Group had last Feb placed a $470 billion order for 400 narrow body and 70 wide body aircraft. “There is no doubt that India, like rest of the world, is essentially a low cost market (accounting for over 75 per cent of domestic market share). A majority of the single aisles (190 Boeing 737 MAX & 210 Airbus A320 family) could logically come to AI Express. On a group level, we are going to be 300 plus before the year end (AI and Vistara that merge Nov 12 have 211 planes, including 67 wide bodies, as of now),” said officials.AI Express has so far got 33 “whitetail” B737 MAX — meaning planes that were made for some other airline but could not be delivered to them — and is to get 17 more before the end of this year. “There will be some lease returns. So end of calendar year, we are looking at a fleet of 100 planes,” said an official.","India's low cost carrier ( LCC ) space is in for a major rejig with Tata Group's mega Air India Express coming into being on Oct 1, 2024.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Navdeep and coach Naval Singh

NEW DELHI: From enduring taunts about his dwarfism to achieving glory at the Paris Paralympics , Navdeep Singh 's journey is a tale of remarkable resilience. The 4 feet 4 inches tall para javelin sensation secured the gold medal in the F41 classification at the Paris Paralympic Games .After finishing fourth at the Tokyo Paralympics three years ago and claiming bronze at the 2024 World Para Athletics Championship, Navdeep was determined to change his fate this time.He stood proudly atop the podium, with tears in his eyes, as the Indian national anthem played and the tricolor was raised at the roaring Stade de France.Initially awarded the silver, Navdeep's medal was upgraded to gold after Iran’s Sadegh Beit Sayah was disqualified for repeatedly displaying an objectionable flag, violating the International Paralympic Committee’s rules, which prohibit political gestures.Sayah’s unsporting conduct led to his disqualification, allowing Navdeep to take his place as the champion.""I was so surprised when the red card was shown to the Iranian javelin thrower. He started crying. He was in tears and weeping. I also became so emotional that I went to him and hugged him. I consoled him. Until then, I didn’t know what exactly had happened and the reason behind this big decision,"" Navdeep told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview from Paris.For Navdeep, the gold medal is redemption for the heartbreak of finishing fourth at the Tokyo Paralympics.""When I was given the gold medal, I was so happy. Tokyo is in the past now, Paris is the present. I am really delighted that I could make my country proud. I’m really happy I could add one more gold medal to India's tally. People always remember gold,"" an elated Navdeep said.""My first throw was a foul. I looked at my coach, and he asked me to remain calm. In my second attempt, I threw 46-plus. I turned toward my coach and asked him how much I threw in my second attempt. He said 46-plus. I was amazed because I didn’t put much effort into it. It gave me so much spark and motivation to do even better. And then, the rest is history,"" he said.""I never imagined I would throw 47-plus, honestly. I don’t have any idea how I did this. Because during my training just before departing for Paris, I was throwing 41 or 42. But I don’t know how I managed to throw 47-plus,"" Navdeep added.Navdeep follows in the footsteps of two-time Olympic medalist Neeraj Chopra and believes that the technique of falling just before releasing the javelin gives a powerful boost, much like Neeraj does with his throws.Navdeep credits this technique to his coach, Naval Singh, who has been instrumental in shaping his career.""My coach, Naval Singh, has worked a lot with me. He has trained me for almost seven years. He has played a big role in my career. Whatever I am today, it’s because of him. He has made me an international-level javelin thrower. All the credit for my technique and foundation goes to him,"" Navdeep said.""Mera girna mera akhiri upay hota hai. Jab gir jata hun, wo throw acha jata hai [Falling is my last resort. When I fall, that throw goes well],"" (laugh) Navdeep said.Having just returned from Paris, coach Naval watched Navdeep's final with confidence, knowing his student would bring home a Paralympic medal.""I knew Navdeep was going to make me and India proud. He has done a lot of hard work. Navdeep ki technique Neeraj Chopra se bhi behtar hai (Navdeep's technique is even better than Neeraj Chopra's). If he were in able-bodied athletics, he would have done wonders. But we are all proud of Navdeep. This is just the start for him—he is going to break several records,"" a confident coach said.",Navdeep Singh secured the gold medal in the F41 classification at the Paris Paralympic Games. The 4 feet 4 inches tall para javelin sensation was initially awarded the silver medal. Iran’s Sadegh Beit Sayah was disqualified for repeatedly displaying an objectionable flag.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113177053,imgsize-31676,width-400,resizemode-4/113177053.jpg"
Nefertiti Bust: Egyptian scientist starts petition to return Nefertiti bust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/egyptian-scientist-starts-petition-to-return-nefertiti-bust/articleshow/113178139.cms,"What does the petition say?

What does Germany say about the bust?

Egypt 's former antiquities minister Zahi Hawass has launched a petition to urge Germany to return the pharaonic bust of Queen Nefertiti, which is currently housed in Berlin's Neues Museum.Believed to have been crafted in 1345 BC, a German archaeological team discovered the painted limestone bust in 1912 and shipped it to Europe a year later.It was uncovered in the remains of the city of Amarna , the short-lived capital under Pharaoh Akhenaten, Nefertiti's husband.The city was abandoned after he died in 1335 BC.Amarna sits on the east bank of the Nile River and is located in the province of Minya.Hawass asked for the return of the bust, saying it was removed from Egypt illegally after its discovery more than a century ago.""We announce today that Egypt — this is the national committee, it is not a government committee — asks for the return of the bust of Nefertiti,"" Hawass said.""What I need from everyone here is to go to my website...hawasszahi.com, and you will sign, one signature, to show that you would love for this bust to come back.""Hawass said he is not calling for the repatriation of artifacts taken out of Egypt legally.His campaign is focused on repatriating ""three main beautiful objects"" including the bust of Nefertiti, the Rosetta Stone and the Dendera Zodiac .The Rosetta Stone is an ancient Egyptian stone bearing inscriptions in several languages and scripts, which led to the understanding of hieroglyphic writing. It is currently on display in the British Museum in London.The Zodiac of Dendera is a giant stone diagram from a temple in Egypt dating to the mid-1st century BC, which is currently in the Louvre in Paris.The German side says that Egypt authorized Germany to launch an excavation to locate the Nefertiti bust for its museums in Berlin.The deal included a 50:50 split of some 10,000 artifacts found in exchange for financing by German cotton and textile magnate and arts patron James Simon, according to German art experts.A representative from the Egyptian government selected half of the objects, while the other half was taken to Germany, including the bust, which was displayed in the Neues Museum several years later and has become a major tourist attraction.A row between Germany and Egypt, which was then a British protectorate, erupted shortly afterward over who should hold the sculpture.During World War II, the bust was hidden away and, toward the end of the conflict, was moved to the Egyptian Museum in West Berlin where it stayed until it was delivered back to the Neues Museum in 2009.Over several decades, Cairo has repeatedly called for the bust's return, accusing German Egyptologist Ludwig Borchard, who led the excavation, of smuggling it out of the country.When asked by the Reuters news agency, Berlin's Neues Museum was not immediately available for comment on the petition.April marked the bust's 100th anniversary on display in Berlin's Neues Museum.",Egypt's former antiquities minister Zahi Hawass has launched a petition to return the bust.

Petroleum: Blue water economy: Massive oil and gas discovery in Pakistan's water,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/blue-water-economy-massive-oil-and-gas-discovery-in-pakistans-water/articleshow/113154434.cms,"A significant deposit of petroleum and natural gas has been discovered within Pakistan's territorial waters, following a detailed three-year survey carried out in collaboration with a friendly nation. The discovery could potentially offer a drastic boost to the nation's economy, according to a Pakistani senior security official quoted by DawnNewsTV.The official explained that the survey has successfully identified the location of the reserves, and relevant government bodies have been informed.These resources, located in the depths of Pakistani waters, represent a critical step towards capitalising what the official referred to as the "" blue water economy .""While this discovery could lead to a major boost for Pakistan’s energy sector, the process of exploration is still in its early stages.The work of digging wells and actually getting oil out could take several years. The official also talked about the potential of the blue water economy, pointing out that valuable minerals and elements could be extracted from the ocean, providing additional economic benefits for Pakistan.Estimates suggest that this discovery could be among the world’s largest oil and gas reserves , potentially placing Pakistan as the holder of the fourth-largest deposit globally.Venezuela currently leads in terms of oil reserves, with approximately 3.4 billion barrels, followed by countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Canada, and Iraq. The US is also notable for holding the most significant untapped shale oil reserves.In an interview with DawnNewsTV, Muhammad Arif, a former member of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) said that while the discovery is a positive development, there is no guarantee the reserves will be as large or easily recoverable as initially hoped.He said, ""If this is a gas reserve, it can replace LNG imports and if these are oil reserves, we can substitute imported oil.""The significant financial investment needed to explore offshore oil and gas reserves, estimating the cost at around $5 billion just for exploration, further claimed Arif.","A significant deposit of petroleum and natural gas has been discovered within Pakistan's territorial waters.

"Vance’s comments 'not helpful', don't always agree with Trump: Nikki Haley",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vances-comments-not-helpful-dont-always-agree-with-trump-nikki-haley/articleshow/113173965.cms,"Support for Trump despite differences

Ready to help if called upon

Former ambassdor to the UN Nikki Haley took aim at Senator J.D. Vance ’s comments about ""childless cat ladies"" during a recent interview on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" labeling them unproductive and urging Republicans to avoid such rhetoric. Haley underscored the need to focus on substantive issues rather than personal attacks, highlighting the significance of policies over style.""Style is, no, it is not helpful to talk about whether women have children or whether they don't,"" she told CBS, adding, ""I have said that and I will continue to say to Republicans, stop it, that's not helpful.""Haley also discussed her disagreements with former President Donald Trump While she supports many of his policies, she differs on some of his ideas and methods, particularly his recent proposal to mandate insurance coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF).With personal experience in fertility treatments, Haley argued that while IVF should be accessible, mandating coverage could increase insurance costs and may not be the most effective solution.""We want that option to be available to everyone. But the way you do it is you don't mandate coverage. Instead, you go and you make sure that coverage is accessible, and you make sure that you're doing everything you can to make it affordable,"" she told CBS.Haley said that she believes that the implementation of robust immigration measures, the maintenance of law and order, the creation of economic opportunities, and the strengthening of national security would improve the lives of American citizens.On the topic of childcare, Haley contested Trump’s claim that it is relatively inexpensive, recognizing the financial burden it poses for many families. Although she expressed concerns about Trump’s proposal to expand child tax credits, suggesting it could lead to inequities, she advocated for broad tax cuts as a more effective way to provide relief to all Americans.Although Haley disagrees with Trump on certain issues, she has continued to offer her support for his presidential campaign. She revealed that while she hasn't been officially asked to campaign for him, she remains on standby if needed.""I spoke with him in June,"" Haley said. ""He knows I’m ready to help if he ever asks.""Despite their past differences, Haley endorsed Trump at the Republican National Convention. When asked about her position, she explained that her focus is on the policies she believes would benefit the country rather than on personal disagreements.""I don't need to like someone 100% of the time to know their policies are better for America,"" she said.As the first debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris approaches, Haley remains ready to assist Trump if called upon, but she’s not actively advising him at this time.""I'm happy to be helpful if he asks,"" Haley said.Indian-American Nikki Haley, who once competed against Donald Trump in the Republican presidential race, suspended her campaign following Super Tuesday’s results. After failing to secure enough delegates, Haley, who won Vermont but lost to Trump in 12 other states including Texas and California had said , ""The time has now come to suspend my campaign,"" with no regrets.","Former ambassdor to the UN Nikki Haley took aim at Senator J.D.
