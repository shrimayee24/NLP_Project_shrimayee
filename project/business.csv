"Highway projects of 4L cr delayed, 200 bid out, await start",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/highway-projects-of-4l-cr-delayed-200-bid-out-await-start/articleshow/123128712.cms,"NEW DELHI: : Around 580 National Highway (NH) projects with total cost of nearly Rs 3.9 lakh crore are delayed and another 200 projects worth Rs 1.6 lakh crore are yet to take off months after they were bid out.Delay in land acquisition, issues relating to contractors and pending statutory clearances have been identified as main reasons that have held up these projects, sources said.However, the road transport and highways ministry has been able to reduce the number of projects, which are delayed by more than three years, by almost 50% in the past one-and-a-half years - from 152 in April 2024 to 81 in July 2025 - through greater focus on regular monitoring to resolve all pending issues. Officials said even the number of all delayed projects has been reduced by around 16% in first four months of the current financial year due to stricter and regular monitoring.""The target is to reduce the number of delayed projects significantly as these cause cost escalation and deprive people of the desired benefit,"" said an official.TOI has learnt that there is a monthly meeting of all highway building agencies to expedite project execution.Among the major factors impacting the projects, land acquisition is the leading one (28% of cases), followed by issues relating to contractors (19%) and forest clearances (13%). Officials said there is special thrust on completing projects where small works are pending to reduce overall number of delayed projects significantly.Data show while total number of delayed NH projects stood at 690 in April 2024, it went down to 686 in April 2025 and to around 580 by July-end. Over 50% of projects are delayed by up to six months, while more than one-third are delayed by 1-3 years.Officials said the factors delaying project execution also impact new works being bid out. For example, the highway agencies are yet to bid out 276 sanctioned projects worth Rs 1.4 lakh crore. As per the new norm, bids cannot be opened for a project unless the highway building agency has at least 80% of the required land in its possession.","Delay in land acquisition, issues relating to contractors and pending statutory clearances have been identified as main reasons that have held up these projects.

Russia has accused the United States of pushing a ""neocolonial agenda"" after President Donald Trump announced substantial hike in tariffs on the global south. In a sharp rebuke, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the move reflected Washington’s inability to cope with a shifting global order.""Sanctions and restrictions have unfortunately become a defining feature of the current historical period,"" Zakharova said in response to a media query on the US decision to tighten tariffs against countries in the Global South.""Unable to accept the erosion of its dominance in an emerging multipolar international order, Washington continues to pursue a neocolonial agenda, employing politically motivated economic pressure against those who choose an independent course on the international stage.""Zakharova asserted that no sanctions or tariff wars would stop the evolution of the international system.

'Kaan Khol Ke Sun Lo...': Mamata Threatens EC, BJP Over Bengali Harassment, Voter Roll ‘Conspiracy’

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday suspended four officials posted in West Bengal for allegedly sharing login credentials of their elector roll (ER) database with ""unauthorised persons"".Taking note of the grave lapses committed by the officers, the poll body said that action came after Bengal's chief electoral officer informed the ECI ""about the wrongful addition of names in the electoral rolls by the four officers"" in Baruipur Purba.The four officials suspended were posted in the capacity of the electoral registration officer (ERO) and assistant electoral registration officer (AERO), who are responsible for the preparation, revision and correction of the electoral rolls.The Election Commission said that suitable disciplinary proceedings will be initiated against Debottam Dutta Choudhury (ERO), Tathagata Mondal (AERO), Biplab Sarkar (ERO) and Sudipta Das (AERO), adding that FIRs will be lodged against them ""for their actions, which potentially amount to criminal misconduct"".The poll body said that FIR will also be lodged against the casual data entry operator Surojit Halder.A few days ago, the ECI gave the nod to FIRs against two electoral registration officers (EROs) in Bengal for anomalies in the voters' list.The two officers shared their passwords with data entry operators, which allowed the latter to feed 102 bogus voters' data into the EC portal.TOI reported that the EROs of Nandakumar in East Midnapore and Rajarhat-Gopalpur in North 24 Parganas were questioned by EC and were under scrutiny for failing to give a satisfactory reply to the commission.The office of the chief electoral officer sent a report to the EC, indicating that names of non-existent voters were entered directly by data entry operators by using the passwords of the two EROs. The two EROs have admitted to sharing the passwords.In this case, it was found that even booth level officers (BLOs) were not sent to verify the names. The lack of physical verification allowed the electoral rolls to be inflated with bogus voters, sources said. The district electoral officers were then asked to probe the malpractices.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday suspended four officials posted in West Bengal.

'Don't burn relations with strong ally': Nikki Haley slams Trump for threatening India ties over Russian oil; accuses US of giving China 'pass',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/burn-relations-with-strong-ally-nikki-haley-slams-trump-for-threatening-india-ties-over-russian-oil-accuses-us-of-giving-china-pass/articleshow/123123648.cms,"Indian-American Republican leader and former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley

Indian-American Republican leader Nikki Haley criticised President Donald Trump for threatening to increase tariffs on Russian oil imports from India, warning that such a move could damage ties with a key American ally while giving China leniency.In a post on X on Tuesday, Haley took aim at what she sees as an uneven approach from the Trump administration. “India should not be buying oil from Russia. But China, an adversary and the number one buyer of Russian and Iranian oil, got a 90-day tariff pause,” she wrote.“Don’t give China a pass and burn a relationship with a strong ally like India,"" she added.Her remarks came after Trump, in a press briefing Tuesday, threatened to “very substantially” increase tariffs on Indian goods, following the 25% duty imposed just last week. He also rejected India’s reported offer of zero tariffs on American goods, saying, “That’s not good enough, because of what they’re doing with oil.”The White House has pointed to the growing US trade deficit with India as justification for the move, accusing New Delhi of maintaining high tariffs on American goods and limiting market access. India’s continued imports of Russian crude and military hardware have also drawn scrutiny.India is now the largest seaborne buyer of Russian crude oil, importing nearly 1.75 million barrels per day in the first half of 2025, up 1% from the same period last year.While US initially welcomed India's role in helping stabilise global oil supplies, Trump now claims those purchases are helping finance President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.India, however, has remained firm in its stance. India’s ministry of commerce and industry responded to Trump’s announcement by reaffirming that national interest remains the country’s top priority.“The Government attaches the utmost importance to protecting and promoting the welfare of our farmers, entrepreneurs, and MSMEs. The Government will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest, as has been the case with other trade agreements including the latest Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the UK,” the ministry said in a statement.New Delhi has also made it clear that its agriculture and dairy sectors remain off the table in any trade negotiations — a position it has consistently maintained in all prior trade agreements.","Indian-American Republican leader Nikki Haley criticised President Donald Trump for threatening to increase tariffs on Russian oil imports from India.

The list of invitees also includes representatives of minority communities, sports and cultural icons, thought leaders, and entrepreneurs from emerging fields such as Indian knowledge systems and start-ups.The highlight of the centenary year will be a three-day dialogue in Delhi from August 26, led by Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, focusing on the Sangh’s century-long journey, its role in nation-building and its vision for “new horizons.”Bhagwat’s Delhi address will be part of a series of four major events in the run-up to the Vijayadashami centenary on October 2. Similar dialogues are scheduled in Bengaluru in November, Kolkata thereafter, and Mumbai. Each will feature two days of lectures by Bhagwat and a third day devoted to a pre-submitted question-and-answer session. The discussions will cover the Sangh’s experiences over the past century, its core ideas, and its priorities for the coming decades.The Delhi programme will begin at 5.30 pm each day and will also delve into the “Panch Parivartan” (Five Transformations) agenda of the centenary year. Bhagwat is expected to touch on issues such as India shaping its future on indigenous strengths rather than colonial-era benchmarks, unexplored capacities in various fields, and the country’s evolving global role.According to RSS Prachar Pramukh Sunil Ambekar, the invitation list spans around 17 main categories and 138 sub-categories, including social, economic, religious, spiritual, sports, arts, media and intellectual leaders. “Our aim is that the entire country should move forward together on its development journey. We want dialogue with all sections of society,” he said.Ambekar added that while outreach to some foreign missions is underway, certain countries will be excluded. “We are in contact with many embassies, but in the current context Pakistan, will not be invited,” he said.

Panchmiya shared the details of the incident in a post on X, describing it as the most difficult 48 hours of his travel experience.“We had just landed in Barcelona after a heavy week at ETHCC Cannes. It was a chill morning for us,” he wrote. Panchmiya said he stepped outside for a call, leaving his small black bag under the table. “Something I’d done a hundred times on trips like these.” When he returned, the bag was gone.The missing items included his passport, US visa, credit cards, and a large amount of cash. He approached Starbucks staff to check the CCTV footage but was told the police would need to be involved first. “I ran to the Starbucks staff, begged them to show me the CCTV. They couldn’t, said the police had to get involved first,” he said.At the police station, Panchmiya was informed that reviewing the footage would take time. “Police said: ‘It’ll take 15 to 20 days for us to even review the CCTV footage,’” he wrote. With his return flight to India scheduled for Monday and the Indian embassy closed for the weekend, he waited until Monday to seek help.“I walked in as soon as they opened. And I cannot thank them enough, they issued me an emergency certificate (a temporary passport) in just 4 to 5 hours. That same evening, I was back on a flight to India,” he wrote.Now back in India, Panchmiya is reapplying for his passport and visas. He said he shared the experience to inform others who may find themselves in a similar situation while travelling.“If you travel often, especially around Europe, this can happen to anyone. Even if you’re cautious. Even if you’re ‘experienced,’” he wrote.Offering guidance, Panchmiya said, “Don’t panic. Immediately go to the nearest police station. File a report. Walk into your embassy in person. Don’t just email or call. Explain everything clearly.” He added, “Ask for an emergency certificate. If your flight is close, they can issue one in hours.”Reflecting on the situation, he noted, “I’ve never had my passport stolen before. But now I’ve seen firsthand how quickly things can flip. And also, how supportive the Indian embassy and the Web3 community around me can be in tough times.”He concluded the post by stating that he is now safe at home and shared the story in the hope that it helps others navigate a similar situation.","Ayush Panchmiya lost his passport, US visa, credit cards, and cash while in Barcelona, Spain.

India mulls new pilot training system as air traffic booms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-mulls-new-pilot-training-system-as-air-traffic-booms/articleshow/123128116.cms,"NEW DELHI: India is considering revamping pilot training by gradually moving away from the current system, where a student has to first earn a commercial pilot licence (CPL) and then do type rating separately for a specific aircraft, to a unified ""multi-crew pilot licence"" (MPL) system.Directorate General of Civil Aviation will hold a meeting with stakeholders on the issue on Wednesday. If approved, both systems will co-exist, and operators will have the flexibility to choose what best meets their requirements of safety and operational efficiency.This is the second big change India is contemplating in this field, after proposing to make students who from Class 12 arts and commerce streams eligible to pursue CPL - a field reserved for science students with physics and maths in 12th since mid-1990s. As the fastest growing aviation market globally, govt is clearly keen to take steps to meet Indian carriers' requirement for pilots in coming years.At the moment, cadet pilots have to first do CPL that involves, among other things, flying training aircraft for 200 hours. They then need to do simulator-based type rating for specific aircraft like Airbus A320 or Boeing 737.MPL will require them to fly a small training plane for about 70 hours.Then they will do simulator training for 140 to 160 hours. Subsequently, airlines will induct them as trainees on that type of aircraft. Approved by International Civil Aviation Organisation, MPL has been adopted by over 50 airlines globally, like Lufthansa, Etihad, flyDubai and Singapore Airlines.""We will evaluate both the systems and take a considered view on what is best in terms of ensuring high training standards and meeting airline requirements. MPL was considered by us in the past too. There has again been a request to consider the same and that is being done,"" said senior govt officials. If approved, MPL will be introduced gradually over 2-3 years and CPL will continue to exist for non-airline students.An integrated programme, MPL ""lays emphasis on developing key competencies that are essential to safely operate modern commercial aircraft. It can be tailored to specific aircraft type and the operational philosophy of airlines which will ensure a steady stream of pilots"", said a senior pilot.""MPL should have been adopted several years ago to meet India's growing aviation needs... MPL aligns better with modern airline operational realities than the current CPL system which is outdated for a fast-developing aviation sector. India needs 2,000-plus new pilots annually over the next decade,"" said another captain.Opposing MPL, a senior captain said: ""Our regulatory system lacks necessary robustness to adequately oversee and enforce MPL program standards consistently.""","India is considering revamping pilot training by gradually moving away from the current system.

They also violated the policy of data security by sharing their login credentials for the electoral roll database with unauthorised persons. EC has ordered lodging of an FIR against casual data entry operator Surojit Halder.Significantly, the CEO has reported to EC similar lapses by other West Bengal officials involved in preparation, revision and correction of the electoral roll. Action against these erring officers would follow, said an EC source.The rush on part of certain EROs and AEROs in West Bengal to arbitrarily add names to the state's roll comes even as EC prepares to order special intensive revision of its roll, on the lines of the exercise in Bihar. A source indicated that the hurry to add electors - many suspected to be Bangladeshi settlers - ahead of assembly polls next year may be an effort to ensure their names are on the roll before the enumeration phase of SIR gets underway.As per Section 32(1) of the R P Act, 1950, any ERO or assistant ERO guilty of any act or omission in breach of official duty, shall be punishable with a minimum jail term of three months, which can extend to two years with fine.","Election Commission orders immediate suspension of EROs of Baruipur Purba assembly constituency (AC) and Moyna AC.

"Central green nod not needed for constructions of 20,000-150,000 sqm",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/central-green-nod-not-needed-for-constructions-of-20000-150000-sqm/articleshow/123127694.cms,"Development activities can't be stalled altogether, says SC

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Tuesday reactivated stalled construction activities related to housing, industrial sheds, schools, colleges, universities and hostels with covered area between 20,000 and 1,50,000 square metres by ruling that these can go ahead with the state environmental authority's nod, exempting them from the rigours of securing environmental clearance from the Centre.On Feb 24, SC had ex parte stayed the Jan 29 central notification on environmental clearance norms for building and construction projects on a plea by NGO Vanashakti, which alleged that dilutions in norms would damage nature and forests. This had stalled thousands of projects - educational, industrial and national - across the country.A bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran upheld the environment ministry's notification and said no central environmental nod would be required for these categories of constructions.SC quoted additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, who said the Centre did not have wherewithal to carry out environment scrutiny of projects in states.However, the bench struck down total exemption from environmental scrutiny to industrial sheds, schools, colleges, universities and hostels in the Jan 29 notification of the environment and forest ministry. Supreme Court said these could be constructed after clearance from the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA).Importantly, the bench resolved an ambiguity over which authority - State or Centre - should grant clearance to projects located in eco-sensitive areas, wildlife protected areas, critically and severely polluted areas (CPA/SPA) and those near inter-state boundaries. SC upheld the notification granting the power to the state.Appearing for Godrej's real estate arm, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said the regime exempting such projects from central nod has been in place since 2006 and that the Jan 29 notification was introducing no new concept.He was supported by senior advocate Atmaram Nadkarni, who appeared for CREDAI, the apex body of private real estate developers.CJI Gavai and Justice Chandran said, ""No country can progress without development. Duty to protect the environment and ecology is paramount, but development activities cannot be stalled altogether.""Bhati informed the bench that because of the ex parte stay granted by the SC bench led by Justice A S Oka on Feb 24, thousands of building construction projects across the country in the educational and industrial sector have been stalled and applications seeking clearance are piling up before SEIAA, with Maharashtra alone having more than 700 such pending applications.When the bench asked NGO Vanashakti's counsel Gopal Sankaranarayanan why SEIAA be not permitted to give clearance to such projects, the counsel said it would dilute the stringent environment protection regime for constructing huge projects with covered areas of nearly 2 lakh to 15 lakh square feet. It should be subjected to environmental clearance from the Centre, he further said. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said that environmental impact assessment authorities at the central and state levels have similar expertise and pointed out the qualifications of members comprising the two authorities.","Construction activities related to housing, industrial sheds, schools, colleges, universities and hostels with covered area between 20,000 and 1,50,000 square metres can go ahead with state environmental authority's nod.

"'One of the worst orders': In a 1st, SC bars HC judge from hearing criminal cases",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-of-the-worst-orders-in-a-1st-sc-bars-hc-judge-from-hearing-criminal-cases/articleshow/123127665.cms,"SC: Passing of such absurd & erroneous orders unpardonable

NEW DELHI: Enraged by what it termed ""one of the worst and most erroneous orders we have come across"", Supreme Court has pulled up Allahabad HC's Justice Prashant Kumar for allowing criminal proceedings in a civil dispute case. Questioning Kumar's competence in deciding criminal cases, SC, in an unprecedented order, directed he shouldn't be given any criminal case for adjudication till he retires, and must be made to sit with a seasoned judge of the HC in a division bench.""The judge has not only cut a sorry figure for himself but has made a mockery of justice. We are at our wits' end to understand what's wrong with judiciary at the level of HC,"" Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said.SC said at times ""we are left wondering whether such orders are passed on some extraneous considerations or it is sheer ignorance of law. Whatever it be, passing of such absurd and erroneous orders is unpardonable"". It said the erroneous order was not an exception as Justice Kumar had passed similarly unpardonable ones over a period of time, which left them with no option but to take the extreme step.The case pertains to sale of goods and payment between two businessmen.The seller had delivered goods worth Rs 52.34 lakh out of which he was paid Rs 47.75 lakh. As the balance amount was not paid, he lodged a criminal case, leading to the other businessman to move HC for quashing the case.While allowing criminal proceedings in the case, a single bench of Justice Kumar justified his decision, saying that the complainant would not be in a position to pursue the civil litigation as it will take years and he will have to put more money to pursue the litigation. ""To be more precise, it would seem like good money chasing bad money. If this court allows the matter to be referred to civil court on account of civil dispute between the parties, it would amount to travesty of justice and O.P. no.2 (complainant) would suffer irreparable loss and he might even not be in a position to emerge from the financial constraints to pursue the matter,"" he had said.Expressing shock over the stand taken by the judge the SC bench said, ""Is it the understanding of the high court that ultimately if the accused is convicted, the trial court would award him the balance amount? The observations recorded... are shocking. It is an extremely sad day for one and all to read the observations... It was expected of the high court to know the well-settled position of law that in cases of civil dispute a complainant cannot be permitted to resort to criminal proceedings as the same would amount to abuse of process of law.""It was expected of the HC to understand the nature of the allegations levelled in the complaint. In substance the HC has said in so many words that the criminal proceedings instituted by the complainant in a case of pure civil dispute is justified because it may take considerable time for the complainant to recover the balance amount by preferring a civil suit,"" it said.The bench quashed the order and directed that the case be reconsidered by the HC but by another judge.""The chief justice of the high court shall immediately withdraw the present criminal determination from the judge concerned. The chief justice shall make the judge concerned sit in a division bench with a seasoned senior judge of the HC. We further direct that the judge concerned shall not be assigned any criminal determination, till he demits office. If at all he is to be made to sit as a single judge, he shall not be assigned any criminal determination,"" the apex court said.","Supreme Court pulls up Allahabad HC's Justice Prashant Kumar for allowing criminal proceedings in a civil dispute case.

The bench accepted the plea of Supreme Court Advocates On Record Association president Vipin Nair who submitted that BCI should first hold an inquiry on the alleged role of lawyers and thereafter police could be roped in for further investigation if some outsider was involved.In this murky case, a litigant managed to get a favourable order from the SC after a 'ghost' opponent propped up in court proceedings who told the court that he had compromised with the petitioner in a land dispute, which became the basis for the top court to quash orders passed by a Muzaffarpur trial court and Patna HC against the litigant.Five months later, the real opponent appeared and told the court that he had neither compromised with the petitioner nor engaged any lawyer to represent him before the SC. Both the parties are blaming each other for playing with the court and, interestingly, both of them pressed for police investigation.The SC has already recalled its order which was passed on the basis of the alleged fake compromise.","The Bar Council of India has been given eight weeks to look into the controversy and file a report.

""Such discussions are welcome but the opposition failed to see the sentiments of 140 crore Indians. They must now regret demanding this debate,"" sources quoted him as saying at NDA parliamentary party meeting. They failed to read nation's pulse and ended up scoring a self goal, he further said, according to sources.Modi recalled that he had referred to the opposition's failure to grasp the national achievement right at the outset of his speech during the debate. ""Today, I stand to present India's perspective and hold a mirror to those who fail to see it,"" sources quoted him as saying.Sources said Modi urged NDA leaders to amplify the collective voice of a ""New India,"" which has resolutely responded to terrorists and their patrons.His remarks drew applause from NDA MPs, who greeted him with chants of ""Har Har Mahadev"". After the meeting - the first during Parliament's monsoon session - NDA leaders marched from the Balayogi Auditorium to the new Parliament building, showcasing unity. Meanwhile, opposition MPs protested near the Gandhi statue, demanding a discussion on the revision of electoral rolls in Bihar.Modi emphasised the NDA's identity as a natural and organic alliance, reflecting on its successes since its founding in 1998 and its potential for future achievements. At the NDA meeting - the second since the govt's formation in June 2024 -Modi was felicitated for his ""exceptional leadership"" in guiding India's response to Pahalgam terror attack.Modi urged MPs to participate enthusiastically in upcoming events like the Tiranga Yatra, held annually before Independence Day, and National Space Day on Aug 23. He highlighted historical significance of Aug 5, marking the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, which ended special rights for J&K, and the groundbreaking ceremony of the Ram temple in Ayodhya in 2020.","Modi: Opposition failed to see the sentiments of 140 crore Indians.

The award had refuted China's expansive claims on SCS waters in its dispute with Manila. In 2023, India had for the first time explicitly called upon China to abide by the ruling and followed it up with a similar assertion in a joint statement with Quad a year later.Among other key takeaways from the meeting was adoption of terms of reference for negotiations for a preferential trade agreement and signing of an agreement for mutual legal assistance in criminal matters. The leaders also adopted a plan of action (2025-2029) for implementation of the strategic partnership. India also announced a gratis e-tourist visa facility for Filipino nationals for a period of one year.Modi also thanked Marcos, who has been looking to ramp up defence and security cooperation with countries like India and Japan amid increasing tensions with China in the SCS, for a strong condemnation of the Pahalgam terrorist attack.""As maritime nations, maritime cooperation between the two countries is both natural and necessary. Today, when the President is in India, three ships of the Indian Navy are participating in a naval exercise in the Philippines for the first time. India's hydrography ship is also involved in this,"" Modi said, adding that India and Philippines are friends by choice, and partners by destiny.The leaders called for expeditious conclusion of negotiations for the preferential trade agreement (PTA) for promotion of mutual trade and Manila expressed interest in procuring more defence equipment from India, apart from the BrahMos missile defence systems India is already supplying to it. For India, helping Manila build up its defence capabilities is also a way of getting back at Beijing, a major defence supplier to Pakistan.The visit by Marcos, who backed interoperability between the armed forces of the two countries, coincided with India's first joint patrol of the SCS with the Philippines. The PLA accused the Philippines of ""rallying an external country to interfere in the SCS by organising so-called joint patrols which undermine regional peace and stability"". It did not name India.The visit by Marcos also took place ahead of a likely visit to China by Modi later this month for the SCO summit. Talks are also on for a possible visit by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi to India this month.","The two sides signed 13 agreements and MoUs, which included finalisation of terms of reference for cooperation between all three wings of the armed forces. The leaders also adopted a plan of action (2025-2029) for implementation of the strategic partnership.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123126862,imgsize-1612099,width-400,resizemode-4/123126862.jpg"

Why This Deal Could Work for the Los Angeles Lakers

San Antonio Spurs’ Perspective

Theappear to be fully invested in building around Luka Doncic , signaling a significant shift in the franchise’s priorities. According to recent reports, the team is no longer tailoring its plans around. While relations between LeBron and the Lakers are calm for now, the possibility of a trade request remains in the background.LeBron’s large contract and no-trade clause make moving him a complicated process, but that hasn’t stopped trade scenarios from circulating. One of the more intriguing proposals comes from Bleacher Report’s Andy Bailey, who has outlined a deal that would send both LeBron and his son, Bronny James, to a Western Conference rival.Bailey’s hypothetical trade involves the San Antonio Spurs acquiring the father-son duo in exchange for two young scorers and future draft considerations.Pick swaps acquired by the Spurs from Sacramento in the DeMar DeRozan trade.While fans might expect a superstar return for LeBron James , this package offers a different kind of value.Key Benefits for the Los Angeles Lakers • Two reliable young scorers: Both Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson have proven they can average close to 20 points per game.• Versatile skillsets: Neither is expected to become a franchise star, but both can contribute in multiple roles on a contending team.• Support for Luka Doncic: Role players who can defend and score efficiently are crucial in the Lakers’ new era.• Future flexibility: The draft pick swaps give the team additional assets without locking them into expensive veteran contracts.As Bailey notes, “This might not be the type of LeBron trade return that some Lakers are hoping for, [but] getting an aging superstar off the team for two solid players and draft capital might be the Los Angeles Lakers’ best option moving forward.”Also read: New York Knicks Reportedly Keeping a Close Watch on Giannis Antetokounmpo’s Situation in the Milwaukee Bucks For the Spurs, the move would bring in a global icon in LeBron James, boosting both on-court performance and marketability.

The deadly 2023 implosion of the Titan submersible, which killed all five people on board during a dive to the Titanic wreck, was a “preventable” tragedy, according to a new report released Tuesday by the US Coast Guard.The Titan, owned and operated by Washington-based private company OceanGate, imploded during a deep-sea expedition in the North Atlantic. All five people on board were killed, including Stockton Rush, OceanGate’s CEO and the operator of the submersible. The incident triggered a massive search and rescue effort off the coast of Canada that drew global attention, but there were no survivors.The Coast Guard convened its highest level of investigation, a Marine Board of Investigation, in the aftermath of the disaster. Their final report pointed to significant failures in nearly every area of the Titan’s operation, from its design to its day-to-day oversight, reported PBS News.Investigators found that the submersible’s design, certification, maintenance, and inspection processes were all inadequate. A Coast Guard statement further cited a “toxic workplace culture” within OceanGate and noted that the company’s mission was hindered by a lack of both domestic and international regulatory frameworks for submersible operations.“There is a need for stronger oversight and clear options for operators who are exploring new concepts outside of the existing regulatory framework,” said Jason Neubauer, of the Marine Board of Investigation as quoted by PBS News. “The findings will help prevent future tragedies.”In the two years since the implosion, multiple OceanGate employees have come forward to support the Coast Guard’s findings, describing unsafe practices and internal dysfunction at the company.The Titan disaster has since led to lawsuits and mounting pressure for tighter regulation of the rapidly growing private deep-sea expedition industry.","The Titan submersible imploded during a deep-sea expedition in 2023, killing all five people on board.

India’s stand on Russia crude oil trade







US President Donald Trump on Tuesday hinted at tariff actions against countries continuing to import energy from Russia, including India and China, ""in a fairly short period of time. ""While stopping short of confirming a 100% tariff, Trump said such measures were under serious consideration.""I never said a percentage, but we'll be doing quite a bit of that. We'll see what happens over the next fairly short period of time,"" Trump said at a White House press conference.""We have a meeting with Russia tomorrow. We're going to see what happens,"" he added.This comes after Trump imposed a 25% tariff and penalty on India for peocuring crude oil from Russia.On Tuesday, Trump had said that he would ‘very substantially’ raise the tariff rate on India. In an interview with CNBC, Trump said, “They're fuelling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, then I'm not going to be happy.""""India has not been a good trading partner, because they do a lot of business with us, but we don't do business with them. So we settled on 25%, but I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they're buying Russian oil,"" he had said in the interview.Trump had dismissed India's proposal of zero tariffs on American imports, expressing disapproval of India's role in the Ukrainian conflict through its oil trade with Russia.In the interview, Trump had criticised India's existing tariff structure as very high. ""Now, I will say this, India went from the highest tariffs ever. They will give us zero tariffs, and they're going to let us go in. But that's not good enough, because of what they're doing with oil — not good.""The US has been pressuring India to stop all crude oil trade with Russia, with the Donald Trump administration alleging that it amounts to India ‘financing’ Russia’s war against Ukraine.The foreign ministry has responded to Trump’s threats of penalties and higher tariffs by calling out the double standards and hypocrisy of the US and European Union.""It is revealing that the very nations criticising India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia (despite the Ukraine war),"" read the MEA statement issued late on Monday.“...the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” the statement concluded.Despite Western pressure to reduce ties with Russia over the Ukraine conflict, India has maintained its position, citing historical relationships and economic necessities.","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday hinted at tariff actions against countries continuing to import energy from Russia, including India and China.

The secret of her longevity

Community and family

A national Inspiration





Japan, who is known for its supercentenarians, has discovered a fresh longevity icon. At 114 years old, Shigeko Kagawa has earned the distinction of becoming Japan's oldest living person after her predecessor Miyoko Hiroyasu recently passed away. So, what is the secret to Shigeko Kagawa's longevity? We find out. Take a look...Shigeko Kagawa was born on 28 May 1911, during a period when Japan experienced profound changes. After finishing her studies at Osaka Women’s Medical College (now Kansai Medical University), she pursued medical practice during an era when women doctors remained scarce. Her life experience combined both challenges and optimism, which developed into her dedication to serve her community and deliver healthcare to others.Ms. Kagawa kickstarted her practice during her twenties, before joining the hospital staff in Osaka during World War II. She sadly remembers the complete destruction of her hometown through air raids and the tragic death of numerous people.She managed her family clinic after the war, while performing the duties of an obstetrician and gynecologist. She always remained on stand by, so she could rush to assist expectant mothers whenever they needed help with emergencies and difficult deliveries throughout the night.Ms. Kagawa dedicated herself to her clinic and community service, until age 86 when she finally retired.Ms. Kagawa chose not to slow down post retirement. In 2021 at 109 years old, Ms. Kagawa achieved the world record as the oldest Olympic torchbearer when she took part in the Tokyo Torch Relay. Through her remarkable achievement, the world media paid attention to her, while motivating everyone regardless of age. Ms. Kagawa finished her section of the relay while seated in a wheelchair, but her enthusiastic smile along with her unwavering determination made her the center of attention.Ms. Kagawa chose to live with her family in Yamatokoriyama Nara Prefecture after her retirement from her home. Every day she follows a standard schedule that includes reading newspapers, and staying informed about news, as well as practicing calligraphy and spending two days at daycare per week. Her daily routine includes consuming three small portions of nutritious food, while keeping her mind active.When asked about her secret to living such a long life, Ms. Kagawa offers a humble and lighthearted answer: “I don’t have any. I just play every day. My energy is my greatest asset. I go wherever I please while eating my preferred foods and pursuing my preferred activities. I’m free and independent”.Her energy comes from her active lifestyle which includes extensive walking, which she practiced before the car became widespread. The doctor used to walk extensively to visit patients since there were no modern cars like today. This practice could have contributed to her robust health and wellness. She bases her approach on these routines, while stressing that older adults need to stay involved while keeping their minds active and open to fresh encounters.The love of her family members serves as the foundation for Ms. Kagawa's happiness. She receives continuous joy through the combination of home support and her friendships with both former patients, and her existing social network. Local officials have honored her outstanding life achievements through official recognition for her dedicated service to the community. Many people find inspiration in her story, which encourages everyone to find value in the present moments regardless of their age.Also See: Longevity: Doing THIS for just one minute everyday can help with longevity! Japan is known for its longevity, with 36 million people aged 65 or older making up 29% of the nation's total population, while the country counts 95,119 centenarians as of September 2024. The statistics about Shigeko Kagawa represent more than numbers, since they symbolise hope and new possibilities. Her energetic spirit along with her humorous nature and humble personality shows us that meaningful work combined with physical activity, mental acuity, and energetic heart spirit might represent the greatest secrets of all.","Shigeko Kagawa is Japan's oldest living person at 114 years old.

BENGALURU: Show-cause notices issued by BBMP to those who have obtained e-khatas has left property owners fuming.Questioning the very system that allows gross misappropriations to fester and lets the big fish slip through, while tightening the noose around commoners, many now want Bengaluru district in-charge minister D K Shivakumar to intervene and end their harassment.""The bureaucrats piloting the e-khata project and deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar should have some clarity on this. Why should we suffer and be forced to prove our credentials when they cannot streamline the system? Why hand out notices after issuing e-khatas, when the discrepancies in property tax declarations could have been pointed out earlier? This is nothing but harassment,"" some of the affected property owners said after they were slapped with notices.Worst affected are residents of Shantinagar assembly constituency, where the e-khata system was first introduced before its rollout in other parts of the city.""A notice has been issued demanding tax for the car parking slot in my apartment. What is weird is that BBMP has unilaterally decided the dimensions of the parking lot, without even cross-checking documents or physically inspecting the apartment. Now, we are left with two options: Either pay the amount and move on; or counter the BBMP's claim through a cumbersome legal and bureaucratic maze,"" said Richmond Town resident Rajat Rao.Highlighting gross anomalies in the entire process, Vijay Kumar, a Yelahanka resident, said: ""BBMP officials themselves have advised us to under-report property sizes during e-khata registration. When I bought my flat, which is 1,700 sq ft, the revenue staff suggested I disclose just 1,500 sq ft. When I questioned it, they told me not to worry and hinted at a Rs 500 bribe. Now I've got a notice. Who is responsible here?""He added: ""When I raised the issue, the official suggested I appeal with BBBMP's e-court. Now this is another sham. I am supposed to appeal for something that I'm not even responsible for, but has been wrongly accused of.""Another citizen, Sudhindra Halappa Gowda, said: ""While we are being tortured so much, what about all the bureaucrats and politicians who are not even paying taxes? They are not being penalised. Why is the middle-class suffering?""The issue appears to have been triggered by a software check introduced recently. BBMP's new system, Kauvery, automatically flagged any mismatch in property area details between e-khata and EPID.A senior BBMP official, though, defended the system, saying: ""We don't manually input anything. The software picks up discrepancies. If people have entered wrong details in their e-khatas, how are we to blame?""He added: ""Car parking area is never explicitly mentioned in the sale deed in terms of size — only the super built-up area is. Citizens have ignored this all along, but parking space is also a property and tax is due on it.""BBMP's standCommenting on the current impasse, Munish Moudgil, the BBMP special commissioner (revenue), said: ""We have issued notices only in case of properties where the variation is more than 5%. For those under 5%, we didn't intend to send any alerts.""However, due to a technical glitch on the part of NIC, mass emails were sent out even to those who were not at fault. These affected residents can appeal, and we will resolve the issue promptly.""Yet, the question that taxpayers are raising is that why should they be wasting their time for someone else's inefficiency?""","Show-cause notices issued by BBMP to those who have obtained e-khatas has left property owners fuming.

Tamil Nadu elections: Can Vijay be the next MGR?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-elections-can-vijay-be-the-next-mgr/articleshow/123099144.cms,"TVK believes AIADMK, having lost 10 elections since 2017, cannot defeat DMK, and hence the battle is between DMK and Vijay's TVK





A huge poster of actor Vijay stares down from the wall. A digital signboard flashes: 285 days, 3 hours, 43 minutes and 46 seconds, a countdown to the 2026 assembly election in Tamil Nadu . Scores of people sit glued to screens, fingers flying over keyboards, some others are on mobile phones trying to reach voters in remote hamlets. The Tamizhaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) war room in Chennai is fully activated.Membership drives, training programmes for booth agents, surveys and strengthening of its IT wing mark the priorities of TVK. Insiders say surveys show TVK is racing ahead of AIA DMK and closing in on DMK. While comparisons are unfair, Vijay has set his party the ambitious goal of repeating the MGR phenomenon: winning the assembly election on its own on its debut (the matinee idol-led-AIADMK won 144 of the 200 seats it contested in 1977).“These people,” says TVK election management general secretary Aadhav Arjuna, about the team, “have handled more than five elections in multiple states.” He and party general secretary N Anand oversee the strategies. “We have appointed 69,400 booth agents and their four-member teams and assigned them to every election booth in the 234 assembly constituencies,” says Aaadhav. One assembly constituency has around 275 booths with a booth assigned for about 250 families.Two election managers handle the war room and campaign strategy, besides analysing voter mood, and tracking issues and opponents’ activities. “It is a 24x7 job. There is no time for anything else,” says one of the two managers who don’t want to be named. “Booth agents go to every house taking the message of the party and the leader to people and listen to their problems,” he says. They project Vijay as ‘Makkal virumbum mudhalvar vetpalar’ (The CM candidate people yearn for). “We’ve completed training sessions for 120 party district secretaries,” says Aadhav. TVK recently launched the app ‘MY TVK’, for digital enrolment of members; it claims to have added 2.5 crore members. “Our leader can directly access the 2.9 lakh office bearers,” he says.“MGR started his party not based on alliance, but on his party cadre and people. People wanted change. It is a similar scenario now. TVK’s will be an honest govt, equality-based administration with women empowerment and support for minorities,” says Aadhav.The party is gearing up for the Aug 25 ‘Madurai Maanadu’. “After that, the leader outreach programme will begin. Before Dec, there will be a dramatic change in TN politics,” says Aadhav, alleging corruption under M K Stalin’s regime.Having spurned advances from AIADMK and BJP, TVK is critical of both. “After J Jayalalithaa’s death, AIADMK surrendered to Narendra Modi for self-interest. Cadres, supporters and people are upset. Their only hope is Vijay, who is against family and corruption,” says Aadhav.Vijay’s political strategist Jhon Arokiasamy calls TVK the largest party in the state. “The party will either contest all the seats on its own or, after the conference and TN tour, consider alliances,” he says. Arokiasamy says TVK is not interested in AIADMK or BJP. “When you oppose divisive politics and corruption, you have to be against DMK and AIADMK. And BJP is an ideological rival,” he says.TVK believes AIADMK, having lost 10 elections since 2017, cannot defeat DMK, and hence the battle is between DMK and TVK. “Palaniswami is not a universally accepted leader within and outside the party. And TVK is the new force,” says Arokiasamy.During earlier interactions with AIDMK, the actor had demanded that he be projected as the CM face, and his party would contest half the seats. Party general secretary Anand says Vijay will take the final decision on alliance. “Whatever be his decision, we will win the election, and he will be CM. Whoever accepts him as the CM candidate will be accepted in our alliance,” he says.","Tamizhaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) war room in Chennai is fully activated.

Case 2: Rs 12.5 lakh lost in fraudulent surrogacy deal



Case 3: NRI couple loses Rs 19 lakh

Case 4: Nalgonda couple alleges Rs 11 lakh fraud





HYDERABAD: Gopalapuram police have registered five new cases against the head of Srushti Fertility Clinic Dr Athaluri Namratha alias Pachipala Namratha, and others based on complaints lodged by five sets of victims.While in one case a couple alleged that the doctor handed them a baby whose DNA did not match theirs, three other couples accused the clinic of adopting dubious methods. They claimed that they had already paid the money — anywhere from Rs 12.5 lakh to Rs 19 lakh — and even deposited their biological samples when they grew suspicious about the operations of Dr Namratha and her clinic.The frauds occurred between 2019 and 2025. Cops are yet to ascertain details of the fifth case.A woman from Hyderabad, requesting anonymity, alleged that she and her husband had approached Universal Srushti Fertility & Research Centre in July 2024 for infertility treatment. Dr Namratha advised gestational surrogacy using the couple's own genetic material and assured them that all legal formalities would be handled by them.The couple paid Rs 16.5 lakh for hormone therapy, laboratory work, and surrogate expenses.Their egg and sperm samples were collected at the clinic's Visakhapatnam branch on September 18, 2024. A baby girl was delivered via caesarean section on June 16, 2025, at a Visakhapatnam-based hospital. ""Initially, we were told by the doctors that the baby was healthy, but they later shifted her to the NICU, terming her as late pre-term,"" the woman said. The couple's suspicions arose after Srushti staff refused to divulge the surrogate mother's details. Their fears deepened after they were unable to observe any facial resemblance with the baby, which prompted them to go for an independent DNA test. ""The results, which came out on July 12, confirmed that neither of us was biologically related to the child,"" the complainant alleged.When confronted on July 22, Dr Namratha allegedly admitted that donor gametes were mistakenly used, and asked the couple to return the infant so the clinic could seek govt adoption clearance and repeat the procedure with their samples. The parents refused and approached the police, citing immense emotional trauma and legal uncertainty over the child's status. It is learnt that the child is still in the custody of the couple. The police have registered a case against Dr Namratha, Dr Vidyulatha, Kalyani, Sheshagiri, and Srinivasa Reddy under sections 61 (2), 316 (2), 318(4), 111, 335, 336, 340 BNS & Sections 38, 39, and 40 of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021.Another couple from the city approached police alleging they were duped of Rs 12.5 lakh by Dr Namratha and others through a fraudulent surrogacy deal.The husband, a 34-year-old private employee from the city, alleged that he and his wife approached Dr Namratha in Nov 2024 for a surrogate baby. Between April and May 2025, the couple paid Rs 10 lakh for tests and collection of ‘biological samples' at the Secunderabad branch. On June 26, Dr Namratha allegedly informed them that the ""baby is ready,"" indicating successful initiation of surrogacy, and collected Rs 2.5 lakh more. Though Dr Namratha assured that the baby would be delivered on February 3, 2026, the couple became suspicious when the hospital repeatedly refused to reveal the surrogate's identity, produce consent forms, or show proof of court permission, and decided to approach the police.A case was registered against Dr Namratha, her associates, Chenna Rao, and Sureka under relevant sections of BNS & the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021.A US-based NRI couple who approached Universal Srushti Fertility and Research Centre in December 2019 for infertility treatment allegedly lost Rs 19 lakh to the accused. The husband, a 49-year-old software professional, and his wife approached Dr Namratha who, quoting a high success rate, charged Rs 7 lakh in cash and collected the couple's biological samples. After an unsuccessful embryo transfer, the couple returned to the USA. In January 2020, Dr Namratha advised the couple to opt for a surrogacy procedure costing Rs 25 lakh. The complainant's brother paid Rs 12 lakh in cash as an initial instalment.""The clinic provided no documents about medical procedures or statutory clearances. Due to Covid-19, I could not personally meet the doctor, and when I reached the fertility centre on Sunday, I came to know about the recent case against Dr Namratha,"" the complainant alleged. A case was registered against Dr Namratha under relevant sections of the BNS.A couple from Nalgonda alleged that Dr Namratha and her associates duped them of Rs 11 lakh with a false assurance of providing them with a child through a surrogacy procedure.The 49-year-old man and his wife first approached Universal Srushti Fertility Centre in June 2024 after unsuccessful IVF treatment attempts.

Tesla’s defense: distracted driving

Implications for Tesla’s Autopilot safety record



Broader consequences for Tesla’s legal exposure





A Florida jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages to the family of a 22-year-old woman who died in a 2019 crash involving a Model S sedan equipped with Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance technology. The case, centered around allegations that Tesla’s Autopilot system failed to prevent the fatal collision, marks one of the largest verdicts ever against the electric vehicle giant. While Tesla argued that driver behavior caused the accident, the jury found the company partly liable for the death, amplifying concerns about the safety of Tesla’s semi-autonomous driving technology.In April 2019, George McGee was driving a 2019 Tesla Model S near Key Largo, Florida, with Autopilot engaged. McGee dropped his phone and bent down to retrieve it, diverting attention from the road. The vehicle failed to detect a parked Chevrolet Tahoe at an intersection, and McGee did not brake or steer away. The Tesla struck a couple standing nearby—22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon, who died, and her boyfriend Dillon Angulo, who suffered severe injuries.The plaintiff’s attorneys contended that Tesla’s Autopilot was defective, focusing on its inability to detect stationary vehicles at intersections and its design limitations for controlled-access highways only.Tesla’s promotion of Autopilot as highly capable, without adequate warnings about these limits, was a critical issue.Tesla maintained that the crash was primarily the result of driver distraction and error. McGee admitted to looking for his dropped phone moments before the collision and was traveling at approximately 62 mph in a 45 mph zone. Tesla emphasized that no vehicle could have avoided the accident under those conditions and stated that their cars meet all required safety standards.This verdict arrives amidst growing scrutiny of Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) technologies. Critics argue the ruling highlights real safety risks associated with Tesla’s autonomous driving systems, especially outside limited highway conditions. The company’s liability in this high-profile case may lead to heightened regulatory attention and encourage further litigation related to its driver assistance technology.The $243 million verdict includes $200 million in punitive damages and $43 million in compensatory damages, with Tesla found 33% responsible for the incident. The driver was found 67% liable but is not financially responsible as he was not a defendant. Legal experts see this verdict as a pivotal precedent regarding automaker accountability for semi-autonomous driving system failures. Tesla has announced plans to appeal the decision.",A Florida jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages to the family of a 22-year-old woman who died in a 2019 crash.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shifted from being a futuristic concept to a rapidly evolving reality impacting every industry. With advanced machine learning models, automation systems, and AI-powered decision-making tools, tasks once performed by humans are now handled with speed and precision by algorithms. This has triggered global concern about potential job losses. Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has admitted that automation will reduce certain jobs within the company. Similarly, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI will impact “everybody’s jobs” in some capacity, although he expects it to also create new opportunities. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicts the most dramatic changes will occur within the next five to ten years, transforming entire job markets.When asked about the possibility of artificial general intelligence (AGI) performing all human tasks, DeepMind CEO Hassabis highlighted an important distinction:AI could analyse medical data, scans, and test results faster and more accurately than human doctors, potentially replacing or assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning.Nurses, however, provide emotional support, physical care, and human empathy that technology can’t replicate. A robotic nurse may be efficient but lacks the ability to emotionally connect with patients, a critical part of caregiving.This example shows that while AI in healthcare may replace certain intellectual tasks, professions relying on emotional intelligence will remain human-centered. This statement from Hassabis offers one of the clearest examples of how AI will alter specific professions, but not eliminate the need for human empathy and interpersonal care.According to Hassabis, the workplace of the future will integrate humans and AI collaboratively. AI will handle data-heavy, repetitive, and analytical processes, allowing humans to focus on creative problem-solving, emotional interaction, and leadership roles. This shift will require governments and industries to invest heavily in reskilling programs to prepare workers for AI-driven environments, emphasizing lifelong learning, adaptive skills, ethical AI usage, and the development of new interdisciplinary roles bridging technology, creativity, and human-centric decision-making.Andy Jassy’s remarks highlight a future where AI automation tools replace repetitive and operational tasks. Amazon already relies on robotics and intelligent software to manage logistics, inventory, and supply chain processes. Jassy believes that as these technologies mature, fewer human workers will be required for jobs like order processing and warehouse management. However, he noted that the shift doesn’t necessarily mean fewer opportunities overall but rather a need for upskilling and reskilling so employees can transition into more technology-driven roles.Jensen Huang, whose company Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) powering modern AI systems, offered a candid view on AI’s impact:“Everybody’s jobs will be affected. Some jobs will be lost. Many jobs will be created.” Huang believes AI’s productivity gains will help industries perform tasks faster and cheaper, which may reduce demand for certain roles but open new ones focused on AI development, data analysis, and advanced engineering. He expressed hope that economic growth from AI adoption will ultimately “lift society” rather than harm it.Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind and a key architect of advanced AI systems, views AI as an additive rather than purely disruptive technology. He explained that as AI capabilities expand, new job categories will emerge—roles that use AI to enhance human output rather than replace it entirely. Historically, technological revolutions (like industrial machines or computers) displaced certain jobs but also created industries that didn’t exist before. Hassabis believes this trend will continue:“New jobs will be created that are actually better, that utilise these tools or new technologies.”AI can handle data analysis, diagnostics, and treatment recommendations faster than humans, but doctors will still oversee complex decision-making and patient care.Nursing requires emotional support, hands-on care, and human empathy—qualities that machines and robots cannot replicate effectively.He predicts massive workplace changes within 5–10 years, with some jobs disappearing and new ones emerging.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expects automation to cut some jobs, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will affect “everybody’s jobs” but also create new opportunities.Roles focused on AI development, creative problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and advanced data management are expected to increase.",Top tech leaders have issued warnings that AI will significantly disrupt the workforce.

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances.

Apple retail growth accelerates globally with strong focus on India and the Middle East

Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India, marking another step in its long-term strategy to strengthen its footprint in emerging markets. During Apple’s latest earnings announcement, CEO Tim Cook confirmed plans to open multiple new Apple Stores in India before the year ends. The move comes as part of a broader global expansion plan that also includes fresh Apple retail outlets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the launch of the Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia. Cook highlighted that these new physical stores are a key step in improving Apple’s customer experience, product accessibility, and service reach in high-growth regions like India.“We recently launched the Apple Store online in Saudi Arabia, and we couldn’t be more excited to open new stores in the UAE and India later this year,” Cook stated. “We were also delighted to welcome customers in Japan to a new location in the heart of Osaka.”According to Apple Magazine, four new stores are scheduled to open across key metropolitan cities in India, namely Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, and the Delhi NCR region. These new outlets will build on Apple’s successful retail debut in India in 2023, which saw the launch of Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi. These initial stores have quickly become major crowd-pullers, especially during new iPhone release events, and have demonstrated the value of physical retail locations in India’s fast-growing premium smartphone market.To support this retail growth, Apple has been actively hiring talent for its upcoming stores. Earlier this year, Apple Store leader John Taffe shared on LinkedIn that Apple was looking for passionate and skilled individuals to join its retail team. “Apple’s journey in India has been incredible, and we’re thrilled to continue growing in these vibrant cities. To make these new stores a success, we’re looking for passionate and talented individuals to join our team,” Taffe noted. This hiring drive highlights Apple’s commitment to not only selling products but also delivering personalised customer experiences and creating jobs within the Indian retail sector.While India remains a critical market, Apple is expanding its retail network globally. Apart from its Indian plans, the company has announced new retail locations in the UAE, including a store in Al Ain, which will add to its existing four UAE outlets (two in Abu Dhabi and two in Dubai). The Apple Store Online in Saudi Arabia further emphasizes Apple’s growing focus on the Middle East.These international retail initiatives aim to strengthen Apple’s customer reach and brand experience beyond its digital ecosystem. Apple’s global retail growth is supported by its strong financial results. In its April–June quarter (Q3), Apple reported a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales, showcasing robust demand even in challenging economic conditions. This financial strength gives Apple the confidence to invest heavily in physical stores in markets like India, where premium smartphone adoption is rapidly increasing.India has emerged as one of Apple’s most important growth markets, driven by rising disposable incomes, expanding smartphone penetration, and a growing preference for premium devices. The launch of Apple BKC and Apple Saket in 2023 marked the company’s first direct retail presence in the country, and the overwhelming customer response has paved the way for more stores. Apple’s upcoming four new stores signal a long-term commitment to India, where it faces strong competition from brands like Samsung and OnePlus. However, Apple’s focus on a seamless retail experience and exclusive customer service could help it capture a larger market share in the premium category.","Apple is preparing to significantly increase its retail presence across India.
