A team of MNF legislators, led by opposition leader Lalchhandama Ralte, visited the airport on Saturday.Ralte said both MNF and Congress governments had put lot of efforts in establishing the state's first airport and successive governments ran the airport.

When will your loan EMIs come down?

Loan EMI calculator after RBI MPC meet: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Sanjay Malhotra on Friday announced the Monetary Policy Committee’s unanimous decision to cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points. Repo rate is the rate at which banks are able to borrow money from the RBI.A repo rate cut is always good news for home loan borrowers, since EMIs come down. But this time around, it’s a double bonanza for the middle class! With FM Nirmala Sitharaman having announced NIL income tax up to Rs 12 lakh income levels in Budget 2025, the relief in loan EMIs is the cherry on the cake.Experts say that come April 1, 2025, middle class and common man will enjoy the twin benefits of changes in income tax slabs and rates and lower EMIs.So how much will you save on EMIs? What does the income tax relief + lower EMIs combination mean for middle class monthly savings? And, importantly, when will your loan EMIs start coming down? We take a look:According to loan EMI calculations provided by BASIC Home Loan, an individual with a home loan amount of Rs 50 lakh and paying a current interest rate of 8.75% for a 30 year loan will see a reduction of around Rs 889/- per month in the EMI. The EMI amount will go down from Rs 39,335/- to Rs 38,446/-Also Read | Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 explained: 20 FAQs individual taxpayers should check to understand tax rates, income tax benefit under new tax regime The biggest takeaway for the middle class is the combined bonanza from income tax slab and rate changes under the new income tax regime and the prospect of lower EMIs in the coming months. In an analysis BankBazaar explains this better:“A salaried person with a gross income of Rs 25 lakh and a home loan of Rs 50 lakh (20 years, 9%, 12 EMIs paid by March), can hope to save a total of Rs 1.37 lakh in FY 2025-26. This will be through a combination of interest savings on the home loan rate reduction of 25 basis points and the tax savings from higher tax slabs from April 1,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.The analysis suggests that an individual under the new income tax regime with a gross salary of Rs 25 lakh will now possibly save up to Rs 11,461/- per month with the changes in income tax slabs, rates and the reduced interest rate on loan. This benefit could go up to Rs 13.389/- per month for an individual earning a gross salary of Rs 50 lakh.According to Vivek Iyer, Partner and Financial Services Risk Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, the repo rate cut transmission will take about 3 to 4 months. “It may not be transmitted in full as banks would need to transmit it only to borrowers whose credit standing is good and hence on an overall portfolio basis it may vary from bank to bank,” Iyer told TOI.Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh! How income tax slab changes will benefit taxpayers at different salary levels under new regime Atul Monga, Co-Founder and CEO, BASIC Home Loan also says that it will take some time for the repo rate cut relief to trickle down to loan borrowers.“The MPC’s decision to reduce the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% is a strategic move to fuel economic growth by making borrowing more affordable. Both existing and new borrowers under floating rate loans stand to benefit from lower interest rates, improving loan affordability and accessibility. Fixed rate loan borrowers will remain unaffected from the rate cut,” Monga told TOI.“That said, banks and housing finance companies may take some time to fully transmit the benefits of this rate cut to borrowers, depending on their policies and rate cycle. Lenders have to reset their external benchmark lending rates at least once in 3 months. Borrowers will see benefits once the lenders resets their benchmark rates, which can vary depending on the lender and customer profile,” he explains.Also Read | Latest income tax slabs 2025-26: How much tax do individuals earning slightly above Rs 12 lakh have to pay? Marginal relief calculations explained","For a Rs 1 crore loan at current interest rate of 8.75%, the EMI will come down from Rs 84,450 to Rs 82,630. For a Rs 50 lakh loan at a 9.55% interest rate, the E MI will come out to Rs 41,315. The cut will take effect from April 1.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118010397,imgsize-101606,width-400,resizemode-4/118010397.jpg"
"After Delhi loss, does AAP need 'new model' to keep hold in Punjab?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-delhi-loss-does-aap-need-new-model-to-keep-hold-in-punjab/articleshow/118087335.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the political analysts believe, must develop a "" Punjab-specific development model "" to strengthen its position in the state after its ""Delhi model"" failed to gain traction in the national capital in the recently concluded assembly elections.Following the party's embarrassing defeat in Delhi, the opposition in Punjab is expected to become more aggressive in their efforts to challenge AAP ahead of the 2027 state elections.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is set to form the government in Delhi for the first time after 27 years after securing 48 out of 70 seats in the polls.Political experts suggest that AAP's loss in Delhi poses a significant challenge for the party in Punjab, where it must work to maintain its unity and enhance its governance.AAP came to power in Punjab in 2022 with a sweeping victory, winning 92 out of 117 assembly seats. It campaigned on the promise of replicating the ""Delhi model,"" which included benefits such as free electricity, financial assistance for women, improved healthcare, and better education facilities.Ronki Ram, a political science professor at Panjab University, told news agency PTI that Delhi voters rejected this model as they deemed it unsustainable.""If people of Delhi did not support that model then why would people of Punjab support it?"" he asked.Pramod Kumar, chairperson of the Institute for Development and Communication, echoed similar sentiments.""They (AAP) promised to implement the Delhi model of development in Punjab. What fate that model has met in Delhi, the same fate it will meet in Punjab. They will have to plan a Punjab-specific model. The lesson is that the Delhi model will not function in Punjab,"" he stated.According to the experts, AAP’s setback in Delhi not only poses a challenge for the party but also provides an opportunity for opposition groups in Punjab as the next assembly elections approach.""Now, Punjab will come into an election mode and the AAP will be shifting its total focus in Punjab. For AAP, this is the challenge of how to keep the party consolidated which means to keep its MLAs together so that they could not be poached by any party,"" Kumar said.""The second challenge is how to give a better performance. There will be a direct intervention of party leader Arvind Kejriwal in day-to-day affairs to improve the party's performance in the state,"" he explained.As for the opposition, Kumar noted that the future of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and BJP depends on whether they decide to form an alliance. Otherwise, both parties would struggle to pose a strong challenge to AAP individually.The Congress, on the other hand, will have to strategise on how to regain prominence and take an assertive stance in Punjab.Before the Delhi assembly elections, AAP’s Punjab leadership, including chief minister Bhagwant Mann, cabinet ministers, MPs, and MLAs, actively campaigned for the party’s candidates in Delhi.They highlighted achievements in Punjab such as providing 50,000 government jobs, offering 300 units of free electricity, launching 850 'mohalla clinics,' and acquiring a private thermal power plant.Mann, a key campaigner, led roadshows in Delhi, promoting his government's work in Punjab to garner support for AAP candidates.Meanwhile, opposition parties in Punjab have been highly critical of the AAP government, citing concerns over deteriorating law and order, increasing debt, and drug-related issues.Following AAP’s defeat in Delhi, political opponents in Punjab accused the party of misleading voters.They asserted that the people of Delhi had ""exposed the lies and deceit"" of the Arvind Kejriwal-led party and condemned the Mann government for ""misgovernance"" and ""deceiving voters with false promises.""Delhi assembly results mark AAP’s second major electoral setback after the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, where it managed to win only three out of Punjab’s 13 parliamentary seats.With AAP facing a critical juncture, its future in Punjab remains uncertain as political opponents ramp up their attacks, sensing an opportunity to weaken the party’s hold on the state.Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa predicted internal strife within AAP’s Punjab unit, claiming, ""There would be an internal power struggle between Bhagwant Mann and Arvind Kejriwal.""Union minister Ravneet Singh Bittu echoed similar sentiments on X, posting, ""History rewritten in Delhi! After 27 years, the people have given BJP a resounding mandate, embracing PM @narendramodi's vision of Viksit Bharat. This victory is a testament to trust, development, and a brighter future. Thank you, Delhi.""He further accused AAP of harbouring ""the most corrupt leaders"" and suggested that the party’s downfall in Punjab was imminent.",The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) failed to gain traction in the national capital in the recently concluded assembly elections. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is set to form the government in Delhi for the first time after 27 years. Political experts suggest that AAP's loss in Delhi poses a significant challenge for the party in Punjab.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118094902,imgsize-1469686,width-400,resizemode-4/118094902.jpg"

Poll What Do You Think Played the Biggest Role in Election Outcomes? Challenges in Governance and Public Services Effective Campaigning Strategies

BJP-AAP vote share gap is quite small. So, what swung the election decisively in BJP’s favour? Some short takes:

Saffron's long march

Taking the middle out



‘Fakes’ among freebies

Brand Kejriwal loses sheen



Modi hai toh…

NEW DELHI: The national capital on Saturday witnessed a saffron tsunami with the BJP securing a resounding victory in all parliamentary constituency areas, winning 48 out of 70 assembly seats.Aam Aadmi Party, however, maintained a stronghold in Muslim- and Dalit-dominated constituencies.What seemed to have worked in favour of the BJP was the, middle class andfactor (excise policy case), along with the ""sheeshmahal"" attack on AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal during the poll campaign.What seemed to not have worked in AAP's favour were issues like poor roads, traffic congestion, Yamuna pollution, and poor air quality.BJP’s campaign for Delhi started much before polls were announced. Every bad headline against AAP was followed by a sustained BJP campaign, hurting the incumbent. Closer to elections, ‘sheesh mahal’, as BJP cleverly named the generously refurbished CM residence, hurt AAP’s image even more.Also Read: 'Hold BJP accountable for poll promises': Kejriwal's directive to Delhi AAP MLAs After initially criticising AAP’s freebie game, BJP, too, made populist promises with gusto. BJP also talked up the idea of a double-engine sarkar, even as perceptions of govt dysfunctionality took hold, in part thanks to the LG-AAP fight. By the time polls were held, many voters had bought BJP’s argumentVote-share stats make it clear AAP has lost little of its core low-income vote. BJP would have always strategised with that assumption — and therefore it targeted Delhi’s neo-middle class and middle class, who were more upset with the state of roads, traffic, Yamuna, and air pollution than they were impressed by free water, power and primary health care.To that, BJP added the announcement of the 8th Pay Commission — Delhi voters include many govt employees and their families — and the Budget’s income tax cuts.BJP campaigned hard against some elements of AAP’s welfare policy regime. ‘Fake medicines’ and ‘ghost patients’ in free mohalla clinics was one such campaign. AAP contested these claims hotly.Also Read: Delhi loss may trigger churning in AAP's Punjab den But some of those charges stuck when coupled with demonstrable failures like Yamuna ﬂowing as dirty as ever and desperate AAP claims like Haryana’s BJP govt ‘poisoning’ Yamuna water.That AAP suffered big losses in seats along the Haryana border tells this story powerfully.Kejriwal started as a ‘humble man of the people’ who didn’t want to stay in govt bungalows. But he came into these polls as a very different leader. He and his colleagues didn’t recognise that aside from anti-incumbency against AAP, there was anti-incumbency against Kejriwal himself.When things turned against AAP, Modi’s appeal, dormant in the last two assembly polls, came to the fore. He was front and centre in BJP’s campaign and his sharp attacks and promises of smooth coordination between the Centre and Delhi made an appreciable difference","BJP secured a resounding victory in all parliamentary constituency areas, winning 48 out of 70 assembly seats. Aam Aadmi Party maintained a stronghold in Muslim- and Dalit-dominated constituencies. What seemed to have worked in favour of the BJP was the, middle class and the ""sheeshmahal"" attack on Arvind Kejriwal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118080926,imgsize-1521439,width-400,resizemode-4/118080926.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party's sacked co-founder Prashant Bhushan on Sunday held former ally Arvind Kejriwal responsible for the party's loss in Delhi assembly elections . Bhushan also accused Kejriwal of turning the party into a ""supremo-dominated"" and ""corrupt"" organisation.In a social media post on X, Bhushan accused Kejriwal of building 'sheesh mahal' for himself and travelling in luxury cars.""Kejriwal is largely responsible for AAP’s Delhi debacle. A party formed for alternative politics which was supposed to be transparent, accountable & democratic was quickly transformed by Arvind into a supremo dominated, non transparent & corrupt party which didn’t pursue a Lokpal & removed its own Lokpal,"" Bhushan said.""He built a 45 crore sheesh mahal for himself & began travelling in luxury cars. He binned 33 detailed Policy reports of expert committees set up by AAP, saying that the party will adopt expedient policies when the time comes. He felt that politics could be done by bluster & propaganda. This is the beginning of the end of AAP,"" he added.Bhushan also shared an open letter addressed to Kejriwal in 2015 after AAP's disciplinary committee leadership expelled him and activist Yogendra Yadav, accusing them of anti-party activitiesIn the letter, Bhushan had warned Kejriwal that the dream of clean, principled politics could well turn into a ""nightmare"".""You feel that you can rectify everything by running the Delhi government well in the 5 years that you have. You think that if you deliver on governance, people will forget what you have done to the party. I wish you well in that endeavour. Even traditional political parties like Congress, BJP have done some governance. But the dream that we started with for clean and principled politics and corruption free governance was much much bigger. The fear that I have, is that after how you have behaved and the character traits that you have showed, this dream of clean and principled politics that the Aam Aadmi party was founded on may well turn into a nightmare. But still, I wish you well,"" Bhushan had written.BJP won a historic mandate in Delhi, returning to power after 27 years. On the other hand, AAP witnessed a huge drop from its previous tally of 62 to only 22 seats in Delhi polls.","Aam Aadmi Party's sacked co-founder Prashant Bhushan on Sunday held former ally Arvind Kejriwal responsible for the party's loss in Delhi assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: Riding on the wave of recent successes in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections just a few months ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) registered a big win in the Delhi assembly elections. Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party suffered an embarrassing loss as most of its heavyweights lost the contest.The BJP secured a significant victory in Delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly. AAP , which had dominated the previous two terms with a substantial majority, managed only 22 seats. The Congress party failed to secure any seats for the third straight time.The BJP and its NDA allies celebrated the Delhi win, attributing it to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership. The Congress, however, maintained that the results reflected a verdict on AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal rather than Modi's governance.The Congress defended its decision to contest against Aam Aadmi Party, criticising those who questioned their stance. They pointed out that similar concerns about opposition unity were not raised when AAP contested elections in Goa, Gujarat, Haryana and other states, potentially dividing the secular vote.The BJP, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept the Delhi assembly elections with a comfortable majority. This victory marks the third major electoral success for the BJP in the last four months after winning the states of Haryana and Maharashtra. With this, the 27 years exile of the BJP in Delhi also comes to an end. This major win also indicates approval by the middle class to Modi government’s big tax relief in the Union budget 2025 last week have got the approval of middle-class consumers.With this, PM Modi yet again proves to be the star campaigner for the BJP.In a high-stakes battle for New Delhi assembly seat, BJP leader Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant slayer by defeating former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal by 4,089 seats.Son of former CM Sahib Singh Verma, Parvesh was was entrusted to take on Kejriwal who has held in to the seat last three times. In 2013, Kejriwal had emerged as giant slayer by defeating then CM and Congress veteran Sheila Dixit.After dethroning the three-time CM, Verma is also in now a strong contender for the top post.BJP leader Tarvinder Singh Marwah emerged as another giant slayer as he defeated former deputy CM and AAP senior leader Manish Sisodia. Marwah defeated three-time MLA Sisodia to win Jangpura seat by 675 votes. Sisodia had switched seats from Patparganj to Jangpura this time hoping for a comfortable win.Marwah, who was in Congress for a long time and elected three-time MLA from Jangpura, had switched to BJP in 2022 after complaining of not getting time with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi for a meeting.Also read: Delhi election results: How the OGs of AAP became Kejriwal’s biggest critics over the decade As the heavyweights of Aam Aadmi Party fell one by one, Atishi stood tall and won the Kalkaji assembly seat. In a high-stakes contest, Atishi won by 3,521 votes defeating BJP's Ramesh Bidhuri and Congress's Alka Lamba.""I thank the people of Kalkaji for showing trust in me. I congratulate my team who worked against 'baahubal',"" Atishi said.""We accept the people's mandate. I have won but it's not a time to celebrate but continue the 'war' against the BJP,"" the 43-year-old said.Her victory is a standout for the AAP as its top leaders Arvind Kejriwal and former Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia lost their constituencies.With the defeat served to Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, Atishi may now also take charge as the leader of opposition in Delhi assembly.The Congress leader may have lost the contest today but he surely has emerged as the 'Baazigar' of this poll season. Son of veteran Congress leader and three-time CM Sheila Dikshit, Sandeep got his ultimate revenge against Arvind Kejriwal today.Though he did not win the New Delhi seat, he managed to eat in to Kejriwal's votes that eventually led to the AAP chief's defeat.It was a matter of prestige for Sandeep, who was finally given a ticket from New Delhi, his mother's bastion, which had been the stronghold of Kejriwal since 2013.It's no surprise there. The one at the top of this list is AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal. The politician, who rose to power as a anti-graft crusader found himself embroiled in corruption cases.After walking out of jail on bail, Kejriwal resigned from the top post seeking validation from the public of Delhi. The union territory, however, refused to give the stamp of 'Mr Clean' to Kejriwal.The AAP suffered a major blow this election and now will have to look at ways to reinvent itself.The former deputy chief minister of Delhi and second-in-command of AAP, Sisodia, also faced defeat against BJP candidate Tarvinder Singh Marwah in the Jangpura constituency.Having previously served as a three-term MLA from Patparganj in east Delhi, he chose to contest from Jangpura in this election.Following his arrest in 2023 over alleged corruption in the liquor policy case, Sisodia was imprisoned for approximately 18 months until he secured bail. Similar to Kejriwal's stance, he declined to accept a governmental position prior to receiving the ""people's verdict"".Delhi, however, decided to give him another chance this time.After governing Delhi for a decade, AAP faced significant anti-incumbency and lost the election to BJP. This is the first time since its inception that AAP will not hold power in Delhi.With the Delhi loss, AAP is now in power only in Punjab. With this, the national expansion plan of the party has hit a roadblock.The party will now have to regroup and reorganise itself as it now sits in opposition in Delhi.The Congress party has recorded its third consecutive blank in the Delhi assembly elections, marking a stark contrast to its earlier dominance when it governed the capital for 15 consecutive years from 1998 to 2013.Delhi's electorate has consistently rejected the party in three successive assembly elections.After snapping alliance with AAP for Delhi elections , Congress mounted an assertive campaign with former party president Rahul Gandhi spearheading the criticism against Arvind Kejriwal.Despite these efforts, the party failed to secure any constituencies in Delhi. Their sole minor comfort lies in achieving a modest improvement in vote share, rising by approximately 2% from its previous figure of less than 5% in the 2020 assembly elections.Omar Abdullah’s X post captured the mood of INDIA bloc today -- 'Aur lado aapas mein'. The jibe came as AAP and Congress fought against each other which eventually benefitted BJP.With the bitter and ugly fight and AAP’s eventual loss in Delhi, the focus now turns to if it's an end to INDIA bloc.The AAP defeat also comes as an embarassment to Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party who actively campaigned for AAP in Delhi.While Congress may have not been able to open its account in Delhi once again, Rahul Gandhi cannot be put in the list of losers. Rahul, who personally took charge to dent Kejriwal's image during the election campaign, was successful in his mission.The defeat also limits AAP within the INDIA bloc who had the capability to challenge Congress' position as a national party. The Delhi blow also gives Congress a little immunity within the bloc where allies SP, TMC, Sena (UBT) chose Kejriwal's party over Congress.","The BJP secured a significant victory in Delhi, winning 48 seats in the 70-member assembly. Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party suffered an embarrassing loss as most of its heavyweights lost the contest. The Congress party failed to secure any seats for the third straight time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118066812,imgsize-1558501,width-400,resizemode-4/118066812.jpg"

Beyond exams: The real learning thrives in nurturing environments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/beyond-exams-the-real-learning-thrives-in-nurturing-environments/articleshow/118097834.cms,"The writer is Union education minister. Views are personal.

Nature has bestowed upon each human being a distinct identity - from our fingerprint to iris, from our perceptions to thoughts, from our talents to achievements. This profound truth about human uniqueness has been the defining feature of our society and our educational system must mirror this uniqueness. Reflecting this uniqueness, Swami Vivekananda once said, ""Education is the manifestation of perfection already present in man.""Drawing out the natural talent of a child and creatively engaging her in academic and extra-curricular pursuits of her choice have been formidable challenges before our educational institutions.Our role, as educators and policymakers, is to nurture the unique talent of a child, leading to her excellence in chosen pursuit. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has marked a paradigm shift as to how we define and nurture talent. It is a philosophical framework that can truly descry the nuanced contours of uniqueness that exist in each child.Under our PM's visionary leadership, we are implementing wholesome reforms in education to ensure that the educational journey of a child remains ever exciting and memorable, shorn of any stress and pressure. This perspective is central to our educational reforms, right from foundational learning to the highest levels of education and research.A few years ago, Bal Vatika or toy-based learning would have invited widespread scepticism. Today, thanks to NEP, these innovative approaches are revolutionising early education, making learning a joyful undertaking rather than a burdensome obligation. Our new education system recognizes that each child blossoms as per her natural talent.Our credit transfer policy that puts in place an Academic Bank of Credit, represents yet another innovative step ahead. It recognises that life's path may not always be linear but zigzag, and that learning can occur in a variety of circumstances and at varying paces. Learners could halt formal education as they pursue a passionate interest, obtain practical experience, or support their family. When they return to formal education, their experiences and accomplishments come handy and are valued and incorporated into their academic record of credit. This adaptability underscores that the doors to learning are always open.Our govt is committed to nurture a culture where examination success never overshadows holistic development , threatening the mental well being of our youth. Recognising this critical challenge, our govt has made it a national priority to help overcome exam-related stress.The PM's ground-breaking 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' initiative represents our commitment to transforming how students, parents, and educators need to approach assessments.The PM's interaction with students, parents, and guardians has turned exam anxiety into a national dialogue. He has endeavoured, over the years, to allay anxiety around exams that puts needles strain on impressionable minds.His practical tips, drawn from his own life and experiences, have been well received by exam-goers, ensuring a stress-free optimal exam performance by them.In an example of true leadership, we are witnessing a visionary leader's dedication to fostering the future generation of Indians that contributes to nation building.'Pariksha Pe Charcha' has been transformative in highlighting the critical importance of mental health and supportive learning environments. This is a mindset that needs to be magnified and permeated across our entire educational landscape - not just 10th and 12th Boards. The pressure and stress of exams need to be dispelled from all stages of learning.In the wise words of Rabindranath Tagore, ""Don't limit a child to your own learning, for he was born in another time."" Our approach to educational change is guided by this wisdom. The idea that stress in education is inevitable needs to give way to the understanding that real learning thrives in nurturing environments. When communities, educators, and families work together to create an atmosphere where students can flourish, success ensues. From the classroom to the playground, from vocational training centres to research laboratories, we must create spaces where diverse talents can find their spark and flourish.As we progress rapidly towards a 'Viksit Bharat', our education system stands as a key foundation stone of national transformation.Today, I call upon every parent, teacher, and citizen of our great nation.The transformation of education is not merely a govt initiative - it is a national mission that demands our collective commitment and shared perspectives.We will achieve our goals when collaboration and partnership between govt and civil society define our policies and actions.","The PM's ground-breaking 'Pariksha Pe Charcha' initiative represents our commitment to transforming how students, parents, and educators need to approach assessments.

BENGALURU: Imagine taking a leisurely Sunday stroll, only to stumble upon your favourite artiste performing on the street, followed by the shock of him being put on pause. That's exactly what happened when Ed Sheeran treated Bengaluru to a surprise gig on Church Street during his India Tour - a true 'Peak Bengaluru' moment.Just as fans gathered in awe, police unplugged the mic mid-performance, citing lack of permission and footpath encroachment. As officers tried to escort him away, Sheeran told the crowd, ""We've permission to be here, but this policeman is shutting it down. See you later!""Ed Sheeran began singing at 11.51am but was shut down just a minute later. This reignited debates about whether authorities should be more flexible and welcoming to spontaneous artistic expressions. The local Cubbon Park police denied that permission was granted for the performance. When TOI tried to contact the management of Ed Sheeran, they were unresponsive. Ed Sheeran is in Bengaluru as part of his India tour.Sheeran, however, later posted on Instagram: “We had permission to busk, by the way. Hence, us playing in that exact spot was planned out beforehand. It wasn’t just us randomly turning up.”According to Cubbon Park police, no one approached them seeking permission to perform at the site. “No one can perform on the footpaths or roads as it causes inconvenience to others. Our team asked them to stop. When they didn’t heed, the cops at the spot unplugged the mic connection,” a police official said.Sanjay Kumar, president of Church Street and Rest House Association, defended the police action, asserting that rules must be followed. “Even abroad, performances require permission. Sheeran’s team could have approached us, and we would have arranged a private space in a restaurant or an open venue for Bengaluru to enjoy,” Kumar said.But fans and netizens voiced their frustration and disappointment, arguing that stopping a global pop icon from briefly performing was unnecessary and avoidable, especially in a city known for its vibrant music culture. While some called it an embarrassing moment for Bengaluru, others pointed to the lack of public spaces for cultural events.","Ed Sheeran performed on Bengaluru's Church Street during his India Tour.

GBS outbreak fuels fears of water quality in Pune,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gbs-outbreak-fuels-fears-of-water-quality-in-pune/articleshow/118097240.cms,"PUNE: For hours, the Chavans didn't know what had gone wrong with their son. He had been unwell for a few days, down with a bout of diarrhoea, but on January 12, seven-year-old Sai Chavan suddenly fell to the ground, and stopped moving. Mother Noor Jahan and father Suraj rushed him to hospital where doctors were flummoxed: Sai had symptoms they couldn't diagnose. Eventually, he was taken to a private hospital in Pune city and it was there that specialists had answers for the couple - their son had Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS).By early February, the Chavans' neighbourhood of Nanded Gaon had enough cases to be classified as the ""primary outbreak zone"" - nearly 90 cases would come from this area and nearby localities of Kirkatwadi, Sinhagad Road and Khadakwasla, all that were not long ago merged with Pune Municipal Corporation.On February 4, almost a month after the first cases emerged, health authorities released their findings. Bacteria Campylobacter jejuni had made its way into the water supply, they said, triggering a mass infection event. So far, more than 180 people have been sickened; six have died.The Chavans found themselves at ground zero. ""We should never have trusted the corporation's water, it was our mistake,"" said Noor. Near her stood Suraj, trying to get his son to walk again. But Sai's knees buckled; he was still in pain.The family was given a municipal tap connection after Nanded Gaon merged with PMC in 2021, but with a catch: the water they got - for an hour every day - was sourced from a nearby well. The well's water was only chlorinated, unlike the rest of Pune's supply which goes through an elaborate purification process at a treatment plant. Incidentally, the well was also the source of water for households across Kirkatwadi, Nandoshi village, Dhayari, Sinhagad Road and DSK Vishwa township.Vikas Joshi, a resident of DSK Vishwa, whose brother is in hospital on oxygen support with GBS symptoms, says, ""There is no point in having a water filter here at home because the supply itself is so contaminated. We buy large cans, boil the water and then drink it.""Dr Santosh Rawale, who practises in Dhayari, says GBS fears are rampant. ""I now get 20 people every day with stomach flu or other infections, asking me if it's GBS. Many residents here had upset stomachs before the outbreak happened.""","The Chavans' neighbourhood of Nanded Gaon had enough cases to be classified as the ""primary outbreak zone"" Bacteria Campylobacter jejuni had made its way into the water supply, they said, triggering a mass infection event.

But a court-mandated fine stood between him and his release. With no family support and no financial means outside, his fate seemed uncertain - until his own earnings as a prison cook came to his rescue.A farm hand from Karnataka's Raichur district, Durgappa was convicted in 2013 for murdering his wife the year before. The sessions court sentenced him to life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 1.1 lakh, with an additional 18 months of jail time if he failed to pay. He was lodged in Raichur jail, and transferred to Kalaburagi the same year.His life behind bars could have stretched till 2027 had it not been for a remission granted on account of good conduct. The only hurdle? Paying the court fine . Unknown to him, the years spent working as a prison cook accumulated into a handy sum. Until recently, prison wages were meagre - Rs 100-150 a day. But when government raised the pay to Rs 524, his earnings quietly built up to nearly Rs 2.8 lakh in his account.When authorities discovered this, Kalaburagi jail chief superintendent R Anitha stepped in. She accompanied Durgappa to a bank, where he withdrew the required amount. He appeared in Raichur sessions court Thursday and paid the fine. The gavel struck again, this time in his favour.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts.In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach. It became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118066912,imgsize-31572,width-400,resizemode-4/118066912.jpg"

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.

For salaried individuals, once the standard deduction of Rs 75,000 under the new tax regime is counted, this income level goes up to Rs 12.75 lakh.Additionally, across the board income tax slab changes mean that individuals under the new tax regime, will now have to pay lower taxes, even at income levels above Rs 12 lakh. There is also the concept of marginal relief, which allows individuals earning just above Rs 12 lakh to not pay taxes more than their additional income.The total tax benefit of slab rate changes and rebate at different income levels can be illustrated with examples:Confused about the new income tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime?

Any individual earlier was required to pay a tax of Rs 80,000 (in the new regime) for an income of Rs. 12 lakhs. Now he will be required to pay nil tax on such income.Yes, the limit of total income for NIL tax payments in the new tax regime has been increased to Rs. 12 lakhs in this budget provided the taxpayer files ITR to avail the rebate.Earlier the limit of income for nil tax payment was Rs 7 lakh. By increasing this limit to Rs 12 lakh around one crore assessees who were earlier required to pay tax varying from Rs 20,000 to Rs 80,000 will be now paying nil tax.Yes, a standard deduction of Rs. 75,000 is available to a tax payer in the new regime. Therefore, a salaried tax payer will not be required to pay any tax where his income before standard deduction is less than or equal to Rs 12,75,000.Standard deduction of Rs 50,000 is available in old regime.Presently, for AY 2024-25, about 8.75 crore persons have filed their ITRs. All such assessees who were paying tax in the new tax regime will benefit from the change in rates and slabsApproximately Rs 1 lakh crore will be made available in the hands of the taxpayers by virtue of changes in slab, rates and rebate.In the new regime under section 115BAC(1A), marginal relief is available to only resident individuals who have income marginally above Rs 12 lakhs. For example, for a person having income of Rs 12,10,000/-, in the absence of marginal relief, the tax, works out to be Rs. 61,500/- (5% of Rs 4 lakhs + 10% of Rs 4 lakh and 15% of Rs 10 thousand). However, due to marginal relief, the amount of tax to be actually paid is Rs 10,000/-.The tax liability on such tax payer by way of slabs only is Rs 61,500. How ever a person having Rs 12 lakh income pays nil tax. By providing marginal relief it has been ensured that the tax payable by a person having income marginally above Rs 12 lakhs is required to pay only marginal amount of tax equal to the amount of income above Rs 12 lakhs so that his carry home is also Rs 12 lakhs.

For e.g. In the answer given to question no.15 above, tax on the total income of Rs 12,10,000/-shall be computed in following steps:(ii) Tax payable on total income of Rs 12,00,000/- on which rebate is available is Nil.(iii) Now the tax liability without marginal relief (in this case Rs 61,500) shall be compared with amount exceeding total income upto which rebate is available [in this case Rs 10,000, [i.e. Rs 12,10,000 - Rs 12,00,000](iv) The marginal relief shall be computed by deducting the income exceeding Rs 12, 10,000 (i.e. Rs 10,000) from total tax liability determined in this case (i.e. Rs 61,500) as tabulated above.(v) Therefore, in the above case rebate by way of marginal relief is Rs 51,500 (61,500/- 10,000/- = 51,500/-) is allowed.(vi) Tax payable is therefore Rs 10,000 [Rs 61,500 - Rs 51,500]Also Read | Budget 2025 Income Tax calculator explained: Save up to Rs 1.1 lakh!

‘Canada as the 51st state?’: Trump says he is ‘serious’ about the idea in Super Bowl interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/canada-as-the-51st-state-trump-says-he-is-serious-about-the-idea-in-super-bowl-interview/articleshow/118101430.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

Canada’s response

Trump doubles down

US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his stance that Canada should become the 51st state, declaring he is “serious” about the idea in an interview aired during the Super Bowl pre-show on Sunday.""I think Canada would be much better off being the 51st state because we lose $200 billion a year with Canada. And I'm not going to let that happen,"" Trump said, adding, ""Why are we paying $200 billion a year, essentially a subsidy to Canada?""However, according to the news agency AP, the US does not subsidise Canada. The trade deficit with the resource-rich nation stood at $72 billion in 2023, largely due to American imports of Canadian energy.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had recently acknowledged Trump’s remarks as a genuine concern, rather than political rhetoric. ""Mr. Trump has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country, and it is a real thing,"" Trudeau reportedly told business leaders, according to CBC.He suggested that Trump’s interest is tied to Canada's critical mineral resources, which are essential for electric vehicles, semiconductors, and clean energy.Trump has made multiple public references to annexing Canada, once referring to Trudeau as “Governor Trudeau” on Truth Social. His administration has also threatened 25% tariffs on all Canadian exports, excluding energy, which would be taxed at 10%. However, a 30-day pause on these tariffs was agreed upon after Canada pledged to enhance border security.To counter the pressure, Canada has launched a $1.3 billion CAD ($900 million USD) border security plan, including drones, helicopters, and a joint task force with the US. It also appointed a ""fentanyl czar"" to address American concerns over drug trafficking.François-Philippe Champagne, Canada’s industry minister, had emphasised the deep interdependence between the two economies. “This is about a confident Canada,” he said.Meanwhile, an Ipsos poll found that 80% of Canadians oppose becoming part of the US, as per BBC.With the tariff reprieve nearing its end, Trudeau warned of potential economic retaliation. “We need to be ready to respond robustly,” he said. Business leaders are also pushing for market diversification to reduce economic reliance on the US.During the interview, Trump also defended Elon Musk’s department of government efficiency (DOGE), stating Musk has been “terrific” in his mission to dismantle government agencies and cut federal workforce inefficiencies. He further hinted that the department of education and military spending could be targeted next.""We're going to find billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse,"" Trump claimed.Trump also used the interview to announce upcoming tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, including from Canada and Mexico and previewed a plan for reciprocal tariffs.While en route to the Super Bowl, Trump signed a proclamation renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the ""Gulf of America.""","US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his stance that Canada should become the 51st state.

In an interview set to air before the Super Bowl, President Donald Trump stated that Elon Musk, tasked with overseeing a purge of US government jobs, would help uncover ""hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud"" within federal agencies. Trump claimed that Musk, the world's richest man and a key figure in the president's cost-cutting efforts, has been instrumental in eliminating wasteful spending.""We're going to find billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse. And, you know, the people elected me on that,"" Trump said in remarks aired by Fox News.Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, was appointed by Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new initiative aimed at reducing federal spending. Over the past three weeks, the Trump administration has issued multiple executive orders to cut costs, with Musk playing a central role in the effort.Despite these claims, there has been no evidence presented of widespread fraud within the government. Musk has already made significant moves, including the layoffs of thousands of workers at the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and has come under fire for gaining access to personal and financial data of millions of Americans through the US Treasury.A federal judge recently halted the administration's plan to put 2,200 USAID workers on paid leave, and another judge blocked DOGE’s access to Treasury Department payment systems containing sensitive data.Trump, in the interview, revealed that he plans to expand Musk's role to include a review of the Department of Education and the military, which has a budget of approximately $850 billion.Musk’s involvement in the cost-cutting initiative has drawn criticism, particularly because his companies hold over $20 billion in government contracts.Democratic critics, including Senator Chris Murphy, have condemned the efforts, calling them an ""assault on the Constitution"" and warning of a ""billionaire takeover"" of government.However, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended Musk’s role, describing him as an ""outside auditor"" and downplaying concerns about the rapid pace of the reforms. ""I'm not uncomfortable with the pace of this,"" Johnson said, adding that Musk’s team is uncovering ""incredible abuses of the public fisc.""","Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, was appointed by Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency.

The Conservatives have announced their first policy under their new leader Kemi Badenoch: a massive clampdown on immigration if the party returns to govt.They plan to double from five to 10 years the length of time a person has to live in the UK before they can apply for ILR ( indefinite leave to remain ) and make them live in the UK a further five years (so a minimum of 15 years) before they can apply for British citizenship. Currently British citizenship can be applied for 12 months after ILR is obtained.The Toris will add new rules to say that those who have claimed benefits or relied on social housing while in Britain on work visas will not be allowed to apply for ILR. Those claiming ILR must also be able to demonstrate that their household would be a net contributor, with a high enough salary, especially if they want to bring dependants, and that they do not have a criminal record.The Tories also plan to ban anyone arriving in the UK illegally, or anyone who outstays their visa, from ever getting British citizenship or ILR.Those on work and study visas who are in breach of their visas, or who have applied to lift the condition of “no recourse to public funds”, will have their visas cancelled and be removed.These changes will apply to Indians but not to those on the Ukraine and British National (Overseas) from Hong Kong schemes.The Tories will also bring out new binding annual caps on visas which will be at a “much, much lower level than recent migration levels”, the party said.

UK to host EU chiefs for May 19 summit: Downing Street,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-to-host-eu-chiefs-for-may-19-summit-downing-street/articleshow/117919732.cms,"UK prime minister Keir Starmer

LONDON: UK prime minister Keir Starmer will welcome European Union chiefs to Britain in May for the first of regular summits designed to reset Britain's relationship with the bloc, Downing Street announced Tuesday.Starmer will host European Council president Antonio Costa and European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen on May 19, a spokesman for the British premier told reporters.He added it would be the first of ""annual summits"" as the Labour leader seeks closer relations with European neighbours following the rancour of Britain's 2020 departure from the bloc under the previous conservative government.""The first UK-EU summit will provide an opportunity to make further progress on areas which will deliver tangible benefits for the people of the UK and the EU and further strengthen the unique relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" the spokesman said.The announcement came a day after Starmer, elected to office last July, became the first UK premier since Brexit to attend a major gathering of all 27 EU leaders in Brussels on Monday.Starmer has vowed to pursue more friendly relations with the European Union and hopes to strike new agreements with the bloc to help fire up a stagnant British economy .The prime minister has laid out strict red lines however, while the EU has its own demands, raising questions about what exactly the two entities will be able to achieve.Starmer has vowed Britain will not return to the single market or customs union and has ruled out signing up to freedom of movement.He does want improvements to the existing trade and co-operation Agreement between the UK and the EU that is due for renewal in 2026.That could include a new veterinary pact to smooth the export of British agricultural goods, while a deal on mutual recognition of professional qualifications has also been suggested.The European Commission, meanwhile, has touted the possibility of a youth mobility programme, however the British government has publicly ruled that out.It is more open to joining a pan-European and North African customs scheme which allows for the tariff-free trade of some goods.Access to British waters for fisherman from European countries is also expected to be a sticking point in negotiations.Likely to be top of the agenda at the summit is a proposed defence and security pact which experts view is something reasonably straightforward to agree upon.","Keir Starmer will host European Council president Antonio Costa and European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen on May 19.
