Anupriya faces twin challenges of water & turncoat to break the jinx on The Turf Of ‘Kaleen Bhaiya’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/anupriya-faces-twin-challenges-of-water-turncoat-to-break-the-jinx-on-the-turf-of-kaleen-bhaiya/articleshow/110547377.cms,"Can Anupriya break the jinx?

Caste matrix

Urban voters

The dry land of Mirzapur is eagerly waiting for rains to get relief from the scorching heat. Same is the situation on its poll turf where water could be the deciding factor. Situated on the banks of the Ganga river, shortage of potable and non-potable water is the main election issue in the district which has shot to fame thanks to the popular OTT series ‘Mirzapur’.The primary source of irrigation for cultivation of crops in more than three dozen villages of Marihaan sub-division of Mirzapur, the sluice gates to provide water to the canal were lifted last time in 2022 Rabi season. The starting point of the canal has now dried up and algae has covered its bed.Baba Yadav, a local resident and a worker of Apna Dal (Sonelal) faction, shares the plight of villagers: “For the past two years we have been struggling in every cropping season as no water comes from the canal. In remote areas of Mirzapur, every family depends on agriculture for livelihood. Ahead of the paddy cultivation in Jan and Feb, power supply was also irregular because of which borewells could not be operated.” Yadav adds that he has been unable to convey these concerns to the party leadership due to lack of access.Mirzapur is among the driest regions of the state and its farmers rely heavily on the monsoon-fed dams and reservoirs for agriculture. Presence of red sandstone and rock terrains make drilling of borewells difficult unlike other parts of the state.Mirzapur is known for not giving more than two consecutive turns to an MP. Apna Dal (Sonelal) candidate Anupriya Patel is aiming to break the jinx this time, but it’s a tough fight for her on the seat she has been representing since 2014. Anupriya, 43, is having a face-off with BJP turncoat and sitting MP from neighbouring Bhadohi, Ramesh Chand Bind , 50, who has entered the fray in Mirzapur on SP ticket after being denied the ticket in his constituency.Mirzapur comprises five assembly segments of Chhanbey, Mirzapur, Majhawan, Chunar and Marihaan. While the gun-toting mafia like ‘ Kaleen Bhaiya ’ are limited to reel life, the real-life kaleen (carpet) traders are keen for an MP who can address their business concerns. Rajesh Kumar, vice-president of All India Carpet Manufacturers’ Association, says: “The one district one product scheme has certainly created a brand value for Bhadohi-Mirzapur carpets but the industry is not getting the support it needs. The incentives have been rolled back or withdrawn while additional compliances and regulations that have been introduced in the recent years have impacted the business.”Ramesh Bind has an uphill task to consolidate voters beyond Muslims, Yadavs and Binds (the three communities account for 4-5 lakh votes). Bind has also been mired in controversies for making inappropriate remarks against upper castes and it’s being raked up against him in the polls. Bind, though, has deep roots in politics. He was BSP MLA from Majhawan for three consecutive terms (2002, 2007 and 2012) on a seat dominated by Binds, Dalits and Brahmins.Caste factor, too, is in the play. Scheduled Caste voters can be the decider for any party. BSP has fielded Manish Kumar Tripathi and Mayawati even addressed a rally in his support on May 23. SCs account for 26% of the population (about 5 lakh voters out of 19.06 lakh electors) and half of them are Jatavs, the old loyalists of BSP. Mirzapur also has a higher population of Kol voters compared to Pasi.OBCs, particularly Patels, constitute the largest chunk in the district and are expected to stand behind Anupriya firmly for the third time. Rajesh Patel, a businessman in Rajgarh development block of Chunar, says, “I will support Anupriya because she is our community leader and a minister. Her margin may drop but she will sail through.” Patel, however, adds that “No steps were taken when we needed water and power for our crops in Jan and Feb. Water crisis is perennial and we hope Anupriya will find a permanent solution in her third term.”Backing Ramesh Bind, Mithlesh Prajapati from Danti village of Majhawan says, “Bulldozers were used to bring down houses of 40 rural families in Danti in Jan last year. Nobody paid heed to our pleas and it is time to teach a lesson to the local MLA and MP.” Local administration had identified the land in Danti for setting up a university and razed the houses to clear up the land. However later on the project was shifted to Deori Kalan.Urban voters in Mirzapur say work on the upcoming Vindhyavasini shrine corridor, proposed investment projects and improved connectivity through national highways might go in favour of the BJP-Apna Dal (S) alliance. Shyam Kumar Dubey, who runs a battery shop near Mirzapur railway station, says, “You should have seen the railway station earlier to realise what has changed. The only issue which I can recollect was frequent closure of the Lal Bahadur Shastri bridge (pucca pul) over the Ganga during the past three years for repair works. However we would soon get six-lane connectivity as Yogi Adityanath has made the announcement and provided the budget for its construction.”","Mirzapur is known for not giving more than two consecutive turns to an MP.

slave mentality

NEW DELHI: Accusing Congress of ignoring Mahatma Gandhi , PM Modi has said the icon remained unknown to the world till the 1982 film 'Gandhi' was made, inviting swift retaliation from Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge who said ""those whose ideological ancestors along with Nathuram Godse were involved in the assassination of Bapu can never follow the path of truth shown by him"".Replying to a question on whether opposition didn't do enough to promote India's cultural heritage and pilgrimage sites when in office at the Centre, Modi said, ""The question is not just about (that)... Gandhi was a tall personality... In the past 75 years, was it not our responsibility to let the world know about him? No one knew (of him).""When the film ('Gandhi') was made, it attracted global interest. We have not done this (the film was an India-UK co-production directed by Richard Attenborough). If the world knows Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela, Gandhiji was no less. This I am stating after my worldwide travels. We've to accept that Gandhi and, through him, India should have received its share of attention in the world. Gandhi is a solution to many of the global issues today, said PM Modi.Countering the PM, Congress's Jairam Ramesh said, ""If there is someone who has destroyed the heritage of the Mahatma, it is the 'caretaker PM'. It is his govt that has destroyed Gandhian institutions in Varanasi, Delhi and Ahmedabad. The 2024 elections are between a Mahatma follower and a Godse follower. The defeat of the 'caretaker PM' and his Godse-follower companions is evident.""In a post on X, Kharge added, ""Now lies are going to pack up and leave."" Rahul Gandhi too took a dig at Modi and said, ""Only the student of 'entire political science' would need to watch a film to know about Mahatma Gandhi.""In an interview to ABP News, Modi accused past govts of failing to conserve heritage because they viewed things from a ""slave mentality"" and also there were ""compulsions of appeasement."" Modi cited the examples of Statue of Unity, Dandi and development of Panchteerth, five places associated with of Babasaheb Ambedkar, all developed under his govt and said, ""We have to live and connect with our history. There is cultural heritage as well. Moreover, we have to brand our 500 years of struggle (of Ram Mandir) globally. When the court gave its judgment, there was absolute peace in the country. The credit of this peace goes to all. Should we not market it?""Asking whether India should have not marketed and branded this legacy, he accused the opposition of being concerned with ""vote bank politics."" Modi said the opposition's pursuit of political shortcuts restricted them to the ""politics of vote bank"". ""That's why they turned communal, casteist and dynastic,"" he added.""Earlier, during elections, they used to visit temples. Not any more. Not just that, no party functionaries are seen at Iftar parties now. Modi has ensured that none of your drama will be accepted. There is pressure on them to avoid programmes of fooling people. Otherwise, Iftar parties became the biggest political events. Everyone realised this drama won't last long,"" he said.","PM Modi said the icon remained unknown to the world till the 1982 film 'Gandhi' was made.

NEW DELHI: The north Indian states of Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and national capital Delhi are in grip of intense heatwave with temperatures in excess of 50 degrees Celsius in Rajasthan and Haryana. Delhi on Tuesday recorded its highest ever temperature with mercury reaching 49.9 degrees Celsius. Indian Metrological Department (IMD) has predicted the heatwave to continue for another two days.Rajasthan continued to suffer a blistering heat wave for the 17th consecutive day on Tuesday, with Churu being the hottest place in the state where the mercury touched the 50.5 degree Celsius mark.In most places, the maximum temperature remained almost 5 degrees above the normal for this season.Health department confirmed three deaths caused by heatstroke in Jaipur on Tuesday, taking the official toll to four in the state so far. Two women from Delhi and Karnataka, both aged 63, and a 40-year-old man from Agra were undergoing treatment for heatstroke at Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur. The hospital administration said despite all possible efforts, they could not be saved.Sirsa’s maximum temperature on Tuesday touched 50.3 degrees Celsius in a heatwave-gripped Haryana, where mercury crossed 44°C during peak hours at 18 stations and electrical infrastructure couldn’t take the load. The last time it was so hot in Hisar, the first Maruti car had not come out yet from Gurugram.The next three hottest districts after Sirsa were Hisar, Narnaul and Rohtak, while even the Shivalik ranges couldn’t shield foothill stations Panchkula and Chandigarh from temperatures that baked them like Ambala and Karnal. The day temperature crossed 48°C in NCR districts Faridabad, Gurugram, and Sonipat, which was 1.1-to-6.1°C above normal.The grilled spots included Balsamand in Hisar (49.3°C), Nuh (49°C), Mahendragarh (48.8°C), Jind (48.7°C), Narnaul (48.5°C), Hisar and Faridabad (48.4°C), Jhajjar (48.2°C), Charkhi Dadri (48.1°C), Ottu in Sirsa (48°C), Bawal in Rewari (47.7°C), Rohtak (47.5°C), Mahendragarh outer (47.2°C), Gurugram (47°C), Karnal (46.5°C), Palwal (46.4°C), Sonipat (46.1°C), Karnal outer (45.9°C), Panipat outer (45.4°C), and Panchkula (45°C). Just three locations recorded temperature between 44 and 45°C during peak hours.Scorching heat, cloudless skies and searing winds blowing from Rajasthan sent Tuesday’s day temperature soaring to an all-time high on record in Delhi. While the mercury shot up to 49.9°C — nine notches above normal — in Mungeshpur and Narela, it was 49.8°C in Najafgarh.Apart from Mungeshpur, Narela and Najafgarh, several areas of the city, including Pitampura, Pusa and Jafarpur, also recorded severe heatwave on Tuesday, with the maximum temperature eight to nine notches above normal.With temperatures exceeding 42 degrees Celsius, people are prone to heat stroke, which is a medical emergency characterised by an elevation in core body temperature, often exceeding 104°F (40°C). Doctors say the heat stroke may lead to central nervous system dysfunction. When the body’s ther moregulatory mechanisms fail, extreme dehydration ensues, signalling an alarm.There is little respite in sight in the next two days, with India Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a red alert for heatwave and severe heatwave for Wednesday and an orange alert for Thursday, when the day temperature may witness a very slight drop. However, there’s a glimmer of hope: the capital may receive very light rain on Friday and Saturday, according to IMD.Punjab is due to elect its MPs on June 1, in a severe northwestern heat wave in which extreme highest temperatures have made daytime campaigning hazardous.The India meteorological department recorded the state's highest temperature of Tuesday to be 49.3 degrees Celsius at the Bathinda Airport, which was 8°C above normal. At many places in the state, the maximum temperature was between 44 and 47°C. In Bathinda town, the reading was 47.2°C. On Monday as well, Bathinda had recorded the highest temperature from across the state, at s little above 48°C.The IMD says that the temperature at the airports normally is observed to be 2 to 3°C more than the reading in the plains, since it is recorded from instruments placed at a height. The IMD has issued weather advisory, asking people to remain hydrated and avoid coming out between 11am and 4pm.In Safdarjung, the city’s base observatory, maximum temperature was 45.8 degrees, five degrees above normal, and the highest this year.","Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and national capital Delhi are in grip of intense heatwave.

NEW DELHI: The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) on Wednesday reported an unprecedented temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius (126.1 Fahrenheit) in Delhi's Mungeshpur area, claiming it to be the highest ever recorded in India. This extreme heatwave has sparked widespread concern and debates on its accuracy and implications, prompting a closer examination of the data and its effects on daily life in the city.While the IMD's automated weather station recorded the temperature, meteorologist Soma Sen Roy indicated that the accuracy of this reading is under review. This extreme temperature surpassed the previous national record of 51 degrees Celsius set in Phalodi, Rajasthan, in 2016. As the national capital grapples with this intense heat, officials have issued red alerts, emphasizing the severe health risks and urging precautions.""The maximum temperature over Delhi NCR varied from 45.2° to 49.1°C in different parts of city, Mungeshpur reported 52.9°C as an outlier compared to other stations. It could be due to error in the sensor or the local factor. IMD is examining the data and sensors,"" the IMD said in a statement.In a post on X, Union Minister of Earth Sciences Kiren Rijiju flagged the error, saying that the temperature of 52.3 degree Celsius in Delhi is ""very unlikely.""""It is not official yet. Temperature of 52.3°C in Delhi is very unlikely. Our senior officials in IMD have been asked to verify the news report. The official position will be stated soon,"" Kiren Rijiju said in the post.Yes, according to the IMD, Delhi's Mungeshpur area recorded a temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius on May 29, 2024.However, IMD meteorologist Soma Sen Roy mentioned that they are ""checking out"" the accuracy of the recording.The recorded 52.9 degrees Celsius surpasses the previous national record of 51 degrees Celsius set in Phalodi, Rajasthan, in 2016. It also broke the 50C threshold for the first time in Delhi's history.The IMD has issued a red alert for Delhi, warning of ""severe heat-wave conditions"" and highlighting the ""very high likelihood of developing heat illness and heat stroke in all ages"". They are also reviewing the accuracy of the recorded temperature.Residents are adopting various measures such as staying indoors, using traditional remedies like aam panna (unripe mango juice), taking multiple baths, and keeping hydrated. Amit Kumar from Najafgarh mentioned, ""We're taking traditional remedies like aam panna (unripe mango juice) and using wet towels to stay cool and prevent fainting.""High temperatures increase the risk of heat-related illnesses such as heat stroke and dehydration. Dr. Atul Mathur warned, ""If you have not been drinking water, you will be dehydrated. For those who have pre-existing heart issues, their BP becomes high.""The intense heat has strained daily activities and essential services. The electricity grid faced a record peak demand of 8,302 megawatts. Water shortages are a significant issue, with authorities ordering measures to prevent wastage. People are also facing severe challenges in commuting and outdoor work, as highlighted by residents like Jay Pandit, who said, ""The hot wind feels like burning the skin, and it's affecting my health.""Years of scientific research suggest that climate change is causing heatwaves to become longer, more frequent, and more intense. This trend poses a growing threat to public health, infrastructure, and daily life in urban areas like Delhi.The Delhi government has issued red alerts and health advisories, urging people to stay hydrated and avoid outdoor activities during peak heat hours. They have also deployed teams to prevent water wastage and manage the city's strained resources.The IMD has warned of continuing severe heatwave conditions across several northern states, including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan.

NEW DELHI: The scorching heat in New Delhi has reached unprecedented levels, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) recording a staggering temperature of 52.9 degrees Celsius (126.1 Fahrenheit) in the Mungeshpur area. If confirmed, this would be the highest temperature ever recorded in India.Globally, temperatures in Death Valley's Furnace Creek, Southern California, registered 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54.4 Celsius) in 2023, potentially the highest global temperature in over a century, according to the US national weather service (NWS). The NWS emphasized the need for formal verification before confirming this reading as the hottest temperature recorded since July 1913, highlighting the significance of this potential record .Death Valley, located in the United States, is known for its scorching temperatures. The highest temperature ever recorded on Earth was measured at Greenland Ranch, a location within Death Valley, on July 10, 1913. The temperature reached an astonishing 134°F (56.7°C), as confirmed by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).The soaring temperatures in India are attributed to blistering winds from Rajasthan, where temperatures peaked at 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 Fahrenheit) on Tuesday, making it the hottest region in the country. Rajasthan's Phalodi desert region currently holds India's all-time heat record of 51 degrees Celsius (123.8 Fahrenheit), set in 2016.Pakistan is also grappling with its own heatwave , with temperatures reaching a peak of 53 degrees Celsius (127.4 Fahrenheit) in Mohenjo Daro, rural Sindh province. The Pakistani meteorological office expects a slight decrease in temperatures from Wednesday but warns of further heatwaves in June.The heatwave in Pakistan coincides with the country's negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which are believed to heavily focus on addressing the country's energy supply crisis, characterized by extensive load-shedding of up to 15 hours per day in some regions.","Temperatures in New Delhi reach 52.9 degrees Celsius (126.1 Fahrenheit) If confirmed, this would be the highest temperature ever recorded in India.

NEW DELHI: India successfully flight-tested the indigenous RudraM-II air-to-ground missile , which is designed to have a strike range of almost 350-km, from a Sukhoi-30MKI fighter of the IAF off the coast of Odisha on Wednesday.

The RudraM series are being developed by DRDO as new-generation anti-radiation missiles (NGARMs) for destroying a variety of enemy surveillance, communication, radars, and command and control centers on the ground.

The 150-km range RudraM-I missile, with INS-GPS navigation with a passive homing head for the final attack, was first tested in Oct 2020, while a 550-km RudraM-III is also under-development.

The test of the solid-propelled RudraM-II around 11.30 am on Wednesday met all trial objectives, validating the propulsion system and control and guidance algorithm.

Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated DRDO & the Indian Air Force on the successful test of RudraM-II.

Hand-raised buffalo released into the wild,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hand-raised-buffalo-released-into-the-wild/articleshow/110542992.cms,"GUWAHATI: In an extraordinary accomplishment, wildlife veterinarians and animal keepers at the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation ( CWRC ) in Kaziranga, in collaboration with the forest department, have successfully hand-raised and rewilded an orphaned wild buffalo calf at Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary .The sanctuary comes under the jurisdiction of Kaziranga National Park & Tiger Reserve (KNPTR).The young buffalo was admitted to the centre on January 20, 2020. This feat marks a significant milestone in the conservation efforts of the CWRC and the forest department as they have demonstrated the feasibility of nurturing and reintroducing orphaned wild animals back into their natural habitats.The global population of Asiatic wild buffalo (Bubalus arnee) has been estimated at approximately 3,400 individuals, with an astonishing 95% residing in India, primarily in Assam. Boasting an estimated population of over 2,600, the world’s single largest congregation of this magnificent species can be found within the confines of KNPTR.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma shared this heartening news via social media, “In Jan 2020, a one-day-old wild buffalo calf was rescued by officials of @assamforest and was nurtured for 4 years at CWRC, Kaziranga. Yesterday, it was released back to the wild, marking another significant step in rescue and rehabilitation efforts for our precious wildlife.”KNPTR director Sonali Ghosh said, “Rescue and rehabilitation of young animals is extremely challenging as they need specialised humanised parental care. However, it needs to be ensured that no attachment to human beings/ imprinting takes place so that they can be rewilded eventually. The wild buffalo calf brings a beacon of hope as the animal keepers and vets of CWRC got a chance to nurture a very young animal successfully and release it back into the wild where she truly belongs.”KNPTR officials said the rehabilitation process has been meticulously carried out in accordance with the conservation translocation protocols established by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Central Zoo Authority (CZA). “At present, the animal is under constant surveillance of the frontline teams of Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary and CWRC. She has been kept in the soft-release enclosure,” an official said, adding, “This juvenile, now nearly four years old, was triumphantly reintroduced to its natural habitat at Burachapori Wildlife Sanctuary on May 28.","The young buffalo was admitted to the centre on January 20, 2020.

Nawaz Sharif signals peace as India awaits new government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nawaz-sharif-signals-peace-as-india-awaits-new-government/articleshow/110542732.cms,"NEW DELHI: While former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif has in the past too accused his own country (read Pervez Musharraf ) of violating the peace agreement he reached with India in 1999, his reiteration of the same on Tuesday is significant because of the timing. The elder Sharif, who is now the most powerful civilian leader in the country, spoke about Pakistan having sabotaged the agreement through its Kargil adventurism while taking back the reins of his ruling party after 6 years, and days before the outcome of the Indian elections.“Once Pakistan conducted five nuclear tests in reply to India’s [then Indian premier] Atal Bihari Vajpayee sahib came here and made a [peace] agreement with us ... but we violated it and it was our fault,” said Nawaz, after being re-elected PML-N president, according to the Dawn newspaper.Nawaz, whose brother Shehbaz Sharif is Pakistan PM, has long maintained that he learnt about Musharraf’s Kargil “misadventure” only from a phone call by his then counterpart A B Vajpayee and that the Pakistani military operation scuttled the peace process he had initiated with Vajpayee in the form of the Lahore Declaration early that year.The latest remarks by Nawaz, who has even otherwise been making favourable noises about ties with India, are seen as significant also because they come in the middle of Indian elections, and just before the results are declared on June 4. “It must be read as a significant signal from Pakistan’s currently most important civilian leader for India’s incoming government,” says former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria.Nawaz enjoys a strong rapport with Indian PM Narendra Modi and it was under him, in 2015, that the 2 countries last had a substantive bilateral engagement, although the comprehensive bilateral dialogue they launched to address all issues, including J&K and terrorism, was quickly undone by the Pathankot terrorist attack.The Sharif brothers may hope to break the deadlock in ties if the Modi government returns next week but, for India in that case, the onus will remain squarely on Islamabad to make the first move as it was Pakistan that recalled its high commissioner and called off trade ties, after India revoked the special status of J&K in 2019.There was a hint of some forward movement by Pakistan in March when foreign minister Ishaq Dar said Islamabad would seriously consider restoring trade ties with India. That Pakistan remains conflicted about ties with India was evident again when his own ministry quickly clarified there was no change in Pakistan’s position and that the responsibility to improve ties lied with India. Pakistan officially maintains that talks are possible only if India reverses its actions in Kashmir.No Indian government of course will accede to any such demand by Pakistan, except for working towards an early return to statehood as asked for by the Indian Supreme Court in a verdict last year that upheld the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state. For the Modi government, the judgment was an endorsement of its position that Pakistan is not a stakeholder in the internal administrative process of J&K. Pakistan of course maintains statehood and elections cannot be a substitute to the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination. Whether it can show any flexibility on the issue, without recourse to cross-border terrorism, may determine the road ahead if the Modi government indeed returns.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif has accused his own country of violating the peace agreement he reached with India in 1999.

He explained that as a general rule of thumb, one can double the GDP growth rate of the market to estimate stock market returns. With India's real GDP growth at 7-8%, Mobius projects the stock market to deliver returns of 14-15-16% in the future.Regarding the recent record highs achieved by Indian markets, such as the Sensex surpassing 75,000 points, Mobius was questioned about his earlier prediction of the Sensex hitting the one lakh mark.Also Read | Repeat of 2004 shock defeat for NDA appears unlikely, says Jefferies' Chris Wood; cautions on capital gains tax changes When asked if he expects this milestone to be reached within the next 12 to 18 months, Mobius said, ""I would not say the next 18 months, but as I mentioned when I first made that prediction, within the next few years.""Mobius also noted that the global markets , including the US, have been performing well, and the Indian market has been keeping pace. In some months, India outperforms the US, while in others, the US takes the lead, he said.Mobius is of the view that there is still significant potential for growth in the global market, and the increasing interest in equities worldwide, especially in the US, is benefiting India as well.

It will also be one of Adani's significant purchases after Ambuja Cements and NDTV.Sharma owns about 19 per cent in One 97, which is worth Rs 4,218 crore based on the stock's Tuesday closing price of Rs 342 apiece. Sharma owns 9 per cent in Paytm directly, and holds another 10 per cent through a foreign entity Resilient Asset Management. Both Sharma and Resilient, according to One 97's filings with stock exchanges, are listed as public shareholders.Sebi rules require an acquirer, holding less than 25 per cent in a target company, to make an open offer for a minimum 26 per cent stake of the company. The acquirer can also make an open offer for the entire share capital of the company.Sources said that discussions between Adani and Sharma have been going on for a while and their meeting at Adani Corporate House in Ahmedabad on Tuesday involved ""finalising the contours of the deal"". They added that Adani is also in talks with funds from West Asia to bring them as investors in One 97, which pioneered mobile payments in the country.Other significant shareholders of One 97 are private equity fund Saif Partners (15%), Jack Ma-founded Antfin Netherlands (10%) and the company's directors (9%).

One 97, founded by Sharma in 2007, and whose IPO was the second biggest in the country, has a market cap of Rs 21,773 crore.""With the financial strain and regulatory bottlenecks that Paytm is facing, aligning with Adani Group would provide the robust financial backing needed to address regulatory compliance issues and stabilise its operations.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"'911 S5': Chinese national arrested, FBI takes down massive global army of zombie computer devices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/911-s5-chinese-national-arrested-fbi-takes-down-massive-global-army-of-zombie-computer-devices/articleshow/110548700.cms,"The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely.

What was the ""911 S5"" botnet?

The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, it was ""likely the world's largest"" and facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and access to child exploitation materials.

Who was behind the botnet?

Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang was arrested in Singapore on May 24. He allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers.

How did the botnet operate?

The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely. Cybercriminals purchased access to these compromised computers, using them to carry out various illegal activities.

What kind of crimes were committed using the botnet?

Criminals used the botnet for a staggering array of crimes. These included identity theft, financial fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and cyberattacks. The botnet was also involved in defrauding financial institutions and federal lending programs, including pandemic relief scams. US Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that the criminals were responsible for over $5.9 billion in estimated losses from relief program fraud.

What assets were seized during the operation?

Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods valued at $4 million, and about $30 million in real estate. These assets were located in various countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, and others. Additionally, 22 domains associated with the botnet were also seized.

How did the law enforcement operation unfold?

The operation, named Operation Tunnel Rat, involved executing multiple search warrants and conducting interviews in Singapore and Thailand. The FBI, along with international partners, dismantled the botnet's infrastructure and arrested Wang. Authorities are also looking into the possibility of additional arrests.

How did the public get involved in this operation?

The FBI has set up a web page where individuals can check if their IP address was among those compromised by the botnet. This helps potential victims identify and mitigate any security issues stemming from the infection.

What happens next for Yunhe Wang?

The US is currently awaiting Wang's extradition from Singapore. Brett Leatherman, deputy assistant director with the FBI’s Cyber Division, emphasized the urgency of the extradition, stating, “We want him, you know, as soon as possible.”

An international law enforcement team has made a significant breakthrough in the fight against cybercrime, arresting a Chinese national and dismantling a massive botnet that has been operational for nearly a decade. This botnet, known as "" 911 S5 ,"" was responsible for various illegal activities, including identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud . The takedown involved cooperation between authorities in multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of cybercrime and the necessity of international collaboration to combat it.The botnet, managed by Yunhe Wang , infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This network of compromised machines, often referred to as ""zombie"" computers, was used by criminals to carry out a wide array of illicit activities. The US Department of Justice and the FBI have been instrumental in this operation, which has led to significant financial and operational seizures, including millions in cryptocurrency and luxury assets.Here is all you need to know:(With inputs from agencies)","The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries.

In November, he was briefly removed from his position as CEO, causing shockwaves in the rapidly evolving AI industry, but was later reinstated.Altman, who initially established OpenAI as a nonprofit research organization dedicated to developing AI safely for the benefit of humanity, now intends to focus his philanthropic efforts on ""technology that helps create abundance for people."" In a joint letter with his husband, technology investor Oliver Mulherin, dated May 18, Altman expressed gratitude for the hard work and dedication of those who have contributed to the advancement of society, saying, ""There is nothing we can do except feel immense gratitude and commit to pay it forward, and do what we can to build the scaffolding up a little higher.""The Giving Pledge, established in 2010 by Bill Gates , Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett , aims to encourage philanthropy among the world's wealthiest individuals to address pressing global issues.

Surveillance and Repression

Impact on daily life

NEW DELHI: The Chinese government's crackdown on the Islamic faith, particularly among the Uyghur Muslim population in Xinjiang, has garnered significant international attention and condemnation due to human rights abuses and allegations of cultural genocide.In a recent investigation, UK's Sky News has shed light on China's increasing control over Islamic practices within the country. The report underscores the mounting restrictions and surveillance faced by Muslims, particularly in regions with significant Islamic populations.One poignant scene described in the report occurs in a cold, dusty part of central China, where a local Muslim leader stands alone in the courtyard of a small mosque. ""Religion is dying,"" he laments, highlighting the severe constraints imposed by the Chinese government on religious activities.The report details how the Chinese authorities have intensified efforts to monitor and restrict Islamic practices, including demolishing mosques, banning religious attire, and censoring Islamic texts. This crackdown is part of a broader campaign to align religious practices with the state's ideology and to curb any potential dissent.The Chinese authorities have taken numerous steps to curb the practice of Islam:Demolition of mosques: Many mosques have been demolished, particularly those that do not conform to the government's architectural standards or those deemed too conspicuous.Banning religious attire: Traditional Islamic attire, such as headscarves and long beards, has been banned in certain areas. This is part of an effort to assimilate Muslims into the broader Han Chinese culture.Censoring Islamic texts: The government has also censored Islamic texts, removing any content that could be perceived as promoting extremism or dissent. This includes altering the Quran and other religious literature to fit the state’s narrative.The report highlights the extensive surveillance network that monitors Muslim communities. High-tech surveillance systems, including facial recognition cameras, are prevalent in areas like Xinjiang, home to a significant Uyghur Muslim population. These systems track individuals' movements and behaviors, ensuring strict compliance with the government's regulations.The restrictions have permeated all aspects of daily life for Muslims in China. Religious education for children has been heavily regulated, with many religious schools being shut down.

"Phones, Islamic books, tourism: Taliban on charm offensive to revive Afghan economy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/phones-islamic-books-tourism-taliban-on-charm-offensive-to-revive-afghan-economy/articleshow/110493793.cms,"A tale of unexpected prosperity

Yet, amidst this backdrop of hardship, certain sectors and individuals find ways to not only survive but thrive, highlighting a complex interplay of resilience and disparity.

Yunis Safi, a businessman in Kabul, understands the subtle power of appearances in Afghanistan's social and economic spheres. Running a phone shop in the upscale Shar-e-Naw neighborhood, Safi explains, ""In Afghanistan, your phone is your personality."" His store, guarded and stocked with high-end iPhones, serves as a stark contrast to the economic conditions outside its doors.

What they are saying: Safi's customers include not just affluent Afghans but also members of the Taliban, indicating a nuanced shift in the group's stance towards technology and commerce. ""Of course they need smartphones. They use social media, they like making videos,"" Safi told AP, pointing out the demand for advanced features and security in mobile devices among his clientele.

The bigger picture

Beyond individual success stories like Safi's, the overall economic narrative of Afghanistan is one of a country at a crossroads. The telecommunications sector's growth, highlighted by significant investments in network infrastructure, presents a glimmer of hope. According to the communications ministry, 2 million new SIM cards have been issued in the past two years, and subscriber numbers are growing. The government is investing $100 million in the telecom sector and has fully restored hundreds of towers. Out of the 22.7 million active SIM cards in the country of 41 million people, 10 million are for voice calls, and the rest are for mobile internet. The communications ministry's push to expand digital connectivity across the country suggests a strategic pivot towards modernizing even in times of political and social upheaval, an AP report said.

The Taliban has also entered into preliminary agreements with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to establish a logistics hub in western Afghanistan, aiming to position the country as a pivotal route for regional exports, including Russian oil to South Asia, according to Afghanistan's commerce minister. Taliban acting commerce minister Nooruddin Azizi, speaking to Reuters after a tripartite meeting in Kabul last week, announced that technical teams would finalize a written plan for the hub within two months, with investment from all three nations expected six months after discussions.

The proposed hub in Herat province is intended to leverage Afghanistan’s geographical advantage as a historical crossroads of the Silk Road, strategically nestled between South and Central Asia and neighboring China and Iran. Azizi emphasized the significance of this initiative, noting, ""Based on our discussions, a logistics centre is going to be established in Herat province, which can connect the north to South Asia.""

From spring offensive to

charm offensive

In Kabul, about 30 men, including a model and a 17-year-old with no prior job experience, form the inaugural class at a Taliban-run institute designed to foster a cadre of tourism and hospitality professionals. This initiative is part of a broader charm offensive by the Taliban to reshape perceptions of Afghanistan, despite stringent educational and societal restrictions on women. Mohammad Saeed, the head of Kabul's Tourism Directorate, notes a modest uptick in foreign visitors, buoyed by a more peaceful environment and improved flight connections with international hubs like Dubai. Despite this progress, the tourism sector grapples with formidable challenges such as onerous visa processes, severed international diplomatic relations, and a lack of robust infrastructure.

Despite this progress, the tourism sector grapples with formidable challenges such as onerous visa processes, severed international diplomatic relations, and a lack of robust infrastructure. Amidst these efforts, Afghanistan is positioning itself as an emerging tourism destination, a vision supported by the Taliban's leadership, as expressed by Saeed. The students at the institute are optimistic about their futures, with aspirations like Ahmed Massoud Talash's aim to enhance his social media presence through scenic Instagram posts, and Samir Ahmadzai's ambition to enter the hospitality business. The curriculum includes traditional Afghan handicrafts and basic anthropology, with an informal focus on understanding cultural interactions with foreign tourists—especially women, given the strict local customs. The reopening of the women’s spa at Kabul’s Serena Hotel exclusively for foreign women after a prolonged shutdown signals a tentative readiness for more international guests. However, the pervasive restrictions on Afghan women and complex global perceptions continue to pose significant hurdles to Afghanistan's tourism ambitions.

Between the lines

The survival and success of businesses like Safi's and the bustling exchange markets provide critical insights into Afghanistan's adaptive economic strategies. These stories of resilience and adaptation are pivotal in understanding how Afghans navigate their new realities under the Taliban's rule, leveraging every available opportunity to forge stability in an unstable environment.

What next: Monitoring how Afghanistan's economy adapts to the current challenges will be crucial. The resilience of sectors like telecommunications and informal finance may dictate the pace and nature of economic recovery or further decline. How the Taliban supports or stifles these growth areas could significantly impact the nation's economic trajectory and its people's everyday lives.

In Afghanistan , the economic landscape has drastically shifted since the Taliban 's takeover in 2021. The nation, once buoyed by international aid and foreign investment, now reels under severe financial distress . The freezing of billions in assets and the cessation of most foreign aid have plunged the country into an economic crisis.Afghanistan's financial woes deepen as foreign support dwindles. The takeover by the Taliban has led to a significant retraction of international financial support, exacerbating an already precarious situation. The economy , heavily reliant on aid, faces a dire future with limited immediate prospects for recovery.On the streets of Kabul, another facet of the economy thrives in the bustling money exchange market. Here, Abdul Rahman Zirak estimates that ""$10 million changes hands daily,"" with remittances from the Afghan diaspora playing a critical role. This sector's vibrancy during economic turmoil underscores the crucial role of informal financial systems in sustaining livelihoods when formal banking sectors collapse.","Afghanistan is positioning itself as an emerging tourism destination.

Economic and Geographic Factors at Play

The Covid-19 pandemic provided many Americans with an opportunity to reassess their living situations, especially with the rise of remote work . This led to significant state-to-state migration , with individuals seeking lower costs of living and new environments. However, the concept of ""sticky"" states—those retaining a high percentage of their native-born population—offers intriguing insights into American mobility, a report in the Independent said.According to a 2023 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Texas leads the nation with approximately 82% of its native residents choosing to stay. Texas' appeal includes its vibrant cities like Austin, lack of state income tax, and relatively low cost of living.Following Texas are North Carolina (75.5%), Georgia (74.2%), California (73.0%), and Utah (72.9%). These states offer various advantages, from cultural vibrancy to economic opportunities, that retain their populations.Conversely, Wyoming (45.2%) ranks as the least sticky state, followed by North Dakota (48.6%), Alaska (48.7%), Rhode Island (55.2%), and South Dakota (54.2%). These states often face challenges such as harsh climates or less economic diversity, prompting residents to seek opportunities elsewhere.For many, the decision to stay or leave their home state involves multiple factors, including family ties, economic conditions, and cultural identity.Leticia Macias of El Paso, Texas, highlights the cultural uniqueness and economic advantages of her home city, influenced by its border-town identity and vibrant local culture.Justin Morris in North Carolina appreciates the state's affordable living costs , family proximity, and the cultural scene around the Research Triangle, which allows him to pursue his artistic career.Fabian Bean, originally from Alaska, moved to Minnesota for educational and professional opportunities more aligned with his interests in politics and environmentalism.Ashley Marie Sorensen, from South Dakota, chose to settle in Minnesota, drawn by its social investments, such as strong public schools and upcoming paid parental leave policies.States like California, despite being among the stickiest, struggle to attract new residents due to high living costs and stringent property tax policies like Prop 13. This paradox shows that while some states retain their populations, they face challenges in welcoming newcomers.Pia Orrenius, co-author of the Dallas Fed study, emphasizes that retention alone isn't indicative of success. States must balance retaining residents with attracting new ones to maintain vibrancy. California, for instance, needs to become more welcoming to continue thriving.In conclusion, the concept of sticky states sheds light on the complex interplay of economics, culture, and geography in American migration patterns, revealing why some states hold onto their residents while others do not.","Texas leads the nation with approximately 82% of its native residents choosing to stay.

NEW DELHI: Race car driver . Property mogul. Private astronaut . Billionaire . Larry Connor 's resume reads like he’s a real-life Tony Stark and he’s trying to add another tick mark to his list of hallowed achievements: become the first person to venture to the Titanic shipwreck after submersible disaster that claimed the lives of four tourists. Connor, a 74-year-old billionaire from Dayton, Ohio recently announced his desire to take a submersible the Atlantic seabed, beyond the OceanGate expedition, to prove that a safe trips to the wreckage of the Titanic is feasible.But, who’s Larry Connor?Connor is the owner of the Connor Group, a real estate investment firm in Dayton, Ohio. Connor graduated from Ohio University in 1972, and went on to purchase Orlando Computer Group, who went on to become the second-largest re-seller of IBM microcomputers in the state of Florida. In 1992, he co-founded Connor, Murphy & Buhrman, that would become the Connor Group when he bought his partners out.In 20 years, the company’s assets increased from $100million to $4 billion. He has also shown a warmer side and during the pandemic donated $1.6 billion of his own money as bonuses to his associates who were earning less than $150,000 per year and also footed their childcare expenses.Connor’s monetary success has allowed him to follow his other passions that have taken him to the depths of the planet and even into orbit. Much like the fictional Tony Stark, Connor also raced formula cars in the 80s, and continued to race at various levels into the 2000s. In 2003, his team won the year’s Petit Le Mans, a sports endurance race held at Road Atlanta, in Braselton, Georgia, USA. His Team C racing outfit also won the Baja 1000, an off-road race held on the Baja California Peninsula.Not just happy with racing, he has also developed a taste for deep dives. He teamed up with Triton Submersible founder Patrick Lahey for an expedition to the Mariana Trench region. The team did three dives: to an undersea mountain in Mariana Trench, one to the third deepest part of the ocean called Sirena Deep and one to Challenger Deep, the deepest known underwater spot on the planet.For the uninitiated, the Challenger is much deeper – approximately 23,000 feet deeper – that the spot where the Titanic lays.Connor was also part of the Axiom Mission 1, in which he played the role of the pilot in the first all-private space mission to the International Space Station. When he went to space, he became the second oldest person to enter orbit after John Glenn (77 when he entered space).The billionaire hasn’t disclosed when he will start his expedition to the ruins of the Titanic.","Larry Connor, a 74-year-old billionaire from Dayton, Ohio recently announced his desire to take a submersible the Atlantic seabed, beyond the OceanGate expedition.

This commitment follows her previous pledge in 2019 to expand women's power and influence over a ten-year period.French Gates recently stepped down from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, receiving $12 billion from Bill Gates for her future philanthropic endeavors. As one of the most significant supporters of gender equity in the US, she expressed her frustration in a guest essay for The New York Times, stating that people often claim it's not the right time to discuss gender equality . However, she emphasized that ""Decades of research on economics, well-being and governance make it clear that investing in women and girls benefits everyone.""Through her organization, Pivotal Ventures, French Gates has begun directing $200 million in new grants to U.S.-based groups working to protect women's rights and advance their power and influence. These grants, which provide general operating support, have been awarded to organizations such as the National Women's Law Center, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, and the Center for Reproductive Rights.Teresa Younger, the president and CEO of the Ms. Foundation for Women, praised French Gates' commitment as part of a growing trend of major women donors generously supporting nonprofits. Younger emphasized the importance of unrestricted, multi-year funding for organizations, stating, ""If philanthropy took lessons from the way that women are moving money, we would see more money in the field having greater impact.""In addition to the grants, French Gates pledged to give 12 individuals $20 million each to distribute to nonprofit organizations of their choice before the end of 2026. These funds will be managed by the National Philanthropic Trust, one of the largest public charities offering donor-advised funds.Out of the promised $1 billion, French Gates has announced $690 million in commitments, which include an ""open call"" for applications to be administered by Lever for Change this fall. A total of $250 million will be awarded to organizations working to improve women's mental and physical health globally.French Gates' Pivotal Ventures, a limited liability company, also manages investments in for-profit ventures. The organization has focused on various avenues to increase women's economic and political participation and power, such as closing the wage gap, compensating care work often performed by women, and encouraging women to run for political office.In her essay, French Gates highlighted the high maternal mortality rates in the U.S., particularly among Black and Native American mothers. She also noted the loss of reproductive rights in 14 states, the lack of national paid family leave, and the increasing number of teenage girls experiencing suicidal thoughts and persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness.As French Gates prepares to leave the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation next week, the organization will change its name to the Gates Foundation.

Pakistan Revives China Belt and Road Initiative Projects to Boost Economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-revive-china-belt-and-road-initiative-projects/articleshow/110470413.cms,"Pakistan ’s new government is hoping to inject some fresh momentum into projects that fall under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, as it tries to boost the country’s troubled economy.The South Asian nation is looking at joint ventures for renewable energy projects , agriculture collaboration and possibly enticing some Chinese companies to relocate to Pakistan, said Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan’s federal minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, who also co-heads the committee responsible for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , in an interview.“Yeah, I’m very hopeful because I was there in China recently and I had meetings with their senior leadership,” said Iqbal at his office in Islamabad, decorated with a large map showcasing the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. “So I see great interest on the Chinese side to revive the momentum for CPEC and also to take it into the second phase.”Pakistan was seen as a flagship destination for BRI projects , with CPEC — which includes a port in the southern town of Gwadar and new power plants — the crown jewel. The progress on new projects stalled in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and amid Pakistan’s on-going economic difficulties that have required the International Monetary Fund’s intervention.Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was elected to a second successive term in February, has been looking to revive economic cooperation with China for the past two years. Sharif’s older brother, Nawaz, led the country when Pakistan signed on to the BRI in 2013.Projects worth about $25 billion came online in the first phase, including power plants that ended the nation’s chronic power deficit.A Pakistani committee approved a long-delayed railway upgrade project last week — but scaled it down from $10 billion to $6.8 billion.The project will be done in two phases “so there is not a big burden on Pakistan,” said Iqbal. The railway, in its first phase will run from Karachi, the southern coast city, to Multan, a little over halfway to the capital, Islamabad.The Sharif government has also finished some key BRI projects that were pending for years: a water-supply project in Gwadar, dredging work at the port and an electricity transmission line from Iran.“So all these things really help China see that the new government is again serious and it restored their confidence that now Pakistan is, you know, serious about CPEC initiatives ,” said Iqbal.China has also been a key financial lender, alongside the IMF, with its loans helping Pakistan avoid bankruptcy. The country is struggling with low growth and the fastest rising consumer prices in Asia. Islamabad’s difficulties have seen it fall behind on payments related to Chinese-funded power plants.To mark the tenth anniversary of CPEC last year, China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng unveiled five new corridors including one focused on growth to boost economic activity in Pakistan. The others are related to livelihood, innovation, green energy and regional connectivity. Sharif is likely to visit China soon, said Iqbal.One change in the second phase would likely involve Islamabad taking a step back while urging the private sector to forge partnerships with Chinese firms.The other big focus, albeit a long-shot prospect, is to try and attract Chinese firms thinking of relocating from China amid rising labor costs and heightening geopolitical tensions.“That would be a success because at the moment more than 80 million jobs are being relocated from China to other countries because of the high level cost in China,” said Iqbal. “They have gone to Vietnam and you know, Laos and Cambodia. There is now overcrowding there. So they are certainly looking for new places.”","Pakistan is looking at joint ventures for renewable energy projects, agriculture collaboration and possibly enticing some Chinese companies to relocate to Pakistan.

Otherwise, wind speeds atop the summit can reach a staggering 100-240 mph.Dwivedi recounted his own harrowing descent experience, describing it as a nightmarish and exhausting ordeal, compounded by the presence of a massive line of climbers ascending to take advantage of the brief weather window.The overcrowding on Everest has become a problem for years but the world’s biggest mountain has become an increasing concern to officials in recent years.Everest’s popularity hasn’t waned, despite frequents accidents and deaths on the mountain.The season is at its peak at the moment – with hundreds of climbers jammed side by side along the Hillary Step, The New York Post reported.This came few days after five people were found dead and three others have gone missing since the beginning of this climbing season, New York Times reported.High above the clouds on earth’s highest peak, climbers are making the arduous trek up Mount Everest.The narrow window of the spring summit season, which usually lasts from April to May, is the best time to climb. The weather is clearer and less windy but that is no guarantee of safety: At least five people have died and three others have gone missing since the beginning of this climbing season, officials said.The popularity of the climb has prompted concerns in recent years that overcrowding, competition and inadequate vetting of rookie climbers are making it even more dangerous.","A video of climbers waiting in long queues for their turn to ascend and descend the world's tallest peak,are going viral on social media.
