Parliamentary panel seeks price cap on cancer drugs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliamentary-panel-seeks-price-cap-on-cancer-drugs/articleshow/123623411.cms,"NEW DELHI: A parliamentary committee has recommended that the price caps enforced by the govt, for example, the existing 30% trade margin cap on 42 essential anti-cancer drugs - should be extended to cover cancer vaccines, immunotherapy, and oral chemotherapy. It has also suggested that quality of generic drugs available in the market should be monitored citing hesitancy among medical professionals in prescribing them.According to the committee, headed by Narain Dass Gupta, though the govt has taken significant steps in recent years towards strengthening the regulatory framework for governing the pricing of cancer drugs and promoting affordability, a substantial segment of such drugs remains beyond the ambit of current price control mechanisms.""The number of anti-cancer medicines under price control has increased from 40 (in 2011) to 63 (in 2022), still, a significant number of oncology medications are not included under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013, and thus are not subject to any statutory price ceiling,"" the committee has pointed out and said that this regulatory non-inclusion has led to excessive and often unaffordable pricing.""In view of this, the committee strongly recommends that the govt undertake urgent measures to expand the scope of the DPCO to include the widest possible range of cancer drugs,"" the committee on petitions has recommended.","A parliamentary committee has recommended that the price caps enforced by the govt, for example, the existing 30% trade margin cap on 42 essential anti-cancer drugs - should be extended.

Sept too likely to be wetter than normal in India: IMD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sept-too-likely-to-be-wetter-than-normal-in-india-imd/articleshow/123623336.cms,"Delhi Rain Chaos: Waterlogged Streets, Massive Traffic Jams Hit City After Sudden Change in Weather

Heaviest August rain since 1996, says IMD

NEW DELHI: Monthly average rainfall over the country as a whole in Sept is most likely to be 'above normal', at more than 109% of the long-period average, the IMD said on Sunday. It also warned of possible heavy rainfall events during the month in Uttarakhand, north Rajasthan, south Haryana, Delhi and parts of north Chhattisgarh, saying the extreme events may trigger landslides, mudslides, flash floods and urban flooding.Geographically, most parts of the country are likely to receive 'normal' to 'above normal' rainfall in Sept, while some parts of the northeast and east India, many areas of extreme south peninsular India and some parts of northernmost India are likely to receive 'below normal' rainfall, the IMD said.Underlining a trend of increasing rainfall in Sept since the 1980s, IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said it was advisable for the authorities to remain alert and take all precautionary measures to avoid potential risks.He attributed increasing rainfall in the month to shifting of the monsoon withdrawal date from Sept 1 to Sept 17 over the years, saying the interaction of western disturbances with the monsoon system during the transition month leads to higher-than-normal rainfall.The IMD's data for Aug shows that though the average rainfall during the month was merely 5% above the normal, northwest India and the South Peninsula reported 34% and 31% above the normal rainfall, respectively.This led to cloudbursts, landslides and flash floods in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and J&K; the flooding of farms in Punjab that damaged agricultural crops; and many episodes of urban flooding in cities, including in Delhi.IMD's data shows that rainfall over northwest India in Aug was the highest for the month since 1996 and the 13th highest since 1901, whereas it was the third highest for south peninsular India since 2001 and the eighth highest since 1901.Mohapatra said though there was no increasing trend of cloudbursts in the country, the data at least showed an increasing trend of 'mini-cloudbursts' that led to landslides and other disasters, specifically in the hilly region of the country. A cloudburst is a short-lived extreme weather event in which heavy rainfall occurs over very small areas (20-30 sq km) at a very fast rate (100mm per hour). In a mini-cloudburst, rainfall occurs at the rate of 50mm per hour. In India, cloudbursts occur during the monsoon season, normally over orographically dominant regions like the Himalayan region, northeastern states and Western Ghats.Citing the example of heavy rains in Chennai on Saturday, Mohapatra said cloudbursts or mini-cloudbursts are not limited to hilly regions.","Monthly average rainfall over the country as a whole in Sept is most likely to be 'above normal', says IMD. It also warned of possible heavy rainfall events during the month in Uttarakhand, north Rajasthan, south Haryana, Delhi and parts of north Chhattisgarh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123623347,imgsize-995007,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"
Ties looking up but key border difference remains; India says border peace insurance for ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ties-looking-up-but-key-border-difference-remains-india-says-border-peace-insurance-for-ties/articleshow/123621680.cms,"From Border Dispute to Terrorism: Vikram Misri Details Key Issues Raised in Modi-Xi Talks

As he reiterated the significance China attaches to a dragon-elephant tango, at a time the world is seeing “once-in-a-century"" transformations, President Xi Jinping made 4 suggestions from a strategic and long-term perspective to build a steady and healthy relationship in his meeting with PM Narendra Modi.These included deepening strategic communication and mutual trust, expanding exchanges and cooperation for mutual benefits and win-win results, accommodating each other's concerns and strengthening multilateral cooperation to safeguard common interests.While talking about accommodating concerns though, Xi reiterated China’s long-held position – stressed repeatedly during the eastern Ladakh military standoff – that India and China should not allow the border issue to define the overall China-India relationship.This latest assertion of the Chinese position that development of the relationship be ring-fenced from the border issue will likely see India treading cautiously in its efforts to normalise the relationship with China.Responding to the Chinese readout of Xi’s remarks, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said PM Narendra Modi had made it very clear that the boundary situation will have an impact on bilateral relations.“I would just say that we have been stating this from the beginning, and, on different levels, that the situation on the boundary will have an impact on bilateral relations in certain ways. Because of this, the insurance policy for bilateral relations is to maintain peace and tranquility on the boundary. So, even the Prime Minister has made this very clear,” said the foreign secretary.According to the Indian readout too, Modi underlined the importance of peace and tranquility on the border areas for continued development of bilateral relations. During the standoff that lasted for well over 4 years, India had maintained that there would not be business as usual until the border issue was resolved.However, the border issue was not a deal-breaker in the meeting that Modi described as fruitful. Xi also said India and China should work together to maintain border peace and tranquility and agreed with Modi that there has been peace and stability in the border areas since their meeting in Kazan last year.Xi told Modi an elephant-dragon dance is the right choice for both countries, while describing the global situation as both chaotic and fluid. “We are the world's two most populous countries, and we are also, equally, members of the Global South. We both shoulder the historical responsibility of improving the well-being of our two peoples, promoting the solidarity and rejuvenation of developing countries, and promoting the progress of human society,” said Xi in his opening remarks in the meeting.“It is the right choice for both of us to be friends, to have good neighbourly and amicable ties, partners who enable each other's success, and to have the dragon and the elephant dance together,” he added.Unlike the Indian statement, the Chinese readout made no direct mention of trade or terrorism but it quoted Xi as saying that the relationship will flourish as long as the 2 countries act as partners and not rivals. While Modi said a stable India-China relationship is important for both multipolar world and multipolar Asia, Xi only mentioned multipolar world while underlining the need to work together.On Sunday, Modi also had a separate meeting with Cai Qi, Member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China, and a powerful political ally of Xi. According to Indian authorities, Modi shared with Cai his vision for bilateral relations and sought his support to realise the vision of the 2 leaders. Cai reiterated the Chinese side's desire to expand bilateral exchanges and further improve relations in line with the consensus reached between the two leaders, said the government.","President Xi Jinping made 4 suggestions from a strategic and long-term perspective to build a steady and healthy relationship with PM Narendra Modi.

"E20 ethanol-blended petrol hits vehicle mileage, users bear brunt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/e20-ethanol-blended-petrol-hits-vehicle-mileage-users-bear-brunt/articleshow/123621956.cms,"E27 Fuel Explained: What 27% Ethanol In Petrol Means For Your Car, Mileage & Wallet

NEW DELHI: The admissions by the automobile industry and the govt that ethanol-blended petrol (E20) can cause a drop in a vehicle’s mileage in the range of 2%-6% is a double whammy for consumers as they keep paying higher price for fuel but their vehicles run less.Take the example of Surender Pal Singh, a Delhi-based automobile engineer, who claimed the mileage of his less than three-year-old car reduced significantly in the last 4-6 months. “The average mileage of my car was around 17-17.5 km on Delhi roads when I bought it. The mileage slipped to 16.5 km last year and I thought it may be because of my driving habits and traffic conditions. But 4-5 months back I saw the mileage touching 14.5 km,” Singh claimed, who was the principal of a major vehicle driving institute. Singh claimed that recently, he switched to “premium fuel”, which is about Rs 7 costlier, and the fuel mileage has improved, adding that he himself drives his car.Several car users have posted such observations and complaints on social media, raising questions why they should keep paying the price for a fuel that gives them less mileage.Govt think tank Niti Aayog in its 2021 report on ‘Roadmap For Ethanol Blending in India 2020-25’ had recommended that “for better acceptability of higher ethanol blends in the country, retail price of such fuels should be lower than normal petrol to compensate for the reduction in calorific value and incentivise switching to the blended fuel.Tax breaks on ethanol as a fuel may be considered by the govt”.The report had highlighted that while using E20 fuel, there would be a drop in fuel efficiency by nearly 6%-7% for four-wheelers and 3%-4% for two-wheelers designed for E0 (100% petrol) and calibrated for E10, and 1%-2% for four-wheelers designed for E10 and calibrated for E20. “However, with the modifications in engines (hardware and tuning), loss in efficiency due to blended fuel can be reduced,” the report mentioned.Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), citing two studies of 2016 and 2021, said that in testing it found E20 not to have any adverse impact on vehicles.",The automobile industry and the govt have admitted that ethanol-blended petrol (E20) can cause a drop in a vehicle’s mileage in the range of 2%-6%.

"More flash floods, landslides? IMD warns India set for wetter September; what's causing record rainfall",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/more-flash-floods-landslides-imd-warns-india-set-for-wetter-september-whats-causing-record-rainfall/articleshow/123615589.cms,"Gadget tips for monsoon: What to do and what to avoid this rainy season

NEW DELHI: India is likely to get more than normal rainfall in September, adding to a monsoon season already marked by extreme weather and heavy damage from rains.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday said that rainfall in September is expected to be more than 109% of the long-period average of 167.9 mm. The forecast indicates that most parts of the country will receive normal to above-normal rainfall, although the northeast, east, several areas in the extreme south peninsula and pockets of northwest India could record below-normal rain.IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra cautioned that intense rainfall could lead to fresh disruptions. He said Uttarakhand may face landslides and flash floods, while south Haryana, Delhi and north Rajasthan could also see major impacts.""Many rivers originate in Uttarakhand. So, heavy rainfall means many rivers will be flooded and it will impact cities and towns downstream. So, we should keep this in mind,"" he said.He further warned that heavy showers are also likely in the upper catchment areas of the Mahanadi River in Chhattisgarh.Mohapatra noted that September rainfall has shown a slight rising trend since 1980, except for lean years such as 1986, 1991, 2001, 2004, 2010, 2015 and 2019.Alongside the rain forecast, the IMD said September temperatures will vary across regions. Maximum temperatures are expected to stay normal to below normal in many parts of west-central, northwest and south India, while they could be above normal in east-central, east, northeast India, parts of northwest India and the western coast.Between June 1 and August 31, India received 743.1 mm of rainfall, around 6% higher than the long-period average of 700.7 mm. June saw 180 mm of rain, nearly 9% above normal, followed by July with 294.1 mm, 5% above average. August recorded 268.1 mm, about 5.2% above normal.Northwest India had an unusually wet August, with 265 mm of rainfall, the highest for the month since 2001 and the 13th highest since 1901. Cumulatively, the region logged 614.2 mm of rain from June to August, 27% higher than the normal 484.9 mm.South Peninsular India also saw heavy rainfall in August, receiving 250.6 mm, 31% above normal, making it the third highest August total since 2001 and the eighth highest since 1901. Overall, the region registered 607.7 mm between June and August, a surplus of 9.3%.The unusually heavy rains have fuelled extreme weather events across several states. Punjab saw its worst floods in decades, with overflowing rivers and breached canals inundating vast stretches of farmland and displacing lakhs of people. In Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir, cloudbursts and flash floods triggered landslides and caused extensive loss of life and property.The IMD said the surplus rainfall was the result of active monsoon conditions, boosted by frequent western disturbances. Mohapatra explained that disturbances between July 28 and August 14 brought heavy to very heavy rainfall to the western Himalayas and nearby plains, including a flash flood and landslide in Uttarkashi on August 5 and riverine floods in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.He added that a rapid revival of the monsoon after August 14, sustained by four low-pressure systems over 15 days, prolonged active rainfall across large areas.According to Mohapatra, northwest India and adjoining Himalayan states faced ""extremely and exceptionally heavy rainfall events"" between August 21 and 27. He said this included very heavy rain over east Rajasthan from August 22 to 24, over Punjab and Haryana between August 23 and 26, and severe flooding and landslides in Jammu and Kashmir from August 23 to 27.Other intense spells were recorded in Konkan and the ghats of Madhya Maharashtra on August 20, east Rajasthan on August 23, Jammu on August 27 and Telangana on August 28.Mohapatra said these events were driven by ""the slow movement of two successive very active western disturbances, interaction with remnants of monsoonal low-pressure systems, strong southerly winds with moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea and formation of two low-pressure systems over north Bay of Bengal and their movement across central India"".",India is likely to get more than normal rainfall in September. Rainfall in September is expected to be more than 109% of the long-period average of 167.9 mm.

NEW DELHI: Punjab is battling one of the worst flood disasters in decades, with chief minister Bhagwant Mann urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release Rs 60,000 crore of the state’s funds which, he said, were “stuck” with the Centre.In a letter sent on Sunday, Mann said that about 1,000 villages and lakhs of people have been hit by the devastation caused by the swollen Sutlej, Beas and Ravi rivers, along with seasonal rivulets fed by heavy rain in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.“Heavy monsoon rains, coupled with the release of waters from dams, have caused extensive flooding in seven districts, namely Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Amritsar, Pathankot, Ferozepur, Fazilka and Hoshiarpur,” wrote Mann.He further added, ""With the situation still evolving, there is a grave concern that conditions may further deteriorate in the coming days.""The CM said that around three lakh acres of farmland, largely paddy fields, remain submerged, with crops destroyed just weeks before harvest. “In addition, there has been a widespread loss of livestock, which is severely impacting rural households whose livelihoods are heavily dependent on dairy and animal husbandry,” he wrote.As floodwaters continue to disrupt life across the state, the Punjab government has extended the closure of all schools until 3 September.“In accordance with the directives of chief minister of Punjab, Bhagwant Singh Mann, keeping in view the flood situation in Punjab, holidays have been declared in all government/aided/recognised and private schools in the state until September 3, 2025,” state education minister Harjot Singh Bains announced. He added, “Parents and students are requested to prioritise safety and comply with the instructions issued by the administration. ”The schools had previously been shut from August 27 to August 30.Mann claimed that Rs 60,000 crore of Punjab’s funds are pending with the Centre. Breaking down the figure, he said the state suffered a permanent revenue loss of Rs 49,727 crore due to the implementation of GST and transition from the VAT regime, for which “no compensation has been provided by the government of India”.He also pointed out that cuts in the rural development fund (RDF) and mandi development fund (MDF) had cost the state over Rs 8,000 crore, while the scrapping of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) projects worth Rs 828 crore “can adversely impact the state’s rural connectivity in the long run”.“Punjab is facing a tough time due to the worst flood conditions. You are requested to release all funds of Punjab stuck with the Government of India, which is to the tune of Rs 60,000 crore,” he urged.The CM also asked the Centre to revise norms under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), calling them “totally unrealistic”. At present, compensation norms fix input subsidy for crop loss above 33% at Rs 17,000 per hectare, equivalent to Rs 6,800 per acre. He said that paying such a petty amount would be a cruel joke with the farmers, further noting that the state government had been topping it up to Rs 15,000 per acre by contributing an extra Rs 8,200.“Since the crops were almost at the harvesting stage, I feel that at least Rs 50,000 per acre should be paid to the farmers. So I request you to revise the norms of compensation of SDRF. Needless to say the state government shall continue to contribute 25 per cent as per the scheme of SDRF,” Mann said.The flood-hit districts include Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Fazilka, Kapurthala, Tarn Taran, Ferozepur, Hoshiarpur and Amritsar, with relief efforts continuing as water levels remain high.","Punjab is battling one of the worst flood disasters in decades.

Poll Do you agree with Sadhguru's view on India's ability to thrive despite challenges? Yes, I believe in India's resilience No, challenges are too overwhelming

Sadhguru on Saturday completed the Kailash Yatra on his motorcycle and returned to a grand reception at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, just 18 months after undergoing two emergency brain surgeries.He was welcomed at the Coimbatore Airport, with locals, villagers and volunteers lining the route to the ashram in a devotional procession.Speaking to journalists at Coimbatore Airport, Sadhguru noted, “As per medical advice, I was not supposed to ride a motorcycle, yet I went to 18,000 feet above mean sea level. This demonstrates the power of yoga.”Describing how yoga helped him in the journey, he said, “Yoga means you become one with the very source of creation, which is within every one of us. So when you are in touch with the source of creation, this is not a challenge. Effortlessly, I have done this at this stage.”Sadhguru began his yatra on a motorcycle, from Gorakhpur on August 9, travelling through Nepal and Tibet amid rain, landslides, rough terrain and altitudes of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. His route took him through Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Thulikhel in Nepal, before crossing into Tibet via Zhangmu, Nyalam and Saga.After reaching Lake Manasarovar, he trekked to Mount Kailash.Ahead of the journey, in an interaction with actor Dino Morea he had said, “I am not going to see Shiva. For me, the dimension we refer to as Shiva—when I close my eyes, that is where I am. I don’t have to go to Kailash for that. Kailash is the most spectacular library, but these days I am not going even for that.”He further added, “I'm taking a few hundred people with me. People when they wake up in the morning, do they say Shiva? No, they'll say stock market or cinema. So for those people with altitude and variety of other challenges, it lowers their concerns about stock market and we can get them to focus on something more profound.”Talking about the tariffs that the US has imposed on India, he said, “When challenges are thrown at us, it's for us to stand up sharper and stronger, which I think India will do for sure. Maintaining India's sovereignty, its freedom to do its business the way it wants to do, is something that we cannot give up as a free nation.”“Even when things are against you, you must thrive. That is the capacity we need to build. And this is a good example, this is a good lesson for us. To make sure that India thrives no matter what kind of conditions,” he furher added.","Sadhguru completed the Kailash Yatra on his motorcycle and returned to a grand reception at the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore.

Supreme Court Allows Stray Dogs Back On Streets, But Bans Feeding Them In Public Spaces

Poll Should there be stricter laws regarding the treatment and management of stray dogs? Yes, absolutely. No, current laws are sufficient.

NEW DELHI: Justice Vikram Nath, who headed the Supreme Court bench that recently overturned an earlier ruling on stray dogs in Delhi-NCR, made a humorous remark about the unexpected fame the case brought him.""So long I have been known in the legal fraternity for the little work I do, but I am thankful to the stray dogs for making me known to the entire civil society, not only in this country but world over,"" he said on Saturday at an event in Thiruvananthapuram, as reported by LiveLaw.Justice Nath, who is set to become the Chief Justice of India (CJI) in February 2027, also expressed ""gratitude"" to current CJI BR Gavai for assigning the case to him.“And I am thankful to my CJI for allotting me that matter. I felt very elated… well, people outside India also know me. So I am thankful to them for giving me this recognition,” he quipped. “And I have also been receiving messages saying that apart from dog lovers, dogs are also giving me blessings and good wishes. In addition to human blessings and good wishes, I have their good wishes also.”On August 22, the bench led by Justice Nath stayed the August 11 ruling by a smaller two-judge bench, which had directed that stray dogs picked up from Delhi-NCR must not be released from shelters.The earlier ruling had sparked widespread protests by animal welfare activists and dog lovers.Modifying the order, the three-judge bench ruled that the dogs should be returned to the same location from where they were picked up — but only after being vaccinated and sterilised, aligning the directive with the existing animal welfare guidelines.The CJI shifted the case to Justice Nath's bench after it was brought to his (Gavai's) notice that the August 11 order was in conflict with earlier coordinate bench orders on the same matter.",Justice Vikram Nath headed the Supreme Court bench that overturned an earlier ruling on stray dogs in Delhi-NCR.

Indian Army, J&K Police Neutralize 2 Terrorists In Bandipora, Ops Ongoing

NEW DELHI: The Army is now raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers, to enhance swift strike capabilities along the borders with Pakistan and China.The plan is to progressively raise 23 ""agile and lethal"" 'Bhairav' battalions from existing troops to bridge the gap between regular infantry soldiers and the elite Para-Special Forces. ""The aim is to have the first five such units in place by Oct 31, though it can take a little more time,"" a source told TOI.Three of the first five 'Bhairav' units are coming up under the Army's crucial Udhampur-based Northern Command, one each for the 14 Corps at Leh, 15 Corps at Srinagar, and 16 Corps at Nagrota. The fourth unit is in the desert terrain of the western sector and the fifth in the hilly terrain of the eastern sector.The 11.5-lakh strong Army is drawing 'Bhairav' commandos from its regular infantry battalions, which number 415 (each has 800 soldiers), under the ""save and raise"" concept without fresh troop accretions. ""Much smaller and nimble than infantry battalions, the 'Bhairav' units will be equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones.They will be geared for speed, flexibility and high-impact tactical operations,"" source said.These units will be in addition to the Army's 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions, each of which have 620 soldiers selected after arduous training, and are equipped with a wide array of specialised weapons and equipment.Though meant for special clandestine missions in high-risk environments, usually behind enemy lines, these crack units are often used for mere tactical operations. ""The 'Bhairav' battalions, each with seven-eight officers, are also meant to relieve Special Forces, who can then concentrate on their more critical tasks,"" another source said.The 'Bhairav' commandos will undergo specialised training for two-three months in their respective regimental centres and then be attached to the Special Forces units in their respective theatres for another month for advanced training.On July 26, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had announced the move to set up new 'Rudra' all-arms brigades, 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries, and the 'Bhairav' battalions. He also said all infantry battalions will now have dedicated drone platoons, as was then reported by TOI.A new tri-service joint doctrine for Special Forces operations was, incidentally, released on Wednesday. Apart from the Army's Special Forces, there are 27 'flights' of around 1,600 'Garud' commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.""Special Forces, owing to their agility, strategic reach and mission-specific capabilities, are uniquely suited to generate disproportionate operational effect through precision engagement, deep insertion and unconventional operations,"" said CDS General Anil Chauhan, in the doctrine's foreword.","The Army is raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers.

NEW DELHI: Dirty toilets. Delays in baggage retrieval. Long queues at check-in, security and immigration. Airports may soon pay for these lapses with reduced user development fees under a proposal from Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA).The regulator has issued a consultation paper to create uniform performance standards for all major airports - those handling more than 35 lakh passengers annually - and link compliance to tariff structures. Rewards will be offered for exceeding standards, penalties imposed for failing them. Third-party audits will verify compliance.Airport services are characterised by natural monopoly or limited competition, wherein users have limited options on service providers. In such an environment, the role of the regulator extends beyond tariff determination to ensuring that services are delivered efficiently, transparently, and to a standard that meets both operational and user expectations,"" the paper states.The proposed standards cover maximum wait times at every touchpoint - terminal entry, check-in, security, immigration and baggage retrieval. Cleanliness, availability of basic facilities, and use of tech such as Digi Yatra and immigration e-gates will also be assessed.""These standards are instrumental in safeguarding passenger interests, enhancing accountability, and promoting continuous improvement across airport operations,"" Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) said.The authority plans to categorise airports handling over 60 lakh passengers separately, citing differences in infrastructure and operational complexity.While airlines, CISF, Bureau of Immigration and ground-handling agencies handle specific functions, airport operators must ensure adequate counters and infrastructure, an industry insider said.""The aviation ecosystem is inter-linked. Ensuring checked-in baggage is on conveyor belt within allowed time is the airline's responsibility. A ground handling agency does this job for the airline and the agency has an agreement with the airport operator.

""The objections seeking exclusion from Bihar draft roll may have been prompted by fear of penal action under sect 31 for falsely claiming no prior enrolment as an elector,"" said an official.Significantly, the claims received from electors for inclusion in electoral roll number just 33,326, which is barely 16% of the objections seeking exclusion from the roll.Even at the level of political parties, the objections filed by their booth level agents (BLAs) seeking exclusion of ineligible electors (103) are more than four times the claims for 'inclusion' of eligible electors left out from the draft roll.Over 15.3 lakh enrolment applications had been received from newly eligible electors until 3 pm on Aug 31. With a nine-month gap between the last revision and SIR and the usual 2% addition of new voters every year, a figure of 12 lakh new additions on account of citizens attaining 18 years of age is normal. ""The remaining 3.3 lakh additions may be of electors who were never enrolled, despite being of eligible age,"" said an official. Around 3 lakh electors have been served notices over discrepancies in their documents - which put into doubt their eligibility under Article 326 of the Constitution that requires an elector to be at least 18 years of age and a citizen of India.","Over 2-lakh objections seeking the exclusion of 'ineligible' electors from Bihar's draft electoral roll, received till 3 pm Sunday.

Amid the threat of India-US ties sliding into a semi comatose state, and the global unease over US’ coercive trade policy, PM Narendra Modi joined hands with President Xi Jinping to expand “common ground” on bilateral, regional, and global challenges including fair trade and terrorism – both otherwise sticking points in bilateral ties - in multilateral platforms.As relations improve, Modi agreed with Xi that India and China are development partners, not rivals. It’s China which has mostly used that formulation in recent times. They also agreed their economies can help stabilize world trade.Significantly, Modi explicitly mentioned India’s strategic autonomy in the meeting saying both countries follow it, and their ties should not be seen through a third country lens. The reaffirmation of strategic autonomy on Chinese soil, which found a rare mention in an Indian press statement, is reassuring for both Beijing and Moscow, and is also a message to top Trump administration officials who have accused India of “cosying up” to China.Modi and Xi also committed to a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary question, from the political perspective of overall relations and long-term interests of the people of India and China.On whether Trump’s tariff policy was discussed, officials said the leaders focused on working towards long-term growth and development of both countries and dealing with the challenges posed by global trade disruption.Modi invited Xi for the BRICS summit next year in India and the president offered support for India’s upcoming presidency.The hour-long meeting in Tianjin, on the margins of the SCO summit, did not see any major announcement, but helped solidify the recent improvement in the relationship as Modi underlined the significance of maintaining peace and tranquility along the border areas for continued development of ties and Xi committed to reducing the trade deficit between the 2 countries.“They underlined the need to proceed from a political and strategic direction to expand bilateral trade and investment ties and reduce trade deficit,” said foreign secretary Vikram Misri, adding Modi and Xi agreed common interests outweigh differences between India and China. Modi said in a post on X he had a fruitful meeting with Xi, as they reviewed the positive momentum in relations since their last meeting in Kazan. “We agreed on the importance of maintaining peace and tranquility in border areas and reaffirmed our commitment to cooperation based on mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity,” said Modi, welcoming the return of peace and stability in the border areas and the recent agreement between the Special Representatives for border management.Modi also welcomed the decision to resume direct flights between India and China.Modi told Xi a stable relationship and cooperation between India and China and their 2.8 billion people on the 3 mutuals (respect, interest and sensitivity) is necessary for the growth and development of the two countries, welfare of all humanity as well as for “a multipolar world and a multi-polar Asia befitting the trends of the 21st century”.On the framing of the relationship as partners, and not rivals, Misri said this is what was desirable. Modi and Xi also called for strengthening people-to-people ties through direct flights and visa facilitation, building on the resumption of Kailash Manasarovar Yatra and tourist visas.Modi and Xi also discussed the border issue in detail noting with satisfaction, as the Indian readout said, the successful disengagement last year and the return and maintenance of peace and tranquility along the border areas since then. They reiterated differences should not be allowed to turn into disputes.“They expressed commitment to a fair, reasonable, and mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary question proceeding from the political perspective of their overall bilateral relations and the long-term interests of the two peoples. They recognized the important decisions taken by the two Special Representatives in their talks earlier this month and agreed to further support their efforts,” said the Indian statement.In the SR talks in August, both sides had agreed to set up an expert group to explore Early Harvest in boundary delimitation in the India-China border areas. Another working group to advance effective border management and maintain border peace is also being set up.","PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping agreed to expand ""common ground"" on bilateral, regional, and global challenges.

TOI has learnt that while Rajasthan has removed around 28 lakh ineligible beneficiaries by launching a “voluntary give up” initiative, Odisha has weeded out around seven lakh such beneficiaries who have passed away or had higher income.In July, the food ministry had written to all states to “re-verify” the 80 crore-odd beneficiaries who receive 5 kg each of rice or wheat monthly and add new beneficiaries under PMGKAY. Officials said since the original beneficiary lists were prepared by states more than a decade back, there is a need to reverify the eligibility of people.The ministry had carried out a ‘comprehensive exercise’ to strengthen rightful targeting of the free foodgrain distribution by matching the database of ration card management system (RCMS) with databases of Central Board of Direct Taxes, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, ministry of corporate affairs, ministry of road transport and highways and PM Kisan Samman Nidhi.Around 10% of the existing 80 crore beneficiaries under PMGKAY, after inter-ministerial data convergence, “who appear in one or more of the databases and may not qualify as per eligibility norms prescribed by the respective states”.The Centre has maintained that states can add new beneficiaries after weeding out ineligible ones. “There will be no reduction in the overall number. The aim is to ensure deserving people get the govt benefit,” said a source.","The food ministry will review the progress of states on Monday at a meeting of state food secretaries.

Educate Girls becomes first Indian non-profit to win Ramon Magsaysay Award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/educate-girls-becomes-first-indian-non-profit-to-win-ramon-magsaysay-award/articleshow/123616431.cms,"Safeena Husain (File photo)

NEW DELHI: India’s non-profit, Educate Girls, has been named a 2025 Ramon Magsaysay Awardee — Asia’s premier honour — becoming the first Indian organisation to receive the prize. Founded in 2007, the group has worked across 30,000 villages to enrol more than 2 million girls back in school and support over 2.4 million children in remedial learning.The award citation lauded Educate Girls for “addressing cultural stereotyping through the education of girls and young women, liberating them from the bondage of illiteracy and giving them skills, courage, and agency to achieve their full human potential.”For founder Safeena Husain, the announcement was deeply personal. “When they announced Educate Girls had been chosen, I was crying. The last 18 years flashed before my eyes. It was emotional and overwhelming,” she told TOI.Husain’s own educational struggles shaped her mission. “My schooling was interrupted for three years, but a woman supported me, took me into her home, and encouraged me to return. That changed my life — I became the first in my family to study abroad at the London School of Economics.It made me want to ensure that no girl is denied that chance.”Despite near-universal enrolment at the primary level, dropouts, especially among girls remain high in multiple states such as West Bengal, Karnataka, Asaam, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh at secondary stages. Husain said Educate Girls deliberately works in “the most rural, remote, tribal areas where the problem is most acute,” including districts in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.According to her, the barriers are clear: “Two things keep girls out of school — poverty and patriarchy. Poverty forces girls into work, but it is patriarchy that deprioritises them when families decide who gets educated. Our work is about changing that mindset through community volunteers called Team Balika.”Husain hopes the award gives fresh momentum to the cause. “No girl says she wants to stay home, marry early, or graze goats. Every girl wants to study, have friends, and opportunities. I hope this recognition gives us the tailwind to bring every last girl back to school.”She also pointed to the National Education Policy 2020 as a strong foundation. “It has provisions for second-chance programmes and distance learning. But policy alone is not enough. Society too must change its mindset. Sons and daughters must be treated equally.”Looking ahead, Educate Girls plans to expand its footprint. “The bad news of winning an award like this,” Husain said with a laugh, “is that it makes you dream bigger. Our target is 10 million learners in the next decade, including older girls who missed school. We also hope to move into new geographies, including the Northeast.”The Ramon Magsaysay Awards will be presented in Manila on November 7.","India’s non-profit, Educate Girls, has been named a 2025 Ramon Magsaysay Awardee.

""Does Jarange want 100% reservation for the Maratha community, leaving the other communities in the lurch. Any further enhancement of reservation for the Marathas would be illegal under the existing laws. Jarange needs to be told that other communities too need reservation,"" he told TOI.Bhujbal had spearheaded a series of Elgar rallies organised by his outfit, All India Mahatma Phule Samata Parishad, in Nov-Dec 2023, against Jarange's agitation on the quota issue.

"US imposes 'visa integrity fee': India, China, Mexico most affected; experts warn of tourism decline",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-imposes-visa-integrity-fee-india-china-mexico-most-affected-experts-warn-of-tourism-decline/articleshow/123604189.cms,"After Tariffs, Now U.S. To Deprive Indians Of H-1B Visas? Trump Aide's Big Hint

What are the hardest-hit regions?



Another hurdle for international visitors?



'Experts warn of tourism decline'







The United States' decision to introduce a new $250 “visa integrity fee” has sparked concerns across the global travel industry, which is already struggling with declining arrivals amid President Donald Trump’s tough immigration policies and strained foreign relations.According to US government data, overseas travel to the US dropped 3.1% year-on-year in July, with only 19.2 million visitors recorded, Reuters reported.It marked the fifth monthly decline in 2025, upending expectations that inbound travel would finally rebound above pre-pandemic levels of 79.4 million annual visitors.The new fee, effective October 1, will apply to travelers from non–visa waiver countries, including Mexico, Argentina, India, Brazil, and China.Once implemented, it will raise the total visa cost to $442, among the highest visitor fees in the world, according to the US Travel Association.The visa integrity fee is the latest in a series of measures rolled out by the Trump administration. Earlier this month, officials proposed regulations to shorten the duration of visas for students, cultural exchange participants, and foreign media.In August, the administration also announced a pilot program requiring bonds of up to $15,000 for some tourist and business visas, aimed at deterring overstays.The hardest-hit regions are likely to be Central and South America—ironically, two of the few areas where US travel has been growing this year.Travel from Mexico rose nearly 14% as of May 2025, while arrivals from Argentina were up 20% and Brazil up 4.6%, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office.Overall, Central American travel grew 3% and South American arrivals 0.7%, compared with a 2.3% decline from Western Europe.In Asia, however, recovery remains sluggish. Chinese arrivals in July were still 53% below 2019 levels, while travel from India has dipped 2.4% this year, driven largely by an 18% plunge in student visas.Travel experts say the additional charge adds yet another hurdle for international visitors. ""Any friction we add to the traveler experience is going to cut travel volumes by some amount,"" Gabe Rizzi, President of Altour, a global travel management company, told Reuters.""As the summer ends this will become a more pressing issue, and we'll have to factor the fees into travel budgets and documentation,” Rizzi added.The World Travel & Tourism Council projects that international visitor spending in the US will fall below $169 billion in 2025, down from $181 billion in 2024.Analysts warn that higher costs and Trump’s restrictive immigration stance could deepen the downturn even as the country prepares to host global events such as the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics.For the travel industry, these steps reinforce what many see as a “bleak perception” of the US abroad.""We see it as a sustained setback, and we anticipate much of it is in place throughout the administration,"" Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics, a consultancy under Oxford Economics said, Reuters reported.The firm had forecast in late 2024 that inbound travel to the US would rise more than 10% in 2025. Instead, it is now expected to contract by 3%.Some in the industry view the fee as an unavoidable burden in an already expensive travel process.""The US has always been selective about its visitors. If your financial standing isn’t up to par, getting a visa is tough anyway,"" Su Shu, founder of Chinese firm Moment Travel in Chengdu said. With inbound tourism shrinking, industry leaders fear the new visa charge could further discourage international visitors.","U.S. to introduce new $250 ""visa integrity fee"" for non–visa waiver countries.

U.S. Attacks India After Modi-Xi Jinping SCO Unity Show; 'Brahmins Profiteering' Russia Oil Barb

'Modi's war'





'Laundromat for Kremlin'

'Using our dollars to buy Russian oil'





US President Donald Trump's advisor Peter Navarro renewed his criticism of India, accusing the country of indirectly funding Russia’s war in Ukraine through discounted oil purchases—and claiming that Brahmins are profiting at the expense of Indians.""Look, Modi's a great leader. I don't understand why he's getting into bed with Putin and Xi Jinping when he's the biggest democracy in the world. So I would just simply say to the Indian people: please, understand what's going on here. You've got Brahmins profiteering at the expense of the Indian people. We need that to stop. Yeah, and we'll be watching that closely,"" he said during an interview with Fox News.Defending the US stance after he was questioned on justification for 50% tariffs on India, Navarro further said, “Before Putin invaded Ukraine, India didn’t buy Russian oil to speak of—very, very small amounts. What happened? Now, Russian refiners provide discounts, India refines it, and then sells it at a premium to Europe, Africa, and Asia. It fuels the Russian war machine.”Additionally, the Trump aide revived his “laundromat for the Kremlin” jibe at India, arguing that American taxpayers are indirectly funding Ukrainian defense as a result. He also highlighted India’s high domestic tariffs: ""25% of the 50% is because India is the Maharaja of tariffs.They have the highest tariffs in the world. They won't let us sell to them. So who gets hurt? Workers in America, taxpayers in America, Ukrainians in cities getting killed by Russian drones. ""On China, Navarro remained optimistic about ongoing trade negotiations, noting that the US maintains tariffs exceeding 50 per cent. He said the November 10 deadline is realistic, describing high tariffs as “a good thing” for US leverage.Navarro has made multiple jabs at India as the latter refuses to budge on ceasing trade with Russia which included calling the Russia-Ukraine war - ""Modi's war"", ""Kremlin's laundromat"" and accused them of fueling the Ukraine war for profit.The Trump administration, earlier this month, ramped up attacks on India for buying Russian oil, with Navarro characterizing the Russia-Ukraine conflict as ""Modi's war,"" and cautioning New Delhi about getting close to Beijing and Moscow.""India, you're the biggest democracy in the world, okay? Act like one... side with the democracies...(instead) you're getting in bed with the authoritarians,"" Navarro had said, just hours after 50% tariffs on India went into effect.Navarro's 'laundromat' remark has been made by Navarro in the past as well. “Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian oil made up less than 1% of India’s imports. Today? Over 30% -- more than 1.5 million barrels a day. This surge isn’t driven by domestic demand—it’s driven by Indian profiteers and carries an added price of blood and devastation in Ukraine,"" he had said.“India’s Big Oil lobby has turned the largest democracy in the world into a massive refining hub and oil money laundromat for the Kremlin,” he claimed, adding that India now exports more than 1 million barrels a day in refined petroleum, over half of the Russian crude it imports.Read more: From 'Modi's war' to 'Kremlin's laundromat', invectives pile up Navarro in another attack on India, accused New Delhi of using American trade dollars to finance Russia’s war in Ukraine. Justifying Washington’s newly imposed 50 per cent tariffs on Indian imports, Navarro said that Indian refiners, working with “silent Russian partners,” were making huge profits by refining Russian oil and selling it in international markets while “Russia pockets hard currency to fund its war on Ukraine. ”In a post on X, Navarro said, “India uses our dollars to buy discounted Russian crude. This isn’t just about India’s unfair trade—it’s about cutting off the financial lifeline India has extended to Putin’s war machine.”Also read: Navarro attacks India again; takes 'laundromat' jibe","Peter Navarro claims India is indirectly funding Russia's war in Ukraine through discounted oil purchases.

Asia has become the epicentre of skyscraper innovation in the 21st century. According to reports from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) , the region dominates global rankings for supertall structures, housing the majority of the tallest buildings on earth. Rapid urbanisation, economic growth, and advances in engineering have fuelled this vertical expansion, transforming skylines from Dubai to Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur. These record-breaking towers are more than architectural achievements; they symbolise cultural identity, national pride, and futuristic ambition. Today, Asia continues to push the boundaries of height, redefining what modern architecture can achieve worldwide, inspiring innovation, resilience, sustainability, and global recognition.The Burj Khalifa isn’t just the tallest building in Asia, it’s the tallest in the world.

Another 25% tariff on August 27.

Result: a 50% tariff, on top of existing duties.

Playing Both Sides on Pakistan



Tech and Defense: From Promise to Uncertainty

The Big Picture







Donald Trump has never disguised his transactional approach to foreign policy. But in 2025, his behaviour toward India has crossed into something far more disruptive. He has claimed credit for ending a May India-Pakistan conflict (a claim Delhi flatly rejects). He has invited Pakistan’s army chief to lunch at the White House, prompting anger in Delhi that Washington is “treating India and Pakistan as equals.” And he has escalated a tariff war, leaving Indian exporters facing what the US Congressional Research Service (CRS) describes as a “50% tariff on India on top of existing tariffs.”These are not Indian government talking points. They are the findings of CRS—a dry, nonpartisan research arm of the US Congress—in a briefing dated August 25, 2025. When CRS puts it in writing, Capitol Hill pays attention.The Congressional Research Service is Washington’s in-house think tank. Its analysts don’t campaign, give TV interviews, or spin headlines. They produce factual, nonpartisan reports that lawmakers rely on when voting on tariffs, arms sales, or oversight of the White House. A critical CRS report means that Congress is on alert—and the alarms are flashing red on India policy.The CRS reminds lawmakers of the long, bipartisan effort since 2000 to build India into a pillar of US Indo-Pacific strategy:But now, CRS bluntly states that “President Trump since May has taken actions that observers say put the partnership at risk.”At the centre of the rupture is economics. Using emergency powers, Trump imposed:For India, which had already reduced tariffs and withdrawn its digital services tax to smooth talks, this is a gut punch. After two decades of being courted as a trade partner, Washington has just doubled the barriers.CRS also revisits the May 2025 four-day war between India and Pakistan. Its finding is damning: “Indian officials… have expressed frustration that the President has treated India and Pakistan as equals—including by hosting Pakistan’s army chief to lunch at the White House—while Delhi holds Pakistan responsible for the terrorist attack that sparked the conflict.”In other words, while Trump claims to be “tough on terror” domestically, his official record is one of legitimising the very military India blames for cross-border terrorism.The fallout isn’t only diplomatic. It risks spilling into the two areas once touted as the “load-bearing pillars” of the partnership:The stakes extend to people, not just policy. CRS highlights:But friction remains: Washington has labelled India “recalcitrant” on deportations, and Congress is split on H-1B reform.Beyond the headlines, the CRS report offers a layered warning. It documents how India’s rise—now the world’s fourth-largest economy—made it a natural partner for successive US administrations, only for Trump’s second term to throw sand in the gears.On trade, the report is explicit: Trump’s dual tariffs could leave India facing a 50% effective duty, an unprecedented escalation that Indian officials consider discriminatory since Europe was spared similar penalties. The report notes that this has already sparked calls in India to boycott American goods, a populist backlash that Modi has countered by doubling down on his “self-reliant India” agenda.On security, CRS points to Indian anger over Trump’s “equal treatment” of Pakistan and his claim to have ended the May conflict, when in Delhi’s telling, the ceasefire owed nothing to Washington.On technology, the report shows how reduced staffing in Trump’s National Security Council threatens to stall implementation of the TRUST roadmap on AI, semiconductors, and quantum. In defense, it flags both momentum—$24 billion in sales, growing interoperability—and fragility, with the 10-year framework expiring this year and still unresolved. And on immigration, it reminds lawmakers that India is not just a policy partner but a people partner: the single biggest source of H-1Bs, green cards, and foreign students.The concluding section distils the dilemma for Congress into a set of choices: whether to loosen export controls, resource the Quad, and keep betting on India’s democratic resilience—or let Trump’s instincts on tariffs and Pakistan dictate the shape of America’s India policy.CRS closes by laying out the dilemmas now before lawmakers:CRS never editorialises. But its message is unmistakable: after two decades of careful bipartisan investment, Trump’s mix of tariffs, boasts, and Pakistan lunches is shredding the credibility of America’s India policy. For Congress, the choice is whether to salvage the partnership or let Trump’s instincts dictate strategy. For India, the warning is even sharper: if this is what friendship looks like, what would betrayal look like?","The US Congress’ own research arm, CRS, warns that Donald Trump’s second term is destabilising a relationship built over 25 years.

PATNA: Muzaffarpur's Devki Devi has emerged as a symbol of women empowerment through self-help groups in Bihar.A resident of Ratanpura under Bochaha block, she shot to fame on Sunday when PM Narendra Modi referred to her as the ""Solar Didi"" in his monthly radio programme ""Mann ki Baat"".Married at a young age to Sunil Sahni and a mother of four, Devki's family once struggled to make ends meet.She first became interested in solar energy after hearing CM Nitish Kumar speak about its potential for farmland irrigation and domestic consumption.Her family discouraged her from taking a loan to set up a solar plant in their small field, but members of the local JEEViKA group persuaded her to go ahead. Now president of the Krishna JEEViKA self-help group, Devki took a loan from a foundation and installed solar panels on half a kattha of land in 2023.""Now, I take payment from the farmers through UPI. I am helping 112 farmers by irrigating their more than 40 acres of land with solar energy and also earning a good income,"" she told reporters.Her husband Sunil is proud of her success. ""I wish her better days in future,"" he said as reporters thronged their solar pump station. He recalled the difficult period after losing his job as a daily wage sweeper at a private bank in 2022, followed by a devastating fire that destroyed their household belongings.When hunger loomed large, Devki learned about JEEViKA's solar irrigation scheme.She said that selection was through a lottery system but she was fortunate to be chosen for a loan of Rs 1.5 lakh. ""Initially, my family and the villagers said the scheme was a fraud. But I got the support of JEEViKA didis, whom I joined, and managed to get the pump installed by taking a loan at 10% interest,"" she said.Today, Devki not only sustains her family but also motivates others in her village to adopt solar power, ensuring irrigated fields and better incomes for the community.","Devki Devi has emerged as a symbol of women empowerment through self-help groups in Bihar.

Waste strewn on streets, protesters urinate in open





MUMBAI: With the CSMT area lined with protestors and their vehicles, weekend sales in the commercial hubs around Crawford Market took a beating as festival shoppers stayed away in fear. A motorist posted how his car was blocked by a mob near CSMT that banged on the bonnet and windows while raising slogans.Protestors took over the streets for cooking, bathing and washing, even hanging their clothes on traffic lights. Food packets lay strewn along roads. BMC set up more dustbins and deputed staff to three-shift duties to tackle mounting waste.Garbage lay strewn as protesters filled the area around CSMT over the weekend. Many motorists avoided taking their cars to south Mumbai in view of the massive crowds, forcing businesses in the precinct to take a hit. Some protesters even walked into a five-star hotel in Colaba and a clothing store in Kala Ghoda with banners.Eyewitnesses said they went into the hotel to use the bathrooms and sat in the lobby for some time. Some popular restaurants in the area also shut early. Many protesters were seen urinating on public buildings, enveloping the area in a stench, despite BMC scaling up services, including provision of more mobile toilets.While BMC expected around 5,000 protesters on day 1, nearly 30,000 thronged Azad Maidan over three days, forcing it to activate emergency mode to scale up services. On day 1, the shortfall was glaring-there just weren't enough water tankers and toilets, leaving protesters scrambling for basic amenities. By the third day, BMC went into an overdrive: water tankers increased from six to 25, and sanitation and maintenance manpower swelled from 119 to 1,125 as staff from four additional wards were pulled in.Waste management also saw urgent fixes. With food packets strewn across streets, 100 extra dustbins were installed, and BMC workers were deputed to three-shift duties to keep pace with the mounting garbage.Toilet facilities were initially expanded with 236 portable units and 40 mobile toilets at Azad Maidan; 50 more were added on Sunday, besides 60 in the port area.Medical aid was also ramped up. A 24x7 help desk, four medical teams and four ambulances were stationed at the protest site. Nair Hospital deployed a team, while beds were readied at GT, Nair, KEM, Bombay, St George's and JJ hospitals, said officials. Over 1,000 protesters have been treated for ailments, they said.Officials said mud accumulated due to rain at Azad Maidan was also cleared. Two truckloads of stones were laid at entry points to level pathways.""Adequate lighting has been ensured at Azad Maidan, especially in the evenings and at night. Three high-beam floodlights mounted on fire brigade vehicles have been installed. Large numbers of BMC staff from different departments are continuously working at the protest site to provide civic services. Protesters are requested to cooperate with them,"" said BMC.BMC is now bracing for more demands on its already stretched resources. ""Most protesters are being provided with food packets and water bottles. We have also distributed garbage bags. We plan to rope in labourers on a contractual basis from Monday from a private agency. This will bring in another 500 labourers on the ground. The regular ward-level staffers have to also look at Ganpati immersions,"" said an official.","Protestors took over the streets for cooking, bathing and washing, even hanging their clothes on traffic lights.

(With agency inputs)





DEHRADUN: A fresh spell of heavy to extremely heavy rain is set to lash the hill states of north India over the next few days, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) flagging this as a confluence of the monsoon trough and an active western disturbance.IMD said the interaction will intensify rainfall activity over Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir, raising the risk of flash floods, landslides, and swollen rivers. ""Extremely heavy rainfall is very likely at isolated places over Uttarakhand on Sept 1, over Himachal Pradesh between Aug 31 and Sept 2, and over Jammu on Sept 2,"" the IMD bulletin said. Overall, northwest India is expected to witness a prolonged wet spell for the next three to four days.Though western disturbances are more frequent and impactful in north India during winter, their convergence with the monsoon system can create highly unstable weather conditions.IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra attributed the torrential rainfall in Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir, and Himachal Pradesh during Aug to these two-system interactions. ""Northwest India saw three such active interactions in Aug, which led to incidents in Dharali (Uttarakhand), Kishtwar (Jammu & Kashmir), Jammu, and Mandi (Himachal Pradesh),"" he said.Rohit Thapliyal, senior scientist at the regional meteorological centre in Dehradun, told TOI, ""The intense interaction will cause heavy showers in parts of Uttarakhand for the next 48 hours. We have upgraded the weather alert to ‘red' in Dehradun, Tehri, Pauri, Haridwar, Nainital, Champawat, Bageshwar, and Udham Singh Nagar districts.""At present, the monsoon trough is running south of its normal position, while a western disturbance in the form of a cyclonic circulation is hovering over north Pakistan and adjoining Punjab. Additional circulations over Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are pulling in more moisture from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal into the Himalayan foothills, the IMD said. An official pointed out, ""This overlap of the western disturbance with the monsoon axis enhances wind shifts and moisture build-up, leading to widespread heavy rains in the Himalayan foothills. ""Mohapatra said that in Aug, northwest India recorded 265mm of rain, the highest for the month since 2001 and the 13th highest since 1901. The region has experienced above-normal rainfall in all three months of the monsoon season so far, and the trend is likely to continue in Sept.""Many rivers originate in Uttarakhand. So, heavy rainfall means the rivers will be flooded, and it will impact cities and towns downstream. We should keep this in mind,"" he said.In the past 24 hours, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh reported very heavy rainfall at several locations, while Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and parts of Uttar Pradesh also experienced downpours.With the hills already affected due to rainfall-induced disasters, fresh downpours could worsen conditions in landslide-prone areas of Himachal and Uttarakhand. IMD has advised state authorities to remain on high alert for flash floods, road blockages, and disruptions to pilgrimage and tourist routes.","A fresh spell of heavy to extremely heavy rain is set to lash the hill states of north India over the next few days.

Derivative considerations





The rupee's trajectory has become a key concern for financial markets. Banks have reduced trading exposures, while numerous importers with large unhedged positions are facing losses. Corporates engaged in over-the-counter forex derivative transactions, anticipating stable rupee levels, are reportedly worried as the currency crosses 89.The financial sector remains uncertain whether the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will allow further rupee depreciation to support exporters affected by US tariffs. This speculation intensified after the currency hit a historic low, surpassing 88 against the dollar on Friday.""It will be interesting to see how far RBI is willing to allow rupee depreciation. With exports estimated to fall a bit, bear pressure on rupee will be sustained unless US tariff issue is resolved quickly,"" said Haresh Desai, market veteran and founder of Rajwade Treasury Consultants, as quoted by Economic Times. With inflation currently manageable, analysts suggest the RBI may refrain from substantial dollar sales.Samir Lodha, former banker and MD of corporate advisory firm QuantArt, observed, ""While there was some month-end demand, the rupee slipped past 88, most probably because RBI stepped back. Left entirely to the market, these levels would have been seen a week earlier, which suggests it could be more of a 'decision' to allow the rupee to slide. In that case, further weakness in the rupee is possible."" However, he noted that market news could rapidly bring the rupee back to 87, as reported by ET.The upcoming US non-farm payroll report on September 5 is also significant. A downward revision could encourage US interest rate cuts, potentially supporting the rupee. ""In August 2024, the revised number was lower than what was initially reported. Traders are waiting to find out if that will happen this year too,"" a senior banker commented.A weaker rupee could boost export competitiveness and generate a larger RBI surplus for government dividends, particularly helpful amid expected fiscal pressures from the 8th Pay Commission and reduced GST rates.Additionally, determining the RBI’s intervention point for currency support remains uncertain, often influenced by the perspectives of key officials. The central bank may view the 50% US tariff as temporary, expecting a resolution within months.Under Governor Sanjay Malhotra's leadership, the rupee has demonstrated increased flexibility, declining over 3.3% since March’s rate of 85.47.During Shaktikanta Das’s governorship, the financial sector had expected minimal rupee fluctuations. This assumption shaped importers’ derivative strategies for dollar purchases, and changes in this pattern could affect companies, though less severely than past derivative-related losses.The 'Seagull' derivative structure involves specific call and put options at various strike prices. Importers’ profits decrease when market rates exceed their sold call strike price. Many had set strike prices above 88. ""Seagulls and call spreads are good options when managed well. With tools and understanding, they can be managed—converted into vanilla hedge or full hedge. Companies, which do nothing even when the rupee weakens, would lose,"" Lodha explained.Desai added that many corporate treasuries remained complacent despite impending challenges.Net importers and foreign currency borrowers face particular uncertainty. ""A few corporate treasuries with seagulls (and call spreads) taken as so-called 'hedges' could also suffer huge losses, and in any case massive swings in their quarterly profit and loss on mark-to-market valuation changes,"" Desai added.","The rupee's trajectory has become a key concern for financial markets.

The coming together of China, India and Russia can have profound consequences on global power equations and thereby on global trade. This will have its impact on the stock market too.”“There are two developments, one global and the other domestic, that can weigh on markets. The US court ruling that Trump’s tariffs are illegal is a big development and the US Supreme Court’s final verdict on the issue will have to be awaited. Domestically, India’s Q1 GDP growth number at 7.8% came much better than expected. It appears that the fiscal stimulus provided in the Budget and monetary stimulus provided by the MPC are acting with a lag.The proposed GST reforms can accelerate growth in the coming quarters.
