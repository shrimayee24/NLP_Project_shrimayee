Bihar polls: EC allows 12 alternative documents apart from EPIC for voting; special arrangements for 'purdanasheen',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-ec-allows-12-alternative-documents-apart-from-epic-for-voting-special-arrangements-for-purdanasheen/articleshow/124443282.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Friday issued detailed instructions to ensure proper voter identification ahead of the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, including special arrangements for women in burqa or purdah, amid heightened scrutiny over electoral rolls and voter verification.In a press note, the poll body said, ""To encourage participation of 'purdanasheen' (in burqa or purdah) women, special arrangements shall be made at the Polling Stations as per extant instructions for their dignified identification in the presence of lady Polling Officers/Attendants while ensuring their privacy.""The ECI said it is empowered under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, to issue Electors’ Photo Identity Cards (EPICs) to facilitate identification and prevent impersonation at polling stations. Nearly 100% of voters in Bihar and the eight constituencies going to bye-elections have already received EPICs. The Commission also directed Chief Electoral Officers to ensure delivery of EPICs to new voters within 15 days of final publication of electoral rolls.For voters unable to produce an EPIC, the ECI on October 7, 2025, allowed the use of 12 alternative photo identity documents, including Aadhaar cards, MNREGA job cards, bank or post office passbooks with photographs, health insurance smart cards, driving licenses, PAN cards, Indian passports, pension documents with photographs, government service identity cards, official MP/MLA/MLC IDs, and Unique Disability ID (UDID) cards.The Commission reiterated that inclusion on the electoral roll is a prerequisite for voting.The instructions come amid a political debate over voter verification. Last week, Bihar BJP president Dilip Jaiswal urged the ECI to ensure “proper verification” so that only “genuine voters” can cast ballots, particularly highlighting burqa-clad women. “We have urged the ECI to ensure that the tallying of faces of voters, especially burqa-clad women, must be ensured with respective EPIC cards so that only genuine voters get to exercise their franchise,” he said. Jaiswal also suggested deploying paramilitary forces in villages with sizeable weaker-section populations to prevent intimidation during polling.The move drew criticism from the opposition. Abhay Kushwaha of the RJD, which leads the Mahagathbandhan coalition, called the BJP proposal “a political conspiracy.” He added, “Only recently has the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls been carried out. New EPIC cards are to be issued to all voters with fresh photographs. Identification of voters is no big deal. But the BJP wants to push its own agenda.”The RJD also requested the ECI to disclose details of 3.66 lakh names deleted from the final electoral roll and urged the poll panel to restrain the NDA government from making “populist announcements” without budgetary allocation and curb personal attacks during the campaign.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) issued detailed instructions to ensure proper voter identification ahead of the upcoming Bihar assembly elections.

"HC bins Roche's injunction plea, allows generic version of only drug for SMA",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-bins-roches-injunction-plea-allows-generic-version-of-only-drug-for-sma/articleshow/124441574.cms,"A division bench of Delhi high court Thursday rejected the appeal of pharma giant, Roche, seeking an injunction against Indian pharma company Natco Pharma launching a generic version of Risdiplam, the only available drug to treat a rare genetic disorder, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). This comes as a major relief for Indian SMA patients.Govt's one-time aid of Rs 50 lakh for patients of rare diseases was not enough to cover even a year's treatment using Roche's patented version of Risdiplam, but at Natco's price for the generic version of the drug, treatment cost could be covered for 10-16 years.In March this year, a single-judge bench of Delhi HC rejected Roche's injunction plea against Hyderabad-based Natco Pharma in a patent infringement dispute related to Risdiplam. Roche's patent expires only in March 2035. However, Natco applied for a patent for an improved process for the preparation of Risdiplam and intermediates in Sept 2022. The court had ruled Natco had prima facie raised credible challenges to the validity of Roche's patent and ruled in favour of Natco.Several public health groups had opposed Roche seeking a permanent injunction against Natco, arguing that Roche's patent infringement lawsuit against Natco prioritised profits over patients' access to affordable treatment, potentially violating India's National Rare Disease Policy.Roche's patented medicine costs roughly Rs 6 lakh a bottle. An individual with a body weight of over 20kg needs roughly 2.5-3 bottles per month, or 30-36 bottles per year. Roche gives two bottles for free if you buy one, and so the patient would have to pay about Rs 60-72 lakh per year for treatment, unaffordable for most patients in India. Drug costing experts peg the cost of producing the drug at roughly Rs 3,000 for a year's supply.In April, Natco revealed in a ""legal update regarding Risdiplam launch in India"" that the ""company has decided to price the product (Risdiplam) at Rs 15,900"" per 60mg bottle, reducing the price by as much as 97%. This would bring down the cost to less than Rs 5 lakh per year. Bulk buying by govt could bring down the price to Rs 10,000 per bottle, which could bring the cost down to Rs 3.1 lakh per year, said health activists. The financial assistance for patients with rare diseases was increased to Rs 50 lakh in Sept 2024. At Natco's price, those living with SMA would be able to afford treatment for up to 16 years.The Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment welcomed HC's decision and said it highlighted harmful effects of patent evergreening, which could delay access to affordable medicines and lead to unnecessary litigation. It reaffirmed that access to lifesaving drugs should not depend on one's ability to pay.","Roche's patent expires only in March 2035.

"Rolex watch seized from Dubai based traveler at Delhi Airport, ruled 'Not Commercial' by High Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/rolex-watch-seized-from-dubai-based-traveler-at-delhi-airport-ruled-not-commercial-by-high-court/articleshow/124332777.cms,"Delhi High Court rules single Rolex watch worn by Dubai resident is for personal use, not commercial import/Representative Image

The case: Rolex seizure at IGI Airport



Customs order and penalties



₹1.8 lakh as redemption fine

A penalty equivalent to AED 6,250

Warehousing charges accumulated since the seizure

Poll Should customs authorities provide clearer guidelines for classifying personal vs. commercial items? Yes, clearer guidelines are needed No, current rules are sufficient

What the court said



The outcome



Why the judgment matters



The broader context



The takeaway



A single high-value product does not automatically mean commercial intent.

Declaration rules must still be followed — non-declaration can attract penalties.

Customs authorities must base decisions on context and evidence, not assumptions.





On March 7, 2024, Mahesh Malkani, an Indian citizen living in Dubai, arrived at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport wearing a Rolex Submariner worth around AED 56,000 (approximately ₹12.7 lakh). Believing he had nothing dutiable to declare, Malkani passed through the Green Channel — reserved for passengers without goods requiring customs declaration.Customs officers, however, intercepted him, seized the watch, and issued a detention receipt. Officials claimed that Malkani had used the wrong channel and violated baggage rules. They further classified the single watch as a “commercial quantity,” implying it was intended for trade rather than personal use.Following the seizure, the Commissioner of Customs at IGI Airport issued an Order-in-Original on January 30, 2025. The order allowed Malkani to redeem the Rolex watch for re-export upon payment of the following:The order required Malkani to complete the redemption within 120 days. Instead of paying, he moved the Delhi High Court , challenging both the classification of the watch as “commercial” and the penalty terms.A Division Bench of Justices Pratibha M. Singh and Sahil Jain heard the case and delivered judgment on September 17, 2025.The High Court upheld the customs department’s right to impose a redemption fine and penalty but disagreed with the classification of the Rolex as a commercial consignment. The judges observed: “Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use.”The bench noted that wearing a high-value watch during international travel does not, by itself, justify treating it as a commercial import. It emphasised that customs officials must take a practical view when distinguishing between personal and commercial use.While the court did not waive the fines or penalties, it extended the redemption deadline to October 31, 2025, thereby allowing Malkani additional time to reclaim his watch. The judgment effectively clears him to retrieve the Rolex after payment, while also reaffirming that the mere possession of an expensive personal item cannot automatically be equated with commercial intent.The High Court also strongly urged customs authorities to avoid arbitrary classifications in future cases, warning that such broad, blanket assumptions may not stand up to thorough judicial scrutiny.The decision clarifies an important grey area in customs enforcement: value alone cannot determine intent. A single high-end item, such as a luxury watch or jewellery, may still qualify as a personal belonging if it is clearly meant for personal use.Legal experts have welcomed the ruling as a sensible interpretation of customs law. Supreme Court advocate Dr. Sujay Kantawala said the judgment “underscores that customs must take a practical view of what counts as personal use versus commercial quantity.”The case also reflects broader judicial concern over how customs officers apply baggage rules, especially to international passengers carrying high-value personal goods.Under Indian customs regulations, travellers arriving from abroad are allowed to carry personal items and gifts up to a certain value without paying duty — currently around ₹45,000 (approximately AED 2,000). Anything beyond that must be declared at the Red Channel.Failure to do so can lead to detention, hefty fines, or confiscation, even if the items are clearly personal. Over the past year, courts have repeatedly reminded customs officials to exercise discretion, particularly when dealing with worn items such as watches or jewellery that are clearly intended for personal use.The Delhi High Court’s ruling sets a precedent for future customs disputes involving luxury items. It makes clear that:For travellers, the message is equally clear: when in doubt, declare. For customs, the case is a reminder that practicality and fairness must guide enforcement — not just the price tag on someone’s wrist.","Delhi High Court rules single Rolex watch worn by Dubai resident is for personal use, not commercial import.

Departments have also been advised to create a pool of academically outstanding final-year law students, who can assist with legal research, drafting, and other aspects of litigation.Officials said that the PM urged all department heads to reduce litigations and also to draft legislations in easy to understand and simple language for convenience of citizens. The meeting had lasted for more than two hours where different secretaries had made their observations and suggestion.TOI has learnt that taking forward his swadeshi pitch and to reduce imports, Modi asked secretaries to interact with domestic manufacturers to identify products that can be produced domestically and that the departments should handhold those industries to facilitate efficient manufacturing of the identified products locally. They have also been asked to explore the possibility of having panels of accredited third party assessors and auditors under Quality Council of India for certifying the quality of products and processes to promote trust and quality. They have been asked to see that these arrangements align with international norms for accreditation.The PM has also asked departments to encourage researchers and manufacturers in defence sector to use their technologies for commercial manufacturing of products for civilian use and to promote ecosystem for indigenous development of public digital and social media platforms.The PM has also asked the ministries and departments to have a ""whole of government"" approach in implementing initiatives, policies and schemes which involve participation of multiple departments, meaning that departments should not focus on their narrow area of work but look at the larger national perspective.","Ministries and departments have been directed to put a ""ceiling"" on the number of court cases that can be filed.

NEW DELHI: In a surprise move, Arvind Kejriwal 's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced that it will contest all 243 seats in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, positioning itself as an alternative to both the ruling NDA and the opposition Mahagathbandhan. The decision has added an interesting variable as strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor ’s Jan Suraaj also debuts this time in what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Party leaders said AAP aims to introduce its ""Delhi-Punjab model"" of governance in Bihar, focusing on education, healthcare and anti-corruption measures. The leadership believes widespread public frustration with unemployment, migration and poor infrastructure has created space for a new brand of issue-based politics in the state.""We have an approved model of growth and governance. The work done by the Aam Aadmi Party is being discussed across the country. People hailing from the Purvanchal region had contributed immensely to our victory in Delhi,"" AAP's state in-charge Ajesh Yadav said while announcing the decision.""Our national convener Arvind Kejriwal asked if they can help us form a government in Delhi, then why not in Bihar?"" he added.AAP’s move comes at a time when the opposition bloc - RJD, Congress, and Left parties - is struggling to finalise a seat-sharing formula ahead of the polls. The AAP, which earlier announced its decision to part ways from INDIA bloc in July, shortly after Delhi election debacle, has again chosen to chart an independent course in Bihar.Kejriwal's move is being widely seen as a response to the rise of Prashant Kishor, who has visited almost every corner of Bihar with an aim of grassroot expansion in the last couple of years. Prashant Kishor is promising an alternative to the traditional contest between the BJP-JD(U) and RJD-Congress that heavily depends on caste politics.AAP MP Sanjay Singh explained this: ""We have already delivered on the ground, but Prashant Kishore is making promises only. Making promises and actually implementing them on the ground are two very different things,"" Singh said.Interestingly, Prashant Kishor, as a strategist, played a pivotal role in AAP's success, especially in Delhi. His I-PAC collaborated closely with AAP charting out campaign strategies that helped AAP win massive once again in 2020.The timing of this bet also seems to be perfect for Kejriwal, and Prashant Kishor, as with nearly two decades of Nitish Kumar-led governance, political fatigue seems to have set in among voters, creating what some see as an opportune moment for a third front. It's a formula that once worked for Kejriwal in Delhi where AAP dethroned Congress mired in corruption and anti-incumbency.The same story was repeated in Punjab where AAP defeated the two traditional parties of Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal that had ruled the state for seven decades. AAP was seen as a party offering a fresh, corruption-free alternative, building on its reputation for delivering welfare policies and good governance in Delhi.In Bihar, Kishor has been attempting a similar style of politics, and now Kejriwal’s party has entered the fray, vying for the same space. But will Kejriwal's party succeed in making inroads in a state like Bihar or will it just vanish in thin air? We will not have to wait long to know, as the state votes in two phases on November 6 and 11. The decision will be known on November 14 when the election result is announced.","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced that it will contest all 243 seats in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections.

When Bhushan said veracity of the affidavits can be inquired into, the bench said, ""After experiencing such false affidavits, how can we trust these? We are not in the business of conducting inquiry.""""We would have been with you had you given details of persons whose names have been deleted without intimation from the final voter list and whether their appeals have been disposed of without proper hearing. We could have intervened. Why not a single instance cited by you? It seems there is too much passion and little reason,"" the bench told ADR's counsel.However, the bench ensured that no name is deleted from the voters' list without following procedure and directed DLSA to deploy para-legal volunteers to inquire from booth level officers about the persons whose names figure in the deletion list of 3.75 lakh, which is in addition to 65 lakh, and facilitate them in filing an appeal against deletion.On EC's charge that the affidavit contained false information amounting to perjury, Bhushan said, ""It was given to me by a responsible person. If EC is having a problem with it, the court can direct legal services authorities to inquire into it.""Justice Bagchi said, ""EC has demonstrated that the facts are incorrect. If the person who has filed the affidavit is not found at the address given, how would legal services authority inquire into it. Inquiry does not rectify falsehood."" EC, through senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, said once the allegation is found to be false, the NGO would now change the narrative. ""Their aim is to create a narrative through analysis based on wrong data,"" he said.Social activist Yogendra Yadav took over from Bhushan and alleged that the SIR of Bihar's electoral rolls has been weaponised to exclude a large chunk of voters, especially women. He said because of SIR, around 80 lakh voters have been deleted from the list. Based on data and graphics presented by him, the bench said till 2023, the number of voters in Bihar exceeded the total adult population. When Yadav said it was a problem which was cured subsequently, the bench said, ""If it (total number of voters ) was 105% of total adult population, it is a crisis not a problem. ""Yadav said there are still several lakh voters with the same name and same address. EC should employ software to delete duplicate names from the final voter list, he said, which invited sarcastic comments from Dwivedi, who said, ""Till now they were seeking inclusion.

The two have alleged that Priya usurped their father's assets by presenting a forged will.During the hearing of a suit challenging division of Sunjay's assets, reportedly worth Rs 30,000 crore, senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Samaira and Kiaan Raj, said: ""She (Priya) has made these children the cynosure of every kidnapper's dream. She has put them in danger by disclosing how much they get from the assets. Who is really greedy? She is getting 60% of the assets and 75% of the trust. She is no benign stepmother but Cinderella's stepmom. ""Jethmalani alleged before a bench of Justice Jyoti Singh that Priya was in a ""glaring hurry"" to restrict the children's share, and carried out a ""clumsy forgery"" of the will. He claimed there was ""enough evidence"" to probe the forgery, and sought a status quo on the movement of Sunjay's assets. ""She (Priya) is a nominee, and she holds the assets.How far the forgery of documents goes will have to be unravelled - there is enough evidence to conduct a probe,"" he added.Questioning the authenticity of the will presented by Priya, Jethmalani further claimed that Sunjay did not consult a lawyer while making it. ""Sunjay's digital footprints are nowhere; the digital footprints are there of the conspirators to a serious crime, which is forgery of a will,"" the senior lawyer argued, pointing out that the will's executor got it just one day before its reading.He alleged that the will was modified when Sunjay was on a holiday with his son, adding that those who forged the document got rewarded.HC will resume hearing the matter on Oct 13. The court last month asked Priya to furnish a list of his assets and allowed her to file it in a sealed cover, even as she questioned the claim filed by the two children.

BENGALURU: Karnataka cabinet, chaired by CM Siddaramaiah, Thursday approved a policy granting one paid menstrual leave every month (12 in a year) to women employees across all sectors - including government offices, garment factories, IT firms, MNCs, and private industrial units. The initiative is expected to benefit over 50 lakh women in the state, and the policy is likely to be notified soon.CM Siddaramaiah described the policy as a step toward creating a more humane, understanding, and inclusive workplace. With this move, Karnataka joins Bihar and Odisha in granting menstrual leave to women employees. While Bihar restricts the benefit to women government staff (two days per month), Odisha offers 12 such leaves annually to women employees across all sectors.Law Commission of Karnataka drafted the Karnataka Menstrual Leave and Hygiene Bill, 2025, proposing 12 days of leave for working women and two days every month for students. Of the 75 stakeholder responses received, 56 supported the move. The draft prescribes a fine of up to Rs 5,000 for employers who deny leave or discriminate against menstruating employees.According to the government's Periodic Labour Force Survey, Karnataka has one of the highest female labour force participation rates in the country, at 31.5%. Bengaluru, with a population of 14 million, is home to thousands of startups and MNCs such as Walmart and Google , as well as major Indian tech firms like Infosys and Wipro Labour minister Santosh Lad said the policy had been worked out over the past year.

Referring to the Shetty Commission recommendations, SC rejected the plea that permitting young trial judges with seven years combined experience as advocate and judicial officer would make them leapfrog over senior judicial officers who preferred the promotion chain to reach the post.The CJI said, ""If a person is meritorious and on account of merit alone gets selected directly as a district judge, there can be no question of heartburn for those who are not as meritorious...""

Research questions and hypothesis should be based on topics that fit emerging needs and priorities of the country.Based on PM Narendra Modi's interaction with secretaries on Monday, cabinet secretary T V Somanathan has written to all secretaries to explore the possibility of selection of guides through identified parameters. PhD programmes should be reoriented to promote innovation and development of new relevant ideas and technologies, he said.They have also been asked to explore the system for joint PhDs through a 'Network Project System', which includes research by multiple PhD scholars and also from different institutes. Sources said the need for the paradigm shift was flagged by a secretary during the interaction with the PM.Officials said that actual research should be qualitative, quantitative and done u mixed method, which is a practice in countries such as the US.""There should be mandatory teaching requirements and obtaining competitive grants before getting doctorate degrees. There is a dire need to overhaul the system of doctorate degrees. Countries that promote and have ecosystem for collaborative research have always been the leaders. See how they dominate in getting top prizes, including the Nobel,"" said an official.The ministries have also been asked to review the ""employability"" of various educational courses and that courses in ITIs should be revised in consultation with industries to align them with changing technologies and needs of the industry.","PM Narendra Modi has asked ministries and central departments to re-examine the method of selection of guides for doctoral degrees (PhDs) Research questions and hypothesis should be based on topics that fit emerging needs and priorities of the country, he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"
"SC: There's no age bar for having kids or adoption, then why for surrogacy?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-theres-no-age-bar-for-having-kids-or-adoption-then-why-for-surrogacy/articleshow/124441445.cms,"SC: Not for state to question couple's ability to parent kids

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that an age bar on aspiring parents under the surrogacy law cannot be enforced retrospectively, and those who froze their embryos before commencement of the law, that is Jan 25, 2022, would be allowed to go for surrogacy irrespective of their age. It also raised questions over the rationality behind the age restrictions when there is no age bar for procreation or adoption.The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act sets age limits for intending parents and surrogate mothers. It says the intending mother must be between 23 and 50 years, and the intending father between 26 and 55. The surrogate mother must be married and be between 25 and 35 years, have a biological child, and act as a surrogate only once in her lifetime. It allows single women (widowed or divorced) between 35 and 45 to pursue surrogacy.The bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan rejected the plea of Centre justifying the restrictions on the ground that children born out of surrogacy would not be cared for properly if the intending mother and father, one or both, are above the prescribed age-limit(s) under the Act.""In the present case, the parenting capabilities of the couple are being used to assail their eligibility to have children through surrogacy...It is not for the State to question the couple's ability to parent children after they had begun the exercise of surrogacy when there were no restrictions on them to do so,"" the bench said.The bench allowed the plea of three couples who are in their 50s and 60s and had frozen their embryos before 2022. They moved SC after the authority under the law refused to permit them to move to the next step in the surrogacy process. Giving a ray of hope to all similarly placed couples, the court said they can approach HCs for similar relief.It also clarified that it was not questioning the wisdom of Parliament on its prescription of age limits under the Act, and the issue before it was limited to couples who had commenced the surrogacy process before the enforcement of the Act. Petitions challenging the age bar are already pending before SC.""Thus, prior to the enforcement of the Act, the right to pursue surrogacy despite one's age did not impinge on any of the above considerations and was solely in the decision-making domain of the intending couple. It was a personal decision, with personal consequences. Although the Union of India has argued that age-limits are directly related to the welfare of children, as explained above, we are unable to accept this submission in view of the unlimited freedom afforded to couples who wish to conceive children naturally, irrespective of their age,"" the bench said.""Thus, if an intending couple had - (i) commenced the surrogacy procedure prior to the commencement of the Act; (ii) were at the stage of creation of embryos and freezing after extraction of gametes; (iii) and on the threshold of transfer of embryos to the uterus of the surrogate mother, the age restriction under Section 4(iii)(c)(I) of the Act would not apply,"" the court said.Centre had taken the stand that the law should be applied retrospectively due to concerns over the declining quality of gametes with age and the potential impact of the same on children born through surrogacy.Rejecting it, SC said, ""On the basis of concerns over gamete quality, the law does not fetter couples who wish to bear children naturally. Moreover, there is no age bar for couples who wish to adopt children under the provisions of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956, which personal law applies to the intending couples herein.""","The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act sets age limits for intending parents and surrogate mothers.

NEW DELHI: Acting swiftly on projects of strategic significance following suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), an expert committee of the environment ministry has recommended environmental clearance for constructing the Sawalkot hydroelectric project on Chenab in Ramban district of J&K.The 1,856-MW project is a major hydropower initiative on Chenab, one of the western rivers along with Indus and Jhelum that currently flow unchecked to Pakistan despite India's right to use it for non-consumptive purposes, including hydro-power generation. The construction will begin after meeting UT govt's formalities.The Sawalkot hydroelectric project by NHPC is a run-of-the-river project that will be using water of Chenab river in Ramban, Reasi and Udhampur districts of the UT.It will be constructed in two phases (6x225MW & 1x56MW for Stage 1, and 2x225MW for Stage 2) in an area of 1,401 hectares at an estimated cost of Rs 31,380 crore. The project will include a 192.5m-high concrete dam, an upstream short water channel, an underground power station, and a system to carry water back to the river.The expert appraisal committee of environment ministry on river valley and hydroelectric projects, while granting green clearances during its last meeting on Sept 26, has specified certain ""environment conditions"" and safeguards.According to minutes of the September 26 meeting, released on Thursday, the environment conditions include setting up a dedicated team to oversee environmental management activities, installing an online monitoring system for e-flow releases and a detailed mechanism of compensation for land acquisition for the project.In addition to several socio-economic and disaster management security conditions, the panel also made it mandatory to undertake a study on the project's impact on environment, by an independent agency five years after commissioning of the project. It also asked the project proponent to obtain forest clearance under the provisions of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1986, in case of diversion of forest land for non-forest purpose involved in the project, and clearance from National Board for Wildlife, if applicable.The project, with its water storage capacity, will also help India utilise additional waters as the nation, at present, doesn't have the capacity to store even 3.6 million acre-feet (MAF) of water on western rivers, the share which was allowed to it under Indus Waters Treaty. Similarly, so far, India has built only 3,482MW capacity of hydro-power generation units from western rivers out of an estimated potential of about 20,000MW.","The 1,856-MW project is a major hydropower initiative on Chenab, one of the western rivers along with Indus and Jhelum that currently flow unchecked to Pakistan.

The state govts have been asked to instruct sub-registrars to share data and follow due process while registering properties. In fact, within weeks of the top court order, the tax department had written to the registration directorate in the states.While sub-registrars were asked to share data, a verification done over last few months has shown widespread misreporting for the last three financial years. In fact, tax authorities also conducted spot verification in districts such as Kishanganj, Sitamarhi, Araria and Madhubani in Bihar, where 250-300 instances were noticed with information on over Rs 2 lakh cash transactions not being shared.Besides, sub-registrars also failed to report property transactions of over Rs 30 lakh mandated by law. For instance, officials said, over three years in one sub-registrar office in Bihar, at least 600 transactions involving property deeds over Rs 250 crore were not reported. Similarly, PAN details were not captured and shared.The problem is not so acute in UP, where officials have undertaken spot verification in districts such a Maharajganj and Pilibhit, among others.

'Democracy Under Siege': Ex-US Official Slams Trump's 'Enemy Within' Barb, Crackdown On Dissent

Who is Letitia James?







New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution, said that she is a ""fearless"" person.Calling the charges of bank fraud ""baseless,"" James referred to a civil fraud lawsuit she successfully filed against President Donald Trump and his company for alleged fraudulent business practices, which resulted in a fine of approximately $465 million being overturned by an appeals court in August.The statement also mentioned the resignation of US Attorney Erik Siebert, who departed his position after President Trump criticised him for not bringing charges against James and former FBI Director James Comey. Comey was indicted last month following the appointment of US Attorney Lindsey Halligan, Axios reported.James said, ""This is nothing more than a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system. He is forcing federal law enforcement agencies to do his bidding, all because I did my job as the New York State Attorney General."" She continued, ""These charges are baseless, and the president's own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost. The president's actions are a grave violation of our Constitutional order and have drawn sharp criticism from members of both parties.Regarding Siebert, James said, ""His decision to fire a United States Attorney who refused to bring charges against me—and replace them with someone who is blindly loyal not to the law, but to the president—is antithetical to the bedrock principles of our country."" She added, ""This is the time for leaders on both sides of the aisle to speak out against this blatant perversion of our system of justice.""The Attorney General concluded, ""I stand strongly behind my office's litigation against the Trump Organization. We conducted a two-year investigation based on the facts and evidence—not politics. Judges have upheld the trial court's finding that Donald Trump, his company, and his two sons are liable for fraud.""""I am a proud woman of faith, and I know that faith and fear cannot share the same space. And so today I am not fearful, I am fearless, and as my faith teaches me, no weapon formed against me shall prosper. We will fight these baseless charges aggressively, and my office will continue to fiercely protect New Yorkers and their rights. And I will continue to do my job.""In response, Halligan stated, ""No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust. The facts and the law in this case are clear.""Letitia “Tish” James is the 67th Attorney General for the state of New York. Elected in 2018, she became the first woman of colour to hold statewide office in New York and the first woman to be elected Attorney General. James brings decades of experience and a strong record of achievements to her role as a powerful and effective attorney.Prior to her current position, she was the public advocate for the City of New York. Elected in 2013, she became the first woman of colour to hold citywide office. During her tenure, her office passed more legislation than all previous public advocates combined, including a groundbreaking law that banned questions about salary history from the employment process to address the pervasive gender wage gap.Before serving as public advocate, James represented the 35th Council District in Brooklyn in the New York City Council for ten years. As a council member, she passed the Safe Housing Act, legislation that required landlords to improve living conditions for tenants in New York City’s worst buildings.Prior to her election to the City Council, James was head of the Brooklyn Regional Office of the New York State Attorney General’s Office. James began her career as a public defender at the Legal Aid Society. A proud Brooklynite, she is a graduate of Lehman College and Howard University School of Law.","New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution.

Finland, regularly recognised as the world’s happiest country in the World Happiness Report, attracts global talent thanks to its outstanding quality of life, robust social welfare system, and stunning natural landscapes. For Indian citizens, obtaining permanent residency (PR) in this Nordic nation provides full rights to live and work, options for family reunification, and a route to citizenship. Recent 2025 immigration updates have simplified the process for non-EU skilled professionals, positioning Finland as an appealing destination amid labour shortages in sectors like IT, healthcare, and engineering.Finland’s permanent residency offers non-EU nationals — including Indians — the right to live and work in the country indefinitely, along with access to essential public services such as healthcare and education. It also provides the freedom to travel freely within the Schengen Area. Unlike temporary residence permits, permanent residency does not expire, though the residence card itself must be renewed every five years within the specified timeframe. However, this status should not be confused with Finnish citizenship, which comes with stricter requirements — including proof of language proficiency and a longer period of continuous residence, typically eight years.The 2025 immigration updates focus primarily on The 2025 immigration updates focus primarily on work visas and family reunification, rather than directly on permanent residency. Under the new rules, family sponsors must have lived in the country for a minimum of two years, and spouses are required to be at least 21 years old. At the same time, work permits have been simplified for specialists, with fast-track processing available for high-salary positions, which now require a monthly gross income of EUR 1,600 (around INR 1.65 lakh).To be eligible, you need to have lived in Finland continuously for four years under a Type A (continuous) residence permit, starting either from your entry into the country or from the date the permit was granted. Periods spent on Type B (temporary) permits for short-term work are not counted toward this requirement. Moreover, you must have physically resided in Finland for at least two out of these four years, with any time spent abroad for holidays or work properly documented.The basis for your temporary permit, like employment, family ties, must still hold, for you to apply for a PR. Permanent Residence is not available to students or those on job-seeker permits. Before submitting a PR application, you must first transition to a Type A work or family-based permit.Although permanent residency doesn’t directly mandate these, obtaining the initial Type A permit typically requires financial and professional stability. For employment-based applications, candidates must either earn at least EUR 40,000 annually (around INR 41.3 lakh) or hold a recognised master’s/postgraduate degree with a minimum of two years of relevant experience. Alternatively, demonstrating C1-level proficiency in Finnish or Swedish along with three years of work experience can also strengthen eligibility.Applicants must provide a clean criminal record (police clearance from India), valid health insurance, and proof of accommodation. They should have no outstanding debts or dependence on social welfare. Any criminal history may negatively impact the approval process.Indians typically start with a temporary residence permit application from India, then apply for PR after four years while in Finland. Processing can take a long time so be flexible with your plans.Secure a job offer, university admission, or family tie. Apply online via Enter Finland or at VFS Global centres in India. Submit biometrics and documents like passport, job contract, salary proof, apostilled certificates, and police clearance.Live in Finland on your Type A permit, extending as required.Gather passport, photos, proof of residence, income/salary slips, educational certificates, trip logs (absences), and family details if applicable.Apply in Finland before your current permit expires. Use Enter Finland with Finnish ID for faster processing.Prove identity at a Migri service point Check status via Migri's Processing Time Checker. If approved, collect your biometric PR card.Rejections (e.g., due to incomplete docs) can be appealed within 30 days for a fee of approximately EUR 260. .For unemployed permit holders, a three-month grace period applies to find new work.Here are some benefits and considerations for Indians: Indians have the perks of indefinite stay, family sponsorship, Schengen travel, free education/healthcare, and a path to citizenship after eight years (with language tests). However there are some challenges that come with this. Some of the challenges are cold climate, language barriers (Finnish/Swedish), high living costs overall, which require proper preparation and adaptability for a smooth transition to life in Finland, ensuring long-term comfort and success.Also See: Sweden becomes the first country to be prescribed by doctors: Inside “The Swedish Prescription” campaign","Finland’s permanent residency offers non-EU nationals — including Indians — the right to live and work in the country indefinitely.

MUMBAI: After almost a decade of anticipation, Mumbai's first underground Metro line saw a roaring start Thursday, with 1,46,087 commuters using it by 9pm. The entire 33.5km of the Aqua Line (Metro 3) between Aarey and Cuffe Parade has finally connected south Mumbai and the suburbs via an underground rail link.The ridership figure till early afternoon was almost equal to the average daily ridership of around 60,000 recorded when only the Aarey-JVLR to Acharya Atre Chowk section was operational-and that was for an entire day. The sharp rise reflects the strong demand for direct connectivity to south Mumbai's business and govt districts. In comparison, on Oct 7, when Phase 1 (Aarey-JVLR-BKC) opened, the ridership was much lower at 18,015, while it stood at 32,791 on May 10 when Phase 2A (Aarey JVLR-Acharya Atre Chowk) commenced.With the final phase now open, the Aqua Line has become Mumbai's first and the country's longest fully underground Metro corridor constructed in one go. Passenger inflow picked up after 8.30am, with steady crowds reported at Worli, Dadar, Vidhan Bhavan, CSMT and Churchgate stations.Many said the new line helped them skip long wait at BEST bus stops and avoid expensive taxi rides to the island city. BEST buses from Mantralaya, for instance, ran with visibly fewer passengers.At the main bus stop outside CSMT station, the crowd was nearly half compared to other days and three buses were spotted back to back waiting for passengers at 11am. A few taxi drivers at the stand outside CSMT were seen approaching commuters, requesting them to take share cabs to Fountain and Nariman Point.""I used to wait 20 minutes at Worli depot for a BEST bus and then crawl through traffic for an hour to reach Nariman Point,"" said Ramesh Jadhav, who works with an insurance firm at Cuffe Parade. ""Today, I boarded the Metro at 9am and reached Hutatma Chowk in 19 minutes. The fare was Rs 20.""A TOI travel-time comparison across key corridors found the Aqua Line has significantly cut commute time and costs. A trip from Aarey to Cuffe Parade took 58 minutes on the Metro compared to 1 hour 22 minutes by car, at one-tenth the cost-Rs 70 versus nearly Rs 800. From BKC to Churchgate, the Metro took 31 minutes (Rs 30) against 36 minutes (Rs 560) by car. Between T2 and CSMT, it clocked 40 minutes (Rs 50) compared to 56 minutes (Rs 929) on the road. Overall, travel time was down up to 40% and costs by 80%.Neha Shah, a bank employee who travels from Marol to BKC, said her daily routine has transformed. ""By road I spent Rs 200 a day on auto and still reached late. Now it's Rs 40 and 25 minutes flat. I can actually plan meetings knowing I'll be on time,"" she said.During the evening peak hours, passenger turnout was exceptionally high at Vidhan Bhavan station in Nariman Point. To ensure smooth crowd movement and safety, one of the seven entry gates to the station was closed for around 10 minutes. Officials said the CSMT-Churchagate-Vidhan Bhavan stretch appeared to be the most patronised route.BKC Metro too witnessed huge rush during evening peak hours. One commuter said he stays near Vidhan Bhavan and works at BKC. ""It's wonderful to have this direct link from workplace to home.""Girgaon's Hitesh Ashara, who works as a broker at Diamond Bourse in BKC, called it a game-changer. ""I would spend Rs 40 daily on auto. Also, there were daily refusals.""The Metro has eased travel within south Mumbai too. Satish Menon, who works near Mantralaya, said, ""Earlier, I would get off at CSMT and take a shared cab. Now I go to Vidhan Bhavan and walk.""Cuffe Parade's Sadashiv Amin said the Metro is a ""major relief"" for local residents as cabbies would demand exorbitant fares to Churchgate railway station while buses had poor frequency. ""I can now get seamless connectivity.""A TOI team that travelled the entire Aarey-Cuffe Parade route found trains moderately crowded between Marol, BKC, Dadar and Worli during morning hours, with standing passengers. Ridership thinned slightly south of CSMT after noon but remained steady through the day. Families and senior citizens were also seen taking exploratory rides. Usha and Vijay Patil, a retired couple from Dadar, said, ""From Dadar to Girgaon it took 23 minutes and cost Rs 30. ""The full-line opening created buzz online.

""Water that was supposed to pass into the secondary drains, instead gushed into the carriageway,"" said a senior GBA engineer.According to data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the highest rainfall was recorded in Bommanahalli at 34 mm, followed by HSR Layout with 24 mm, HAL Airport Station 2 with 23.5 mm, and Garudacharpalya with 19.5 mm.The downpour was concentrated along the city's southeastern belt.In Begur, the situation was particularly grim. ""The drain overflows every time it rains, and the entire street is in knee-deep water.Since this is a low-lying area, it gets flooded within minutes,"" said Sathyanarayan G.K., a resident of Classic Layout, Begur, who alleged that repeated complaints lodged with the authorities have fallen into deaf ears.His frustration was echoed by Kiran Kumar from the same layout in Begur, who said: ""Such is life in Begur. Every time the sewage water gushes in, we are doomed. We cannot even step out of our homes, and the stench is unbearable.""In HSR Sector 6, citing incomplete civic works, Arvind Krishnan pointed out: ""Half the road has been dug up for the BWSSB drain works, and the rest is filled with silt. They promised to finish the relaying before the monsoon, but nothing moved.""Divya Suresh, from HSR Sector 7, added: ""Near the Agara Lake junction, the stormwater drain overflowed and sewage mixed with rainwater. It's unbearable — the stench, mosquitoes, and traffic jams have made life miserable.""With residents at their wits' end, a BWSSB official reasoned: ""We are carrying out underground secondary drainage works to ensure the sewage flows smoothly without choking the roads. However, frequent clogging happens because of garbage dumped by residents. Moreover, our work was delayed by the monsoon.""Traffic police, too, struggled to manage the chaos with a tailback stretching over more than 3 km on the downward ramp to Bommanahalli.A police official at Madiwala said: ""There is severe waterlogging on the exit ramp from the Silk Board flyover towards Bommanahalli. With the service roads choked, our teams are diverting traffic to the inner roads.""Meanwhile, Bellandur police said waterlogging was a recurring issue along the stretch, but an even bigger problem was two-wheeler riders parking their vehicles by the roadside to take shelter from the rain.""Cars get stuck between these parked bikes, leading to a jam that stretches for nearly 2 km. Though the rain stopped around 7:30 pm, traffic had already piled up, which took another 20 minutes to clear,"" a police official added.","Heavy rains lashed the city's tech corridor, leaving commuters stranded in knee- deep water and vehicles crawling in bumper-to-bumper traffic.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court granted anticipatory bail to Big Boss fame Ajaz Khan on Thursday. Delhi Police's Cyber Police Station have registered an FIR over objectionable post on social media against a YouTuber and his family.The case was filed by a woman and her son, who is a YouTuber.The Delhi HC said, ""The freedom of 'speech' and 'expression' granted by the Constitution under Article 19 must be exercised within the bounds of the reasonable restrictions it places. When the speech crosses the line into insult, humiliation or incitement, it collides with the right to dignity.""Justice Ravinder Dudeja granted anticipatory bail to Ajaz Khan, on the condition that he furnish a bail bond of Rs 30,000 along with one surety if arrested.The High Court granted anticipatory bail to Ajaz Khan, noting that the digital devices were already in the custody of the Bombay Police and that the petitioner had undertaken to cooperate in the investigation and provide his voice sample to the FSL, which tilted the balance in his favour.""Accordingly, in the event of arrest, petitioner shall be released on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Arresting Officer or Investigating Officer or SHO,"" Justice Ravinder Dudeja ordered on October 9.While granting anticipatory bail, the high court imposed conditions, including that the accused shall surrender his passport before the investigating officer and shall not leave the country without prior permission of the trial court. He shall cooperate in providing his voice samples to the investigating agency as and when directed.While disposing of the petition, the High Court advised to use social media with caution.Justice Dudeja said, ""The internet has made knowledge easily accessible by intensifying its circulation. With this, however, it has also brought a large audience of every age group. Thus, any content on the internet is porous and accessible to a large audience. Every content on the internet must be uploaded with great caution, especially when the uploader has a large audience and exercises influence in society.""The High Court noted that both the petitioner and the son of the complainant are social media influencers, having a large set of audience. The audience may be influenced by the material posted by them, and thus even if the content is deleted after it is posted by them, it would reach a large set of audience, thereby leading to republishing of the same content/sparking a debate over the content among their followers, which eventually affects the victim.""Thereby, one should cautiously use social media before posting any content, as it might adversely affect not only the particular individual but their respective fans also at the same time,"" Justice Dudeja said.Ajaz Khan’s anticipatory bail plea was filed through advocates Khalid Akhtar and Mohd Shadan. His plea had earlier been rejected by the trial court on August 5.This case arises out of reposting on Instagram by the petitioner of a video originally created and uploaded on YouTube by the complainant's son titled ""A DAY WITH NAJAYAZ KHAN"".It was stated that the said video contains multiple offensive, defamatory, and obscene references to the Petitioner, including derogatory remarks, obscene gestures, and false imputations.The Petitioner neither created, scripted, nor endorsed the video, and it was already in the public domain before the repost. The Petitioner promptly deleted the reposted content, the plea had said.Ajaz Khan was called by the police many times to join the investigation, but he failed to do so.

He only became aware about during the arguements before the trial court.It was also stated that after second notice, Khan sent an email to seeking some time to appear.It was also stated that he has joined investigation pursuant to the Order of Bombay High Court in another case registered at Thane Maharashtra.The brief facts of the case is that the son of the Complainant who is a social media influencer, having about 16 million followers on Youtube and several million followers on various other social media handles, made a 35 minutes video titled ""a day with najayaz khan"" and posted thesame on several social media handles, including ""youtube"", wherein he mimicked the applicant using all sort of derogatory words, abuses, obscene gestures and in its aftermath, the applicant (Khan) made a retaliatory Video.",The Delhi High Court granted anticipatory bail to Big Boss fame Ajaz Khan on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: In the murky inheritance battle being fought over Sunjay Kapur's assets, a dramatic fairytale reference was made in Delhi high court when his wife Priya Kapur was accused of being ""greedy"" and behaving like ""Cinderella's stepmother"" by the late businessman's children from ex-wife Karisma Kapoor on Thursday. The two have alleged that Priya usurped their father's assets by presenting a forged will.During the hearing of a suit challenging division of Sunjay's assets, reportedly worth Rs 30,000 crore, senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Samaira and Kiaan Raj, said: ""She (Priya) has made these children the cynosure of every kidnapper's dream. She has put them in danger by disclosing how much they get from the assets. Who is really greedy? She is getting 60% of the assets and 75% of the trust. She is no benign stepmother but Cinderella's stepmom. ""Jethmalani alleged before a bench of Justice Jyoti Singh that Priya was in a ""glaring hurry"" to restrict the children's share, and carried out a ""clumsy forgery"" of the will. He claimed there was ""enough evidence"" to probe the forgery, and sought a status quo on the movement of Sunjay's assets. ""She (Priya) is a nominee, and she holds the assets.How far the forgery of documents goes will have to be unravelled - there is enough evidence to conduct a probe,"" he added.Questioning the authenticity of the will presented by Priya, Jethmalani further claimed that Sunjay did not consult a lawyer while making it. ""Sunjay's digital footprints are nowhere; the digital footprints are there of the conspirators to a serious crime, which is forgery of a will,"" the senior lawyer argued, pointing out that the will's executor got it just one day before its reading.He alleged that the will was modified when Sunjay was on a holiday with his son, adding that those who forged the document got rewarded.HC will resume hearing the matter on Oct 13.The court last month asked Priya to furnish a list of his assets and allowed her to file it in a sealed cover, even as she questioned the claim filed by the two children. Priya disclosed they had already received Rs 1,900 crore from the family trust.

Zoho’s homegrown messaging app Arattai recently gained immense popularity. Rival to WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal the app surged to the top spot in India’s app stores. The app has now received attention from Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra . Recently, Mahindra took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to reveal that he has downloaded the Arattai app, prompting a response from Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu. Launched in 2021, Arattai—meaning “chat” in Tamil—was initially seen as a niche side project.

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe.

""The short-term sentiment remains positive, with the index sustaining above the critical moving averages on the daily timeframe.

Globally, the GAZA peace accord signals an end to the conflict and reduction of geopolitical risk from the region. Domestically, there are indications of a trade deal between US and India with India ‘rebalancing’ its oil purchases. These positive developments and the shift in FII strategy ( FIIs were buyers in the cash market in the last three trading days) bode well for the market.Even though valuations continue to be relatively high compared to most other markets, short-covering can take the market higher. This is a highly probable event since the short position in the market continues to be high. The better-than-expected results from TCS, which reported better revenue and margin numbers, can lift sentiments for IT stocks.”“A significant market trend is the elevated enthusiasm in the primary market. The Rs 11607 crore LG Electronics IPO getting oversubscribed 54 times is the reflection of exuberance in the IPO market. Refunds from these and other IPOs will add to the liquidity in the market helping the market to move higher.""US markets closed lower on Thursday as investors consolidated positions before the third-quarter earnings season, lacking economic data or significant market drivers.Asian equity markets fell at the opening following a pause in US stock gains, as concerns emerged about high valuations after their continuous upward movement.Oil prices remained stable in early Asian trading on Friday, following a decline exceeding 1% in the previous session.

We were together in Mumbai and Dubai,"" said Digin.He added, ""We live in the same compound here, but in different buildings.""Digin recalled the events from that day. He said that Hariraj had dropped off his wife and son and then picked up his roommate Sujith, who returned from Kerala, from the same airport.""It was a special day for us, because it was our daughter's birthday. So, after returning from the airport, he came to my apartment, and we spent some nice time together. We had a cake cutting ceremony, and he gifted my daughter and played with my children. All my children are very close to him,"" he added.Digin said that Hariraj had come with Sujith, and around 9 pm both returned. By then, his wife and son had reached home and video-called him. Afterward, he had his dinner and was browsing something on his tablet, according to Gulf News.""It was around 11:40pm that he felt uneasy, and then Sujith called me and another friend from their building, and the ambulance also,"" said Digin.He rushed to Hariraj’s house in his car and within two minutes, the ambulance arrived.

""Doctors tried for almost half an hour to revive him, but they couldn't save him,"" Digin said.Digin said Hariraj was diabetic but it was under control with diet and yoga. He also played badminton regularly.Remembering Hariraj, Digin said that he was very close to his grandmother, his brother and his parents, especially his mother, whom he called every day without fail.""It was heartbreaking to see the grief of his family including many cousins at the funeral,"" Digin said.Hariraj had completed his B.Tech from CUSAT, Kerala and M.Tech from IIT, Madras, one of India’s most prestigious institutions.""He will always be remembered for his smile and friendly behaviour. Several friends and colleagues came to bid him farewell before we took him home. Many of his friends from school and university attended his funeral also,"" Digin added.One of his juniors living in Dubai, Amal Gireesh, said: ""He is gone too soon. It is a big loss for all of us.""Paying tribute, Digin’s wife Sini Susan wrote: ""He was more than just a brother. He was the life of our family, and without him, our future feels like a mere skeleton — bare and empty. He was the one who brought joy, laughter, and fulfillment to our lives. You were with us for years, and your presence made life richer. Your loss is unbearable, and the void you've created can't be filled. The kids will miss your fun, gifts, and laughter. You were a great brother, always supporting and caring for us.""","Hariraj Sudevan, 37, an engineer from India working in the UAE, passed away just hours after seeing off his visiting family at the airport.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

PUNE: Kerala Tourism will host India’s first travel literary festival, ‘Yaanam 2025: Tales, Trails & Journeys’, from 17 to 19 October 2025 at Ranga Kala Kendram, Varkala, Kerala, informed Mr Sajeev K R, Tourist Information Officer, Kerala Tourism. He was speaking to the media in Pune at an event organised by the Kerala Department of Tourism.Sajeev K R said the three-day festival will bring together travellers, writers, artists and adventurers to share stories and experiences through panels, trails and performances. Designed to spotlight Varkala as an experiential destination, Yaanam also fosters cultural exchange, narrative tourism and sustainable travel. The festival complements Kerala Tourism’s innovative initiatives, strengthening the state’s global tourism appeal.He added that Kerala Tourism, which recently showcased its readiness for Destination Weddings and Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions (MICE) at the Wedding and MICE Conclave in Kochi, will vigorously present these strengths in B2B meets and trade fairs.According to Shri Biju K, Secretary – Tourism, Government of Kerala, Kerala, endowed with pristine natural beauty, vibrant culture and rich heritage, is quickly emerging as a preferred hub not only for destination weddings but also for MICE events.With its spectacular landscapes, world-class facilities and a seamless blend of tradition and modernity, the state is attracting event planners, couples and corporate clients looking for a distinctive and memorable experience.Sajeev K R further said that, to entice tourists, the festival will also highlight events like the Kochi-Muziris Biennale (12 December 2025 – 31 March 2026), hailed as India’s most significant new-age art event, and the Champions Boat League (CBL) (19 September – 6 December 2025), which began on 19 September at Kainakkary in Alappuzha.Alongside these new initiatives, the state’s core attractions such as beaches, hill stations, houseboats and backwaters will enhance the overall visitor experience. Kerala offers a variety of experiences for travel enthusiasts, including houseboats, caravan stays, plantation visits, jungle resorts, homestays, Ayurveda-based wellness programmes, adventure activities and countryside walks, including trekking to verdant hills.Kerala continues to set records in domestic tourism, attracting 22,246,989 visitors from across India in 2024. The state aims to build on this growth following the resurgence of tourism post-COVID-19, said Sajeev K R.","Kerala Tourism will host India’s first travel literary festival, ‘Yaanam 2025: Tales, Trails & Journeys’ Designed to spotlight Varkala as an experiential destination, Yaanam also fosters cultural exchange, narrative tourism and sustainable travel.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124443067,imgsize-1071161,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/kerala-tourism-is-launching-india39s-inaugural-travel-literary-festival-39yaanam-202539.jpg"
"Adani Enterprises, IndiGo & more: Top stocks to buy on October 10; check list",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/top-stocks-to-buy-on-october-10-check-list-adani-enterprises-prestige-estates-projects-indigo-pvr-inox-eternal/articleshow/124443025.cms,"



Jefferies has a buy rating on Adani Enterprises with the target price at Rs 3,000. Analysts said Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA)’s inauguration marks a strategic expansion in India’s aviation infrastructure, easing congestion for Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). Phase-1 adds 2 crore passenger capacity (total: 9 crore), and bridges gaps to underserved regions. The company’s dual airport strategy— owning NMIA/Mumbai International Airport (MIAL)—enables coordinated slot allocation and removes intra-regional competition. Analysts also feel a strong non-aero focus across retail, hospitality, and RE should enhance monetisation, positioning NMIA as a high-growth asset in Adani’s airport portfolio.Nomura has a buy on Prestige Estates Projects with the target price at Rs 1,900. Analysts said the company’s presales grew 50% year-on-year to Rs 6,000 crore during the last quarter which was ahead of estimates. The beat was driven by one more plotted development launch towards fag end of the quarter and stronger-than-expected sustenance sales of roughly Rs 4,000 crore. One key theme which analysts believe is reflecting in the second quarter of FY26 is the strong sustenance sales from existing inventory.Goldman Sachs has a buy on Interglobe Aviation (Indigo) with a target price of Rs 6,000. Analysts said that recent trends highlight a moderation in domestic air traffic, though international traffic continues to demonstrate strong growth. They feel with capacity expansion and robust demand across global routes, expect international travel to remain the primary engine for growth in coming quarters. They also expect market leader IndiGo to deliver strong growth in international expansion. IndiGo is well-positioned to capitalize internationally with better pricing, and a more extensive pipeline of new routes, helping it sustain growth.CLSA has an outperform rating on PVR Inox with the target price at Rs 1,920. Analysts said that the domestic gross box office collections were up 20% on an annual basis for the year-to-date (YTD) and festive season ahead should help to allay concerns over structural risks for multiplexes, including from streaming services. They believe India has immense movie content and YTD Bollywood/Hollywood film releases were up by ~25%. Meanwhile sector leader PVR Inox with 1,743 screens across 111 cities continues to expand, funded by internal accruals.Citigroup has a buy rating on Eternal with the target price raised to Rs 395 from Rs 320. Analysts feel growth momentum in Blinkit remains stellar, and the focus on user acquisition is visible in acceleration in app-traffic, continued investment in dark store expansion, and new cities additions. They believe this has further solidified Blinkit’s market leadership in recent quarters, driving upside to growth and margins. In the food delivery business, they continue to expect stable trends with growth in the mid-high teens range.","Jefferies has a buy rating on Adani Enterprises with the target price at Rs 3,000.

Yes, increased vigilance is needed No, current measures are sufficient

What it means for India?







After suffering major losses at home -- Muridke terror camp - during Operation Sindoor , Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has reportedly formed a covert alliance with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), the South Asian wing of ISIS, allegedly engineered and funded by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Reports indicate the alliance aims to target Baloch people, with possible expansion to Jammu and Kashmir.A circulated video on social media shows LeT commander Rana Muhammad Ishfaq training with ISKP’s Shafiq Mengal at an undisclosed location in Balochistan.A recently surfaced photograph shows ISKP’s coordinator in Balochistan, Mir Shafiq Mengal, handing a pistol to Rana Muhammad Ashfaq, a senior LeT commander -- a symbolic gesture signalling formal coordination between the two groups under ISI patronage.Mir Shafiq Mengal has helped establish ISKP bases in Mastung and Khuzdar and reportedly led death squads against separatists. LeT’s longstanding presence in Quetta has facilitated the growing closeness between the groups.Meanwhile, this covert alliance between the two terror groups could raise serious concerns for India, as it is reportedly aimed at expanding operations in the Kashmir region, raising major security concerns.Intelligence sources say the goal is evident: to crush the Baloch insurgency, strengthen Pakistan’s control over Afghanistan’s unstable border regions, and restart terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir while maintaining plausible deniability.Observers note a worrying shift in ISKP’s propaganda magazine 'Yalgaar', which signals an expressed intent to extend operations into the Kashmir Valley, apparently coordinated and supported by Pakistan’s deep state.Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has a long history of terror attacks on Indian soil, including 26/11 Mumbai attacks.Arun Gupta, director of VIF and former deputy NSA, said, “Pakistan is a master in proxy wars, using terrorist groups to fight insurgencies, but unintended consequences are inevitable. India must remain vigilant.”This alliance comes after India’s strong counterterror actions under Operation Sindoor, which the PM Modi-led government says is ongoing but currently paused. India had destroyed LeT’s den and headquarters in Muridke in mainland Pakistan.After the Muridke camp was destroyed by the IAF, reports have emerged that LeT is shifting to a safer location near the Afghanistan border, with Pakistan aiding its reconstruction.","Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has reportedly formed a covert alliance with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) ISKP is the South Asian wing of ISIS, allegedly engineered and funded by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) The alliance aims to target Baloch people, with possible expansion to Jammu and Kashmir.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124380304,imgsize-946149,width-400,resizemode-4/ians-photo.jpg"

The new direct service was announced at the start of the trade mission to India led by UK PM Keir Starmer.This comes just months after IndiGo picked Manchester airport for its first ever long-haul route into Europe, launching direct flights between Mumbai and Manchester in July.It means that from November there will be nine direct flights a week between Manchester and India. There will be five flights a week from Mumbai to Manchester, and four a week from Delhi to Manchester.Until now, there were three direct flights from Mumbai to Manchester. Manchester airport is now the only UK airport outside London to have direct services to both Mumbai and Delhi. They will all operate from Manchester’s state-of-the-art £1.3 billion Terminal 2.The two routes are expected to generate increased exports worth more than £33.5 million a year, £26 million in tourism income from Indian visitors, 500 new jobs, and more than £26 million of productivity savings for UK businesses.Chief secretary to the UK Treasury James Murray said: “Manchester airport has recently had a large amount of investment which has enabled Terminal 2 to be renovated and expanded, and on the basis of the extra capacity IndiGo chose Manchester airport.”British Airways on Wednesday confirmed it will introduce a third daily flight between Delhi and London Heathrow in 2026, subject to regulatory and capacity approval, and will look for further growth opportunities in India as trade between the UK and India increases.",IndiGo will launch daily flights between New Delhi and Manchester.

Anglo-Saxon and medieval insights



A marketplace built over history





Beneath the bustling heart of Leicester, England, archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s historic Market Place. What began as a routine excavation for urban redevelopment has turned into one of the most significant discoveries in recent UK archaeology. The dig, led by the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS), is part of a £7.5 million project by Leicester City Council to create a new market square. The team uncovered the long-lost Gainsborough Chamber—a medieval civic building first recorded in 1533, infamous for its “vile prison.” They also discovered layers of Roman and Anglo-Saxon life, artifacts, and even a Roman infant burial, offering an extraordinary window into centuries of human history lying silently beneath the modern marketplace.At the centre of the discovery is the Gainsborough Chamber, demolished around 1748 but now partially restored in the archaeological record. Historical texts describe it as a “most vile prison,” where harsh conditions likely made it infamous in medieval Leicester. Archaeologists uncovered its thick stone walls, a stone-lined well, and remnants of the dungeon, confirming the building’s architectural and civic importance.According to historian Charles Billson, a prisoner in 1533 described being chained, lying on hard planks, and receiving no comfort or company, highlighting the dungeon’s grim reputation. Gavin Speed, the lead archaeologist, emphasized that this area of Leicester had remained largely untouched until the current excavation, making the discovery even more remarkable.The excavation revealed a wealth of Roman-era remains, including a timber building later replaced by a stone structure. Artifacts such as Roman tesserae, pottery, coins, and jewellery help reconstruct daily life in ancient Leicester. A particularly poignant find was the burial of a Roman infant beneath the timber structure, likely around 1,900 years ago, providing a glimpse into family life and customs from nearly two millennia ago. The later stone building was constructed directly over the earlier timber house, showing how the city evolved over time. These findings underscore Leicester’s long-standing significance as a Roman settlement and trade hub.Beneath the medieval layers, archaeologists uncovered a thick Anglo-Saxon soil layer, shedding light on a little-understood period in Leicester’s history. Compacted pebbles, overlain by silts and successive resurfacing layers, revealed nearly 800 years of continuous market activity. Post-holes from medieval market stalls offer rare physical evidence of the city’s commercial past. Dr. Speed described the site as “like a slice through an archaeological cake,” showing how each layer represents a different generation of market activity and urban life. These discoveries reveal how Leicester’s central square continuously adapted to social and economic changes, blending Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and medieval influences across centuries.The dig confirms Leicester’s role as a historic trade centre, with layers of activity preserved beneath the modern square. The city council plans to repave the market in porphyry by the end of 2026 but hopes to display some of the archaeological finds to the public. Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby highlighted that the expertise of ULAS has revealed how the site has been used for thousands of years, from Roman settlers to Victorian traders. While shoppers walk above, centuries of human history remain hidden just below their feet, from infant burials to bustling medieval markets. This remarkable find reminds us that every step through Leicester’s marketplace is a step across two millennia of living history.","Archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s Market Place.

Upcoming Nobel Announcements 2025





The Nobel prize in Literature 2025 has been awarded to Hungarian author László Krasznahorkai “for his compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art. ” The Nobel committee at the Swedish Academy in Stockholm, Sweden made this announcement on Thursday.László Krasznahorkai was born in 1954 in the small town of Gyula in southeastern Hungary. His breakthrough came with Sátántangó (1985; Satantango, 2012), a bleak yet mesmerizing portrayal of a destitute rural community on a Hungarian collective farm. Krasznahorkai’s signature style—long, flowing sentences that capture the relentlessness of human experience—continued to evolve in works such as Az ellenállás melankóliája (1989; The Melancholy of Resistance, 1998), a feverish allegory of violence and anarchy in a small town.Other notable epics include Háború és háború (1999; War & War , 2006), Báró Wenckheim hazatér (2016; Baron Wenckheim’s Homecoming , 2019), and Herscht 07769 (2021; Herscht 07769: A Novel , 2024), each exploring themes of social collapse, human folly, and the search for meaning in a world poised between order and chaos.Beyond his apocalyptic narratives, Krasznahorkai has expanded his literary vision to contemplative explorations inspired by his travels in East Asia.Works such as Északról hegy, Délről tó, Nyugatról utak, Keletről folyó (2003; A Mountain to the North, a Lake to the South, Paths to the West, a River to the East , 2022) and Seiobo járt odalent (2008; Seiobo There Below , 2013). Shorter works like Aprómunka egy palotáért (2018; Spadework for a Palace , 2020) further display his versatility, blending humor, historical reflection, and philosophical insight.Krasznahorkai, 71, has previously received many other prominent awards including the 2015 Man Booker International Prize. The Booker judges praised his “extraordinary sentences, sentences of incredible length that go to incredible lengths, their tone switching from solemn to madcap to quizzical to desolate as they go their wayward way.”""He is a hypnotic writer,"" Krasznahorkai's English language translator, the poet George Szirtes, told AFP.""He draws you in until the world he conjures echoes and echoes inside you, until it's your own vision of order and chaos"", he added.The literature prize is the fourth in the series to be announced for this year, following the Nobels in medicine, physics and chemistry.On Wednesday, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Susumu Kitagawa of Kyoto University, Richard Robson of the University of Melbourne, and Omar M Yaghi of the University of California, Berkeley, ""for the development of metal–organic frameworks.""On Tuesday, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Clarke (UC Berkeley), Michel H. Devoret (Yale University and UC Santa Barbara), and John M. Martinis (UC Santa Barbara) for their discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in electric circuits.And the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Dr Shimon Sakaguchi for explaining how the immune system distinguishes between harmful pathogens and the body’s own cells.2024 – Han Kang: “For her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life.”2022 – Annie Ernaux: “For the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements, and collective restraints of personal memory.”2020 - Louise Glück: “for her unmistakable poetic voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal”Alfred Nobel left most of his estate, more than SEK 31 million (today approximately SEK 2,2 billion) to be converted into a fund and invested in “safe securities.”The income from the investments was to be “distributed annually in the form of prizes to those who during the preceding year have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.” The Nobel Prize amount for 2025 is set at Swedish kronor (SEK) 11.0 million per full Nobel Prize, and the winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and a diploma.Peace Prize: Friday, October 10, at 11:00 CESTEconomic Sciences Prize: Monday, October 13, at 11:45 CEST","The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded 117 times to 121 laureates between 1901 and 2024.
