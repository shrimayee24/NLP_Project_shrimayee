"Has National Dam Safety Authority examined safety of Mullaperiyar?

It criticised the Union government for being in slumber since 2021 when it was informed that no relevant rules and regulations under the Act have been framed till date.Nedumpara-led petitioners said they were concerned about the protection of their lives and properties of five million citizens which will be at grave risk in the event of the Mullaperiyar dam breaching.They said the dam, made of limestone and surkhi, was commissioned in the year 1895 with an estimated lifespan of 50 years. They requested the court to direct the Centre, Tamil Nadu and Kerala to work together to resolve the safety concerns over the dam.After reports about damage to the dam was published in Kerala press in 1979, the Central Water Commission held meetings with TN and Kerala and opined that after completion of emergency and medium-term measures, the water level in the dam can be raised up to 145 ft.On the directions of the SC in April 2000, the ministry of water resources constituted an expert committee which in its March 2001 report opined that after implementation of strengthening measures, the water level in the dam could be raised from 136 ft to 142 ft. The SC in its February 27, 2006, order had permitted TN to raise water level to 142 ft.However, Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation (Amendment) Act in March 2006 prohibited raising the water level beyond 136 ft. SC in May 2014 declared the Kerala law unconstitutional and had directed the Centre to set up a three-member supervisory committee about safety of the dam on raising the water level to 142 ft.","Mullaperiyar dam in Kerala, owned by Tamil Nadu, is a cause of constant friction between the two states.

In another sign of India‚Äôs deepening ties with the Taliban, foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Afghanistan's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai, conveying India‚Äôs readiness to respond to the urgent development needs of the Afghan people and getting an assurance that the Taliban would not allow Afghan territory to be used against India.This was the highest level of engagement India has had so far with the Taliban since the latter took control of Kabul in 2021. India was represented so far at the level of joint secretary in meetings with the dispensation in Kabul.Interestingly, the meeting in Dubai also took place in the middle of Afghanistan‚Äôs fast deteriorating ties with Islamabad over the activities of Pakistan Taliban and Pakistan‚Äôs retaliatory air strikes on Afghanistan soil. India had earlier this week expressed solidarity with Afghanistan on the issue, saying Pakistan has developed a habit of blaming neighbours for its internal problems.‚ÄúThe Afghan side underlined its sensitivities to India's security concerns. The two sides agreed to remain in touch and continue regular contacts at various levels,‚Äù said an Indian readout on the Misri-Muttaqi meeting. Misri raised concerns about the activities of Pakistan based terror groups like LeT and JeM and Muttaqi assured him Afghanistan will do nothing to undermine India‚Äôs security.In the meeting, India agreed to Afghanistan‚Äôs request for material support in the health sector and for the rehabilitation of refugees. Misri also told the Afghan minister India would consider engaging in development projects in the near future, in addition to the ongoing humanitarian assistance programme. This is significant as India‚Äôs support so far was limited to providing humanitarian aid. The Taliban have for quite some time been assuring India of enough security to not just allow it to further strengthen its diplomatic presence in Kabul but also reopen its consulates and resume work on development projects.While the MEA joint secretary who handles Afghanistan, JP Singh, has travelled to Afghanistan on several occasions, Dubai was thought of as the right venue for the first real high-level engagement as it was convenient apparently for both sides to meet there. Like all major powers, India doesn‚Äôt officially recognise the Taliban regime, not least because of its inability to ensure an inclusive government and its treatment of women and girls. The UAE government, which has strong ties with both India and the Taliban, was happy to facilitate the meeting.‚ÄúForeign Secretary underlined India‚Äôs historic friendship with the Afghan people and the strong people to people contacts between the two countries. The two sides evaluated the ongoing Indian humanitarian assistance programmes,‚Äù said the Indian readout. The Taliban said in their own readout they called for enhancing trade, political and diplomatic ties and for facilitating visas for Afghan businessmen, students and patients.The government‚Äôs decision to send 50000 MT of wheat to the drought-affected Afghanistan in late 2021, despite Taliban‚Äôs past animosity towards India, led to the start of the present detente. Muttaqi appreciated and thanked the Indian leadership for continuing to engage and support the people of Afghanistan, said the Indian government.‚ÄúThe two sides also discussed strengthening of sports (cricket) cooperation, which is highly valued by the young generation of Afghanistan,‚Äù said the government, adding they also agreed to promote the use of Chabahar port for supporting trade and commercial activities, including for the purpose of humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan.‚ÄúIt may be recalled that in response to the needs of the Afghan people, India decided to extend humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. India has so far dispatched several shipments consisting of 50,000 MTs of wheat, 300 tons of medicines, 27 tons of earthquake relief aid, 40,000 litres of pesticides, 100 million polio doses, 1.5 million doses of COVID Vaccine, 11,000 units of hygiene kits for the drug de-addiction programme, 500 units of winter clothing and 1.2 tons of stationery kits, etc,‚Äù recalled India in its statement.",India's foreign secretary Vikram Misri met Afghanistan's acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Dubai.

PM Modi likely to inaugurate Z-Morh tunnel on Lohri; Railways gear up for train link to Valley,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-likely-to-inaugurate-z-morh-tunnel-on-lohri-railways-gear-up-for-train-link-to-valley/articleshow/117063613.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: In a big boost to connectivity in Kashmir, PM Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the 6.5-km Z-Morh road tunnel between Gagangir and Sonmarg in the Valley on Lohri (January 13) to make Sonamarg an all-weather tourist destination. The Indian Railways on Wednesday also successfully operated a train at 110 kmph on USBRL‚Äôs Katra-Banihal section, paving the way for train operations between Katra and Srinagar.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the final stage of inspection by the Commissioner of Railway Safety for the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL) was conducted on Wednesday. He added that the specially designed Jammu-Srinagar Vande Bharat with eight coaches, equipped with anti freezing features, will be operational soon.Sharing details of the Z-Morh tunnel project‚Äôs inauguration, sources said the PM is scheduled to physically inaugurate the tunnel. At present, the Gagangir-Sonamarg stretch gets blocked by heavy snowfall and avalanches during winters. The two-lane tunnel will bring down travel time to barely 15 minutes, compared to hours taken by vehicles to cover the zig-zag road.Once the adjacent Zoji-La tunnel is completed, the travel between Srinagar and Leh will be seamless and will provide connectivity to Baltal (Amarnath cave shrine), Kargil and other places in the Ladakh region. It will also allow faster and smoother movement of military vehicles to the border.Just when the Z-Morh tunnel was almost complete for opening, terrorists attacked the workers‚Äô camp at Gagangir last Oct. In the indiscriminate firing, seven civilians, including six non-local workers of the infrastructure company building the tunnel, were killed. ‚ÄúThe project is now ready for inauguration and security issues have been addressed,‚Äù a source said.On the 272-km USBRL project, costing around Rs 40,000 crore, Vaishnaw said the government has given priority to safety before opening the rail link to Kashmir with the rest of the country. He said the redevelopment of the Jammu station will be complete by Aug and it will have eight platforms and modern amenities. ‚ÄúIt was a very challenging project and the toughest challenge was to give foundation support to the world's highest arch bridge (359 m) on the Chenab river and country‚Äôs longest transportation tunnel,‚Äù he said.Vaishnaw added that snow removal train, which will move ahead of passenger and freight trains, will make sure that services on this strategic route runs all through the year. The railways has also used anti-vibration seismic devices in the project as this region falls under Zone-V earthquake vulnerability. The dampers will absorb the tremors, and thus, maintain faster and safer travel.",PM Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the 6.5-km Z-Morh road tunnel between Gagangir and Sonmarg in the Valley on Lohri (January 13) The Indian Railways on Wednesday also successfully operated a train at 110 kmph on USBRL‚Äôs Katra- Banihal section.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117063672,imgsize-1403471,width-400,resizemode-4/117063672.jpg"

In doing so, they are insulting the wisdom and intelligence of Rahul Gandhi's predecessors, such as Mrs. Indira Gandhi, his mother Mrs. Sonia Gandhi and other senior Congress leaders like Dr. Manmohan Singh,"" she told news agency PTI.""If Pranab Mukherjee were indeed aligned with the RSS, why did Congress entrust him with so many different and highly significant responsibilities over 45 years? Was Mrs. Indira Gandhi not intelligent enough to see through that? Was Mrs. Sonia Gandhi unaware of such things? These are baseless statements, and if certain Congress members are making them, it shows their lack of knowledge about Congress's history and parliamentary democracy,"" she said.""In a parliamentary democracy, different ideologies can coexist and dialogue between them is essential ‚Äî this is one of the strongest pillars of parliamentary democracy. Those making such remarks clearly lack understanding and are exposing their ignorance and prejudice through their statements,"" Sharmistha Mukherjee added.In a social media post on X, Ali had alleged that the honour was given to the former President because ""his love"" for the RSS.""The Modi government has indulged in dirty politics over death and has rejected the demand of the entire nation for space for Manmohan Singh at Rajghat memorial site and has given land at the same place for Pranab Mukherjee's memorial.

Delhi assembly elections: Congress braces for 'lonely' battle as key INDIA bloc partners back Arvind Kejriwal's AAP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-assembly-elections-congress-braces-for-lonely-battle-as-key-india-bloc-partners-back-arvind-kejriwals-aap/articleshow/117057482.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Congress is all set for a lonely political battle in Delhi with at least two key INDIA (Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance) bloc partners backing Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party in the assembly elections. The Congress and the AAP were allies during the Lok Sabha elections in Delhi but will be contesting the assembly elections as rivals.Kejriwal on Wednesday said that Mamata Banerjee had announced to back AAP in Delhi assembly elections and thanked the Trinamool chief for her support. ""TMC has announced support to AAP in Delhi elections . I am personally grateful to Mamata Didi. Thank you Didi. U have always supported and blessed us in our good and bad times,"" the AAP chief said in a post on X. Reacting to Kejriwal's post, senior TMC leader Derek O' Brien said, ""We have your back @AamAadmiParty"".Yesterday TMC leader Kunal Ghosh had said that the people of Delhi will defeat the BJP in the assembly polls. ""We hope that AAP government comes back there and BJP is defeated. The people of Delhi will defeat BJP,"" Ghosh said.Mamata's support would come as big boost to Kejriwal as he faces a determined BJP in the February 5 elections. The Trinamool chief is the second regional leader to come out in support of AAP for the Delhi assembly elections.Earlier, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav had announced support for Arvind Kejriwal's party in Delhi elections. ""The way the AAP government has worked, we feel that they should get another chance to work here,"" Akhilesh had said at a ""Mahila Adalat"" campaign of AAP in the presence of Arvind Kejriwal. Akhilesh Yadav's two-line appeal was a clear hint that the SP was backing AAP and not the Congress in the Delhi assembly elections.For the Congress, this political isolation is not new. The party, weakened by its electoral losses in Haryana and Maharashtra, faces a strong challenge from the regional allies within the INDIA bloc. The stand taken by Mamata and Akhilesh does not come as a surprise as several INDIA bloc allies have openly differed with the Congress over various issues in the recent past.Mamata Banerjee has been the most vocal critic of the Congress and had openly questioned the functioning of the INDIA bloc under the grand-old-party. Mamata even signalled her intent to take charge of the alliance and found support of several leaders including Sharad Pawar and Lalu Prasad.""What can I do if they cannot run the show? I do not lead the front. Those who are in leadership positions there should think about it. But still, I am maintaining my connections with the regional and national parties. If given the responsibility, though I do not want that, I can run it from West Bengal,"" Mamata had said.Akhilesh Yadav, who contested the 2024 Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh in alliance with the Congress, charted a separate path on some key issues during the winter session of Parliament. The Samajwadi Party refused to join Congress's offensive on the Adani ""bribery"" issue as Akhilesh maintained that the incidence of violence in Sambhal was far more important and deserved greater attention.The Congress, which has been literally wiped out of Delhi, faces an uphill battle as it desperately tries to regain its lost political space. In the last two assembly elections, the party could not open its account and saw its vote share dip to alarming lows. The Congress, which has announced candidates for several seats, is promising a host of welfare schemes to people of Delhi in line with the recent trend of wooing voters.On Wednesday, the party promised a ""Jeevan Raksha Yojana"" for free health insurance of up to Rs 25 lakh if voted to power in Delhi. Senior Congress leader and former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot claims the proposed scheme would be a game-changer for the party. The party had earlier announced the 'Pyaari Didi Yojana', promising a monthly financial assistance of Rs 2,500 to women if voted to power in the national capital.These schemes notwithstanding, it would need a Herculean effort for the grand-old-party to make its presence felt in Delhi. Ironically, none of its senior leaders, including the Gandhis, are anywhere on the ground to take up this challenge. In the absence of senior leadership, the all-out offensive against Arvind Kejriwal by Delhi Congress leaders has already created ripples in the INDIA bloc with AAP accusing the grand-old-party of helping the BJP.The Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) has echoed similar concerns. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut expressed concerns over the intense battle between AAP and Congress and said that the fight should be against the BJP in the national capital and the country.""Congress and AAP were fighting the Lok Sabha elections together. However, the situation which has formed in the Vidhan Sabha (assembly) elections, it looks as if they are trying to help the BJP. Our fight should be against the BJP - in Delhi and the country,"" Raut said. The senior Shiv Sena (UBT) leader also objected to Congress labelling former Kejriwal as ""deshdrohi"".Clearly, the Congress needs to chart a clear course and not leave the Delhi campaign to its state leaders. If the party is indeed serious to challenge Kejriwal's dominance, its national leadership should go out in the field all guns blazing.",The Congress and the AAP were allies during the Lok Sabha elections in Delhi. The Trinamool chief is the second regional leader to come out in support of AAP for the Delhi assembly elections. The stand taken by Mamata and Akhilesh does not come as a surprise as several INDIA bloc allies have openly differed with the Congress over various issues.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117058188,imgsize-79284,width-400,resizemode-4/117058188.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The issue of four toilets instead of three in each coach of Vande Bharat sleeper trains and a pantry car in every trainset, which had held up the Rs 55,000 crore project , has been resolved, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Wednesday. He said they will go with the original design of coaches with three toilets and no pantry car in each train since these are meant for overnight journeys.Kinet Railway Solutions , the SPV of Russian railway major TMH and Indian Railways ‚Äô PSU, RVNL, which has bagged a contract to manufacture 1,920 sleeper coaches or 80 trainsets, had raised concern over the change in design and had sought a higher price. ‚ÄúSince there is no change in the original design, there is no need for revising the cost,‚Äù Vaishnaw said.Sources said the railway board had informed their decision to Kinet Railway Solutions in the last week of December. The production of the first prototype is likely in the next one year. Besides Kinet, the railways has awarded a consortium of Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) and Titagarh Rail Systems (TRS) the contract to manufacture 1,280 coaches or 53 trainsets. Moreover, a contract for supply of 10 Vande Sleeper trains has been awarded to BEML and Integral Coach Factory (ICF), Chennai on nomination basis.On the issue of concerns regarding procurement of bullet trains from Japan , officials said all issues have been resolved and India will get Shinkansen E5 bullet trains to ply on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor. ‚ÄúWe will get the train with the best available technology. Techniques for developing bullet train infrastructure are being indigenised and those will be used in future projects,‚Äù an official said.He added that Japanese counterparts have appreciated the good progress made in India and the technology for launching 40-metre girders for bullet train projects and they will import this from India.","The issue of four toilets instead of three in each coach of Vande Bharat sleeper trains and a pantry car in every trainset, which had held up the Rs 55,000 crore project, has been resolved, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Wednesday. He said they will go with the original design of coaches with three toilets and no pantry cars.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117063771,imgsize-1344127,width-400,resizemode-4/117063771.jpg"
IAF chief cites China's fighter jets to stress on self-reliance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-chief-cites-chinas-fighter-jets-to-stress-on-self-reliance/articleshow/117034832.cms,"Also read:

NEW DELHI: China's recent display of two new-generation stealth fighter jets, which sent shock waves around the globe at the country's astonishing pace of military modernisation, found mention in the IAF chief 's remarks on Tuesday, which saw him stress the need for India to strongly push for self-reliance in defence R&D and production along with greater private sector participation even though it will involve much higher costs.""The world today is in a precarious position dominated by conflicts and contests. We have our own security concerns on the western and northern borders with increased militarisation by China and Pakistan,"" Air Chief Marshal A P Singh said at the annual Subroto Mukherjee seminar here.""China is investing heavily in its air force the recent unveiling of its new stealth aircraft is a case in point,"" he added, while also expressing frustration at the extremely slow pace of delivery of the indigenous Tejas fighter. On December 26, China conducted the maiden flights of what are probably two new 6th-generation fighters at Chengdu. Videos of the tailless, stealthy advanced combat aircraft cruising at low altitudes shocked even the US, which is yet to finalise its own 6th-generation fighter project. China already has 5th-generation fighters in the Chengdu J-20 jets, which it has also deployed at its airfields facing India like Hotan and Shigatse, as reported earlier by TOI.India is still far away from producing even a 5th-generation fighter, with the PM-headed cabinet committee on security clearing the development of the swing-role advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore, only in March last year. As per projected timelines, the first AMCA prototype will make its maiden flight in four to five years, with production and induction beginning only after 2035. At present, India is struggling to produce the 4th-generation Tejas Mark-1A fighters because of the continuing delay in supply of GE-F404 turbofan jet engines by US major General Electric. Down to 30 fighter squadrons when it is authorised 42.5 to tackle challenges from China and Pakistan, IAF wants to induct at least 180 Tejas Mark-1A and 108 Mark-2 jets in the run-up to the AMCA.The IAF chief said, ""R&D loses its relevance in case it is not able to meet time-lines. Technology delayed is technology denied. There has to be an increased aptitude for acceptance of risks involved and failures in R&D."" He added, ""Atmanirbharta will come at a cost and we should accept it. We may have to spend more and buy at a higher rate if required - amortising of the R&D part and limited numbers will push the cost up - but will give the much needed self-reliance.""",China's recent display of two new-generation stealth fighter jets sent shock waves around the globe.

Total eligible voters in Maharashtra crossed adult population tally: Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/total-eligible-voters-in-maharashtra-crossed-adult-population-tally-congress/articleshow/117066929.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: With the Election Commission rubbishing doubts raised by the opposition over the inclusion of 50 lakh voters in four months in Maharashtra, Congress on Wednesday alleged the total eligible voters in the state during the assembly polls exceeded its adult population projected by the Modi govt. It said even a 100% voter registration in the state would be unprecedented and suspect.A day earlier, the CEC had asserted that the voter addition process is foolproof to prevent fake voter additions , in response to complaints from Congress and other opposition parties.Congress data analytics department chief Praveen Chakravarty said, ""We have a simple one line response to the CEC - if the process is so robust, how is it that the total eligible electors in Maharashtra seems to be more than the total adult population as estimated by the Modi govt's own report?"" He said the Nov 2019 report of the National Commission on Population of the health and family welfare ministry projected Maharashtra's estimated adult population in 2024 at 9.5 crore, while the EC stated that the total enrolled electors for Maharashtra polls was 9.7 crore. Aadhaar enrolment data also reinforces the fact that voters exceeded the population, he said.""The EC seems to have enrolled 16 lakh more voters than the entire adult population in Maharashtra. Even if estimates vary, is it possible that the EC has registered 100% or more of all eligible voters in a state?"" he asked.Chakravarty said analysis of other states shows that on an average, only 90% of eligible population are enrolled as electors by the EC. ""While all the other questions that we raised in our letter dated Dec 10, 2024, about mysterious addition of new voters remain unanswered, just this one simple datapoint that the EC may have registered more electors than adult population quashes the CEC's claim that the process of voter addition and deletion is very robust and unquestionable,"" he argued.",The Election Commission has rubbished doubts raised by the opposition over the inclusion of 50 lakh voters in four months in Maharashtra.

Homes with under-14 kids see fewer females in labour force,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/homes-with-under-14-kids-see-fewer-females-in-labour-force/articleshow/117066700.cms,"The phenomenon is more pronounced in urban than in rural areas, the study found

NEW DELHI: Reinforcing how care provisions at home significantly affect women's choice of entering the labour force, an analysis of government data shows that Female Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) is lower among households with children under 14 years of age. Moreover, this phenomenon is more pronounced in urban than in rural areas.Also the presence of children affect female LFPR more significantly in the age bracket of 20 to 35 years, compared to later years. These findings are part of an observation analysis of the Periodic Labour Force Survey from 2017-18 to 2022-23 released last month as part of the Economic Advisory Council to the PM (EAC-PM) working paper series. The analysis is authored by EAC-PM member Shamika Ravi and economist Mudit Kapoor.The research shows that female LFPR in urban areas is almost always and everywhere lower than female LFPR in rural areas. ""This major gap between rural and urban areas reflects the pressures of household responsibilities,"" it said.Highlighting a significant resurgence in female LFPR across Indian states, especially in rural areas, since 2017-18, the analysis also brings into focus that married women in rural areas showed higher participation growth compared with unmarried women. There are, however, significant regional and interstate variations.The overall results also draw attention to the female LFPR peaking at 30-40 years of age and declining sharply after. The male LFPR, on the other hand, remains high (100%) from ages 30-50, declining gradually thereafter. ""Marital status is a significant determinant of LFPR for both women and men. Married men consistently exhibit higher LFPR across states and age groups, while marriage significantly reduces female LFPR, especially in urban areas,"" the research said.Another striking result which is consistent across states and regions of India is that married men are significantly more likely to participate in the labour force than men who are not currently married and this result is persistent for all ages of men, across all states and areas (rural and urban).The research in its conclusion also highlights there have been numerous govt schemes, especially targeting rural women over the last 10 years like the Mudra loans, the ""Drone Didi"" scheme and SHGs mobilised under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana.""Our paper measures the final outcome of these initiatives as a cumulative and significant growth in female LFPR across India and in particular in rural areas. Rigorous research, however, is needed to evaluate these programmes' impact and to explore the persistent inter-state and rural-urban disparities in India's female LFPR,"" the authors said.","The phenomenon is more pronounced in urban than in rural areas, the study found.

NEW DELHI: Women electors now outnumber their male counterparts across 14 states/Union territories, as per the final electoral rolls published so far with January 1, 2025, as the reference date. This is an improvement over last year, when the updated rolls with January 1, 2024, as the reference date had shown women electors in higher numbers than men across a dozen states and Union territories.Countrywide, total women electors as per the freshly updated electoral roll are still 2.33 crore less than the male electorate. Of the over 99-crore-strong Indian electorate, nearly 50.7 crore are men and 48.3 crore (48.8%), women. Third gender electors total 48,870, with states like Tamil Nadu accounting for their highest numbers (9161), followed by Maharashtra (6145), UP (6089) and Karnataka (5095).The new additions this year to the list of states/UTs where the absolute number of women electors exceeds the male electorate are Assam, Karnataka and Nagaland. However, the trend seems to have been reversed in Chandigarh where the male electors have overtaken women again this year in terms of absolute numbers.The data for Chandigarh and Nagaland is provisional as their final electoral roll w.r.t January 1, 2025 as the cutoff date has either just been published or is due to be published in the next couple of days.Among the 14 states and Union territories where the women electorate has overtaken male electorate in absolute numbers as per the electoral rolls published this year, are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Manipur Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. As per the nationwide electoral roll published early last year, the states/UTs with women electors in the lead were Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Kerala, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.Gender ratio (number of women electors per 1,000 male electors) is yet another indicator of women voters gaining ground in different states and UTs. As many as 22 of the country‚Äôs 36 states and Union territories have recorded a gender ratio higher than the national figure of 954. Not only this, the gender ratio is skewed in favour of women in as many as 14 states.However, states like NCT of Delhi, UP and Haryana, with a gender ratio of 859, 876 and 890 respectively, continue to pull down the national figure.In percentage terms, women electors as per the 2025 rolls constitute 53.2% of the total electorate in Puducherry; 51.7% in Kerala and Manipur; 51.6% in Mizoram; 51.5% in Goa‚Äô and around 51% in Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.Women had clocked a higher 65.8% polling percentage in the 2024 Lok Sabha poll, as compared to the 65.6% male voter turnout.","Women electors now outnumber their male counterparts across 14 states/Union territories.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Centre to make a scheme by March 14 to provide cashless treatment to victims of road accidents during the golden hour, which is essential to protect lives but is being refused by hospitals for various reasons, including worries about payments.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih said that no further time would be given to govt to frame the scheme as Centre was obliged to do it under the Motor Vehicles Act ""The provision made in Section 162 for framing a scheme for providing cashless treatment in the golden hour seeks to uphold and protect the right to life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. Moreover, it is a statutory obligation of the central govt to frame the scheme.

The scheme must be such that it serves the object of saving lives by providing medical treatment in the golden hour"".The court noted that a Motor Vehicle Accident Fund was created to provide treatment during the golden hour but the scheme does not exist and 1,662 claimants received compensation between April 1, 2024 and August 31, 2024.","Hospitals are refusing to provide cashless treatment to road accident victims.

Opposition MPs suggest extending ONOE JPC‚Äôs term to a year

The first meeting of the JPC on the 'one nation, one election' bills on Wednesday was marked by a flurry of questions from panel members, with opposition MPs calling the legislations an assault on constitutional norms and BJP and allies arguing that they served the nation's broader interests.. The session saw law ministry officials outlining the benefits of holding simultaneous elections , including reduced expenditure and administrative load.The Congress MP‚Äôs comments led to a counter from BJP MP Anurag Thakur, who interpreted her remarks as an implicit endorsement of EVMs, contrary to her party‚Äôs scepticism about the machines.Opposition MPs also asked whether the financial estimates had been updated to reflect the use of EVMs, which were employed nationwide for the first time in 2004.BJP MPs, including Sanjay Jaiswal, defended the bills by citing precedents from 1957 when state assemblies were dissolved to align elections with the national schedule, under the leadership of figures like President Rajendra Prasad.MP V D Sharma emphasised the public support for simultaneous elections, referencing a high-level committee led by former President Ram Nath Kovind, which had consulted over 25,000 people, the majority of whom favoured the proposal. BJP members argued that the constant cycle of elections disrupted development and drained national resources.Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde highlighted the practical issues in Maharashtra, where closely scheduled elections for various levels of govt stalled development activities due to the need for extensive election management. However, opposition voices, including those from Congress, DMK and Trinamool, reiterated their stance that the legislations undermined federalism and the democratic ethos, with one TMC MP stating that protecting democratic rights was more important than financial considerations. The Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill and the Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill were introduced in Lok Sabha in the winter session and referred to the committee.","The first meeting of the JPC on the 'one nation, one election' bills on Wednesday was marked by a flurry of questions from panel members.

Pritish Nandy foresaw the future, and was always full of surprises

Poet, editor, TV show host, film producer, Rajya Sabha member, animal rights activist - Pritish Nandy , a gifted man of many parts and surprises, passed away in Mumbai on Wednesday. He was 73.Born in Bihar's Bhagalpur town, Nandy was the brother of renowned academic Ashis Nandy. He was a prolific poet, writing with the passion and intensity of Latin American versifiers in his youth.Nandy often wrote with empathy for the young Naxalites who were killed for the cause they believed in, including in a poem titled, 'Calcutta if you must exile me.'Eventually, it was Nandy who exiled himself. Shifting to what was then called Bombay, he found a new calling at The Times of India. He edited The Illustrated Weekly of India and oversaw Filmfare and Femina.During Pritish Nandy‚Äôs tenure as editor, The Illustrated Weekly came up with several exclusives. Among his famous reports was an interview of Frank Camper, a mercenary who ran a training camp for his tribe in the jungles of Alabama. Nandy‚Äôs interview with singer Kishore Kumar provided an insight into the mind of the musical genius. As an editor, he also had a fondness for special issues related to quiz, sports and cinema ‚Äî all collector‚Äôs items.Moving on to the world of motion pictures and television seemed to be a natural step. He hosted the Pritish Nandy show on DD. When he set up his own media company in the early 1990s, he named it Pritish Nandy Communications .In the 1990s, Bollywood was still doing film business the traditional way. But Nandy foresaw the future. He was among the pioneers in the corporatisation of Bollywood. Among his noteworthy films are the big budget, multi-starrer thriller, Kaante, and director Sudhir Mishra‚Äôs masterpiece, Hazaaron Khwahishen Aisi. Other films such as Bollywood Calling, Jhankar Beats, Chameli, Pyaar Ke Side Effects were entertaining yet different from humdrum Bollywood. They typified the new polished Bollywood, still trying to find its way in the new millennium.Considering his affinity for Leftist movements in the past, many were surprised when he was nominated to Rajya Sabha by Shiv Sena. Nandy was the first MP from the city to use his local area development fund (MPLAD) for the heritage precinct at Kala Ghoda.But Nandy was always full of surprises. He played a key role in setting up NGO People for Animals with Maneka Gandhi. He saw the potential of the internet before most, playing a key role in setting up one of India‚Äôs first cyber cafes. And he was a popular columnist.His death was mourned by many ranging from actor Sanjay Dutt to writer Ashwin Sanghi to academic Amitabh Matttoo. Actor-politician Anupam Kher wrote on X, ‚ÄúDeeply deeply saddened and shocked to know about the demise of one of my dearest and closest friends #PritishNandy!

Injustice inflicted by courts at every stage: SC

NEW DELHI: Admitting that ""injustice has been inflicted"" by all courts, including itself, in rejecting the juvenility plea of a death convict who had to spent 25 years in jail, Supreme Court on Wednesday directed his release from prison forthwith by holding that he was just 14 years old at the time of committing the crime, a fact which was not accepted earlier by it in four rounds of litigations, manifesting that even SC is not infallible.In this case, the accused was convicted and awarded the death sentence in 2001 in a murder case. He had raised the defence of juvenility by claiming to be just 14 year old and also placed bank account details, but his plea was rejected by the lower court. But his defence of juvenility was also not accepted by high court and Supreme Court.High court and Supreme Court upheld his conviction and sentence despite placing before them fresh evidence of school certificate for his age proof. SC not only rejected his appeal but also his review and curative petitions.Staring at death, the convict was left with no option and he filed a mercy petition with Uttrakhand governor, which was rejected. He thereafter sought mercy from the President, who commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment in 2012 with a condition that he shall not be released until the attainment of 60 years of age.The convict‚Äôs mother, with the help of a social worker, thereafter started a fresh round of litigation by challenging the presidential order in high court, which dismissed her plea and she approached Supreme Court, which examined the evidence relating to his age afresh and confessed the mistake done by the courts. During the pendency of the mercy plea, an ossification test was also done by a medical board constituted by Meerut jail on a request made by the convict and it also indicated that he was aged around 14 years at the time of the occurrence.Noting all the judicial proceedings from trial court to SC in its order, a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and Aravind Kumar said, ‚ÄúThe facts as narrated above speak for themselves. At every stage, injustice has been inflicted by the courts, either by ignoring the documents or by casting a furtive glance. The appellant, despite being illiterate, raised this plea one way or another, right from the trial court up to the conclusion of the curative petition before this court... The approach of courts in the earlier round of litigation cannot be sustained in the eye of law,‚Äù the bench said.Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Sundresh said that in case of a juvenile, the court is expected to play the role of parens patriae by treating a child not as a delinquent, but as a victim, viewed through the lens of reformation, rehabilitation and reintegration into the society.‚ÄúThus, a juvenile court is a species of a parent. A delinquent who appears before the court is to be protected and re-educated, rather than be judged and punished. It is for this purpose that the court will have to press into service the benevolent provisions for rehabilitation introduced by the legislature. A juvenile court assumes the role of an institution rendering psychological services. It must forget that it is acting as a court, and must don the robes of a correction home for a deviant child,‚Äù the bench said.‚ÄúWe would only state that this is a case where the appellant has been suffering due to the error committed by the courts. We have been informed that his conduct in prison is normal, with no adverse report. He lost an opportunity to reintegrate into society. The time which he has lost, for no fault of his, can never be restored,‚Äù the court said, directing Uttarakhand State Legal Services Authority to play a proactive role in facilitating his rehabilitation and smooth reintegration into the society upon his release.Emphasising that it is the primary duty of a court to make a single-minded endeavour to unearth the truth hidden beneath the facts, the bench said ‚Äúthe court is a search engine of truth, with procedural and substantive laws as its tools. When procedural law stands in the way of the truth, the court must find a way to circumvent it. Similarly, when substantive law, as it appears, does not facilitate the emergence of the truth, it is the paramount duty of the court to interpret the law in light of its teleos. Such an exercise is warranted in a higher degree, particularly while considering social welfare legislation.‚Äù",Supreme Court on Wednesday directed his release from prison forthwith by holding that he was just 14 years old at the time of committing the crime. High court and Supreme Court upheld his conviction and sentence despite placing before them fresh evidence of school certificate for his age proof.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117064703,imgsize-82176,width-400,resizemode-4/117064703.jpg"

Judge kin spared grind first-gen lawyers often go through

NEW DELHI: On the heels of a senior Supreme Court judge's proposal to pause for some years the selection of sitting or former judges' lawyer children for appointment as high court judges, another senior SC collegium member has proposed that such candidates must meet a higher benchmark to be in the zone of consideration.After the first proposal received traction among lawyers, who had a long grievance that first-generation lawyers generally get ignored when bracketed in zone of consideration for HC judgeship with kith and kin of sitting or former constitutional court judges, another member of the collegium was of the view that it would be discriminatory to completely bar such candidates' selection when judicial appointments are based only on merit and suitability.He also felt that it could deprive the constitutional courts of the talent it needs to deal with litigation, which is getting complex with the passage of time. However, the SC judge agreed with the objective of the initial proposal of another judge given the resentment among lawyers. He also emphasised that many such selections were deserving cases, sources said.He proposed a higher threshold in the selection criteria for such candidates keeping in view the facilities and experience they can get without the grind first-generation lawyers go through in the acutely competitive legal profession.Interestingly, the lawyers‚Äô grievance was reflected during the ‚Äòfull court reference‚Äô on Wednesday to pay homage to three former SC judges ‚Äì Justices Kuldip Singh, M Jagannadha Rao and H S Bedi ‚Äì who passed away. All three judges‚Äô sons became HC judges, one of whom resigned within six months of his appointment to return to legal practice in SC.

SC: Case on EC appointments 'test of power of legislature vs court',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-case-on-ec-appointments-test-of-power-of-legislature-vs-court/articleshow/117064466.cms,"Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar with election commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu during a press conference at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi.

EC appts process valid till Parliament enacts law: SC in 2023

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday said examining the validity of the 2023 law, which altered the SC-prescribed composition of the panel for selection of chief election commissioner (CEC) and ECs, would boil down to a contest between Parliament's power to legislate on the selection framework and SC's power as a constitutional court.On Marc 2, 2023, a five-judge SC bench in Anoop Baranwal case had noticed a vacuum in parliamentary legislation on the process for appointments to Election Commission and directed that a panel comprising the PM, leader of opposition (LoP) and Chief Justice of India would advise the President on this. SC had said its prescription would hold good until the Centre came up with a law to lay down a mechanism, for the first time ever, for the selection.Enabled by the leeway so provided and citing Article 324 of the Constitution that left it for Parliament to frame a law for the purpose, Parliament in Dec 2023 passed a Bill, clearing the way for a law which had a Union minister, in place of the CJI as suggested by the top court, as a member of the panel alongside the PM and LoP.Many petitions were immediately filed before the court claiming that the law violated the spirit of its judgment, which was to maintain the independence of EC. On Jan 12, 2024, a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna (now CJI) and Dipankar Datta refused to stay operation of the law.On Wednesday, advocate Prashant Bhushan said the incumbent CEC was scheduled to retire in Feb, and SC should hear the petitions urgently. The court listed the matter for hearing on Feb 4.The court framed the issue as centered on which of the two mechanisms would take precedence, Supreme Court's outlined in the Baranwal case or the law enacted by Parliament.Bhushan concurred and said, ""The neat question which arises in these petitions is - whether the appointment of CEC and ECs should be as per the SC judgment or the new law.""A bench of Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Ujjal Bhuyan said, ""We understand the importance of the matter. Ultimately, it is a test of legitimacy of legislative power or the court's power under Article 141 of the Constitution.""Article 141 provides that ‚Äúthe law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts within the territory of India‚Äù. Interestingly, the five-judge SC bench in its March 2023 judgment had said that the procedure provided by it for appointments to EC would remain operational till Parliament enacted a law on the issue.Advocate Prashant Bhushan said the SC judgment on composition of the selection panel had seminal importance in infusing independence in the EC. Substituting the CJI with a Union cabinet minister, chosen by the PM, would make the panel a government body and any selection of ECs by it would be seen as interfering with the independence of EC.He said the EC‚Äôs independence was vital to the legitimacy of elections and the vibrancy of democracy. The bench asked him to remind the court on Feb 3 to list the batch of petitions for hearing on Feb 4.On March 4 last year, EC Arun Goel had resigned after a challenge to his appointment was dismissed by the SC in Aug 2023. As another EC Satish Chandra Pandey had retired in Feb 2024, the EC was reduced to a one-member body in CEC Rajiv Kumar.In the meantime, a panel comprising the PM, home minister Amit Shah and then LoP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury (who dissented) recommended appointment of IAS officers Gyanesh Kumar and Sukhbir Singh Sandhu as ECs on Mar 16 last year ahead of Lok Sabha elections.","EC appts process valid till Parliament enacts law: SC in 2023 in Anoop Baranwal case.

(PTI)

NEW DELHI: The Maldives on Wednesday assured India that it will not undermine its larger neighbour‚Äôs security concerns on the issue of Chinese dual-use research vessels frequenting the strategically-located archipelago, while also responding positively to a slew of defence cooperation steps including lease extension of the two Indian helicopters and a Dornier aircraft deployed in the country.The emerging reset in bilateral relations, which have gained momentum since Maldivian President Mohammed Muizzu held talks with PM Narendra here last Oct after a period of decidedly icy ties, was evident in the meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and his counterpart Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon here.Describing the delegation-level meeting as ‚Äúfruitful‚Äù, Singh reaffirmed India‚Äôs readiness to support the Maldives in capability enhancement for defence preparedness, including provisioning of military platforms and assets to augment capacities of the Maldives National Defence Forces (MNDF). ‚ÄúThe discussions will add new vigour to India-Maldives relations,‚Äù he said.India also handed over defence equipment, including utility vehicles and berthing items worth around Rs 35 crore, to the Maldives. The two sides also agreed to accelerate the MNDF `Ekatha Harbour‚Äô project, the foundation stone for which was jointly laid in May 2023 by Singh and his then Maldivian counterpart Mariya Didi. The development of the coast guard harbour and repair facility at Sifavaru is one of the biggest grant-in-aid projects of India.The sharing of maritime security information as well as the supply of Indian coastal radar systems and other defence equipment to the Maldives also figured in the talks.Sources said the Maldivian delegation said their country will never take any step to compromise India‚Äôs security interests in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). India has conveyed to the Maldives its serious concerns about Chinese research ships docking at its ports and mapping oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations in the IOR.‚ÄúThe Maldives is conscious of our concerns that extra-regional powers should not gain ground and disturb the stability and equilibrium in the IOR,‚Äù a source said.Bilateral relations had become extremely strained after the pro-China Muizzu govt came to office in Mal√© in Nov 2023. Apart from signing a defence cooperation pact with China, the Muizzu govt had forced India to withdraw its over 80 military personnel operating the Dornier and two `Dhruv‚Äô advanced light helicopters in the archipelago.At the meeting, the extension of the about to expire lease of the Dornier and the two choppers, now operated by civilian Indian personnel, was also discussed. ‚ÄúThe Maldivian response was positive,‚Äù the source said.Maumoon acknowledged India‚Äôs historical role as the ‚ÄòFirst Responder‚Äô for the Maldives, while thanking New Delhi for assisting Mal√© in augmenting modern infrastructural capacities and training of the MNDF, the MoD said.The significant turnaround in ties came after India agreed to provide support in the form of $400 million and Rs 3,000 crore as a bilateral currency swap agreement to tackle the financial crisis being faced by the Maldives during the Modi-Muizzu meeting last October.The two sides on Wednesday reasserted the firm commitment to work closely in realizing the joint vision for the India-Maldives comprehensive economic and maritime security partnership, the MoD said.",The Maldives assured India that it will not undermine its larger neighbour‚Äôs security concerns on the issue of Chinese dual-use research vessels frequenting the strategically-located archipelago.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

BENGALURU: Bengaluru has claimed the top spot, surpassing Chennai, as India's best city for working women in 2024, providing an inclusive, secure and adaptable environment for women professionals, according to a survey.While Mumbai was ranked third and Delhi eight, South India demonstrated the highest level of gender inclusivity, with 16 cities from the region making it to the list of top 25 in the ‚Äò Top Cities for Women in India ' (TCWI) survey by workplace culture consulting firm Avtar Group.What also tilted the scales in favour of Bengaluru were higher scores in areas of women's skill development , employment opportunities, infrastructure facilities, and support for caregiving. Mumbai and Bengaluru scored highest, reflecting robust job markets and availability of skilling opportunities, whereas Chennai and Hyderabad lagged slightly behind.In terms of safety parameters, Mumbai and Hyderabad rank at the top. In the emerging smaller urban centres group, Thiruvananthapuram exhibited exemplary safety standards with a high rating, while Gurugram registered the lowest rating.Among the metros, Hyderabad and Bengaluru demonstrated superior caregiving infrastructure, whilst Gurugram and Coimbatore stand out for their exceptional support systems for dependents. Hyderabad emerged as the frontrunner with the highest infrastructure rating among major metropolitan areas, with Mumbai securing the second position, both offering robust transport networks and civic facilities.The 2024 City Inclusion Score (CIS) assessment evaluated selected Indian cities based on their gender inclusivity and equitable environment. The study analysed 120 cities, measuring their potential to foster inclusive environments for women.The evaluation framework comprised two primary components - the social inclusion score (SIS) consolidated four key parameters -- city liveability, safety metrics, employment representation of women, and women's empowerment initiatives. The assessment utilised official data from various govt sources, including the national Ease of Living report, National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) statistics, Periodic Labour Force Survey (2023-2024), Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER), and additional higher education parameters. The Industrial inclusion score (IIS) assessed the business environment's inclusivity towards women across different sectors. This component evaluated three crucial factors: organisations practising inclusion, industry-wide inclusivity measures, and career advancement facilitators.","Bengaluru has claimed the top spot, surpassing Chennai, as India's best city for working women in 2024.

'

Diddy‚Äôs 'Tantrums' over lost spotlight

A fall from grace

A battle for attention

Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs, once the undisputed king of hip-hop, now finds himself grappling with an entirely different kind of rivalry‚Äîone that has erupted inside the grim walls of Brooklyn‚Äôs Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC). The disgraced music mogul, facing decades in prison on sex trafficking charges , is reportedly fuming over the attention his fellow inmate, Luigi Mangione , has been receiving, reported the New York Post.Mangione, a 26-year-old accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December, has become an unexpected celebrity among inmates. Dubbed the ‚ÄúCEO Killer,‚Äù Mangione‚Äôs alleged crime‚Äîa cold-blooded murder tied to a manifesto railing against health insurance companies‚Äîhas struck a chord with his fellow prisoners. According to insiders, Mangione has been given a hero‚Äôs welcome behind bars, with inmates rallying around his anti-corporate message.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like a folk hero in here,‚Äù a source told The Daily Mail. ‚ÄúA lot of these guys have their own beefs with the healthcare system, and Mangione‚Äôs story resonates with them.‚ÄùBut not everyone is cheering. Combs, who entered MDC in September as its most famous inmate, is reportedly seething. Once the center of attention, the 55-year-old rapper now finds himself overshadowed by Mangione‚Äôs notoriety.‚ÄúDiddy has been throwing tantrums,‚Äù a source revealed. ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt stand that Luigi is the one everyone‚Äôs talking about. Even in prison, his ego is out of control.‚ÄùThe situation has escalated to the point where Combs has allegedly placed Mangione on his ‚Äús‚Äìt list,‚Äù despite the two men never having spoken.Combs‚Äô rage is a stark contrast to his diminished power within the prison walls. Once a titan of the music industry, he now faces allegations of hosting non-consensual ‚ÄúFreak Off‚Äù parties, with federal agents uncovering mountains of incriminating evidence, including hundreds of explicit videos and a stockpile of baby oil. Charged with racketeering, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, Combs could spend the rest of his life behind bars.Mangione, meanwhile, faces his own grim fate: 11 counts, including first-degree murder in furtherance of terrorism. Authorities claim his manifesto was a chilling prelude to the public assassination of Brian Thompson, a crime that shocked the nation and left the corporate world on edge.For now, both men remain confined to the same facility‚ÄîCombs in general population, Mangione in protective custody. But those close to the situation say the rivalry is far from over.‚ÄúDiddy‚Äôs entire identity is about being the biggest star in the room,‚Äù a former associate remarked. ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs not even the biggest star in prison. It‚Äôs eating him alive.‚ÄùAs the drama unfolds inside MDC, one thing is clear: fame, ego, and grudges don‚Äôt disappear in prison‚Äîthey just take on new, darker forms.","Diddy is reportedly fuming over the attention his fellow inmate, Luigi Mangione, has been receiving.

Stock market recommendations:Nifty saw a bout of short covering in second half of Wednesday‚Äôs trade ahead of its weekly expiry scheduled today allowing the index to end flat. Index had been reeling under pressure since it broke below its 200 DMA earlier this week. Though overall view on charts show further downside, the current short covering leg could take index back to 23900 ‚Äì 23950 wherein it could retest its 200 DMA support turned into resistance. Nifty has rejected closing below 23500, not one, two but thrice in the past 3 weeks of trade showing that there is a presence of short term buyers.Bank Nifty hit a fresh 7-month low in yesterday‚Äôs session, while the current short covering was seen on this index as well which helped recover more than 50% of its intraday losses. Bank Nifty is on the verge of facing a 6 month long head and shoulder pattern breakdown with neckline seen at 49600 on a closing basis. For now a trade between 49600 - 50600 could be seen playing out for the rest of this week on the index unless a clear path is not formed by the index on daily closing basis.MINDACORP is showing early signs of ending its 4.5 month corrective consolidation as the stock continues to find repeated support at its 200 DMA. Only in the past 3 months, stock has taken support and bounced off more than 5 times from its 200 DMA making this moving average a strong dynamic support zone for the scrip. A downward sloping trendline marking the ongoing consolidation is on the verge of giving a breakout above 535 closing which could allow further momentum on the scrip going forward.Stock has been in a sideways consolidation for the past 3 weeks now, this week‚Äôs price action confirms beginning of fresh leg upside. OBEROIRLTY has been outperforming its peers as well as the sectoral index NIFTYRLTY as the index has cooled of nearly 14% from its recent high in the past 2 quarters, while the stock has gained 35% in the same period. This outperformance is likely to continue for another 10-12% upside on the stock as consolidation nears to an end as per daily chart pattern.Shares were drooling under pressure last month after it broke below a bearish cup and handle pattern, however that bearish price action has negated strongly from the start of this new calendar year due to multiple external triggers. This has created a huge short covering move on the stock while a 38.2% retracement of its 44% correction seen over 4 months - seems to be a realistic target on the same. Momentum is likely to continue till 540/560 on the scrip in the short term.",Nifty saw a bout of short covering in second half of Wednesday‚Äôs trade ahead of its weekly expiry scheduled today.

Shane Watson: 'Unfortunate that India will not tour Pakistan for Champions Trophy'

Sydney Cricket Ground is love at first sight: SCG museum, walk of fame and all the facilities

Contingency plan

Sydney: The start of the ICC Champions Trophy is little over a month away but the venue situation is far from ideal in Pakistan. The construction and upgradation work is still underway at the National Stadium in Karachi, Gadaffi Stadium in Lahore and the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium , and it is a race against time to hand over the three venues to the International Cricket Council (ICC) by February 12. The stadium work, which got underway in August last year, was due to finish by December 31, but it's nowhere close to it.The ICC, understandably, is a worried bunch as a lot of infrastructural mess was on display during the USA leg of the T20 World Cup last year and the build-up to CT hasn't been ideal. It is understood that a team of the global cricket body will leave for Pakistan towards the end of the week to do a status check and informal contingency discussions are underway in Dubai corridors.""It is a very disappointing picture. All three stadiums are far from ready and it's not renovation or refurbishment, but proper construction which is underway. There is so much work left with seats, floodlights, facilities and even the outfield and playing surfaces,"" said a source tracking developments.TimesofIndia.com reached out to the ICC for a response on the current situation in Pakistan and the story will be updated when they respond.Lahore and Karachi are the two centres where heavy construction work is underway and their multi-storied enclosures, which will have dressing rooms and hospitality boxes, are yet to enter the finishing stages. In addition to the new enclosures, there is fencing work, placement of floodlights and seats which is far from the finish line. And the biggest roadblock is going to be the weather which will make it difficult for construction and finishing work to gather momentum.""The weather is not ideal for construction and finishing work to happen at a rapid pace. At Gadaffi, even the plaster work isn't completed yet. And most of the time is taken by finishing work because we are talking about dressing rooms etc. They just can't be random rooms/enclosures for an ICC event. ICC has a checklist which needs to be met. National Stadium has decided to not completely finish the new enclosure because there is no time,"" added the source.The Gadaffi stadium, which will host some marquee clashes, including one semi-final and possibly final (if India don't qualify), but it's the venue which is still far from ideal. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have no option but to work overtime, the ICC must ensure that rushed work doesn't compromise the safety of players.There is not much time left for the venues to be handed over and it's not a surprise that there are discussions about moving the entire tournament to the UAE. The last men's ICC tournament, T20 World Cup, was poorly planned and the upcoming Champions Trophy is certainly heading in that direction.""It's a no-brainer on what would happen if PCB misses deadlines and venues don't meet ICC checklist. Tournament can't be played at semi-ready venues. The next week will give more clarity on the future but PCB and ICC together need to pull off a miracle,"" stated the source.","ICC Champions Trophy is little over a month away but the venue situation is far from ideal in Pakistan.

In today's rapidly changing world economy, only a few individuals have reached a height of enormous financial success that exceeds the financial resources of several nations. This has been the result of some of the finest visionary leadership combined with innovation and strategic investments to solidify their positions in the list of the world's richest people. Their influence spans such industries as technology, e-commerce, luxury goods, and finance, and companies under their umbrellas have dramatically changed the way we live, work, and communicate.For those billionaires by 2025, it is no longer mere shaping of the economy but more so transforming it. Their excess wealth is not only due to a traditional business model but rather through disruptive technologies at the global scale, and therefore, bold decision-making. This elite group is composed of founders and CEOs of such giants in industries like SpaceX, Tesla, Amazon, Meta, Oracle, and Nvidia, among others.This report showcases the top 10 wealthiest people in the world according to Forbes, and the background details are given on the key business ventures and the strategies that enabled these billionaires to acquire such wealth.Elon Musk is the founder and CEO of SpaceX as well as Tesla. His wealth has significantly increased through his ventures in space exploration, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence with huge and recent surge in the valuation of SpaceX to $350 billion. SpaceX, Musk's aerospace company, has revolutionized the space industry as it develops technology capable of reusing rockets, which have significantly reduced the cost of space travel. Under Musk, Tesla has grown to become the world's most valuable electric vehicle manufacturer, a significant contributor to his wealth through its leadership in sustainable energy solutions and EV manufacturing. In addition to that, he is also a stakeholder in the microblogging service X (earlier known as Twitter) and in the AI firm xAI. These add up to his net worth.
