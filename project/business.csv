Airbus A320 Glitch: Ex-IAF Pilot Shows How ELAC 2 Fails In Real-Time Flight Simulation

NEW DELHI: As a Rs 50,000-crore sword hangs over air travellers at Delhi and Mumbai airports, the Centre has decided to back passengers in an old legal battle between airport operators and the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA), which has now reachedSupreme Court, where the matter will be heard on Dec 3.The case relates to ""hypothetical regulatory asset base (HRAB)"", the capital value of the assets used to calculate the costs of the regulated services, for the first two years of these airports during the PPP era, which started about 20 years ago.After a protracted legal battle followed by the recent Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) judgment, the case has now reached SC, where the two operators of the Delhi and Mumbai airports, DIAL and MIAL, have challenged the tribunal's order striking down theirRs 50,000-crore HRAB claim.""Aviation ministry is going to back AERA in this case as the implications of fares on air travellers are immense. If the private operators of Delhi and Mumbai airports win the case, we are looking at about Rs 50,000 crore getting due to these two operators, which could mean a manifold hike in both user development fees (UDF) paid directly by passengers, and airline landing and parking charges that air carriers factor in while calculating airfares.Overall, the burden for passengers could increase majorly. So, govt has decided to back AERA completely,"" officials said, adding UDF alone could rise by about nine times in Delhi and 21 times in Mumbai.Civil aviation ministry estimates domestic UDF at Delhi could rise from Rs 129 by almost 10 times to Rs 1,261, and at Mumbai from Rs 175 by 22 times to Rs 3,856.In early 2006, Delhi and Mumbai airports were handed over to private players for being developed in PPP (public private partnership) mode. Until then, the state-run Airports Authority of India used to have common charges for all its airports.AERA, which determines tariffs for major airports, came into being in mid-2009. ""The dispute essentially is for the period between the airports being handed over to GMR Group in Delhi and the then GVK Group in Mumbai, and the time when AERA started deciding aeronautical tariffs. If this amount of Rs 50,000 crore becomes due to the developers, the same will be recovered through passengers paying more, and this has to be fought tooth and nail legally. Aviation ministry will do just that,"" said sources.""DIAL and MIAL want a much higher value of assets they got in 2006. What were the assets that time at the two ariports? Run-down terminals barely worth a few hundred crores. They want value of non-aero assets to be added in the regulatory asset base. If that happens and value of non-aero development like hotels, malls and other commercial development is added, the entire model of brownfield airport development will go for a toss as it will come too expensive for users,"" officials said.","The Centre has decided to back passengers in an old legal battle between airport operators and the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA) The case relates to ""hypothetical regulatory asset base (HRAB),"" the capital value of the assets used to calculate the costs of the regulated services.

Social media response:

Yet you fired a ton of people who took care of that land and want to destroy it for oil.

Are you guys really that stupid to think that tourists will opt to go? You’re going to leave the NPS with a funding shortfall. More stupidity like firing the majority of park workers





So Americans get discounted access, foreigners pay more, and everything’s going digital.

BTW stop tracking us, we don't appreciate it. When you show your American The Beautiful Pass at the gate - they scan BOTH your pass AND your ID. That is a violation of our civil rights.





America really said “tourists pay, patriots play free” and called it progress





A row erupted after the US Department of the Interior announced sweeping changes to national park access, including higher fees for nonresidents and expanded digital passes. Starting January 1, 2026, US residents will pay $80 for an Annual Pass, while nonresidents will be charged $250.Nonresidents without a pass will also face a $100 per person fee to enter 11 of the most visited parks.“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”""The Department of @Interior is making it easier for AMERICANS to enjoy our National Parks: U.S. residents enjoy affordable pricing, while foreigners pay a high rate,"" the White House said in a post on X.In its announcement, the department also noted eight resident-only, ""patriotic fee-free"" days for 2026, including Memorial Day, Independence Day and Veteran's Day.US national parks have seen record numbers of tourists in recent years, with upwards of 331 million visitors in 2024 - an increase of at least 6 million compared to the year before, reported BBC .The Department has also announced a set of resident-only patriotic fee-free days for 2026. These include President’s Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day and President Trump’s birthday, the Independence Day weekend, the 110th Birthday of the National Park Service, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday and Veteran’s Day.Revenue from the revised fee structure will be invested directly back into the national parks, supporting upgrades to visitor facilities, essential maintenance work and improved services across the system. Critics have urged the Department to take a closer look at how the higher nonresident rates affect H-1B and F-1 visa holders. The new charges could disproportionately burden international visitors.","The US Department of the Interior announced sweeping changes to national park access.

What improvement looks like - small, visible acts

A new civic movement is needed



NEW DELHI: Across India, behaviours such as littering, spitting, flouting queues, honking needlessly, encroaching on public spaces, and damaging shared property have become so routine that they often pass without notice.They are not merely behavioural glitches; they are embedded, inherited patterns. The problem is not just policy, enforcement, or infrastructure. It is about mindsets passed quietly from one generation to the next, shaping how we view shared spaces and each other.These visuals are perhaps the way of life for many Indians: a man flinging garbage from his car window; a commuter spitting paan from a moving train; a woman stealing blankets from railway compartments; adults teaching children to urinate on roadsides even when public toilets are nearby.The story of an unruly passenger urinating on a co-passenger aboard an Air India flight shocked the nation. But is it really shocking in a country where public walls are routinely marked with fresh stains of neglect?As Kanchan Yadav puts it, ""Just the other day I wanted to stop a man and ask him to show some basic civic sense instead of casually peeing in the open. But somehow, in this country, people seem far more offended by kissing in public than by pissing in public.Whether you're at a bus stand, outside a shop, or just walking past any public space, the most uncomfortable sight is men relieving themselves anywhere they want. They turn entire corners mushy, filthy and unbearable, assaulting your olfactory like a crime scene. """"We keep calling our country motherland and talk so proudly about Mother Nature, but do we really have the civic sense to keep this 'mother' clean and safe?"" she added.We as a society lack basic civic sense. Why? Is it poor education? Weak enforcement? Overpopulation? A scarcity mindset? Or simply a general belief that public spaces are 'not our problem?'The answer, like the problem, is layered.Much of our public discourse around India’s livability focuses on government action: policy, policing, infrastructure, budgets. But a nation’s quality of life is equally, if not more, defined by its people.Ayush Pandey reflected these sentiments as he narrated an incident from his childhood. ""What I vividly remember from my childhood is travelling in general compartments of trains. Back then, as a four or five-year-old, my mother would sometimes make me urinate out of the train window. At that age, I obviously did not understand the difference between relieving myself in public and using a proper washroom — I only remember it as something done for convenience during travel,"" he said.""As I grew old enough to understand the idea of private versus public spaces, I don’t remember doing it again. Until a certain age, this responsibility lies completely with parents, and I believe many children have experienced similar moments on highways or at railway stations,"" Pandey added.While he admitted that most civic issues emerge from poor infrastructure, Ayush added that many cases are mere examples of laziness. He said, ""Civic sense is not just something expected from adults — it is basic courtesy and awareness. Still, we often see grown men urinating in public without hesitation, as if it is their right instead of walking to the nearest restroom. According to me, many Indians have developed a habit: if they can avoid walking even 200–300 steps, or if a washroom is not easily accessible, they simply look left and right — and relieve themselves in the open. ""A city with spotless streets and smooth traffic can be ruined in days if citizens refuse to cooperate. And yet, even a modest city can become pleasant if its people practice discipline and collective responsibility.Consider this: In just the first three months of this year, the Eastern Railway collected over Rs 32 lakh in fines from people spitting across railway stations in Kolkata. And this is just one zone of one railway system in one part of the country. Imagine the true nationwide scale.Or take another recurring story: passengers stealing railway blankets, pillows, taps, mugs and even fans. These are not acts of poverty-driven desperation. Often, they are simply opportunistic and shameless—small acts that collectively damage India’s reputation and weaken public services.Then there are examples from the other side—moments that feel like a slap of irony. In Gurugram, a group of foreign nationals recently organized a cleanliness drive, clearing roads and drains and urging residents to keep the surroundings outside their homes and shops clean.The sight of foreigners cleaning Indian streets while locals walk by unfazed speaks volumes about our civic apathy.These examples do not mean Indians are inherently careless. Rather, they show what happens when generations grow up without structured civic education, without consistent enforcement, and without cultural emphasis on responsibility for shared spaces.In 1982, Wilson and Kelling proposed the now famous Broken Windows Theory: if a broken window is left unrepaired, it signals that more damage will not cost anything. Disorder invites more disorder.India’s streets are a perfect case study. A clean street invites caution. A dirty street becomes a public dustbin. The moment someone sees a pile of garbage on the curb, the brain goes 'Arre yahan sab phenk rahe hain—main bhi dal deta hoon.'Children observe this too. When they see adults casually littering, they internalise it as 'normal behaviour.' With time, this turns into a collective moral numbness: If the environment is already dirty, what difference will my one wrapper make?This is how individual choices compound into national outcomes.Environmentalist Vimlendu Jha believes the problem lies both at policy and individual level. ""It is a behavioural problem when someone says 'chalta hai' while throwing a wrapper outside their car but the same individual won't do so abroad. Forget America, you will not find litter even in Delhi metro. But you will find the railway station across that metro station dirty, the adjoining streets and markets dirty.""""If littering is naturally coming to me, why is this behavior not showing when I take the metro? Why is the New Delhi Metro Station cleaner than New Delhi Railway station? This talks volumes of both the norms and the laws that are being followed,"" said Jha. ""I don't believe littering is part of our DNA as Indians. We are not dirty by design. We work on convenience, we believe in taking shortcuts when no one is watching and the same Indian behaves differently in another country. ""Generations of Indians have lived in an environment where resources—jobs, seats, houses, promotions, rations—were limited. This created a deeply rooted scarcity mindset: If you don’t rush, push, grab, or seize, someone else will take your seat.This mindset spills into daily behaviour:- pushing into trains before passengers have exited- jostling for space in queues- rushing into elevators without letting people out- honking aggressively- breaking traffic rules, overspeedingEven among the affluent, this scarcity attitude persists. It is not about poverty; it is about conditioning.The result is a society where individual urgency trumps collective order, where personal convenience often matters more than mutual respect.Another major factor is the disconnect between rules and consequences.In India, rules are often seen as suggestions, not obligations. Why? Because breaking them rarely brings consequences.People see influential individuals—politicians, celebrities, senior bureaucrats—violating rules with impunity: driving on the wrong side of the road, avoiding fines, intimidating enforcement authorities, or using privilege to bypass regulations.This teaches the public two dangerous lessons:- Rules apply only to the powerless.-Breaking rules is fine as long as you don’t get caught.Children absorb this quickly. They see their parents bragging about how they avoided a(fine), or how a(hack) helped them bypass a procedure. They learn that bending rules is not just acceptable—it is admired.Thus, a culture develops where accountability is weak, and civic sense becomes optional rather than essential.A fundamental misconception in India is that public spaces belong to the government, not the people.'This is not my property' becomes 'I don’t need to take care of it.'So we litter on beaches, damage train seats, spit on walls, break public taps, vandalise monuments, scribble names on heritage structures—all because we subconsciously feel these spaces belong to nobody (or “the government”), and therefore to everyone in a way that excuses neglect.In Scandinavian countries, Japan, or Singapore, public spaces are treated as collective property—extensions of one’s home. In India, public spaces are treated as expendable.Even the most civic-minded citizen struggles in an environment where infrastructure is inadequate:- garbage bins are scarce- footpaths are encroached- public toilets are dirty- traffic systems are chaotic- drainage systems fail in monsoonsAnother difficult truth: civic sense is tied to how we treat people we consider 'lesser.'Many Indians behave respectfully in five-star hotels, airports, or foreign countries—but act very differently in markets, bus stations, and public offices. Why? Because we treat certain spaces, and certain people, as 'inferior,' not worth respecting.The presence of hierarchies—class, caste, gender—distorts our public behaviour:- yelling at sanitation workers, domestic helpers- ignoring queues when domestic helpers are standing in them- bargaining with vegetable-sellers, autorickshaw drivers- honking at pedestrians as if they are obstaclesWithout equality, civic sense withers.For decades, civic education in India has been treated as a formality — light textbook chapters, boring diagrams, no real-world application. Schools focus on exams, not on building socially responsible citizens. Parents often prioritise grades, not behaviour in public spaces. And children learn most strongly not from books, but from what they see adults do.When a child sees a parent throw garbage on the street, it becomes normal. When a child watches elders jump queues, bribe officials, break traffic rules, talk down to domestic workers, or misuse public property, it creates a blueprint for adulthood.""Environment education should not be treated as a subject to score marks. It is a lifestyle choice at the end of the day with clear implications on our lives and culture. We really need to enforce that value system. Environment education paradigm has to shift from just mere knowledge which is information based vs value and action based,"" said Jha.And these habits persist because public behaviour is contagious. Which brings us to the first root cause.India eradicated diseases like Polio through mass awareness and coordinated action. Civic behaviour can be transformed the same way—with a structured, nation-wide effort involving schools, parents, media, and community institutions.And the most crucial piece of this change is children.Children are still forming values. They observe, absorb, and imitate. If given the right guidance, they can reshape the cultural norms that adults have broken.Schools must treat civic sense not as a textbook chapter but as a core part of learning:- daily cleanliness rituals- community outreach programs- traffic rule workshops- waste segregation practices- field visits to understand sanitation and water management- compulsory social responsibility modulesParents must lead by example:- no littering- following queues- treating workers with dignity- obeying traffic rules- stop flexing 'jugaads' in front of childrenChildren learn civic sense from what they see, not what they are told.Advertisements, influencers, films, and social media campaigns can normalise good behaviour the way they normalise trends. Positive peer pressure works better than moral lectures.When civic sense improves, it won’t happen in grand gestures. It will happen in:- a driver stopping before a zebra crossing- a child refusing to litter- a shopkeeper keeping his storefront clean- neighbours cooperating in waste segregation- a commuter asking another not to spit- a tourist complimenting Indians over discipline- a railway coach that remains clean after a long journeyCivic sense is not theoretical. It’s practical, everyday discipline that builds a collective culture.Today, India stands as one of the largest economies and one of the most influential global powers. Yet, the basics— public cleanliness, traffic discipline, respect for common spaces — lag far behind.If we want to become a truly developed society, civic sense must be reimagined as a moral responsibility, a cultural value, a national priority and a daily habit.We have the ingenuity, the youth power, the technological tools, and the community strength to transform our civic culture. What we need is intention.The responsibility lies with all of usIndia’s lack of civic sense is not an unchangeable flaw. It is the result of years of neglect, inconsistent education, overcrowded cities, poor enforcement, and inherited habits. But every habit can be unlearned. Every culture can evolve. Every generation can do better than the last.Just as we took pride in eradicating Polio, we can take pride in building a cleaner, more respectful, more disciplined India.The responsibility lies with all of us—parents, teachers, leaders, citizens—and especially the children who will inherit this country. Because at the end of the day, a nation is not made great by its government. It is made great by its people.","Across India, behaviours such as littering, spitting, flouting queues, honking needlessly, encroaching on public spaces have become so routine that they often pass without notice.

"EC extends SIR deadline by a week, it's Dec 11 now",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ec-extends-sir-deadline-by-a-week-its-dec-11-now/articleshow/125680631.cms,"Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

Next polls due only in April-May, EC can stretch SIR by a week

NEW DELHI: Election Commission on Sunday extended the timeline for SIR Phase 2 across all 12 states and Union territories, allowing an additional week to booth level officers (BLOs) to share the list of absent, shifted, dead and duplicate electors with booth level agents (BLAs) of political parties prior to publication of the draft electoral roll, so as to ensure full transparency.The enumeration period will now continue till Dec 11 instead of the earlier Dec 4. The draft electoral roll will be published on Dec 16 instead of Dec 9. Claims and objections can be submitted until Jan 15, 2026, and final roll will be out on Feb 14 (Feb 7 earlier).The stretching of all legs of SIR comes amid reports of alleged malpractices in states. Instances include submission of enumeration forms by ineligible persons or illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in the name of dead electors, and login credentials of dead BLOs being misused to upload EFs signed in the name of dead electors.Even though these cases may be limited, there is a view that sharing the list of absent, permanently shifted, dead and duplicate entries with the parties through their BLAs even before the draft rolls are published will allow rival parties an opportunity to object to any incorrect findings. They can also point out attempts to sneak in ineligible persons into the draft roll through impersonation of dead voters.An official said since the next round of assembly polls in five states/UT, including West Bengal, is due only in April-May 2026, the poll authority has time to stretch SIR by a week if it helps ensure a perfect electoral roll.Any errors or anomalies can be corrected in advance, minimising doubts, apprehensions and complaints after the draft rolls are published, the official underlined.Incidentally, the extension in SIR timeline comes even as the enumeration exercise is well on track, with EFs of 84.3% electors across 12 states/UTs collected by far. The EF collection stands at 100% in Lakshadweep, 96.6% in Goa, 95.6% in Rajasthan, 95.2% in West Bengal, 92.7% in Madhya Pradesh, 92.1% in Puducherry, 88.7% in Chhattisgarh, 87.6% in Tamil Nadu, 86% in Gujarat, 83.6% in Andaman & Nicobar, 81.2% in Kerala and 69.5% in UP.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his monthly radio pogramme Mann Ki Baat , on Sunday said the month of November has ""brought a lot of aspirations"" and recalled the major events of which the nation witnessed in the 11th month of the 2025.""India has taken a major step in maintenance, repair, and overhaul in the aviation sector. Last week, INS Mahe was inducted into the Indian Navy in Mumbai. Last week, India's space ecosystem got a new boost with Skyroot's Infinity Campus.

It was about a unique drone competition organised by ISRO. In this video, our country's youth, especially our Gen-Z, were attempting to fly drones in Martian-like conditions. In this competition, a team of young people from Pune achieved some success. Their drone even fell and crashed several times, but they did not give up. After several attempts, this team's drone managed to fly for some time in the conditions of Mars.He added that the video reminded him of the setback when Chandrayaan went out of network coverage. Further, the Prime Minister added that the setback was followed by the success of Chandrayaan-3.""This video reminded me of the day Chandrayaan went out of network coverage.

Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","AI-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality.

Airbus A320 Glitch: Ex-IAF Pilot Shows How ELAC 2 Fails In Real-Time Flight Simulation

NEW DELHI: Software rolled back, solar-storm threat neutralised. Indian operators of Airbus A320 jets - IndiGo Air India and Air India Express - finished reverting flight-control computers to a safer 2022 version in just over a day, heading off widespread groundings feared after the manufacturer raised red flags late Friday.DGCA was informed early Sunday that 323 aircraft had received the required ""downgrade"" to an earlier edition of the elevator and aileron computer (ELAC). Airbus had found that a later software upgrade could trigger sudden loss of control during intense solar storms - a failure linked to a US carrier's A320 that plunged abruptly on Oct 30, injuring 15 passengers.IndiGo completed the task across all 200 affected aircraft. Air India carried out the fix on 100 - nine jets were later assessed as not needing the rollback and four were already in base maintenance. AI Express finished updates on 23 of 25, with two under redelivery maintenance.Carriers escaped major disruption - only single-digit cancellations and delays of up to 90 minutes - thanks to IndiGo's young A320 fleet and the AI Group's limited number of older airframes. Older aircraft require hardware modifications alongside the software rollback, expanding task time.Globally, fallout was heavier. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised for the turmoil but insisted urgency was essential. ""The fix required on some A320 aircraft has been causing significant logistical challenges and delays... But we consider that nothing is more important than safety,"" he wrote on X, adding that Airbus teams were working ""around the clock"" to help airlines get aircraft flying again.",IndiGo Air India and Air India Express finished reverting flight-control computers to a safer 2022 version in just over a day.

Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

NEW DELHI: At least one in every five car users on tolled National Highway stretches is now using FASTag Annual Pass to pay the user fee. With an active user base of 36.3 lakh and around 20,000 new buyers being added daily, the scheme has become a runaway success in just three and a half months since its launch, data show.The FASTag Annual Pass, priced at Rs 3,000, allows private car owners to cross 200 toll plazas in a year, effectively bringing down the fee to just Rs 15 per plaza. It has emerged as the most convenient and cost-friendly payment option for inter-city commuters. Data from more than a dozen toll plazas show that over 40% of car users are paying the user fee through the annual pass.“At the national level, nearly 22% of toll transactions for cars are done using the annual pass. The newly operational Bijwasan toll plaza on the Dwarka Expressway in Delhi has the highest share, with more than 50% of such transactions. It is followed by the Mundka toll plaza in Delhi (48.2%) and the Jhinjholi plaza in Sonipat, Haryana, where the share is over 47%,” said a senior NHAI official.Data further show that on average around 13 lakh toll payment transactions occur through the annual pass each day.Officials said initial feedback from toll operators and commuters indicates that there have been hardly any instances of altercation or violence over the new system between commuters and user-fee collectors at plazas. They added that the increased adoption of the system has also significantly reduced queues at toll gates. “It has improved the operational efficiency of toll operators. We will soon carry out a comprehensive impact assessment of the scheme,” said a top official of IHMCL, a subsidiary of NHAI.","The FASTag Annual Pass, priced at Rs 3,000, allows private car owners to cross 200 toll plazas in a year.

India’s Maritime Future Is Preordained: CDS Chauhan Predicts Indian Navy’s Decisive Warfighting Role

NEW DELHI: Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi on Sunday said he would not call Bangladesh “anything other than a friend” and expressed confidence that “things would turn around” for India’s eastern neighbour after its parliamentary elections in February 2026.India–Bangladesh relations have remained strained since the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5, 2024. Hasina, who resigned after months of student-led protests, has been living in Delhi since her ouster.“I would still refrain from calling Bangladesh anything other than a friend — because this could be a temporary and transitory moment. We’ll have to wait; elections have to happen, and then something else can happen,” Admiral Tripathi said in Pune, where he attended the passing-out parade of cadets at the National Defence Academy (NDA).He added that he met Bangladeshi cadets — the NDA also trains cadets from friendly foreign countries — ahead of the parade, and recalled that his first visit after taking over as Navy chief was to Bangladesh.“I was supposed to go to some ‘fancy’ capital but I said, ‘No. I must first go to Bangladesh.’ Tremendous warmth, tremendous hospitality...tremendous nostalgia about what India did,” he remarked, referring possibly to the 1971 India-Pakistan war that led to the creation of Bangladesh.“I'm an eternal optimist and I hope that things would turn around as far as Bangladesh is concerned,” Admiral Tripathi remarked.The neighbouring nation is currently governed by a caretaker administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which assumed charge days after Hasina’s exit.Hasina was recently sentenced to death by a Bangladeshi International Crimes Tribunal for “crimes against humanity” linked to the student protest movement. Dhaka has repeatedly sought her extradition, while New Delhi maintains that the request remains under “consideration.”","India–Bangladesh relations have remained strained since the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina-led government on August 5, 2024.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India (ECI) has pulled up the West Bengal government for not releasing the increased honorarium for booth level officers (BLOs) and the additional payment approved for the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls.In a statement, the poll body said it had informed an All India Trinamool Congress delegation during a November 28 meeting that the delay in payments was “very strange”.“We told the AITC delegation… that it is very strange that the increased honorarium of Rs 12,000 per year for BLOs and an additional Rs 6,000 to BLOs for SIRs approved by the ECI has not yet been paid by the state government.

It also approved an honorarium for electoral registration officers (EROs) and assistant electoral registration officers (AEROs).The Commission said the revision was meant to acknowledge the crucial work of field teams engaged in preparing clean and transparent voter lists.""Pure electoral rolls are the bedrock of democracy.

Opposition flags Delhi blast, SIR, air pollution and farmers’ concerns

Government ready to hear Opposition, stresses rules and procedure

Bills listed for the Winter Session

NEW DELHI: An all-party meeting was held on Sunday ahead of the Winter Session of Parliament . The Opposition demanded detailed discussions during the session and raised concerns over the government’s handling of key national matters.The Opposition sought debates on national security in the wake of the recent Delhi blast, the “SIR” issue, rising air pollution, farmers’ concerns, safeguarding democracy and foreign policy developments.The meeting was chaired by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju . Union ministers Rajnath Singh, Arjun Ram Meghwal and JP Nadda were also present.On the Opposition side, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh, TMC’s Kalyan Banerjee, Samajwadi Party MP Ram Gopal Yadav and AIADMK’s M Thambi Durai were among those attending.Kalyan Banerjee criticized the government for not allowing certain issues raised by the Opposition to be discussed. He highlighted key concerns such as SIR and MGNREGA and questioned the role of the Opposition if parliamentary debate is restricted.Congress deputy leader in the Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi said the party raised these issues at the meeting and insisted that Parliament must debate them.“It seems the government, under the leadership of the prime minister and the home minister, is looking to finish off India’s democracy and parliamentary traditions,” he said.Gogoi added that the Opposition wanted a discussion on national security, especially after the Delhi blast, and on “ensuring the purity of the voter list”. He also flagged economic security, saying farmers were still not receiving fair prices.On foreign policy, Gogoi said, “India is formulating its foreign policy on the basis of other countries. Someone does not like us buying oil from Russia. Another country is investing in its defence and we are not ready.”Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav warned that his party would not allow the House to function if a discussion on the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls is not held.“We will not allow the House to function if discussion is not held on SIR. The Samajwadi Party has raised the issue of SIR because on a large scale, I have seen irregularities. First, we used to hear but now we are seeing that people's votes are being cut. In Bihar, there have been malpractices. We have demanded a discussion on it (SIR). They cannot shy away from it by citing the Election Commission,” he said.On the upcoming Winter Session of Parliament, Congress MP Pramod Tiwari also highlighted several issues the Opposition intends to raise.He also pointed to the schedule of parliamentary business and strategic meetings planned by the Opposition.“The SIR was conducted across the entire state in a very short span of time, which is impossible... Blasts have occurred in the capital. Prime Minister Modi’s foreign policies are completely lost. In addition, air pollution in Delhi and other states must be discussed in detail. We have a strategic meeting today at 6 pm, and the Business Advisory Committee meeting is happening at 4 pm. Let us see what is on the BJP’s agenda,” Tiwari said.DMK MP Tiruchi Siva said that all Opposition parties were unanimous in demanding discussion on the “SIR” issue during the session.CPI-M MP John Brittas said, “Delhi blast exposed govt; we want discussion on security issues.” He added that if Parliament faces disruptions, “it is full responsibility of government.”After the all-party meeting, Rijiju addressed concerns about the functioning of Parliament and the conduct of members during the Winter Session. He emphasized that the government was open to discussions and intended to ensure that all issues are debated within parliamentary rules.“No one said that the Parliament will not function or will not let it function. Some leaders said that they can create a ruckus in the House over SIR.

What is overconsumption?



How brands and creators flatten taste



Insecurity: the quiet nudge



Trends move fast because satisfaction is the enemy of the algorithm; insecurity is its most reliable employee.

Fomo : engine behind overconsumption



Overpriced props: When utility takes a backseat



Social media’s role in impulse buying



Why this is a social issue



Environmental burden: Resource depletion, emissions from production and shipping, water usage, and eventual waste affect everyone, far beyond the buyer. Landfills grow, oceans fill with microplastics from synthetic textiles, and the carbon footprint of “ultrafast” fashion accelerates climate stress.

Resource depletion, emissions from production and shipping, water usage, and eventual waste affect everyone, far beyond the buyer.

Inequality & exclusion : If you can’t keep up with constant trends, you risk being “left out.” This isn’t just a social media feeling — it affects real-world interactions, from workplaces to schools. The pressure to maintain an appearance of being “up-to-date” reinforces economic and social disparities.

When everyone copies the same aesthetic, individuality disappears. Local styles, cultural nuances, and personal experimentation are replaced with homogenized, algorithm-approved visuals. The result is a monoculture of taste, where creativity and cultural diversity are suppressed. Normalisation of waste: Impulse buying and disposability become habits. Owning fewer, better-curated items is no longer aspirational; chasing constant novelty is normalised.

Reclaiming individuality in a copy-paste world



High cost of looking the same



Step into a cafe, stroll across a college campus, wander through a mall corridor, or glance around an office floor — and one thing hits you: a uniform look. Clean-aesthetic tees, minimalist sneakers, matching water bottles, tote bags, neutral-toned gym outfits, skincare pouches, desk essentials — it’s as if everyone’s pulled straight from the same global wardrobe.But this sameness isn’t just fashion fatigue or convenience. It reflects a bigger shift — one where individuality is quietly fading, replaced by trend-driven conformity. Buying is no longer about what we need or genuinely like; it’s about belonging, insecurity, and feeding the endless scroll.Digital culture observer and content creator Oorjita Shahi, who commands a following of around 37k on social media and goes by @oorja.walking, has been closely tracking these patterns:“From a content creator perspective, when brands come to people, they have a set campaign idea and sometimes even provide scripts. Some people, especially those desperate for brand deals, might agree to say literally whatever the brand wants. Brands often use insecurity — especially in beauty — to sell products. They know making people feel anxious works. So people feel like they’re missing out,"" she said.Overconsumption isn’t just buying a lot. It’s buying more than you need, more than you use, and often more than you can responsibly discard.It means accumulating “stuff” — clothes, gadgets, accessories — at a pace far higher than your lifestyle actually requires.Often, these items aren’t bought for necessity. They’re aesthetic props: water bottles that photograph well, outfits that match a “feed vibe,” skincare kits that promise discipline, notebooks and planners that signal productivity, décor that “completes” a room.The consequences are real. The fashion and consumer goods industry is responsible for 8–10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Synthetic textiles release microplastics in washing cycles, and many clothes find themselves in landfills within a year. ( Scientific American Buying more than we need isn’t just personal indulgence — it’s a burden on resources, a generator of waste, and a contributor to climate stress.What once was local — shaped by culture, climate, and personal history — is now global. Brands and social media creators aren’t selling just products anymore; they’re selling a ready-made aesthetic.With global supply chains, social media marketing, product drops, and algorithm-driven trends, a look created in one place can spread everywhere in days. Platforms reward sameness: neutral clothes, minimalist rooms, curated routines. Follow the formula and you get visibility — and not just online. These aesthetics become social expectations in real life too, shaping how people dress, decorate, and present themselves.Consumers, then, are rarely buying a product — they’re buying a template for identity.The engine behind all this is insecurity. Marketing no longer sells utility; it sells reassurance. Posts, Stories, and videos on Instagram or TikTok cultivate longing: the feeling that maybe, just maybe, you’re not quite enough without this bag, this sneaker, this serum.Psychologists describe this phenomenon as Social Comparison Theory: People constantly evaluate themselves against others, measuring their lives, looks, and possessions. Social media feeds amplify this comparison, nudging users toward purchases that promise belonging, status, or social approval.Research confirms it. A 2021 study, Instagram Influencer Marketing: Perceived Social Media Marketing Activities and Online Impulse Buying, found that when influencers are attractive and trustworthy, users are significantly more likely to make impulse purchases. (First Monday)Fear of missing out — Fomo— is more than a buzzword; it has become a behavioural driver for many online shoppers. Social media platforms, armed with data on what catches your eye, deliberately create a sense of urgency. Limited-edition drops, countdown timers, trending hashtags, and influencer endorsements combine to make users feel that if they don’t act immediately, they’ll be left behind socially.The effect goes beyond a single purchase. Each “must-have” item comes with the invisible expectation of a next upgrade, a newer release, or a seasonal refresh. The fleeting satisfaction of acquiring a trending item is almost always replaced by the pressure to chase the next one. In this ecosystem, buying becomes less about fulfillment and more about keeping pace with the digital social hierarchy.Many of the products trending online are designed for perception rather than function.They promise visual appeal, social validation, or a lifestyle narrative, rather than practical value. A pastel water bottle may cost multiple times a standard reusable bottle, not because it performs better, but because it signals belonging to a curated aesthetic.Similarly, notebooks, planners, hoodies, and even niche skincare kits often survive solely on “vibe” — the sense that they complete a personal or social narrative. Once their novelty fades, these items frequently languish unused, join the pile of impulse buys, or end up discarded, contributing to environmental waste.Overconsumption, in this way, turns curated identity into disposable consumption, and the cost is measured not just in money, but in environmental and psychological tolls.Research backs this pattern. Instagram users exposed to trustworthy and relatable influencers are more likely to impulse-buy. ( First Monday, 2021 Another study, The Influence of Instagram Influencers on Impulse Buying Fashion Products ( Journal UNNES ), found that trust, similarity, and familiarity of influencers drive spontaneous purchases.Trend-driven fashion also carries an environmental cost, contributing roughly 8–10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. ( Scientific American Overconsumption isn’t just personal — it’s societal, with consequences that ripple far beyond individual choices.""I think influencers do have a big responsibility to discuss discourage overconsumption. Overconsumption is a big social issue. It's really important to have an approach where they make it very clear that this is just the product that I am marketing, I am not going to pretend like I use these hundred serums,"" said Oorjita when asked if she believes influencers have a responsibility to discourage overconsumption.Solutions begin small, but they matter. Resisting the scroll starts with pausing before buying, reflecting on whether an item is genuinely for you or just for your feed. Choosing with intention, prioritizing durability and personal style, buying fewer items but wearing them longer, and repairing instead of replacing are all ways to regain control.Supporting transparent creators who disclose sponsorships, choosing sustainable brands, reusing, recycling, and ultimately redefining identity beyond consumption all reinforce individuality.""A personality forms through your own understanding of yourself and being self aware about what you like and what you don't like about the world. If you are on social media for six, seven hours a day- you derive all your inspiration from social media and not from the people you meet in real life and the activities and the hobbies,"" Oorjita simply put it.In a world of mass-produced aesthetics and viral feeds, individuality is quietly disappearing — replaced by uniformity, impulse, waste, and dissatisfaction. Influencer culture, algorithmic virality, and brand-driven marketing don’t just sell products — they sell versions of identity, belonging, and acceptance, and belonging’s currency is constant consumption.But overconsumption isn’t just personal: it burdens the planet, erases diversity, and normalizes waste as lifestyle. Real resistance means choosing slowly, buying intentionally, and reclaiming identity from the scroll.Before your next purchase, ask: Is this for me — or for my feed? Because individuality was never meant to be mass-produced, and real style was never meant to be just trending.","Fashion industry responsible for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Social comparison, FOMO, and influencer-driven ideals turn identity into a performance. Owning fewer, better-curated items is no longer aspirational; chasing constant novelty is normalised.

'Doesn’t Deserve LoP Post’: BJP Slams Rahul Gandhi For Missing CJI Surya Kant’s Oath Ceremony

NEW DELHI: The economic offences wing of the Delhi police has registered a fresh FIR against senior Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, along with six other associates and business entities in an alleged case of criminal conspiracy to ""fraudulently"" acquire Associated Journals Ltd, then a Congress held entity having properties worth Rs 2,000 crore. The acquisition was made through Young Indian in which the Gandhis held 76% shareholding.The Delhi police FIR, dated Oct 3, is based on a complaint filed by the Headquarters Investigative Unit (HIU) of the ED, which has shared detailed findings of its investigation into National Herald money laundering case from 2008-2024.Sharing of information under Sec 66(2) of the PMLA allows ED to ask another enforcement agency to register and probe a scheduled offence, which can then become a predicate offence necessary for the ED to carry out its own investigation under the PMLA.The ongoing money laundering probe by ED is based on a private complaint from former BJP MP Subramanian Swamy and its cognisance by metropolitan magistrate's court in Patiala House in June 2014. In this case, the central agency filed a prosecution complaint (chargesheet) under PMLA against Gandhis and other accused on April 9 before a special MPs/MLAs court here at Rouse Avenue. The court has not taken cognisance yet of the matter.Congress has consistently disputed the charges and has accused ED of carrying out a political witchunt at govt's instance. When TOI contacted the party again on Delhi police registering an FIR, it said they are not aware of it.Besides Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, the FIR registered by the Delhi Police has named three others, including chief of Indian Overseas Congress Sam Pitroda. It also names three entities, AJL, Young Indian and the Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd, allegedly a Kolkata-based shell company that provided Rs 1 crore to Young India from which Gandhis paid Congress Rs 50 lakh to allegedly acquire AJL with assets allegedly worth Rs 2,000 crore.Sources said the police is likely to summon shareholders of AJL for questioning to ascertain whether the Congress consulted them and took their approval before transferring the company to Young Indian, beneficially owned by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.","The economic offences wing of the Delhi police has registered a fresh FIR against senior Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.

Sonu Sood Questioned For Nearly Seven Hours By ED In Betting App PMLA Case

Rapido denies involvement

NEW DELHI: A probe into illegal betting-linked money laundering has led the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to a bike-taxi driver in Delhi, whose bank account saw unexplained deposits of Rs 331.36 crore over eight months.Officials said the agency stumbled upon the Rapido driver while tracking transactions connected to the 1xBet betting network.

AHMEDABAD: Kenosha prosecutors in the US have filed felony charges against two Gujaratis based in the Chicago suburbs for allegedly siphoning off more than $653,000 worth of gold from an elderly woman in North Kenosha. Investigators say this is part of a wider, internationally coordinated scam. The charges were filed on Nov 20.The Kenosha County District Attorney's Office has charged Jagdishkumar Nandani and Chintan Thakkar with money laundering over $100,000 and theft of movable property over $100,000.Investigators said the scheme began when the woman received repeated calls from a man falsely claiming to be a federal agent. The caller allegedly told her that her bank accounts were hacked and linked to criminal activity, and that the safest option was to convert her savings into gold. ""This was a deliberate attempt to trap a vulnerable elderly citizens,"" said an officer familiar with the case, adding that such calls often involve trained handlers operating from overseas.The woman handed over $332,750 worth of gold on March 1 and another $139,500 on March 15 at her home, believing she was cooperating with federal authorities.Officers said she later sold her house, fearing it too was compromised, and converted that amount into gold before parting with it. Her total loss exceeded $653,000.According to court records, police in Addison, Illinois, detained Nandani in March. Officers said he admitted to picking up gold in Kenosha, and phone-location data placed him near the victim's residence on the dates of the handovers. The criminal complaint states that Nandani identified Thakkar as an active partner, and that both men were in contact with individuals in India through messaging platforms. A person known as ""Rahul"" is suspected of assigning pickup routes and providing instructions.Officers said Nandani usually retained between $1,000 and $1,500 per pickup, delivering the remaining gold to multiple drop-off points in Chicago. ""Most of the proceeds were pushed to handlers outside the US,"" an investigator said, adding that the two Gujaratis were part of a structured chain.Kenosha police were alerted after Addison officers found the victim's details in Nandani's phone. Arrest warrants have been issued for both accused, who are yet to be taken into custody.","U.S. prosecutors in the US have filed felony charges against two Gujaratis based in the Chicago suburbs.

H-1B Controversy Erupts After US Economist Alleges Industrial-Scale Fraud Targeting Indian Visas

BENGALURU: The top seven Indian IT firms received only 4,573 H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2025—a 70% decline from 2015 and 37% fewer than in 2024, according to the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP). The analysis, based on data from the USCIS H-1B Employer Data Hub, shows TCS is the only Indian IT services company among the top five employers securing approvals for new H-1B workers in the US.TCS is also the only Indian IT company in the top five for continuing-employment approvals, though its rejection rate for extensions increased to 7%, up from 4% in 2024, and significantly higher than its peers. Overall, USCIS recorded a 1.9% rejection rate for continuing-employment petitions. This year, TCS secured 5,293 approvals for continued employment. For initial employment, India's largest IT services company received 846 approvals, compared with 1,452 in 2024 and 1,174 in 2023, with a 2% rejection rate this year.The latest NFAP policy brief highlights a major shift in the H-1B landscape, with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google occupying the top four positions for new H-1B approvals for the first time.Only three India-based companies appear in the list of the top 25 employers for initial H-1B petitions.Petitions for continuing employment make up the bulk of H-1B filings, and rejection rates remain low for most major IT services firms. Infosys, Wipro, and LTIMindtree reported rejection rates between 1% and 2% for continuing-employment petitions. However, initial-employment denials rose sharply in FY 2025. Among larger employers, TCS posted one of the lowest rejection rates at 2%, while HCL America recorded 6%, LTIMindtree 5%, and Capgemini 4%. ""These trends indicate that companies are focusing more on keeping their existing employees legally employed. The H-1B program has become more of a holding pattern for workers in the green card queue rather than a mechanism to bring new skilled workers to the US,"" said Mansi Singh, Partner at law firm BTG Advaya.Immigration platform Beyond Border notes that approvals for individuals classified as ""software engineers"" during the labour certification stage have also been declining for four consecutive years, indicating reduced approvals not only in visa adjudication but in underlying labour assessments. According to H1BGrader, labour certifications for the ""software engineer"" category fell from 40,378 in 2022 to 23,922 through the third quarter of 2025. ""These rejection rates may reflect heightened, longer-term scrutiny of the H-1B program, particularly its use for software engineering and other technology roles, though current data does not conclusively establish direct causation,"" said Camila Façanha, Head of Legal at Beyond Border.Some policymakers who support restrictive immigration measures argue that foreign-born scientists and engineers constitute ""cheap labour"". However, USCIS data shows otherwise. In FY 2024, the average annual salary for H-1B professionals in computer-related occupations was $136,000, with a median of $125,000, underscoring that these workers are not low-cost hires. Additionally, 63% of approved H-1B beneficiaries held a master's degree or higher, indicating that the program continues to attract highly skilled professionals in demand in the US and globally.","The top seven Indian IT firms received only 4,573 H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2025.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: Delhi-NCR has recorded consistent improvement in air quality this year, with the region registering its lowest average AQI for January to November in eight years, excluding the COVID-19 lockdown year of 2020, according to official data.Figures show that Delhi’s average AQI for the January–November 2025 period stood at 187. This is an improvement over 201 in 2024, 190 in 2023, 199 in 2022, 197 in 2021, 203 in 2019, and 213 in 2018.There has also been a sharp drop in the number of “Severe” air quality days. Only three days recorded a daily average AQI above 400 this year, compared with 11 such days in 2024, 12 in 2023, and 17 in 2021. Notably, 2025 has not recorded a single “Severe+” day (AQI above 450), unlike previous years.Pollution levels have eased across key indicators. Delhi’s average PM2.5 concentration was 85 µg/m³, the lowest since 2018 and similar to levels seen in 2020. For comparison, the PM2.5 average was 98 in 2024, 90 in 2023, 95 in 2021, and 103 in 2018.The PM10 average also declined, standing at 183 µg/m³ for the January–November period, down from 205 in 2024, 193 in 2023, and 228 in 2018.Officials said the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) continues to work with authorities across Delhi-NCR to enforce pollution-control measures.They added that efforts will be strengthened further to maintain the progress made this year.On Saturday, CAQM issued revised guidelines for the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for the NCR. Measures earlier listed under Stage IV for the ‘Severe’ category will now fall under Stage III. According to the commission, this shift means NCR State Governments and the GNCTD will decide whether public, municipal, and private offices should operate at 50 per cent capacity, with the rest working from home. The Central Government may also allow work from home for its employees.Meanwhile, on Friday, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Delhi State President Saurabh Bharadwaj alleged that Delhi’s pollution crisis has become a public health emergency due to manipulation of air quality data and failure to enforce graded restrictions.Saurabh Bharadwaj claimed the BJP-run Delhi Government fabricated AQI figures and allowed construction to continue despite GRAP-3 bans. He said pollution levels of 500–700 were recorded as 300–400 to avoid mandatory restrictions.",Delhi-NCR has recorded consistent improvement in air quality this year.

They argue the pursuit of AI dominance is leading to increased emissions, water scarcity, and job displacement, urging leadership to prioritize ethical AI and environmental responsibility.

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

Here's the complete open letter from Amazon 1000-plus employees:

Dear Andy Jassy and S-team,

In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond.

We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis. We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth.

We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm:

Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming. Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019. The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants. Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas.

Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement. Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional.

Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally, Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance.

All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need.

We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following:

No AI with dirty energy.

No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments.

No AI without employee voices.

We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact.

No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.

Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine.

The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are.

This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of.

Signed,

1,039 Amazon employees (and counting!)





Thousands of Amazon employees have signed an open letter issuing some dire warnings about the company’s move toward AI. The letter, signed by more than 1,000 workers (and counting) calls out Amazon for pushing its AI investments at the expense of the climate and its human workforce. The letter’s supporters come from a wide array of roles at the company, including many software engineers, and even employees focused on building AI systems. ""We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth,” the letter’s authors wrote. It adds, “We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene.”The open letter is reportedly signed by Amazon workers anonymously, and comes almost a month after Amazon announced mass layoff plans as it increases adoption of AI in its operations. Among the signatories are employees in a range of positions, including engineers, product managers and warehouse associates. The letter argues that their employer is throwing out its climate promises in the scramble to win the AI race. Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, pointing to efficiencies from electric delivery vehicles and reduced plastic packaging in its climate commitment.","Over a thousand Amazon employees have penned an open letter, warning that the company's rapid AI development is jeopardizing its climate commitments and human workforce.

Gemini 3 boosts Google’s market value





Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi

Years of hard work





Google CEO Sundar Pichai on AI layoffs









Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0. Announcing the launch of Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that it is ‘the best model in the world for multimodal understanding’. Now weeks after the intense work on Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has acknowledged that his engineers are overdue for a break. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Google AI” Release Notes podcast, Pichai said “I think some folks need some sleep,” adding that hopefully he and his teams “get a bit of rest” now that the milestone launch is behind them.The comment made by Pichai comes as Google is moving towards a $4 trillion market cap as the stock price of the company has surged by nearly 70% this year, including a 12% jump following Gemini 3’s debut on November 18. The Gemini 3.0 model has been widely praised for its reasoning, speed and multimodal capabilities. Recently, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also described the Gemini 3.0 model as an ‘insane’ leap forward. He also added that after using Gemini 3.0 for two hours he will not go back to ChatGPT.After the successful roll out of Gemini 3.0, Google has managed to reclaim its frontrunner position in the AI race. Pichai noted that years of hard work of the company is the sole reason behind this success.“In 2016, I wanted the whole company to be AI-first,” he said, pointing to milestones such as the creation of Google Brain in 2012, the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014, AlphaGo’s victory in Go, and the unveiling of Google’s own tensor processing units (TPUs), which were used to train Gemini.Pichai further talked about the Google’s strategy. Pichai explained that Google always worked towards a “full-stack” approach to innovation, improving everything from infrastructure to model training and test-time compute. He admitted that when generative AI first gained traction, Google was short on capacity and had to invest heavily to scale. “If you were on the outside, it would look like we were quiet, or we were behind, but we were putting all the building blocks in place, and then executing on top of it,” he said.Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked about AI layoffs. In a recent expansive interview with BBC, Sundar Pichai pushed back against concerns that AI could eventually lead to mass job cuts. Pichai said that the tech will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others -- ramifications that mean ""people will need to adapt.""Pichai further added that AI may be gunning for his job, but he doesn’t seem too worried about it. AI is advancing so swiftly, he said, that over the next 12 months the tech will be able to perform “complex” tasks and act as an agent on a users' behalf. ""That’s where it gets really interesting,"" he said.",Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0.

No domestic air transport for live animals for laboratory experiments in India; researchers face challenges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/no-domestic-air-transport-for-live-animals-for-laboratory-experiments-in-india-researchers-face-challenges/articleshow/125685346.cms,"VISAKHAPATNAM: As no airline in India currently transports live animals for laboratory experiments, researchers face significant challenges. For example, transporting an animal from Visakhapatnam to Hyderabad must be done by road, exposing it to stress, infection, and other factors.Similarly, imported animals, such as immunocompromised mice required for specific experiments, risk dying en route due to prolonged travel in unfamiliar weather and environments.The 13th International Conference of the Laboratory Animal Scientists Association (LASA), India, will be held at Gitam Deemed to be University, Visakhapatnam, on Dec 19 and 20. The LASA team visited Visakhapatnam on Saturday to announce the event and release the brochure.Speaking to TOI, Dr Vijay Pal Singh, president of LASA and scientist at CSIR-IGIB (Delhi), along with Dr J. Mahesh Kumar (LASA vice-president and scientist at CCMB) and Dr R.K. Shakthi Devan (LASA Secretary), explained that Air India previously provided a specialised, oxygen-supported “air hold” that allowed safe domestic air transport of live animals.“This service has ceased, and no domestic carrier now accepts laboratory animals.Animals that once travelled in hours must now endure two- to three-day road journeys between cities such as Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Visakhapatnam. During these trips, animals — including immunocompromised mice such as NSG and NBSGW strains, other genetically modified or transgenic mice, as well as rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits — suffer stress. This jeopardises research dependent on infection-free or highly specialised strains that cannot be produced quickly in India,” they said.Although international carriers can transport animals to Indian airports, domestic transport from Bengaluru, Mumbai, or Hyderabad relies entirely on road travel. Researchers depend heavily on imported animals, particularly unique strains required for studies on conditions such as sickle-cell anaemia or urgent pandemic-related research, including recovery of cryopreserved immunocompromised or transgenic mice.When asked about annual animal use in research, the LASA team said numbers depend on the study type and purpose. “For regulatory safety studies — acute, subacute, and chronic — numbers are defined under good laboratory practice (GLP) principles. For efficacy studies, sample size is calculated statistically to ensure valid results. Pre-clinical research is a lengthy and costly process, progressing from in vitro studies to mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and non-rodent species such as mini-pigs, or monkeys, depending on the study. The two primary goals are safety and efficacy: ensuring any drug or intervention is non-harmful and effective before human use.“Regulation is rigorous. The Committee for the Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CCSCEA) is the central regulatory authority. Each research institution also maintains an institutional animal ethics committee (IAEC), which oversees local experimentation and reports to the CCSCEA. Testing is hierarchical, starting with lower-order species and progressing to higher-order species. Ethical treatment is paramount: animals are provided with appropriate housing, nutrition, and enrichment, and their welfare is closely monitored.

"Mumbai's Bhandup rejected reds for rightward shift, but life continues to be austere",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mumbais-bhandup-rejected-reds-for-rightward-shift-but-life-continues-to-be-austere/articleshow/125685361.cms,"MUMBAI: The political journey of S Ward, which covers Bhandup, Kanjurmarg and Vikhroli, reflects a dramatic left-toright swing over the past four decades. Once a bastion of Communist influence in the late 1970s, the constituency gradually moved towards the Congress in the 1980s before decisively tilting to the right with the rise of Shiv Sena in the post-1990 era.Today, shaped by its predominantly Marathispeaking electorate and Sena’s deep grassroots network, the ward stands as a saffron stronghold. Yet this ideological consolidation has brought little relief on the ground. The identity-driven, Marathi-majority base may have ensured stable electoral gains for Sena, but chronic civic and environmental distress continues to define daily life: uneven and perpetually dug-up roads, decade-long delays in infrastructure such as the Bhandup ROB, worsening air pollution amid rapid construction, untreated garbage and mangrove loss near the Kanjur dumping ground, and routine monsoon flooding caused by choked drains.Water scarcity, inadequate health facilities, and stalled redevelopment underscore the widening governance gap. As a result, the ward’s political transformation has delivered predictability at the polls but not improvements in lived experience -fuelling rising frustration and asurge in activism.In the 2017 municipal polls, the undivided Sena won eight of the ward’s 14 seats. In the 2024 general election, Sanjay Dina Patil of Sena (UBT) was elected MP, while sitting MLA Sunil Raut -- brother of Sena (UBT) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut -- completed a hat-trick by winning the Vikhroli assembly seat.The Bhandup assembly seat was retained by Sena’s Ashok Patil, a loyalist of deputy CM Eknath Shinde.Even as political parties vie for influence, residents and activists say the ward is grappling with deepening civic and environmental issues. Snehal Basrur, a member of KanjurBhandup Clean ALM, flagged concerns over indiscriminate tree-cutting along LBS Marg, where at least 60 roadside trees were removed for Metro construction. Officials have promised compensatory plantation elsewhere, but Basrur argued that roadside greening is essential on the heavy-traffic artery and that existing trees were not handled with care. She has repeatedly sought improvements in air quality over the past three years, citing dust from continuous construction, rising respiratory ailments and AQI levels touching 250.She demanded action against those responsible for dust and pollution. A civic activist described many pavements as “the worst”, pointing to broken surfaces, protruding manhole covers and uneven stretches that put pedestrians at risk. Local resident and ALM core member Shirish Daudkhane said, “We have petitioned BMC for an urgent review and acceleration of the Bhandup ROB project, pending for a decade. It is essential that infrastructure projects account for projected traffic growth up to 2035-2050. Unfortunately, the present design does not reflect this."" He said that over a lakh PAPs were proposed to be resettled on the Bhandup-Kanjurmarg (East) saltpan lands, which wouldadd to east-west traffic.Environmentalist D Stalin raised alarms about rapid encroachment on saltpan land. ""The dumping ground at Kanjurmarg (East) is not treated properly, and garbage is left to rot in the open. This gives rise to odour, which is a major issue and affects the health of those living in the neighbourhood and even at far-off places like Bhandup and Vikhroli (Kannamwar Nagar) who suffer from the stench. Garbage is also dumped on mangroves,which are being destroyed,"" he said.Daudkhane said, “Traffic congestion is a regular issue. The road is not of uniform width in this constituency, and roads are dug at many places. LBS Marg is a bad stretch with uneven roads and causes traffic jams daily. A few societies have planned not to pay taxes for a year and get the roads repaired on their own.” Another local activist said stormwater drains and original drain lines lack adequate slopes, leadingto flooding in Bhandup village every monsoon due to choked drains. According to legislator Ashok Patil, Sena had promised in its last assembly manifesto to address concerns such as water scarcity -- particularly in the hilly parts of Bhandup -- inadequate health facilities and the need for urgent SRA redevelopment for slum pockets. Locals say MP Sanjay Patil has assured voters that if Sena (UBT) comes to power in the BMC, it will protect their interests.","The political journey of S Ward, which covers Bhandup, Kanjurmarg and Vikhroli, reflects a dramatic left-toright swing over the past four decades.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Bayraktar Kizilelma, Türkiye’s first uncrewed fighter jet, shot down a jet-powered aircraft with a beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile during trials, marking the first time an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has achieved such a feat.In a statement on Sunday, Turkish defence company Baykar, the developer of the UAV, said Kızılelma launched the locally developed GÖKDOĞAN air-to-air missile, successfully striking a high-speed jet target.“The missile was fired from under the UAV's wing after the target was detected and tracked using ASELSAN’s MURAD AESA radar. This marked the first time in Turkish aviation history that a national aircraft fired a domestically produced air-to-air missile, guided by a national radar, at an aerial target,” the statement said, according to TRT World.It added that the engagement established Kizilelma as the ""first and only"" uncrewed platform worldwide with ""verified air-to-air combat capability.""During the test, five F-16 fighter jets from the Merzifon air base conducted formation flights alongside Kizilelma in a joint crewed-uncrewed operation.The UAV’s low radar cross-section and advanced sensors allow it to detect enemy aircraft from long distances while remaining largely undetected.Kızılelma integrates technologies such as the MURAD AESA radar and the TOYGUN targeting system and can deploy a range of domestically produced munitions.In earlier tests, the UAV achieved direct hits using TOLUN and TEBER-82 munitions.","Bayraktar Kizilelma, Türkiye’s first uncrewed fighter jet, shot down a jet- powered aircraft with a beyond-visual-range (BVR) air-to-air missile.

Broader visa reforms in 2025





Thinking about retirement abroad? The UAE isn’t just a playground for investors and professionals, it’s also emerging as a smart, tax-friendly destination for retirees. With its 5-year renewable retirement visa, financially stable expatriates aged 55 and above can enjoy long-term residency without needing a job or running a business.But what does it really take to retire here? From minimum savings and property requirements to monthly income thresholds, understanding the costs, and planning wisely, can make the difference between a smooth move and a financial headache. Beyond the numbers, the visa offers clear perks: no income or property tax, access to world-class healthcare, and the freedom to bring your spouse and dependents along for a secure, comfortable lifestyle.Here’s a complete breakdown of the financial requirements, application steps, and benefits of the UAE retirement visa, so you can see if it makes sense for your retirement plans.The UAE’s retirement visa program provides a 5-year renewable residency option for foreign retirees who wish to settle in the country after their working years. The policy is applicable across all emirates, with Dubai offering an additional customized version of the program.It was officially introduced by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security (ICP) in December 2024, as part of a broader federal update to residency and ID regulations aimed at creating more flexible long-term visa pathways.Applicants must meet all of the following base criteria:In addition, applicants must fulfill at least one of the following financial conditions:Special Case (Dubai Only): Dubai residents are eligible with a lower income threshold of AED 15,000 ($4,050) per month.Applicants are also required to submit a bank statement from the past six months to confirm financial eligibility.The ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security) manages the retirement visa application process through its digital platforms, namely the official ICP website and the UAEICP smart application.The process involves four primary steps through the UAEICP smart application or official website:In addition to federal guidelines, Dubai offers its own retirement visa initiative, tailored to attract global retirees, their spouses, and dependents. It comes with a choice of four financial qualification options, any one of which would make the applicant eligible:This flexibility allows applicants to tailor their approach based on income, assets, or a mix of both. Foreign applicants can apply through the GDRFAD website under the section titled ‘Issuing a residence permit for the retired foreigner’.To complete the application for the UAE Retirement Visa, applicants must provide documents specific to the financial route they are applying under. The documentation ensures the applicant meets eligibility criteria and supports the processing of the visa.Applicants applying through a financial deposit must submit:Applicants applying through regular income must submit:Note: All documents must be valid and clearly support the financial eligibility route chosen by the applicant. Failure to provide complete documentation may result in delays or rejection.While referred to by some as a “free” visa in media reports, the UAE retirement visa does involve multiple fees for processing, medical testing, and administrative services.Total Estimated Range: AED 2,300 to AED 3,800 ($621 to $1,026)These figures highlight that, while the visa is employment-independent, it is not fee-exempt, and applicants should budget accordingly.The retirement visa is more than just a residency document, it’s a cornerstone of the UAE’s broader strategy for global competitiveness and population diversification.The program strongly aligns with the UAE’s Vision 2031, aimed at diversifying national income sources, significantly increasing global talent retention, and transforming the Emirates into a full-spectrum destination — not just for careers but also for retirement, investment, and overall quality of life.The retirement visa is part of the UAE’s broader 2025 residency reforms aimed at attracting long-term residents across diverse sectors. Recent additions include the Blue Visa for environmental experts, expanded Golden Visas for teachers, nurses, digital content creators, and luxury yacht owners, and an enhanced Golden Visa for e-sports and gaming professionals. The rollout also features AI-driven processing for faster approvals, reflecting the UAE’s push for a more inclusive and efficient residency framework. These visa updates reinforce the UAE’s goal to attract and support residents at every stage of life.","Retirees aged 55+ can secure a UAE 5-year visa with AED 1 million in savings, property, or income.
