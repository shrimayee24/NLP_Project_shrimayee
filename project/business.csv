ISRO Makes History As ‘Bahubali’ Rocket Places India’s Heaviest Communication Satellite In Orbit

ISRO on Wednesday successfully launched a next-generation US communication satellite BlueBird Block-2 onboard its heaviest vehicle LVM3-M6. The mission, LVM3-M6, carried the BlueBird Block-2 satellite of US-based AST SpaceMobile under a dedicated commercial agreement.The 43.5-metre-tall LVM3 lifted off at 8.55 am from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, after the completion of a 24-hour countdown. Powered by two S200 solid boosters, a liquid core stage and a cryogenic upper stage, the rocket performed flawlessly. Around 15 minutes into the flight, BlueBird Block-2 was successfully separated and placed into its intended orbit at an altitude of about 520 km, prompting ISRO to declare the mission a success.BlueBird Block-2 is the heaviest payload ever launched into low Earth orbit by the LVM3, making the mission a first of its kind for the Indian launch vehicle. The satellite forms part of AST SpaceMobile’s global LEO constellation aimed at providing direct-to-mobile connectivity, enabling 4G and 5G voice calls, video, messaging and data services on standard smartphones without specialised hardware.The launch was undertaken through NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), ISRO’s commercial arm, as part of its agreement with AST SpaceMobile. ISRO said the mission marked the sixth operational flight of the LVM3, which has previously launched Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3 and multiple OneWeb satellite missions.","ISRO on Wednesday successfully launched a next-generation US communication satellite BlueBird Block-2 onboard its heaviest vehicle LVM3-M6.

"‘Greater coop in semicon, critical tech with India’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/greater-coop-in-semicon-critical-tech-with-india/articleshow/126151596.cms,".

How do you see the political and economic ties between India and the Netherlands in the context of what’s happening in the rest of the world?

How do you see the

India EU FTA

strengthening this relationship with the Netherlands and India?

Do you see the Netherlands emerging as a major destination for Indian students?

Which are the sectors where cooperation can begin in the near future?

How do you see the situation in Europe in the context of the Ukraine war? Do you expect the war to end soon and what are the implications for the region?

n Ties have always been strong, for example in field of water and agriculture, but also the large companies of the Netherlands that have always been active here in India, like Philips. The recent geopolitical developments give an extra impetus to the importance of our ties. That’s what my visit was also about to see how in specific areas we can do more. We now have a letter of intent in the field of security and defence where we’re looking at more intensive cooperation. We also signed an MoU in the field of semiconductors and modern technologies. We are very like minded countries, we are democracies, we are countries that believe in the international rule of law in free trade and those countries need to stick together.n It’s not easy to have a FTA with the EU because you have 27 completely different countries with different economies and different interests. It is in all of our interest to reach an agreement with India on an FTA soon for same reasons I mentioned earlier. We believe in same values, same norms. We are all democracies and we have a lot to offer to each other.n Already there are many Indian students in the Netherlands, and not only students, but also technical students that after their studies found work, in one of our high tech companies like ASML.I heard that there were around 10 cricket clubs now around Eindhoven. That’s testimony to the great relationship that we already have in that field. We also have a very large Indian diaspora in the Netherlands . We are a society where Indians feel at home, where they thrive and contribute to our economy and society.n In the field of semiconductors, I visited one of the Dutch companies here, which is called NXP, which is a spin off of Philips and they do design and production of high end mobility chips. They already design most of its high end chips here in India. This company is providing over 3,000 jobs here in India working on the high end of the semiconductor industry. We want to invest more in R&D together, we want to put more effort in talent development. There’s a big wish on the Indian side to also have more in the production facilities of semiconductors. There’s a broader basis that we already can build on with regards to semiconductors.n We all want this war to end soon. It’s been going on for almost four years at an incredible cost for Ukraine, but also for Russia. We all hope that we will soon reach a ceasefire and hopefully a durable peace agreement. That’s why Europe is actively engaging in the negotiations that are now ongoing, led by the US and where we see that Ukraine is willing to come to the table and reach a deal and an agreement, and we hope that Moscow will do so too.","Ties have always been strong, for example in field of water and agriculture.

'Frame charges against Karti in Chinese visa scam',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/frame-charges-against-karti-in-chinese-visa-scam/articleshow/126150988.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Tuesday ordered framing of charges against Congress MP Karti P Chidambaram and six others in connection with a visa scam, holding that prime facie, a case was made out against them for criminal conspiracy and illegal gratification. The court, however, discharged the eighth accused, Chetan Shrivastava, after concluding that there was ""no material evidence"" on record against him.CBI had filed a chargesheet in Oct 2024 against Karti and the others, alleging bribery in facilitating visas for Chinese nationals for a power company, Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL), in 2011, when his father P Chidambaram was Union home minister.Special CBI judge Dig Vinay Singh of Rouse Avenue courts observed that there was enough material to proceed against the Sivaganga MP and six other accused for offences including criminal conspiracy, demand and receipt of bribe, destruction of evidence, and related charges. The judge noted the materials placed before the court pointed to 'coordinated acts' by the accused.Besides Karti, others chargesheeted in the case included his close associate S Bhaskararaman, TSPL and Mumbai-based Bell Tools Ltd, through which the bribe was routed.The court held that at the present stage of framing the charges, the statement of approver Vikas Makharia, who was the associate vice-president of TSPL, had to be accepted at face value and it could be examined during the trial.It further observed that the conspiracy between Karti and Bhaskararaman was evident, based on the evidence collected during the investigation.Tracing the sequence of events, the court noted that Makharia approached Karti through Bhaskararaman in Chennai seeking 800 additional project visas for TSPL, believing that he had access to home ministry.Bhaskararaman dema-nded and received a bribe of Rs 50 lakh. Subsequently, the approver (Makharia) telephonically thanked Ch-idambaram, who affirmed receipt of the amount.The court noted that although explicit words such as ""payment"" or ""money"" were avoided during the call, the acknowledgement was recorded. The court rejected the submissions made by Karti that he had ""not read the emails"" relied upon by the prosecution, or that there was ""no substantiated proof"" of a meeting in Chennai or any telephonic conversation.CBI had registered an FIR in the case in 2022. According to the agency, TSPL, a subsidiary of Vedanta, had outsourced work to a Chinese firm for its 1,980 MW thermal power plant coming up in Punjab. With the project facing penalties because of delays, the facilitation was sought for re-use of project visas, since there was a ceiling on project visas permissible for a company's plant. The FIR said there was no provision for the re-issue of project visas.","A Delhi court ordered framing of charges against Congress MP Karti P Chidambaram and six others in connection with a visa scam.

Cyber thugs posed as wealth mgmt advisors: Former IPS officer in note

PATIALA: Former Punjab Police IG Amar Singh Chahal , 66, is battling for life after a self-inflicted gunshot to the chest at his Patiala home on Monday. Police say he shot himself with his gunman’s licenced revolver.This is the second such incident involving an IPS officer in the region after Haryana ADG Y Puran Kumar shot himself dead with his gunman’s pistol at his Chandigarh home in Oct.A12-page handwritten note found on the scene details how ex-IG Chahal was cheated of Rs 8.1 crore in a “highly sophisticated” online investment fraud that operated through WhatsApp and Telegram under the name ‘F-777 DBS Wealth Equity Research Group’. It falsely claimed regulatory approvals and links with well-known financial institutions, the note says.Police are investigating the allegations. It’s a disturbing indicator of how deeply such scams have penetrated society and can trap even those who are seemingly aware of the baits and lures.Patiala SP Palwinder Singh Cheema said one of Chahal’s friends alerted police that he may have attempted suicide after getting a message from him.A police team rushed to his house in ‘26-Acre’ locality around 1.45pm and found him unconscious, with a bullet wound to the chest. A revolver lay close by. He was breathing, say police sources. Chahal’s son and daughter-in-law were in another room during the incident, say police.“Chahal is undergoing treatment in hospital and his condition is critical,” said Patiala SSP Varun Sharma. Late evening, Cheema said Chahal had undergone surgery and was on recovery mode but the next 24 hours will be crucial. “Our immediate priority is his treatment. We are also preserving evidence and examining the allegations mentioned in the note,” said Cheema.Police said Chahal, a 1990batch IPS officer, had not filed any complaint regarding the alleged fraud. According to officials who have seen the note, Chahal wrote that he was cheated by cyber criminals who posed as wealth management advisors.Chahal describes in the note how fraudsters posing as ‘senior executives and advisors’ of the firm gradually gained the confidence of investors by offering daily market tips, simulated dashboards and purportedly highreturn investment products. He alleged that the scheme progressed through multiple stages — daily trading, initial public offerings, over-thecounter trades and so-called quantitative funds — each promising escalating returns.Chahal claimed that as confidence grew, investors were encouraged to deposit larger sums while “planted participants” vouched for the scheme’s authenticity whenever doubts were raised. But when he sought to withdraw funds, he was asked to pay hefty service charges, taxes and membership fees, and was even coaxed into paying an alleged bribe to expedite withdrawals, says the note. Despite making repeated payments, no money was released.The former IG said that he had written to the Prime Minister, Union home minister and Union finance minister, seeking intervention. He urged authorities to constitute an SIT or hand the case to a central agency, arguing that only a specialised probe could “dismantle what the nationwide cyber-fraud network”.He has listed multiple bank accounts through which transfers were allegedly made and claimed that while about Rs 1 crore was his own money, more than Rs 7 crore was borrowed from friends and relatives. In his note, he expressed deep remorse and fear about the financial and emotional impact on his family, while repeatedly stating that no one else should be held responsible for his actions.The note also appealed for protection and assistance for his family and requested that creditors refrain from pressuring them.Chahal had preserved screenshots of dashboards, transaction records and chat histories, which he referenced in the note. Investigators are tracing the alleged transactions and examining the digital evidence he cited.Residents of Patiala and former colleagues described Chahal as a capable officer, who empathised with farmers’ issues and concerns of the Sikh community.","Former Punjab Police IG Amar Singh Chahal, 66, is battling for life after a self-inflicted gunshot to the chest at his Patiala home on Monday.

‘Not Misleading Propaganda’: Bangladesh Responds To India Over Delhi High Commission Protest

Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], December 23 (ANI): The Jammu and Kashmir Students Association (JKSA) on Monday wrote to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi , seeking urgent intervention to ensure the safety and well-being of Indian medical students currently studying in Bangladesh amid ongoing protests, tensions, and incidents of violence, particularly in Dhaka and surrounding regions.In the letter addressed to the Prime Minister, the Association urged him to intervene to ensure the safety and protection of Indian medical students in view of the prevailing unrest and uncertain conditions in Bangladesh.National Convenor of the Association, Nasir Khuehami, said that there are around 9,000 Indian students pursuing medical education in various colleges across Bangladesh, among them over 4,000 students from the Kashmir Valley.Khuehami said, ""We have been told by students studying in Dhaka that they have been advised to hide their identity for their own safety, which is deeply disturbing and unacceptable for young Indians who have gone abroad solely to pursue education."" He added that the reported ""death and lynching of a student leader has further shocked and alarmed the entire student community and their families back home,"" underlining the gravity of the situation and the potential risks faced by Indian students on the ground.Highlighting the plight of students, the Association said, ""Many students are confined to hostels and accommodations, facing restrictions on movement, lack of clarity, and fear of being caught in violence. Parents in India are living in constant anxiety, unsure about the safety of their children. The prevailing conditions are unsafe and uncertain, and students feel vulnerable and stranded.""Khuehami said the Association has been receiving distress calls and messages from students and their families, who are extremely anxious about the rapidly deteriorating situation and the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty prevailing there.Urging immediate action, Khuehami said, ""We urge the Prime Minister to kindly intervene to ensure the immediate safety and protection of Indian medical students in Bangladesh. We request the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian High Commission in Dhaka to urgently take up this matter with the Government of Bangladesh and seek firm assurances for the security, dignity, and well-being of our students.""The Association also appealed for evacuation if the situation worsens, stating, ""If the situation of tension and violence continues or worsens, the Government of India should kindly consider making arrangements to evacuate and bring back Indian students safely to India, so that no young life is put at risk. Timely evacuation, if required, will go a long way in preventing any untoward incident and in reassuring anxious families across the country. ""Reposing faith in the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Association said, ""India has always stood by its citizens abroad in times of crisis.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Monday again addressed a press conference amid outrage over the ""new definition"" of the Aravali range, saying that ""no new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"".Speaking on the Supreme Court's acceptance of the ""new definition"" of Aravalli, the minister said: ""The ruling recognises and endorses the Government of India’s sustained efforts to protect the Aravalli range through scientific assessment, strict safeguards and initiatives such as the Aravalli Green Wall Project.""He futher highlighted the expansion of Ramsar sites, afforestation drives and international recognition of India’s forest cover, saying that under the BJP-led NDA government remains ""firmly committed to balancing ecology and economy, while countering misinformation with facts and science"".Addressing concerns in some quarters over a possible expansion of mining activities in the Aravalli Hills and Ranges following the adoption of a uniform definition, Bhupender Yadav on Sunday said it was incorrect to conclude that mining would be permitted on all landforms below 100 metres in the Aravallis.“Only 0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area of Aravalli can be eligible for mining. The rest of the Aravalli is protected and secure,” he posted on X.Yadav explained that the Aravali range comprises all landforms located within 500 metres of two adjoining hills with a height of 100 metres or more. All landforms falling within this 500-metre zone, regardless of their height or slope, are excluded from the grant of mining leases, he said.The minister also elaborated on the issue while responding to a media query on the sidelines of a meeting of the National Tiger Conservation Authority at the Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Exactly one year after a special audit committee concluded that the pharma company AbbVie violated the Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices by spending almost Rs 2 crore to sponsor luxury vacations abroad for 30 doctors, no action has been taken. The ethics board of the National Medical Commission (NMC), that is supposed to take up the complaint against the doctors, is empty barring one part-time member.After the findings of the special audit committee constituted by the department of pharmaceuticals, on the basis of an anonymous complaint, an apex committee conducted hearings to give the company a chance to defend itself. After hearing the company, this committee also concluded that there was “no justifiable reason for 30 healthcare professionals to journey abroad to Monaco and Paris” to gain knowledge about simple procedures in medical aesthetics, such as administration of “Botox and Juvederm”. “Such medical interventions are widely recognized as a lucrative commercial service and evidence attached to the complaint links healthcare professionals directly to the sale, purchase, or administration of such aesthetic products of M/s AbbVie,” stated the apex committee.In its order dated December 23, 2024, the committee let off Abbvie with just a reprimand for unethical marketing practices while asking the NMC to take action against 30 offending healthcare professionals as per the ethics code for doctors.However, the department of pharmaceuticals had not sent the names of the accused doctors to the NMC till June this year and their names are yet to be made public.In response to an RTI query the NMC revealed on December 17 that the five-member ethics and medical registration board (EMRB), which would have to hear the complaint against the doctors and decide what action is to be taken, is empty barring a part-time member. According to the health ministry’s response in Parliament on March 18 this year, the posts of the EMRB president had been vacant since June 2022 (now three-and-a-half years), and that of two whole time members since September 2022 and September 2024. In its reply, the NMC stated that “the statutory posts in NMC are filled by the central government/ministry of health and family welfare”.","AbbVie violated the Uniform Code for Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices by spending almost Rs 2 crore to sponsor luxury vacations abroad for 30 doctors.

Jaishankar Reveals India's $450 Million Aid Package To Rebuild Sri Lanka After Cyclone Ditwah

NEW DELHI: India has proposed an assistance package worth $450 million for the purpose of rebuilding cyclone-hit Sri Lanka. It will include $350 million in concessional lines of credit and $100 million of grants, announced external affairs minister S Jaishankar who is visiting the Indian Ocean neighbour as a special envoy of PM Narendra Modi.Earlier in the day, Jaishankar called on Lankan President Anura Kumara Disanayake to discuss damage caused by Cyclone Ditwah and delivered a letter to him from PM Modi. “The letter from PM Modi that I handed over builds on our first responder role and commits a reconstruction package of $450 million to Sri Lanka. Our talks centred around how expeditiously this commitment can be delivered,” said the minister.He said the assistance will cover the sectors worst affected by the cyclone — including rehabilitation and restoration of road, railway and bridge connectivity; support for construction of houses, health, education systems, and agriculture; and better disaster response.“We are conscious that work towards mitigating the impact of Cyclone Ditwah on people of Sri Lanka must be done in the quickest time possible. We are discussing an effective coordination mechanism for earliest possible delivery,” said Jaishankar, while promising support also to boost FDI and tourism from India.Jaishankar recalled that India’s relief and assistance mission — Operation Sagar Bandhu — commenced on the day Cyclone Ditwah made landfall.“Overall, Operation Sagar Bandhu delivered over 1,100 tonnes of relief material, including dry rations, tents, tarpaulins, hygiene kits, essential clothing and water purification kits. About 14.5 tonnes of medicines and medical equipment were also provided. Yet another 60 tonnes of equipment were brought to Sri Lanka to assist relief operations,” he said.",India has proposed an assistance package worth $450 million for the purpose of rebuilding cyclone-hit Sri Lanka.

PATIALA: An FIR was filed on Tuesday in connection with a Rs 8 crore online fraud that allegedly drove retired Punjab IG Amar Singh Chahal to attempt suicide a day earlier.Chahal allegedly shot himself on Monday with a licensed revolver of his IRB gunman at his residence in Patiala, sustaining a chest wound. After undergoing surgery at a private hospital, he is now stable and out of danger, police said.SSP Varun Sharma said the case was registered against unidentified persons under relevant sections of BNS relating to impersonation, cheating and forgery, along with provisions of IT Act, after recording the statements of Chahal's wife, son and daughter-in-law.The FIR was based on a complaint lodged by Chahal's wife. The former IG, according to cops, had not lodged any complaint with police regarding the fraud.Police had on Monday found a 12-page handwritten note addressed to Punjab DGP Gaurav Yadav at Chahal's house. The note detailed his distress over a Rs 8.1 crore loss to scammers posing as wealth managers via WhatsApp and Telegram groups named 'F-777 DBS Wealth Equity Research Group'.Police said around 25 bank accounts mentioned in the note had been frozen, wh-ile the money trail was being probed. Cops are examining the digital evidence.Sources said a few days ago, Chahal had met a recently retired Patiala DIG and appeared depressed.In his note, Chahal described the perpetrators as ""sophisticated scammers"" who lured him with promises of high stock trading returns and fake profit dashboards. The scammers allegedly built trust using initial fake gains, before pressuring larger investments through multiple bank accounts and demanding additional taxes and fees that blocked his ability to withdraw funds.Chahal borrowed funds of around Rs 7 crore from friends and family, investing around Rs 1 crore through three banks from Oct. In the note, he demanded an investigation by an SIT or CBI, and apologised to his family.","Chahal allegedly shot himself on Monday with a licensed revolver of his IRB gunman.

NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at preventing annual scramble and confusion during postgraduate medical admissions, NMC has revised the NEET-PG 2025 counselling schedule, directing states to strictly align their timelines with the All India Quota (AIQ) process.The revised schedule, issued through a public notice by Post-Graduate Medical Education Board on Dec 19, was circulated to all medical colleges and state counselling authorities on Dec 22. The updated calendar has been finalised in consultation with Medical Counselling Committee, Directorate General of Health Services.NMC officials said the reshuffle is intended to end long-standing clashes between AIQ and state quota counselling, which in previous years led to overlapping rounds, blocked seats and prolonged admission cycles. The regulator stressed that strict synchronisation is mandatory, in line with repeated Supreme Court directions.""All state counselling authorities must adhere to the revised schedule to avoid incoherence between AIQ and state counselling rounds,"" NMC said, urging medical colleges and students to closely track the new timelines.The directive applies to all state counselling bodies, participating institutions and NEET-PG aspirants, and any deviation could disrupt admissions and invite regulatory action.",NMC has revised the NEET-PG 2025 counselling schedule.

Eased MBBS intake norms to continue amid doctor shortage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eased-mbbs-intake-norms-to-continue-amid-doctor-shortage/articleshow/126149832.cms,".

NEW DELHI: With doctor shortage continuing to strain healthcare services, National Medical Commission has decided to continue the temporary relaxation of MBBS intake norms for existing medical colleges for the 2026–27 academic year, allowing higher admissions to speed up the supply of doctors.For this admission cycle, 2024–25, the medical regulator has kept in abeyance the provision that effectively capped MBBS intake at 150 seats per college by linking expansion to the 100 seats per 10 lakh population norm. Eligible colleges can once again apply to increase intake beyond the earlier limit, provided they meet prescribed standards for faculty strength, infrastructure and clinical workload.An NMC official said colleges complying with these norms can safely admit students beyond 150 seats, with intake permitted up to a maximum of 250 MBBS seats. The earlier proposal to strictly enforce the cap, the official added, had drawn representations from states warning that it could worsen doctor shortages. “This flexibility is critical if India is to achieve the target of adding 75,000 medical seats over the next five years,” the official said.Alongside continuation of relaxed intake norms, the commission has also opened the annual application window for setting up new medical colleges for 2026–27.According to existing regulations, new institutions will continue to admit only 150 MBBS students in their first batch. Officials said the twin approach — temporary expansion in established colleges and steady addition of new institutions — aims at balancing capacity expansion with quality control.NMC’s Medical Assessment and Rating Board has opened an online application window for both new colleges and seat expansion in existing ones. Applications will be accepted through the NMC portal from Dec 29, 2025, to Jan 28, 2026, with submissions closing at 6pm on the final day.The regulator has stressed that quality norms will not be diluted. Only colleges fully compliant with Undergraduate Minimum Standard Requirements, 2023, and related regulations will be considered. Incomplete applications will be rejected without further correspondence.Existing medical colleges can apply for a maximum of 100 additional MBBS seats at a time, with assessments conducted strictly for the number of seats sought. Inspections — physical, virtual or hybrid — will verify faculty attendance, hospital patient load, infrastructure, financial capability and academic readiness. “Work-in-progress” applications will not be entertained.Officials said the relaxation reflects a calibrated effort to expand medical education capacity while safeguarding standards.","National Medical Commission has decided to continue the temporary relaxation of MBBS intake norms for existing medical colleges for the 2026–27 academic year.

Watch: MPs Speak Out as SIR Row Dominates Winter Session Opening

BHOPAL: A sweeping revision of Madhya Pradesh's electoral rolls has led to the deletion of 42.7 lakh voters, or 7.4% of the electorate, following a 44-day special intensive revision (SIR) that officials said ranks among the largest voter list clean-ups undertaken in the state.The draft electoral rolls published on Tuesday show the voter count falling from 5.7 crore before the revision to 5.3 crore - a net reduction of 42.7 lakh names after door-to-door verification across 65,014 polling booths.Election officials said the deletions included 8.4 lakh voters found to be deceased, 31.5 lakh who had shifted from their registered addresses, and 2.7 lakh duplicate entries. The scale of deletions reflects extensive demographic churn over two decades, with the stated goal of producing clean, accurate and up-to-date electoral rolls, officials said.Alongside the deletions, poll officials identified about 8.4 lakh ""unmapped"" voters whose details could not be linked to records from the SIR in 2003. Their names remain in the draft poll rolls for now but will be reviewed.""The unmapped voters will have to produce the required documents within seven days of receiving the notice from the BLO (booth level officer),"" joint chief electoral officer Ram Pratap Singh Jadaun said.Failure to respond could result in deletion when final rolls are published.The exercise ran from Nov 4 to Dec 18, following an extension granted by the Election Commission, with more than 65,000 BLOs conducting house-to-house checks across cities, towns and villages. Enumeration forms were received from 5.31 crore electors, covering over 92% of the electorate, officials said. The drive spanned 55 districts and involved 230 electoral registration officers, 532 assistant EROs, and large-scale support from panchayat secretaries, revenue staff, Gram Rojgar Sahayaks and volunteers. Six recognised national political parties took part through 1.3 lakh booth level agents.Officials stressed that deletions remain provisional. Under revision guidelines, no name can be removed without prior notice and a speaking order from an ERO or AERO. The claims and objections window opened Tuesday and runs until Jan 22, 2026, allowing voters to seek inclusion, correction or restoration of names. Appeals may be filed before the district magistrate and, subsequently, the chief electoral officer under the Representation of the People Act, 1950.","The draft electoral rolls published on Tuesday show the voter count falling from 5.7 crore before the revision to 5.3 crore.

NEW DELHI: Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 349 on Wednesday, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category, according to the Sameer app, as dense layer of toxic smog continued to blanket large parts of the national capital, including areas around India Gate.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed widespread pollution hotspots across the city.

They have been suspended and will be blacklisted,” he said.To check industrial emissions, Sirsa added that the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has issued 411 closure notices, while the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has sealed 400 polluting units so far.","Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 349 on Wednesday, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category, according to the Sameer app. Mundka recorded an AQI of 385, followed by Okhla at 382, RK Puram at 376, Punjabi Bagh at 373, and Wazirpur at 372.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126151184,imgsize-389352,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/air-quality-dips-to-very-poor-with-aqi-349.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Seeing the consequences of a duopoly in Indian skies earlier this month when IndiGo schedule collapsed, the aviation ministry has stepped up its efforts to ensure Indian flyers have more choices when it comes to airlines. It has issued no objection certificates to two proposed airlines this week.“Over the last one week, met teams from new airlines aspiring to take wings in Indian skies—Shankh Air, Al Hind Air and FlyExpress. While Shankh Air has already got the NOC from Ministry, Al Hind Air and FlyExpress have received their NOCs in this week. It has been endeavour of the ministry to encourage more airlines in Indian aviation which is amongst the fastest growing aviation markets in the world owing to the policies of Modi government. Schemes like UDAN, has enabled smaller carriers Star Air, India One Air, Fly91 etc to play an important role in the regional connectivity within the country and there is more scope for further growth,” Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said on X Tuesday.The aviation industry wants the govt to take a close look at factors that have led to India having among the highest operating cost for airlines globally, essentially high jet fuel prices and taxes.“In Indian aviation ecosystem, almost all stakeholders — barring airlines — make money. That’s why we keep seeing airlines regularly collapsing over the last three decades or even more. A new airline can be floated but the same remaining airborne due to several factors like high cost structure, taxes, lack of management bandwidth and thin funding is a big challenge,” said an old timer.To be sure airline collapses are a global phenomenon and not limited to India. The additional worrying factor here is the cost-hostile environment for airlines. “Flying is no longer a luxury and the dream that it remain in the reach of the common man makes it mandatory to have cost and tax rationalisation,” said a senior airline official.","The aviation ministry has stepped up its efforts to ensure Indian flyers have more choices when it comes to airlines.

Shane McMahon’s WWE legacy and wealth creation

Business ventures and Marissa Mazzola-McMahon’s role

Shane McMahon and Marissa Mazzola-McMahon, who both served as WWE Producer/Director, are worth a combined $650 million, the result of decades spent near one of sports entertainment’s most influential families and a carefully curated soon-to-branch portfolio beyond the ring. Shane, as a key McMahon heir, has had his financial profile associated with WWE's ascendance to a worldwide media conglomerate for decades, while Marissa's career has been largely away from the limelight.Their fortune, collectively, is uneven but complementary at best. The vast bulk of the couple's wealth originates from Shane, who owns most of the couple's cash, investments, and property, as Marissa’s professional income and personal assets serve to augment, not scale, the family nest-egg. Rumors in the financial, as well as the gossip and entertainment worlds, have put their collective net gross at around $205 million by the year 2025, but the numbers are tightly held secret from the outside world.Even hooks have different weights, and for Shane McMahon, his financial foundation came from WWE, where he served in various capacities as an executive, on-camera talent, and brand representative. He was in charge when WWE became a publicly traded, globally syndicating corporation, a transition that paid senior insiders in the form of salaries, bonuses and equity-linked pay.Shane also became recognized over the years for the insane, risk-taking, high impact, physical matches that elevated his brand and worth.Overall, Shane's net worth is often assumed to be around $200 million in 2025 as an individual. That number includes years of WWE and associated earnings, assets from the McMahon family estate, and WWE-affiliated corporate relationships.

"DHS replaces H-1B random lottery selection, priority will now be given to those earning higher wages",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/dhs-replaces-h-1b-random-lottery-selection-priority-will-now-be-given-to-those-earning-higher-wages/articleshow/126145043.cms,".

JD Vance Insults India Over H1B Visa? 'Cheap, 3rd-World Labour' | U.S. VP For 'America First'

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has moved to overhaul the H-1B work visa selection process, replacing the long-standing random lottery with a system that gives preference to higher-paid and more highly skilled foreign workers, a shift the Trump administration states is aimed at protecting American wages and jobs.This rule, together with the imposition of the $ 100,000 entry-fee for new H-1B applications and the proposed hike in wages will make it more challenging for companies to recruit overseas employees under the H-1B visa program – this is not good news for those pursuing the American dream. On the flip side, this is expected to result in more offshoring – with countries like India, expected to benefit through expansion of global capability centres.This new rule, released on Tuesday night, will take effect from Feb 27, 2026 - it will be in place before the E-registrations for the coming H-1B cap applications open. There is an annual quota of 85,000 (including the Masters cap) for H-1B cap applications. E-registrations for H-1B applications open in March. As demand significantly exceeds supply, post registration a random lottery is conducted. The sponsoring employers then file a detailed H-1B application for those candidates (beneficiaries) who were successfully selected in the lottery.The random selection (lottery) mechanism will now stand changed. Under the new rule, H-1B visas will no longer be allocated purely by chance. Instead, registrations will be weighted according to wage levels set by the US Department of Labour (DOL), increasing the likelihood of selection for applicants offered higher salaries.In an official statement the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) contends that the existing lottery had been misused by some employers to bring in lower-paid foreign labour at the expense of US workers.“The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by US employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,” Matthew Tragesser, a spokesperson for USCIS, said in a statement. He added that the weighted system would better reflect congressional intent behind the programme and strengthen US competitiveness by encouraging employers to seek higher-skilled and higher-paid talent.The rule does not make substantial changes from draft rules that were released in Sept. TOI had done a deep dive into the mechanism set down in the draft rules and its implications. An H-1B candidate with a Level IV wage offer (the highest tier) would be entered into the lottery four times, while a Level III beneficiary would be entered three times, a Level II beneficiary twice, and a Level I beneficiary only once. This ‘weighted lottery’ approach would give higher odds of selection to those offered the highest wages.Under the current system, all beneficiaries (across all four levels) entered in the lottery face equal odds of selection of about 29.59%. Under the proposed rule, however, odds diverge sharply by wage level.The National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), which had analysed the draft rules had stated that under the new mechanism, the probability of selecting an individual at Level IV for an H-1B application would increase by 107% but fall by 48% for individuals at Level I. Effectively, the rule would tilt opportunities heavily toward mid-career professionals or those in senior roles, while creating a barrier for entry-level professionals, including the bulk of recent international graduates from US universities.The implications for the Indian diaspora who aspire to work in the US at lower tiers – such as new graduates from US universities are stark. For the fiscal ended Sept 2024, of the 1.41 lakh H-1B applications approved by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), 80,449 (or 57%) were for Indian beneficiaries. It should be noted that the total figure is above the annual quota of 85,000 as USCIS keeps a buffer for rejections or employers withdrawing from the process.USCIS added that this rule is another crucial step to strengthen the integrity of the H-1B visa program. “As part of the Trump Administration’s commitment to H-1B reform, we will continue to demand more from both employers and aliens so as not to undercut American workers and to put America first,” said Tragesser.","The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has moved to overhaul the H-1B work visa selection process.

The accused, Revathi, has been remanded in police custody for 12 days.Revathi, a former guest lecturer and a resident of Udayanagar in K R Puram was found to be involved in multiple thefts at convention halls.Following her arrest, police recovered 262 grams of gold ornaments worth about Rs 32 lakh. Revathi had quit her teaching job a few years ago before allegedly turning to theft.The case came to light after a complaint from a Manjunatha Nagar resident, who, along with her mother, attended a relative’s wedding at a marriage hall in Basavanagudi on Nov 23.

Guests were given luxury space in over 25 hotel rooms

LUCKNOW: A lavish destination wedding hosted by Unnao based YouTuber Anurag Dwivedi -who is under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate for alleged money-laundering- has drawn intense public and official scrutiny after details emerged of crores being spent on luxury celebrations in Dubai.This comes as the ED intensifies the probe into his finances.Dwivedi married Tamanna in Nov 2025 aboard the Queen Elizabeth-2 cruise in Dubai, following a 12-year relationship.To mark the occasion, he flew more than 130 guests — many travelling abroad for the first time — on five separate flights, bearing the full cost of air travel, visas, accommodation, meals, and sightseeing.Wedding festivities included haldi and mehendi ceremonies, culminating in the main wedding on the cruise’s open deck. He also got passports issued to the guests who didn't have one.The guests were given luxury accommodation across more than 25 hotel rooms, dedicated transport, and sightseeing tours to landmarks such as the Burj Khalifa and Dubai Creek. According to attendees, spending averaged around Rs 90,000 to Rs 1 lakh per guest only on travel and lodging.With cruise bookings, décor, logistics, and celebrity performances added, the overall wedding budget is estimated to have run into several crores.Adding to the high-profile nature of the event were live performances by a prominent Bollywood playback singer and actor.The spectacle has come under the scanner amid an ED investigation alleging Dwivedi’s links to illegal betting apps, hawala transactions, and overseas investments.The agency has conducted searches at multiple locations in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, frozen bank accounts, seized cash, and impounded luxury vehicles, including a Lamborghini and a Merc from his Unnao home. Sources say assets — movable and immovable — linked to Dwivedi are estimated at around Rs 20 crore.Investigators allege that Dwivedi used his popularity as a fantasy cricket influencer to promote illegal betting platforms, laundering proceeds through a web of firms, family members, mule accounts, and hawala channels.The ED has frozen bank balances, fixed deposits, and insurance policies worth about Rs 3 crore under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), and claims documents point to real estate investments in Dubai made via illicit routes.The case traces back to a 2022 FIR by West Bengal Police following a raid in Siliguri that uncovered an organised betting operation linked to online platforms used during major cricket tournaments.Subsequent fund-trail analysis allegedly led investigators to accounts connected to Dwivedi and his associates. According to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Dwivedi is linked to multiple firms, including Fantwear Fashion, RP Greens India, DSD Sports and Media, and Bhumideva Projects.On social media, where he has over 2.3 million followers, Dwivedi has projected himself as the “face of fantasy cricket,” often emphasising his middle-class roots. However, investigators say his lifestyle — luxury cars, overseas properties, and a cruise wedding — belies those claims.The ED's Kolkata Zonal Office, has carried out extensive search operations at 10 premises in Lucknow, Unnao, and Delhi linked to the YouTuber and social media influencer Anurag Dwivedi in connection with an illegal online betting and gambling case. The agency recovered incriminating documents, digital devices, and around Rs 20 lakh in cash.According to the ED, the scrutiny of the seized documents revealed that Dwivedi made real estate investments in Dubai through hawala channels.The investigation was initiated on the basis of an FIR registered by the West Bengal Police, which pertained to the operation of an illegal online betting racket. During the probe, it emerged that accused Sonu Kumar Thakur and Vishal Bhardwaj were running an online betting panel from Siliguri, using mule bank accounts, Telegram channels, and other digital platforms to conduct online betting and gambling activities.The ED’s investigation further revealed that Anurag Dwivedi played a significant role in promoting illegal online betting platforms. The agency alleges that he received proceeds of crime generated from illegal betting apps through multiple hawala channels and mule accounts.According to the ED, after generating income from the promotion and facilitation of illegal betting websites, Dwivedi left India and is currently residing in Dubai. He has been issued multiple summons in the case but has failed to appear before the agency so far.","Anurag Dwivedi married Tamanna in Nov 2025 aboard the Queen Elizabeth-2 cruise in Dubai, following a 12-year relationship.

Torrie Wilson’s WWE legacy and long-term earnings

Justin Tupper’s business career and investment footprint

Torrie Wilson and Justin Tupper are often described as a low-key power couple of WWE, balancing a legacy sports-entertainment career with modern digital media leadership. While Wilson is a well-known name around the world in wrestling circles, Tupper has flown a bit under the radar in the business of sports and content platforms.Uniting as a couple, their 2025 net worth speaks to both prudent career choices, diversified income sources, and a life of relatively low pomp and circumstance. Instead of bombastic and excessive numbers and stories, their financial narrative thrives through longevity, strategy, and continual relevancy.Another notable entry on the list is Torrie Wilson, who racked up her wealth in the early 2000s, which is viewed as the peak of WWE's commercial success. Without a doubt, one of the most recognisable Divas in company history, the television contracts, pay-per-view bonuses, merchandise royalties, modelling opportunities, and other ventures outside of wrestling all accumulated over the years. She also snatched up mainstream magazine covers, including shots in fitness and lifestyle magazines, which only increased her earning power.Wilson continued his earnings through WWE Legends deals as well as convention and Hall of Fame appearances, even after walking away from full-time wrestling.However, in recent years, she has earned an income with social media partnerships and fitness brand collaborations. Her personal net worth by 2025 is estimated to be anywhere around $2 million, a number not so much created by in-ring work at that point but rather from the appropriate use of a well-maintained brand.Yet Justin Tupper’s earning power from a different professional world also adds immensely to the couple’s overall wealth. Tupper took advantage of early trends in direct-to-consumer sports media as the founder of Revolution Golf, a digital golf instruction and commerce platform. His company's being purchased and absorbed into a greater media universe was a seminal financial moment of his professional life.After the success, Tupper had moved into senior management positions in tech firms that serviced sports and entertainment firms, earning a salary and long-term incentives on an ongoing basis. His net worth is probably not public knowledge, but as a benchmark for startup executives at his level with founder exits, the assets are in the low-to-mid seven-figure range. His financial profile consists of business equity rather than salary to be reinvested, rather than being a random celebrity income.Also Read: Trish Stratus and Ron Fisico combined net worth in 2025: WWE legacy, fitness ventures, and family wealth","Torrie Wilson and Justin Tupper are a low-key power couple of WWE.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Adjourning the matter to Feb 11, it directed Mallya to make a statement or file an affidavit by then about when he intends to return to India.The order was based on an understanding in law that a plea challenging the validity of the FEO Act, 2018, should not be heard in the absence of the petitioner having submitted to the jurisdiction of the court, Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad said.Bombay high court, after hearing senior counsel Amit Desai for Mallya and solicitor general Tushar Mehta for ED, directed him to say when he would return to India. The ED sought the dismissal of Mallya’s challenge, saying an offender cannot be permitted to question the FEO by refusing to submit to judicial process in India.The HC also asked Mallya to decide which of his petitions he wishes to pursue: an appeal he filed in 2019 against a trial court order or the petition in the HC, also filed in 2019, to challenge the validity of certain provisions of the FEO Act. Both cannot exist, it said.Mehta, along with additional solicitor generals S V Raju and Anil Singh, opposed Desai’s plea to hear Mallya’s petition. Desai said even under the special FEO Act, Mallya has a statutory right to be represented in India when he is abroad, as he has challenged the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Act. “Mallya is allowed by the law to litigate in India, even when he is abroad,’’ Desai contended. The CJ said, “The vires (constitutional validity) of the Act he cannot challenge, this is our opinion (unless present). ’’ Desai argued, “All rights, including constitutional rights, are available even if not in court.’’Section 14 of the Act is meant to ensure that FEOs do not abuse the process by simply filing petitions through lawyers, the ED said. Desai cited an order of the Supreme Court, and Mehta shot back saying it was not meant to be precedent-setting.Mehta, who joined the hearing virtually from Delhi, remarked that Mallya was partying in the UK. “There are many fugitives, and they are celebrating their birthdays. While nobody can legally object to celebrations, they are mocking our nation. This is unacceptable,” he said.Mehta also said there was an extradition proceeding at an advanced stage, and Mallya cannot use the pendency of his petition in Mumbai to thwart proceedings there.The ED, through advocate Prashant Mishra, submitted its reply to Mallya’s petition and said the facts were “glaring’’ and a huge economic harm to the nation was caused by Mallya with an outstanding of nearly Rs 15,000 crore. Desai said the liability is alleged to be Rs 6,200 crore “but now shown as Rs 15,000 crore. We have a lot to argue in the matter’’.Mallya’s petition claimed there was a violation of his fundamental right to property as the seizure of his assets was unfounded.The ED said he had several opportunities to appear before the trial court and pointed to a provision of the FEO Act to argue it provides for confiscation of property when offences involve over Rs 100 crore and have a bearing on the national economy.","Bombay high court directed Vijay Mallya to say when he would return to India.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s joinery from Manipal





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014.

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes. This includes establishing four distinct teams that focus on research, training, products, and infrastructure.","Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board.

Asian stock markets edged higher on Wednesday, rounding off a strong year driven largely by gains in AI-related stocks, while commodities such as gold and silver extended their rally to fresh record highs as 2025 comes to an end.Overnight in the United States, Wall Street ended on a positive note, with the S&P 500 closing at a record high as the long-awaited Santa Claus rally finally emerged. Investor sentiment was supported by data showing that the US economy expanded at a much faster pace than expected in the third quarter, as reported by Reuters.Gold and silver were among the biggest movers in early Asian trading. Spot gold rose 0.8% to a new all-time high of $4,524 per ounce, taking its gains for the year to around 72%. Silver jumped 1.2% to a record $72.27 per ounce and was on track for an annual rise of nearly 150%, marking its strongest yearly performance on record.Equity markets across Asia were modestly higher. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3%, taking its gain for the year to about 26%, the index’s best annual performance since 2017. Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.4% and was also up around 26% for the year, while South Korean stocks outperformed the region with a sharp surge of 72% in 2025.Global equity futures were largely flat amid thin year-end trading volumes, with EURO STOXX 50, Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures showing little movement.Market participants remained broadly positive about equities, despite persistent risks.“As equity markets enter the fourth year of a bull market, our underlying market call remains constructive,” said Scott Chronert, a US equity strategist at Citi.He added that while earnings growth and high valuations could support further gains, sharp differences in performance across sectors and market segments are likely.In currency markets, the Japanese yen strengthened for a third straight session amid concerns over possible intervention by Japanese authorities. The dollar slipped 0.3% to 155.78 yen, moving away from the 158 level that has previously triggered intervention. The euro was steady at $1.18 and has risen about 14% this year, while the dollar has fallen roughly 10% against major peers in 2025.In the bond market, US Treasuries have gained this year following the resumption of Federal Reserve rate cuts. The two-year Treasury yield was steady at 3.532%, down 72 basis points for the year, while the 10-year yield stood at 4.1589%, lower by about 42 basis points in 2025.Oil prices were little changed in early Asian trade but were set to end the year lower for a third consecutive year.

Haryana amends private university law after Al-Falah terror case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/haryana-amends-private-university-law-after-al-falah-terror-case/articleshow/126152976.cms,"Al-Falah University

GURGAON: After the discovery of a white-coat terror module operating out of Al-Falah University in Faridabad, the state assembly on Monday passed the Haryana Private Universities (Amendment) Bill to tighten the state's regulatory grip on private higher education institutions.The amendment seeks to plug long-standing legal and procedural gaps by clearly defining the grounds, penalties and process for action against private universities, including financial sanctions, administrative takeover and phased dissolution.Once cleared, the provisions will apply to 26 private universities across the state, including Al Falah, The NorthCap University, Amity University and Apeejay Satya University.The amendment adds a clause B to Section 44 of the Act to introduce stringent penalties for maladministration, providing false or misleading information, and failing to meet prescribed academic and regulatory standards. The revised provision empowers the state to halt admissions in one or more courses, impose fines ranging from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore, and, in extreme cases, order the phased dissolution of a university if corrective steps are not taken within 30 days of lesser penalties being imposed.The clause describes an ""administrator"" as a person or a committee of up to five members appointed by govt that would assume complete control of a university's affairs during the transition. It empowers the administrator to assume powers of a governing body and board of management, with control over a university's assets, properties and records from the date of appointment. The administrator, the clause states, will be authorised to meet day-to-day expenses and, with prior state approval, dispose of assets, if needed, to ensure academic continuity and safeguard students' interests.Education minister Mahipal Dhanda said after a comprehensive review of the Haryana Private Universities Act, 2006, and its subsequent amendments, the state govt found several provisions required streamlining, particularly Sections 34A, 34B, 44, 44A and 46. At present, sections 44 and 44A of the Act do not prescribe any procedure for the dissolution of a university or the appointment of an administrator. ""This necessitated amendments to these sections and the insertion of the new Section 44B to clearly lay down the process for phased dissolution and administrative takeover,"" the minister said.He added that the provisions of Section 46 were also streamlined and broadened in the larger interest to ""remove ambiguities, close loopholes and strengthen regulatory oversight over private universities"".""It has been noticed that certain private universities started new courses, enhanced intake capacity and even changed the nomenclature of courses without obtaining prior approval of the state govt by misusing sub-section (3) of Section 34A. Therefore, the provision needed modification,"" the minister said.The amendments come after Dr Umar Un Nabi, an assistant professor of Al Falah University, was identified as the suicide bomber in the Nov 10 blast and two faculty members, Dr Muzammil Ahmad Ganaie and Dr Shaheen Shahid, were arrested in the case. The founder and chairman of Al Falah Group was also arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case.Haryana govt claimed that the institution exploited loopholes in the earlier law. Established in 2013 under the private university Act, the university has yet to secure accreditation from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council. Although two of its three colleges were previously accredited, the recognition was not renewed after it lapsed.Under the old framework, private universities were required to obtain recognition, submit annual reports and file financial disclosures with the state. Officials, however, acknowledged that compliance checks were weak, enforcement was lax, and while penalties existed, there was no clear mechanism for investigation or implementation.The state govt, meanwhile, proposed setting up a new University of Design, Innovation and Technology in Gurgaon to promote credible, future-oriented higher education opportunities for its youth.","The Haryana Private Universities (Amendment) Bill is to tighten the state's regulatory grip on private higher education institutions.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

H-1B visa appointments canceled en masse

'Get out of H-1B quagmire'





Indian-origin CEO Vijay Thirumalai commented on the present H-1B situation as thousands of Indians got stuck in India as they traveled to their home country to get their visas stamped only to be informed that their appointments have been deferred by a minimum fo six months. As they are stranded in India without knowing if they will be allowed to work from India remotely, many people on social media mocked on how Indians can be stranded in India.Thirumalai said the mocking is brutal as he knows what people are going through with their visa appointments getting delayed all of a sudden. The delay was triggered by the State Department's social media vetting process that started from December 15.""People who mock the concept of being stranded, have no idea what is going thru. They have their homes, their jobs, kids school and their entire lives back in US, what was supposed to be a 2 week trip is now stretching to 3-4 months and maybe more, god knows, how long. It is brutal,"" the Indian-origin CEO noted.The consulates in India rescheduled hundreds of appointments leaving candidates amid unprecedented uncertainty.As social media vetting in which visa officers are checking the social media profiles of applicants is taking a longer time, the consulates reduced the number of visa appointments per day. December appointments have been pushed after March; January dates have been deferred to November. Those who are still in the US can defer their travel to the US but those who are already in India are stuck for indefinite time now.Thirumalai said the ideal situation for Indian H-1Bs would be to get out of the H-1B quagmire as soon as possible. Immigration will become only difficult and hence H-1B visa holders should try to get Green Card. ""With the hostile political rhetoric & AI job losses, immigration is going to get only worse. Do all you can to get yourself a GC. Don't listen to folks egging you to get to India, you have worked hard so far, to study here, get a job, have a base, invest 4-5 more years, get a GC + passport to build the optionality for you & you have the best of all worlds. Despite the best Govt, USD/ INR is 90 and macro only getting worse, imagine the situation with a bad govt + even more hostile neighbours,"" the Indian-origin CEO said.",Indian-origin CEO Vijay Thirumalai commented on the present H-1B situation.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Wednesday. While Nifty50 was near 25,150, BSE Sensex was below 85,500. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,157.20, down 20 points or 0.076%. BSE Sensex was at 85,454.65, down 70 points or 0.082%.Experts are of the view that activity is likely to stay muted in the coming sessions due to the shortened trading week due to the Christmas holiday. The stock market is expected to hold firm at elevated levels and move within a narrow range, aided by supportive signals from global markets.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “As 2025 draws to a close the market appears to be moving to a consolidation phase with an upward bias.
