District magistrate has exercised his statutory powers to issue a certificate and identification card to the petitioner. Thus, the board's rejection of this plea is unsustainable.""He pointed out that the only justification provided by the board was that the petitioner's request did not meet the criteria under Regulation 27, which addresses cases where a name is obscene, abusive, or disrespectful.On the other hand, counsel for the education board argued, ""The petitioner's request could not be accepted as the existing regulations only permit changes when a name is deemed obscene, abusive, or disrespectful, which is not the situation here.""In examining the case, the court referred to the landmark SC judgment in NLSA vs Union of India (2014), which affirmed right of transgender individuals to self-identify their gender and mandated legal recognition of this identity.The court quashed the board's rejection order dated Aug 18, 2021, allowing the petition and instructing the school education department secretary to decide on the proposed amendments to Regulation 27 in line with Transgender Persons Act, 2019, within three weeks.

"India clears Singapore Airlines’ FDI, paves way for Vistara merger into Air India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-clears-singapore-airlines-fdi-paves-way-for-vistara-merger-into-air-india/articleshow/112910958.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Govt has approved foreign direct investment ( FDI ) by Singapore Airlines into Air India , paving the way for the merger of Vistara into AI by the end of this calendar year.In a statement, SIA — which owned 49% in Vistara and will own get 25.1% stake in the merged AI by investing Rs 2,059 crore in it, said on Friday: “SIA confirms the Indian Govt has approved its proposed FDI into the enlarged Air India Group, as part of the ongoing merger of Air India and Vistara.This approval, along with other governmental and regulatory approvals received to-date, marks a significant development towards the completion of the merger.”“SIA and its partner Tata Sons aim to finalise the merger by the end of 2024. Upon completion, SIA will hold a 25.1% stake in the enlarged Air India Group. SIA and Tata Sons are firmly committed to supporting the growth and success of the Air India Group, which post-merger will have a significant presence in all key Indian airline market segments (full service, low-cost, international, and domestic). This merger will reinforce SIA’s multi-hub strategy, and underscore its long-standing commitment to India through a direct stake in this large and rapidly growing aviation market,” the statement added.Only FDI approval was remaining for the merger as all other nods from agencies like the Competition Commission and DGCA are already in place. Tatas will have remaining 74.9% stake in AI.After Govt FDI nod, AI-Vistara will shortly communicate timelines of the merger to passengers. People who have booked tickets on Vistara flights post the date of merger will be informed that their flight will be on Air India along with the changed flight number of AI and its time.Sources say the date of merger is likely to be after Diwali (Nov 1) as the airline will avoid taking any chances during the peak festive travel season. “There will be a decent window between post Diwali and the onset of fog that usually happens after Dec 20 which leads to flight disruptions. Ideally the merger should happen in that space to sort out any merger teething issues like informing passengers booked on Vistara their changed AI flight details before fog adds further complexity to the equation,” said sources.Vistara has 70 aircraft which will continue to fly in the airline’s livery. The same will changed to AI’s new livery when the aircraft go in for heavy checks. “Taking out aircraft just for painting purpose and letting capacity take a hit makes no sense. Also Vistara aircraft have a better cabin product than that of AI’s old planes,” said sources.Vistara had earlier reached out to passengers informing them about the transfer of frequent flyer miles to AI’s loyalty programme. The movement of personnel has already started, with many Vistara employees now operating from AI’s new Gurgaon headquarters.Are there chances that passengers who have booked on a certain class of Vistara, say business or premium economy, on a flight that has to operate after the date of merger being shifted to economy on the AI flight they take as the latter’s business may be full or it may not have a premium economy? “There are little chances of such things happening,” said sources.AI management had last considered toyed with the idea of postponing Vistara’s merger. The reason: They wanted AI planes to be upgraded first and till then retain Vistara as the better product carrier. However given mounting concerns among Vistara employees about AI officials getting all key posts in the merged airline, that plan was shelved. So even as AI remains very much a work in slow progress, the merger is now going to happen before the end of this calendar year.","The Indian Govt has approved foreign direct investment ( FDI ) by Singapore Airlines into Air India.

Vadhvan Port: PM Modi lays foundation stone for India’s largest deep-water port,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vadhvan-port-indias-largest-deep-water-port-pm-modi-foundation-stone-top-facts-highlights/articleshow/112913145.cms,"Here are the top facts about the port

Situated in close proximity to Dahanu town in Palghar district, Vadhvan Port is poised to become the largest deep-water port in the country. The port will offer direct access to international shipping routes, thereby reducing transit times and associated costs.

The primary objective of the port is to establish a world-class maritime gateway that will boost the country's trade and economic growth.

The port will cater to large container vessels, offer deeper drafts, and accommodate ultra-large cargo ships.

Vadhvan port will be equipped with deep berths, efficient cargo handling facilities, and modern port management systems.

Vadhvan Port is expected to enhance India's maritime connectivity and further strengthen its position as a global trade hub.

The Vadhvan Port, which is estimated to cost Rs 76,220 crore, will be the third major port in Maharashtra, alongside the existing Mumbai Port and the Jawaharlal Nehru Port.

The proposed location for the Vadhvan Port is in the Dahanu Taluka of Palghar district, and it will be developed as a joint venture between the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority and the Maharashtra Maritime Board. The port is expected to cover an area of 17,471 hectares, with 16,906 hectares falling within the port limits.

The Vadhvan Port is anticipated to alleviate some of the pressure on the Jawaharlal Nehru Port, which is currently the largest container handling port in India.

The strategic location of the proposed port is considered advantageous due to its proximity to Gujarat, Rajasthan, and central India, as well as its accessibility to most of India's cargo destination locations.

The construction of the Vadhvan Port will involve the reclamation of 1,448 hectares from the sea, and it has been planned at a location with a deep draft of 20 metres. None of the major ports in India currently has a comparable draft, which limits the berthing of mega shipping vessels and results in certain shipping lines bypassing India. In comparison, the Jawaharlal Nehru Port has a draft of 15.5 metres, which is the deepest among the existing major ports in the country.

The project is anticipated to generate significant employment opportunities, stimulate local businesses, and contribute to the overall economic development of the region.

The development of Vadhvan Port incorporates sustainable practices, focusing on minimizing environmental impact and adhering to stringent ecological standards.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday laid the foundation for construction of the Vadhvan Port project , estimated to cost around Rs 76,000 crore, in Maharashtra 's Palghar.Before departing for Maharashtra, PM Modi called the 'Vadhvan Port project' a ""very special project""""A very special project that will contribute to India’s development. It will also reaffirm Maharashtra’s pivotal role as a powerhouse of progress,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.","The Vadhvan Port, which is estimated to cost Rs 76,220 crore, will be the third major port in Maharashtra, alongside the existing Mumbai Port and the Jawaharlal Nehru Port.

Last Indian minister visit to Pakistan was in 2015

Foreign minister S Jaishankar said Friday the era of uninterrupted dialogue with Pakistan was over, emphasizing India’s policy of not engaging Pakistan till the time it takes sustained and irreversible action against terrorism. Interestingly, Jaishankar also said India is not passive on the Pakistan issue and will react accordingly to positive and negative developments in the relationship.The MEA officially confirmed Friday Pakistan had invited PM Narendra Modi for the SCO heads of government meeting in Islamabad in October.This is the first invite for Modi to visit Pakistan since Islamabad’s abortive bid to host the SAARC summit in 2016.With the PM restricting his participation to the SCO heads of state summit, it remains to be seen if there’ll be a high-level representation from India. Jaishankar had participated in the last meeting in Kyrgyzstan.""The era of uninterrupted dialogue with Pakistan is over. Actions have consequences. Insofar as J&K is concerned, 370 is done,"" said the minister, speaking at a book release. On whether India is content with the current level of relationship, the minister added, ``maybe yes, maybe no…we are not passive. And whether events take a positive or a negative direction, either way we will react"".While India is expected to attend the SCO meeting, the level of participation is not clear yet. ToI had first reported on August 25 that Pakistan had invited Modi.""India has received the invitation for attending the Heads of Government Summit of SCO hosted by Pakistan. As and when we have an update, we will share it with you,"" said the MEA spokesperson.The practice so far, as far as India is concerned, has been for Modi to participate in the heads of state summit and depute senior ministers, mostly external affairs, for the heads of government meeting.Jaishankar had represented India at the last heads of government meeting in Bishkek in 2023. Pakistan is hosting the event this time as it holds the rotating chairmanship of the council of the heads of government.The last time an Indian foreign minister visited Pakistan was in 2015. The visit, however, was followed by the Pathankot airbase attack that put paid to any hope of a revival of the dialogue process between the 2 countries.The recent terror attacks in Jammu may also restrain India from considering a high-level participation, even though it sees SCO as playing an important role for regional security. The SAARC summit process has also remained stalled for the past 8 years as Modi doesn’t want to visit Islamabad, which has to host the meeting, because of Pakistan’s support to cross-border terrorism.",Pakistan has invited PM Narendra Modi for the SCO heads of government meeting in October.

Colleges must refund this deposit within three months after graduation.

MUMBAI: The Fee Regulating Authority ( FRA ) of the state has imposed a cap of Rs 50,000 on the caution money charged by private colleges for health sciences courses , including MBBS.This will include all kinds of deposits, including library, laboratory, hostel and mess. The amount cannot be charged at the time of admission, and no student can be denied a seat for inability to pay these.A source said colleges can only charge the fees fixed by the FRA at the time of admission and nothing over and above that.Caution money can be charged later, said the source.For MBBS, the cap will be Rs 50,000. For BDS and AYUSH courses, the cap is lower, and the lowest is planned for BSc Nursing.The caution money will be charged under the name of the college, said the source. The deposit amount should be refunded within three months of a student passing out. The FRA notified colleges to restrain from charging excessive caution money even in the past, and this is the first time a cap has been imposed.The decision followed a complaint made to the FRA grievance redressal cell early this week. The move is expected to help a large number of medical aspirants who are unable to afford the ""exorbitant"" fees at private medical colleges.Admissions to medical colleges in the state will be commencing soon. The state CET cell has extended the deadline to fill college choices till Friday.Private colleges have been charging additional amounts as caution, library, mess, and laboratory deposits. Some even charge alumni club membership fees. In a few cases, students have to shell out double the fees fixed by the FRA at the time of admission. It is rampant in colleges offering MBBS courses. Last year, the FRA decided to ask colleges to disclose the amount they charged as caution money and the amount refunded to the students in that academic year.A complainant who approached the FRA this week pointed out that most private medical colleges in the state charged fees in excess of the amount fixed by the authority. He shared the fee structure of colleges for the last academic year, claiming that several students from the SC and ST category did not take admissions in these private institutions due to the exorbitant sums collected under these miscellaneous heads. The tuition fee of students from the SC and ST category is reimbursed by the state govt. The complainant requested the FRA to take action against these colleges.The grievance redressal cell confirmed that exorbitant amounts were indeed collected in the name of caution money and library deposit, after going through the fee structures. An FRA member, who is also part of the grievance cell, Dharmendra Mishra, said that the FRA initiative was a ""landmark"" one.""Medical students and parents have also approached the authority with names of institutes which are charging extra fees under the name of deposits. In some cases, they are charging more than Rs 4 lakh as deposits. It is observed that students belonging to the reserved categories are also not spared by these institutes during the admission process,"" Mishra said, adding that students can file a complaint with the authority if colleges are seeking higher amounts other than the one fixed by the FRA. He said action will be initiated against these colleges under the Maharashtra Private and Unaided Professional Colleges Act of 2015.","The Maharashtra Fee Regulating Authority has capped caution money at Rs 50,000 for health sciences courses in private colleges.

Holck had previously admitted to a Danish court that he was part of a seven-member group responsible for smuggling weapons into West Bengal on a Russian cargo plane on December 17, 1995.The illegal arms drop, known as the Purulia Arms Drop, occurred in the Purulia district of West Bengal on December 17, 1995.

An appeals court later upheld the district court's ruling.India's initial extradition request for Holck was made in 2002.

India commissions INS Arighat: Know all about Navy's 2nd nuclear-powered submarine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-commissions-ins-arighat-know-all-about-navys-2nd-nuclear-powered-submarine/articleshow/112900556.cms,"All about INS Arighat

INS Arighat will join its predecessor, INS Arihant , which became fully operational in 2018, to enhance the country's 'nuclear triad'—the capability to launch nuclear weapons from land, air, and sea.

, which became fully operational in 2018, to enhance the country's 'nuclear triad'—the capability to launch nuclear weapons from land, air, and sea. INS Arihant and INS Arighat are powered by 83 MW pressurized light-water reactors, allowing them to remain submerged for extended periods, unlike conventional diesel-electric submarines that need to surface regularly.

Indian nuclear-powered ballistic submarines are named the Arihant class, a Sanskrit term meaning 'Destroyer of the Enemy.' The name was chosen for its subtlety and appropriateness.

The Indian government plans to build both nuclear and conventional submarines as part of its long-term acquisition and capability development strategy. This includes five Arihant-class submarines and six nuclear attack submarines, to be constructed in three phases.

With India’s “no-first use” nuclear policy, SSBNs (Submarine-Launched Ballistic Nuclear Submarines) play a key role in deterrence due to their difficulty in detection and their ability to survive a surprise attack and execute retaliatory strikes.

Countries like the US, Russia, and China have larger SSBNs with longer-range missiles. For example, China has six Jin-class SSBNs with JL-3 missiles capable of 10,000 kilometers, and the US operates 14 Ohio-class SSBNs.

A project costing around Rs 40,000 crore is under consideration by the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security for the construction of two 6,000-tonne ‘hunter-killer’ SSNs (nuclear-powered attack submarines), armed with torpedoes, anti-ship, and land-attack missiles. The construction is expected to take at least a decade.

On conventional submarine development, Indian Navy has acquired six new Kalvari-class submarines and plans to add 15 more through Project 75 India, Project-76, and Project-75 AS.

NEW DELHI: In a major step towards further strengthening its strategic deterrence capabilities, India on Thursday commissioned INS Arighat , which is the country's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles .The commissioning of the almost 112-metre-long submarine, armed with K-15 missiles that have a strike range of 750 km, took place at the secretive ship-building centre in Visakhapatnam in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh and top national security and military officials.""Second Arihant-Class submarine 'INS Arighaat' commissioned into Indian Navy in the presence of Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh in Visakhapatnam. PM Modi-led Govt is working on mission mode to equip soldiers with top-quality weapons & platforms,"" the defence ministry wrote on X.","INS Arighat will join its predecessor, INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018.

Upon completion, SIA will hold a 25.1% stake in the enlarged Air India Group. SIA and Tata Sons are firmly committed to supporting the growth and success of the Air India Group, which post-merger will have a significant presence in all key Indian airline market segments (full service, low-cost, international, and domestic). This merger will reinforce SIA’s multi-hub strategy, and underscore its long-standing commitment to India through a direct stake in this large and rapidly growing aviation market,” the statement added.Vistara CEO Vinod Kannan said, “We are immensely grateful to all our customers for their support and patronage over the last 10 years. As we progress further in our growth journey, we want to emphasize that this merger is about offering them more choice with a larger fleet and a wider network, while elevating the overall travel experience. Vistara and Air India are committed to ensuring that this transition is smooth and hassle-free. We are excited about this new phase in our journey and look forward to welcoming our customers again soon – as Air India.”Wilson said: “Cross-functional teams from Air India and Vistara have been working together for many months to make the transition of aircraft, flying crew, ground-based colleagues and, most importantly, our valued customers, into the new Air India as seamless as possible. The joint team looks forward to offering our guests an expanded network, additional flight options, an enhanced frequent flyer program and the best of both antecedent airlines and are grateful for the support of our loyal customers through this next phase of building a world class, world scale, global airline with an Indian heart.”In the internal communication to employees, Vistara CEO Vinod Kannan said: “…we enter the final lap of merging with AI. The roadmap ahead will entail a sequence of activities and I seek your support to ensure a seamless transition…. We will co-steer this transition phase to ensure we offer all possible support, consistent communication, and convenience to customers, every step of the way.”Regarding Vistara employees, the note said: “For those of you who have already been seconded to Air India, you will continue performing your set of tasks and responsibilities. The HR teams are working on the migration of all remaining employees, including the minimum spec team members, all flying staff etc., and the final date of movement along with other details will be communicated to you soon. The harmonisation of staff practices and policies for various verticals is also underway, and outcomes will also be shared in coming weeks.”Allaying fears, Kannan told employees that the merger “is just the beginning of an exciting new chapter in our growth story that presents numerous opportunities for everyone. Together, we’re laying the foundation for an integrated entity uniquely positioned to power through the global aviation industry.”“Thank you for your cooperation and for all that you have given to this wonderful organisation. The indelible legacy that you have helped create in our customers’ minds will live on forever. Finally, this is not goodbye yet – we still have over two months of operations to continue to delight our customers and excel at what we do best - and complete all merger related activities. I will continue to keep you updated on any further developments through the usual updates and hope to meet you in person – on the ground, in the sky or virtually, in the coming weeks,” Kannan’s note said.","Starting September 3, customers will “progressively no longer be able to make bookings with Vistara for travel on or after November 12, 2024. All our flights thereafter will be operated by Air India and bookings for them will be redirected to Air India’s website from ours.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112913336,imgsize-1494044,width-400,resizemode-4/112913336.jpg"

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Moody's upgrades Pakistan's rating to Caa2,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/moodys-upgrades-pakistans-rating-to-caa2/articleshow/112871429.cms,"External financing and political risks

Credit ratings agency Moody's has upgraded Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to ' Caa2 ' from 'Caa3' citing improving macroeconomic conditions and moderately better government liquidity and external positions.The ratings upgrade reflects Pakistan's decreased default risk after a USD7 billion IMF bailout staff level agreement in July.However, despite doubling since June 2023, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves remain insufficient for its external financing needs, according to the agency.""There is now greater certainty on Pakistan's sources of external financing, following the sovereign's staff-level agreement with the IMF on 12 July 2024 for a 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of USD7 billion,"" Moody's said in a statement.The IMF stated that the program's approval depends on Pakistan securing necessary financing assurances from its development and bilateral partners. Moody's said it expects the IMF Board to approve the program within a few weeks.Following the upgrade, Pakistan's international bonds made broad gains. The 2027 maturity was up 0.7 cents to 85.9 cents in the dollar by 1007 GMT - not far off the one month high hit earlier in the day, according to Tradeweb data.Topline Securities CEO, Mohammed Sohail, said the credit upgrade was anticipated following the IMF agreement, and another upgrade within a year is plausible.The announcement comes a day after Pakistan's central bank chief told Reuters in an interview that the country would be looking for about USD4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks.Sohail said Fitch's upgrade in July and Moody's upgrade should ""boost bankers' confidence"".Historically, Pakistan has depended on friendly countries to ""rollover"" debt to avoid a repayment crisis.Although Moody's previous concerns about a potential balance of payments crisis have eased, it warned that risks remain high as Pakistan continues to rely on timely financing from official partners.There is also uncertainty over the government's ability to fully implement IMF-mandated reforms, Moody's said.The coalition government, formed after February elections, may struggle to implement revenue-raising measures without stoking social tensions.Moody's cautioned that any slippages in reform implementation could lead to delays in or withdrawal of financing support from official partners.","Moody's upgrades Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to'Caa2'from 'Caa3' The ratings upgrade reflects Pakistan's decreased default risk after a USD7 billion IMF bailout staff level agreement in July.

Overcoming Challenges

KARACHI: Pakistan aims to raise up to $4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks by the next fiscal year, the country's central bank chief told Reuters on Tuesday, as the country looks to plug its external financing gap .In a wide-ranging interview, his first with any media organisation since taking office in 2022, State Bank of Pakistan Governor Jameel Ahmad said Pakistan was also in the ""advanced stages"" of securing $2 billion in additional external financing required for International Monetary Fund approval of a $7 billion bailout program.Pakistan and the IMF reached an agreement on the loan program in July, subject to approval from the IMF's executive board and it obtaining ""timely confirmation of necessary financing assurances from Pakistan's development and bilateral partners"".Ahmad said he expected the country's gross financing needs would be smoothly met - both over the next fiscal year and in the medium term.In the past, Pakistan has relied on long-time allies such as China, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates to 'rollover' debt rather than force a repayment crunch. Ahmad said he expected similar assurances would be given for the next three years, giving the government more time to get its finances in order.In addition, Ahmad said the central bank reckoned Pakistan's gross financing needs for the coming years would be lower than the 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product projected by the IMF in its latest country report in May.""Pakistan's external gross financing needs have been declining in the past few years,"" he said.""Since (the IMF's) assessment was based on a higher current account deficit than realized in fiscal 2024 and now projected for the next few years, we assess the ratio of gross financing needs to GDP to be lower than the 5.5 per cent level.""Asked about monetary policy, Ahmad said recent interest rate cuts in Pakistan have had the desired effect, with inflation continuing to slow and the current account remaining under control, despite the cuts.Pakistan's annual consumer price index inflation was 11.1 per cent in July, having fallen from highs of over 30 per cent in 2023.""The Monetary Policy Committee will review all these developments,"" Ahmad said, adding that future rate decisions could not be pre-determined.Pakistan's central bank cut rates for two straight meetings from a historic high of 22 per cent to 19.5 per cent, and will meet again to review monetary policy on September 12.There have been some concerns in markets that the government might take advantage of lower interest rates to borrow more, but the central bank chief said this was not his expectation.""We understand that the government will continue on the path of fiscal consolidation, notwithstanding the reduction in interest rates,"" said Ahmad.Ahmad, who was appointed governor of Pakistan's central bank for a five-year term in August 2022, said his first year had been 'quite difficult'.In 2023, Pakistan faced an acute balance of payments crisis with only enough central bank reserves to cover a month of imports.After eight months of tough negotiations over fiscal discipline, the IMF threw Pakistan a lifeline in the form of a nine-month $3 billion bailout program.""Last year was much better,"" said Ahmad. ""Now everything is under control from an external account management perspective.""Ahmad said the central bank would now focus on growth, digitalisation and financial inclusion.""Those are also equally important for job creation and other socioeconomic issues,"" said Ahmad, noting the bank's mandate was to ensure price and financial stability before shifting its focus to growth.","Pakistan aims to raise up to $4 billion from Middle Eastern commercial banks by the next fiscal year.

Dynasties forged in blood

'Politics based on religion'

DHAKA: Two women dominated Bangladeshi politics for decades. One was chased into exile. The other is newly free from custody and too sick to rule, but her heir looks set to take power. Autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina , 76, fled the country by helicopter for neighbouring India this month as huge crowds demanding an end to her rule marched towards her palace.Hours after the student-led uprising sparked the sudden collapse of her government, her lifelong rival and two-time prime minister Khaleda Zia , 79, was released from house arrest for the first time in years. Members of Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) endured crackdowns and mass arrests under Hasina, who pointed to her opposition's cosy relations with Islamists as justification.A caretaker government has run the country since Hasina's ouster, but it has to hold new elections eventually, and now that the BNP has emerged from the underground, its members are confident of their prospects. ""People who supported us from behind for a very long time, they are now coming to the front,"" Mollik Wasi Tami, a leader of the party's student wing, told AFP.Interim leader and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, 84, has said he has no plans to continue in politics after his current role is finished. The students who led Hasina's overthrow have no fondness for Zia either, and it remains unclear whether they would support a future BNP government or seek to form their own party.But whatever they decide, analysts say that when polls are held, the BNP is the force with the cross-country network, the political experience and the drive to win. ""In the next election, whenever it takes place, the BNP has more appeal,"" Bangladeshi politics expert and Illinois State University professor Ali Riaz told AFP.Zia herself is too ill to assume the prime ministership a third time. She has suffered from numerous chronic health complaints since she was jailed in 2018 after a graft conviction widely seen as politically motivated, whatever the charge's true merits. Zia has only appeared in public once since her release, in a pre-recorded video statement to a BNP rally in Dhaka from a hospital bed, during which she appeared sick and frail.""We need love and peace to rebuild our country,"" she told thousands of party faithful at the rally, held two days after Hasina left Bangladesh. Her supporters are planning to take her abroad for urgent medical care, clearing the way for her eldest son and heir apparent, Tarique Rahman , to take the reins.Tarique has led the BNP since his mother's conviction while in exile in London, where he fled to avoid his own set of graft charges, which his party is now working to quash.""When the legal problems are solved, he will come back,"" Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the BNP's secretary-general, told AFP. Tarique's visage already appears alongside that of his mother on the party's banners and campaign materials, including at the rally held two days after Hasina's toppling.The fact that rally happened at all was a remarkable departure from Hasina's rule. The BNP's senior leaders and thousands of activists were jailed late last year ahead of January elections that, absent any genuine political opposition, returned Hasina to power.The decades-old contest between Zia and Hasina is a dynastic battle that predates the political career of both women.Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Zia's husband, Ziaur Rahman , both led the country in the early years after its 1971 liberation war against Pakistan. Both were assassinated.Both women joined forces in protests that ousted a military dictator in 1990 and then contested elections against each other the following year. They have alternated in power ever since, with their parties serving as vehicles for their fierce rivalry.Zia's first administration in 1991 was hailed for liberalising Bangladesh's economy, sparking decades of growth. But her second term from 2001 saw several graft scandals -- some implicating Tarique -- and Islamist attacks, including one that almost killed Hasina.Zia was also accused of steering Muslim-majority Bangladesh, and her nominally big tent, BNP, away from their secular roots by allying with the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami. The partnership gave Hasina cover to persecute both parties by claiming she was fighting extremism—an excuse bolstered by several terror attacks during her time in office.Retired Dhaka University professor Abul Kashem Fazlul Haq told AFP that any collaboration between both forces risked antagonising the avowedly secular students who toppled Hasina. ""They are aware that they will be hurt if they do politics based on religion,"" he said.But Alamgir, the BNP's secretary-general, said the party was open to renewing the alliance if it boosted their chances of forming the next government. ""BNP will definitely look for victory,"" he said. ""If Jamaat helps, then definitely.""","Two-time prime minister Khaleda Zia released from house arrest for the first time in years. Autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina fled the country by helicopter for neighbouring India this month.
