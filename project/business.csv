Maritime Operations Centre and Communication Centre to be located there



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave go ahead to the Naval Headquarters to commence its Rs 450 crore strategic project ‘Nausena Bhawan, Maritime Operation Centre and Communication Centre’ in Delhi Cantonment area after Central Empowered Committee (CEC) cleared it saying even though the land is in Morphological Ridge area, it has no trees.The defence ministry through additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati assured a bench of CJI B R Gavai, and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria that the project was of strategic importance and is designed as an environmentally sustainable one. “The ministry of defence has assured that all necessary precautions will be taken by adopting the latest sustainable construction practices,” she said.CEC after scrutinizing the project documents and visiting the site reported to the SC that the ministry of defence may be permitted to utilize 1.9 hectares of the land falling in Morphological Ridge area for the project subject to depositing Rs 22.5 crore with Delhi Ridge Management Board for ‘plantation, conservation, and development of Delhi Ridge.”It said the authorities must get environmental clearance from the ministry of environment forest and climate change and plant at least 500 trees of indigenous species in and around the 750 metre perimeter and ensure proper upkeep to facilitate their survival and growth into mature trees. It must implement rainwater harvesting, measures for safe waste disposal and energy conservation, the CEC said.","The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave go ahead to the Naval Headquarters to commence its Rs 450 crore strategic project.

Supreme Court makes DMRB a jumbo body; asks it to demarcate morphological ridge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-makes-dmrb-a-jumbo-body-asks-it-to-demarcate-morphological-ridge/articleshow/125264614.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday revamped the Delhi Ridge Management Board (DMRB) to eliminate confusion caused by multiple authorities tasked to protect Delhi Ridge and directed the Board to remove all encroachments from the forested and morphological Ridge and file six monthly reports with the court on their health.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran recast the DMRB by making it a 13-member body headed by Delhi chief secretary and members including DDA vice-chairman, representatives of MoEF and Department of Forest, MCD Commissioner, NDMC chairperson, Director General of CPWD, Delhi Police Commissioner’s representative and members of NGOs nominated by Delhi govt.The SC also constituted a standing committee, which will be headed by a representative of the Central Empowered Committee, for looking after day-to-day affairs of DMRB and said committee members, apart from officials, must be experts in the field of conservation. It said DMRB shall act as a single-window authority insofar as Delhi Ridge and the Morphological Ridge is concerned.Writing the judgment, CJI Gavai said, “The core functions of the DRMB must be directed towards conservation of the existing Ridge Forests and removal of existing encroachments from the Ridge.” SC lamented that though a preliminary notification was issued in May 1994 identifying 7,777 hectares of land as reserved forest, only 103 hectares have been notified as forest in the next three decades.CEC told the court that 5% of the Ridge is under encroachment, 4% already diverted for non-forest purposes, and only 1.33% has been notified as forest.“The very purpose of the DRMB is to preserve the integrity of the Ridge, as a morphological and ecological feature. Therefore, the DRMB should focus on preservation of existing Ridge forests and further improving the areas through scientific conservation measures. The DRMB should also ensure that fragmentation of Ridge Forests is prevented,” he said.The SC tasked DMRB to ensure preservation of the Ridge, including the morphological Ridge, in its pristine glory by removing all encroachments and steps to improve the Ridge, including protection, scientific management, ecological restoration, afforestation and habitat conservation.Directing DMRB to submit reports every six months on the status of the Ridge, the bench directed all authorities in Delhi to act in aid of discharge of duties of the Board.",The Supreme Court revamped the Delhi Ridge Management Board (DMRB) to eliminate confusion caused by multiple authorities tasked to protect Delhi Ridge.

Walked Out Of Burning Jet, Now Stranded In UK: AI171 Crash Survivor Vishwaskumar Ramesh Speaks Out

AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad airport has undertaken a large-scale wildlife management operation to reduce the risk of bird and animal strikes around the airfield, five months after London-bound AI-171 crashed after take-off on June 12, killing all 241 people on board.In association with the forest department, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport has begun relocating several species of birds and mammals found in and around the premises to areas at least 50–100 km away from the city.Officials said a major translocation drive involving 1,000 large fruit bats is currently underway. The bats, which roost in large numbers near Kotarpur, close to the airport along Sabarmati riverbank, are being captured and released in Polo Forest, a protected habitat about 150 km away.“Giant fruit bats became a particular concern,” said a source. “During night-time inspections, blood stains were often found on the runway or near aircraft, but there would be no feathers, hinting at bat strikes. Following these findings and based on recommendations from the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the decision to translocate certain species was taken during a series of joint review meetings,” added the source.Other species being relocated include the red-wattled lapwing, yellow-wattled lapwing, black kite, Eurasian thick-knee, and blackheaded ibis. Species commonly found around SVPIA — such as the rock pigeon, cattle egret, house crow, Indian roller, and common mynah — continue to be monitored as part of ongoing wildlife hazard management, an official said.","Ahmedabad airport has undertaken a large-scale wildlife management operation to reduce the risk of bird and animal strikes around the airfield.

From Bhutan, PM Modi Issues Big Warning After Delhi Red Fort Blast, Promises Swift And Full Justice

The UK government has updated its travel advisory for British nationals following Monday’s deadly car blast near Delhi’s Red Fort area, which claimed 12 lives and left several others injured.In its latest guidance, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) advised British citizens in Delhi to remain cautious and follow instructions from local authorities.“There has been an explosion at the Red Fort (Lal Qila) Metro Station, New Delhi,” reads the FCDO update for India. “If you’re in the immediate area follow the advice of the local authorities and monitor local media,” it adds.The advisory also reiterates existing guidance against all travel within 10 km of the India-Pakistan border -- except for the Wagah border crossing -- and maintains warnings for Jammu and Kashmir as well as Manipur due to security concerns.The FCDO noted that the country-based advisory serves as a ""guidance on travel"" rather than an enforced restriction. It aims to help citizens make ""informed decisions"" and cautioned that ignoring such advice could affect travel insurance validity.The explosion took place around 6.52 pm on Monday when a Hyundai i20 car caught fire near the Red Fort Metro Station, resulting in nine deaths and over 20 injuries. The toll rose to 12 by Tuesday after three more victims succumbed to their injuries, according to police.The city remains on high alert as Delhi Police, invoking the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), continue their probe into the blast. Forensic and intelligence findings suggest possible terror links behind the incident.","The UK government has updated its travel advisory for British nationals following Monday's deadly car blast near Delhi’s Red Fort area.

NEW DELHI: The road transport ministry has made it mandatory to include a dedicated analysis based on datasets from the National Database for Emergency Management (NDEM) in the preparation of all highway project reports. This decision comes amid increasing instances of roads, particularly in hilly areas, being washed away due to heavy rain and landslides.NDEM has been developed and maintained by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), and the portal serves as a comprehensive geospatial platform for disaster management, risk assessment, and infrastructure planning. It hosts multi-temporal satellite data, thematic layers, and decision support tools for monitoring natural hazards such as floods, landslides, droughts, and cyclones.In a communication to all states and highway agencies, the ministry has said the dedicated analysis based on NDEM datasets must include use of floodplain, digital elevation models (DEMs) and land use layers to identify optimal alignment to minimise exposure to natural hazards while deciding alignments. These must integrate flood extent and river basin layers to plan adequate cross-drainage structures and prevent future inundation issues, and landside risk mapping in case of hill roads.“All alignment approval proposals to be placed before the different committees shall invariably indicate if the analysis on NDEM has been carried out and to place the results of the analysis for consideration of the committee,” the ministry said.Separately, the ministry has also directed that while preparing project reports for highway projects in hilly areas, topographical surveys should be carried out for a 300-metre-wide strip. It said the base plan prepared using topographical data should be superimposed with the Indian Landslide Susceptibility Map. “The landslide inventory of past incidents should be collected and studied. Further, slope movement (in mm/year) should be analysed from DEMs using InSAR or similar satellite imagery and historical data available through online resources developed by the National Remote Sensing Agency,” the ministry added.The ministry stated that additional land should be acquired at culvert and structure locations to channelise hillside streams for the construction of catch-water drains, enabling effective interception and disposal of runoff that can cause erosion, slope instability, and pavement deterioration.To address the issue of identifying dump sites for muck disposal, it said that for new roads, the preferred approach is to design them in such a way that excavated material can be fully utilised in constructing embankments and fill slopes within a short distance from the source location.","The road transport ministry has made it mandatory to include a dedicated analysis based on datasets from the National Database for Emergency Management.

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday invoked stricter anti-pollution measures under Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR after the city's air quality slipped into the 'severe' category.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) said the decision was taken after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) surged from 362 on Monday to 425 on Tuesday morning, due to calm winds, a stable atmosphere, and unfavourable weather conditions that allowed pollutants to accumulate near the surface.The Stage III curbs, which include a ban on non-essential construction and the closure of stone crushers and mining activities, build upon the measures already enforced under Stages I and II of the GRAP.Classes up to Class 5 are required to shift to hybrid mode under Stage 3. Parents and students have the option to choose online education wherever available.Under Stage 3, the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel cars (4-wheelers) is restricted in Delhi and nearby NCR districts. Persons with disabilities are exempt.Several parts of the city registered alarming pollution levels with AQI readings crossing the 400-mark.As per CPCB data, Anand Vihar recorded an AQI of 412, Alipur reported 442, and Bawana registered the highest level at 462. Chandni Chowk recorded an AQI of 416, while RK Puram and Patparganj logged 446 and 438, respectively.Sonia Vihar also recorded a 'severe' AQI of 433, indicating hazardous air conditions across the city.During winters, the Delhi-NCR region enforces restrictions under GRAP, which categorises air quality into four stages - Stage I (Poor, AQI 201-300), Stage II (Very Poor, AQI 301-400), Stage III (Severe, AQI 401-450), and Stage IV (Severe Plus, AQI above 450).Hazardous air quality levels in Delhi-NCR during the winter are caused by unfavourable meteorological conditions, combined with vehicle emissions, paddy-straw burning, firecrackers, and other local sources of pollution.",The Centre on Tuesday invoked stricter anti-pollution measures under Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi-NCR.

Delhi: 8 Killed In Multiple Red Fort Blasts; Explosion Shakes 3 KM Area Radius Of Indian Capital

NEW DELHI: There is mystery over the kind of explosive or chemical used in Monday's blast with the forensics and NSG's explosive wing yet to submit their report. However, prima facie assessment points towards the use of military-grade explosives, given the scale of damages and casualties.Sources said investigators on Tuesday sought an opinion from forensics on whether PETN, semtex or RDX could have been used. The initial assessment also points towards the possible use of ammonium nitrate fuel oil and detonators. The nitrate oil is used both industrially and in improvised explosive devices due to its easy availability and cost-effectiveness.The forensic teams have collected roughly 42 exhibits from the site and put them through lab testing. The exhibits include the i20 car's tyres, chassis, CGC cylinder and parts of the bonnet, besides other residues and traces of powder found at the site. They will help determine the types of high-exposure materials used in the explosion.Pentaerythritol tetranitrate, or PETN, is a major ingredient of semtex and belongs to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin. One of the most powerful explosives, it is preferred by terrorists because its colourless crystals are hard to detect.A very small quantity of this explosive is required to carry out a blast in comparison to other chemicals. For example, the explosive substance used in the foiled transatlantic air freight bomb plot in 2010 was concealed in a printer cartridge.""PETN is quite stable and detonated either by heat or a shock wave. A car can be destroyed in around 100 grams. Most importantly, neither PETN nor semtex inherently require pellets or shrapnel to act as an explosive and the material itself is enough to cause immense damage through detonation,"" said an officer.On the other hand, ammonium nitrate fuel oil produces a supersonic shock wave rather than a subsonic burn, which means energy is released at an extremely high rate, creating a powerful shock effect.In the Delhi High Court blast of 2011, the initial opinion of forensic experts, including that of National Security Guard, was that a mix of ammonium nitrate with PETN was used. However, the home ministry had said later that RDX was used in it.Sources said there would be complete clarity on the explosive used in Monday's blast in a few days.Investigators suspect a proper detonation system was in place to blow the car, which was rigged with high-end explosives. A watch and its small button batteries may have been used for building the circuit and triggering the bomb.","Pentaerythritol tetranitrate, or PETN, is a major ingredient of semtex.

'We Can’t Breathe': Activists, Parents, Kids Held During Delhi Clean-Air Protest At India Gate

Winds may help improve air quality slightly today

NEW DELHI: It's official. The capital's air quality reached emergency levels on Tuesday and was the worst in nearly 11 months. With the noxious morning smog thickening amid dipping temperatures, Delhi recorded its first 'severe' air day of the year, prompting the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to enforce Stage III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) across NCR.The city's average AQI on Tuesday stood at 428 on a scale of 0 to 500, the worst since Dec 19 last year, when the index touched 451. The last 'severe' AQI in Delhi was logged on Dec 23, 2024, at 406.The sharp rise in AQI, from 362 on Monday, followed a night of calm winds and plummeting temperatures that allowed pollutants to accumulate near the surface, creating a dense smog blanket over the region. Visibility dropped to 600 metres at Safdarjung and 700 metres at Palam around 6.30 am.Winds started to drop on Monday and were almost calm through the night. We also have dipping temperatures, which led to significant accumulation of pollutants,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president at Skymet, adding that winds picked up only post noon on Tuesday, touching around 12 km/hr. ""As per forecasts, we can expect winds to stay consistent on Wednesday, so there are chances of marginal improvement,"" he said.The stage III of Grap implemented on Tuesday would be effective across Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Gautam Buddh Nagar. It includes a ban on construction and demolition (C&D) activities and restrictions on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel four-wheelers, except those used for essential services.Non-essential diesel-operated medium goods vehicles and BS-IV light commercial vehicles (LCVs) registered outside Delhi are also prohibited from entering the capital till the curbs remain in force.Delhi's directorate of education directed all schools to conduct classes up to Class V in hybrid mode. The Commission also advised Delhi and NCR govts to stagger office timings for public and municipal employees to cut down vehicular congestion in peak hours. Similar directions were issued to the Centre for offices located in Delhi-NCR.Most construction activities are banned, which is likely to hit thousands of daily-wage labourers across NCR.""All implementing agencies shall keep strict vigil and intensify measures of the extant schedule of Grap,"" said CAQM, directing that all actions under Stage I, II, and III will continue simultaneously.Although conditions turned sunny in the late morning and visibility improved to around 2,000m, haze persisted through the day. Delhi's minimum temperature fell to 10.2°C at Safdarjung, the lowest this season and about four degrees below normal. It was 10.4°C on Monday. The maximum stood at 27.7°C, two notches below normal. As per IMD's forecast, shallow fog in the early hours and winds up to 20 km/hour may blow on Wednesday, which may aid in slight dispersion of pollutants.CPCB data at 9am, when stage III was invoked, showed 33 of Delhi's 39 monitoring stations in the 'severe' category. Bawana (463) recorded the worst air, followed by Wazirpur (460).Among the most polluted areas were Alipur, Bawana, Burari, Chandni Chowk, ITO, and Jahangirpuri, where early-morning PM2.5 levels touched 600 g/m³.Experts attributed the spike to meteorological inversion, a phenomenon where a layer of warm air traps cooler air - and pollutants - close to the ground. Forecasts by the Centre's Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) suggest the capital's AQI is likely to improve marginally to 'very poor' on Wednesday and remain at that level till at least Friday.","The city's average AQI on Tuesday stood at 428 on a scale of 0 to 500, the worst since Dec 19 last year, when the index touched 451.

Police lapses made crucial proof invalid

NEW DELHI: In one of the most dramatic reversals in legal history, 2006 Nithari serial killings accused Surinder Koli , who was sentenced to death by various courts in 13 murder cases and nearly executed twice, is set to walk out of prison a free man after 19 long years.After being convicted and awarded death sentence by the trial court, Allahabad HC and the Supreme Court - which had dismissed his appeal as well as review plea - the apex court on Tuesday cured the mistake in a curative petition filed by Koli in the last case pending against him. A curative petition is the final judicial resort for an accused to seek justice.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai, Justices Surya Kant and Vikram Nath granted relief to Koli in the Rimpa Haldar murder case on the ground that the court had held the same evidence inadmissible in 12 other murder cases in which he had been acquitted.SC had in 2011 upheld Koli's conviction and death sentence in the Haldar case and dismissed the review petition in 2014.\In July, SC had upheld Allahabad HC's Oct 2023 judgment acquitting Koli in 12 Nithari murder cases of Noida on the ground that police lapses had rendered crucial evidence inadmissible.Armed with July's order, Koli in Sept invoked curative jurisdiction of SC and contended that the nature of evidence in all 13 cases were similar and two set of outcomes - acquittal and conviction - resting on the same evidentiary foundation cannot lawfully coexist.Allowing his plea, the court said, ""When final orders of this court speak with discordant voices on an identical record, the integrity of adjudication is imperiled, and public confidence is shaken. In such a situation, intervention ex debito justitiae (as a matter of justice) is not an act of discretion but a constitutional duty. We therefore entertain this petition to preserve the purity of this Court's process and to vindicate the rule of law.""The bench noted that the apex court had already held that Koli's confession which led to the conviction was legally tainted and not admissible and that would be applicable in the Haldar case too.""To allow a conviction to stand on evidentiary basis that this court has since rejected as involuntary or inadmissible in the very same fact matrix offends Article 21 of the Constitution. It also violates Article 14 of the Constitution, since like cases must be treated alike. Arbitrary disparity in outcomes on an identical record is inimical to equality before the law,"" the bench said.It said the offences in Nithari were heinous, and the suffering of the families was beyond measure but it was a matter of deep regret that despite prolonged investigation, the identity of the actual perpetrator had not been established in a manner that met legal standards.""Criminal law does not permit conviction on conjecture or on a hunch. Suspicion, however grave, cannot replace proof beyond reasonable doubt. Courts cannot prefer expediency over legality. The presumption of innocence endures until guilt is proved through admissible and reliable evidence, and when the proof fails the only lawful outcome is to set aside the conviction even in a case involving horrific crimes,"" it said.It said numerous loopholes were common to all Nithari cases. ""These gaps were central to the acquittals in the 12 cases. They are equally present here,"" the court said.","Surinder Koli was sentenced to death by various courts in 13 murder cases and nearly executed twice. Supreme Court on Tuesday cured the mistake in a curative petition filed by Koli in the last case pending against him. In July, SC had upheld Allahabad HC's Oct 2023 judgment acquitting Koli of 12 Nithari murder cases of Noida.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125262140,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-98.jpg"

leads special prayer for victims of blast

NEW DELHI: Indian agencies will get to the bottom of the conspiracy behind the Delhi blast and the perpetrators will not be spared, PM Narendra Modi said shortly after landing in Bhutan where he participated in the birthday celebrations of 4th Bhutanese king Jigme Singye Wangchuck. While he delivered his remarks on the occasion in Hindi, the PM switched to English to assert that ""all those responsible will be brought to justice"".PM Modi had earlier this year too, at a rally at Madhubani in Bihar days after the Pahalgam attack, switched language to convey to the world that India would identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers.The PM's remarks in Bhutan effectively confirm that the govt sees the Delhi blast as a terrorist attack. India's response will be watched closely by the international community as the govt had said after Operation Sindoor, which followed the Pahalgam attack, that any act of terrorism would be considered an act of war.Bhutan's king Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck led a special prayer at Thimpu in the presence of PM Modi Tuesday for the victims of Delhi blast. Thousands of Bhutanese joined the prayer offered by their king at the Changlimethang Stadium.The king told the gathering: ""Let us come together and pray for India, pray for PM Modi. May all your (PM Modi's) aspirations, vision and service to India bear fruit. May you overcome each and every single obstacle and may your dream of a even brighter, stronger and prosperous India be fulfilled.""He added, ""But above all, we would like to take a moment and pray for people who sadly lost their lives in Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The first lead in J&K police’s investigation into Jaish e Mohammad’s multi-state terror network involving Kashmiri doctors — now busted with nine arrests and a massive haul of over 2,900 kgs of explosives, bomb-making material and 2 AK-series weapons so far — was as innocuous as a few Jaish posters that had come up secretly in Nowgam, Srinagar in mid-October.The Jaish posters threatening attacks on security forces — common until 2019 but a rare occurrence now — fuelled the curiosity of Srinagar SSP G V Sundeep Chakravarthy, who had also led the J&K police component in Operation Mahadev that neutralised the three Pahalgam attackers. He insisted on finding out who put up the posters; and CCTV camera footage nailed three overground workers with a history of stone-pelting. They were arrested and their interrogation led the police to a cleric in Shopian, Maulvi Irfan Ahmad. Irfan’s questioning would, over the next 2-3 weeks, unveil a sinister Jaish plot — with links across J&K, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh — leading to a string of arrests.Those arrested so far include Kashmiri doctors working at Faridabad’s Al-Falah University, Muzammil Ganaie hailing from Pulwama; Adeel Ahmad Rather, originally from Qazigund but picked up from Saharanpur; and Dr Shaheen Sayeed hailing from Lucknow and Muzammil’s purported girlfriend.A fourth doctor, Dr Umar, who hails from Pulwama, is however absconding; an look out circular has been opened against him.Also in custody are the three overground workers behind the Nowgam posters; Hafiz Mohd Ishtiyak, a Mewat cleric who arranged the logistics in Faridabad; Maulvi Irfan and his aide from Ganderbal Zameer Ahmad Ahanger alias Mutlasha who led the J&K police to Muzammil.All the accused arrested in Haryana or UP have been brought to J&K and are being interrogated.Though Maulvi was not talking initially, a mobile device picked up from his house showed a Telegram channel operated by Pakistan-based Jaish terrorist Umar bin Khattab, confirming that he was in touch with Irfan. One of Irfan’s terror recruits, Mutlasha, also came under the scanner for being part of another pan-India terror chat group by the name Farzandan e Darul Uloom Deoband. Irfan eventually said he had seen an AK-47 in the house of a doctor he had radicalised. Mutlasha confirmed the identity of the doctor as Dr Muzammil Ganaie. Muzammil was traced to Al-Falah University in Faridabad, Haryana, where he was working with Dr Adeel and Dr Umar. The module was amassing explosives like fertiliser-based ammonium nitrate and bomb-making material including timers, detonators, batteries etc and storing them in two separate houses in Faridabad. Ishtiaq had the key to one of these houses.While one house was found stocked with 358 kg of explosives, the other held 2,563 kg of explosive material packed in 88 bags. An AK-47 was recovered from Adeel’s locker in GMC Srinagar and another from Dr Shaheen. Muzammil had hidden the gun in her car but she panicked after his arrest and threw it in a dustbin in Faridabad; it was later recovered by the police.Though interrogation is underway to establish how these explosives were to be used, investigators suspect a conspiracy to carry out terror attacks in the hinterland, with Delhi an obvious target given its proximity to Faridabad. “Idea was to use the cover of being medical professionals to escape suspicion. Given the massive quantity of explosives and other bomb-making material, it seems they were collected over two years,” an officer connected with the investigation told TOI.","The first lead in J&K police’s investigation into Jaish e Mohammad was a few Jaish posters that had come up secretly in Nowgam, Srinagar in mid-October.

Venu Srinivasan reappointed as V-C of flagship Tata Trust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/venu-srinivasan-reappointed-as-v-c-of-flagship-tata-trust/articleshow/125262726.cms,".

MUMBAI: TVS Motor Company chairman emeritus Venu Srinivasan has been reappointed trustee and vicechairman of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust (SDTT) for a period of three years. The move, SDTT said, was made “in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. ”On Oct 24, Srinivasan had been appointed permanent trustee of SDTT after his earlier term expired. However, this appointment did not comply with the recently amended Maharashtra Public Trusts Act, which came into effect on Sept 1. The amendment introduced provisions on the appointment of tenure and permanent trustees, including a cap that limits permanent trustees to one-fourth of a public charity’s total board strength.Currently, Noel Tata is the only permanent trustee at SDTT, which has a board strength of seven. To have two permanent trustees, it needs eight board members. Since the amended law supersedes any resolution passed after Sept 1 that does not conform to its provisions, the Oct 18 resolution appointing Srinivasan as a permanent trustee was deemed procedurally invalid.According to sources, Tata Trusts sought advice from multiple senior counsel and a top law firm on the issue and were advised that the Oct 18 resolution was void.Consequently, since Srinivasan could not be considered a trustee from Oct 24 until this week, the board decided to reappoint him.At SDTT’s Tuesday meeting, the board “decided to appoint Srinivasan as trustee for a period of three years with effect from Nov 12, 2025, in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and to designate him as vice chairman of SDTT,” read the press statement from Tata Trusts.Section 30A of the Act states that trustees with fixed tenures should step down when their term ends unless they are ‘unanimously’ reappointed by the remaining trustees. The reappointment, according to the Act, will be applicable for ‘up to five years’ if the trust deed does not specify the duration for reappointment.The Act also states that a tenure trustee whose term expires can only be appointed as a permanent trustee to fill a vacancy of a permanent trustee arising from death, insolvency, physical incapacity, permanently leaving India or conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude.SDTT, which operates according to a deed, and Sir Ratan Tata Trust (SRTT), which operates according to a will, do not specify the duration of a trustee’s appointment.This may be why former Tata Trusts chairmen JRD Tata and Ratan Tata, along with several other trustees like R K Krishna Kumar and Jamshed Bhabha, were permanent trustees of SDTT and SRTT. Tata Group veterans said Ratan Tata had introduced the concept of appointing trustees with fixed tenures. Past trustees with fixed tenures included Keki Dadiseth, Nasser Munjee, and Mehli Mistry.The number of trustees at SDTT and SRTT is seven and six respectively.According to the Act and the existing board strengths, the number of permanent trustees has to be one at each Trust.Noel Tata is the only permanent trustee of SDTT (Noel was reappointed as a trustee for life in Jan this year, much before the Act came to effect). At SRTT, Noel, his half-brother Jimmy Tata, and Jehangir Jehangir are permanent trustees, it is reliably learned. This indicates that SRTT will need to structure its board to comply with the Act. To have three permanent trustees, SRTT will need a board strength of 12 trustees.","TVS Motor Company chairman emeritus Venu Srinivasan has been reappointed trustee and vicechairman of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust (SDTT) for a period of three years.

NEW DELHI: With 75% of new human diseases originating in animals, India is stepping up efforts to bridge the gap between human, animal and environmental health. Govt is set to launch 'National One Health Mission', a Rs 383 crore cross-ministerial initiative to build coordinated surveillance, research and response systems to prevent outbreaks like Covid, Nipah, scrub typhus, avian influenza, reports Anuja Jaiswal.Cleared by the Prime Minister's Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC), the mission will be implemented by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It recognises that zoonotic and vector-borne diseases are not just public health threats but also challenges to food security, environment and economic resilience.The first major milestone will be the National One Health Conclave from Nov 20-21 in Delhi, which PM Modi is expected to attend to underline India's commitment to the 'One Health' approach. ""'One Health' is not a theoretical concept but a public health necessity for India,"" said Prof Umesh Kapil, president, Epidemiology Foundation of India. He stressed that collaborative surveillance, evidence-based diagnostics and strong institutional linkages are key to preventing future outbreaks.Officials said the framework also targets antimicrobial resistance (AMR) caused by misuse of antibiotics in humans, animals and agriculture. Coordinated policies involving ICMR, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, National Centre for Disease Control, FSSAI and CPCB will help curb AMR - one of India's gravest long-term health threats - in line with a national action plan.","75% of new human diseases originating in animals.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has restrained Patanjali Ayurved from issuing advertisements terming other chyawanprash products as ""dhoka"" or ""deception"" and asked it to take them down from all electronic, digital and print media.In the Nov 6 interim order on a plea by Dabur India, Justice Tejas Karia said, ""Anybody who manufactures an ayurvedic product by following the statute and the scriptures as enlisted in the statute cannot be denigrated as deceptive when the statute considers it to be as good and permissible ayurvedic drug, that is, chyawanprash in the present case.""Dabur India was aggrieved by the 25-second ad issued by Patanjali titled ""51 herbs. 1 truth. Patanjali Chyawanprash!""The high court said that for an average viewer of the ad featuring Ramdev, a well-known authority on yoga and Vedic practices, his assertion that only his product is genuine chyawanprash is likely to create a strong impression. ""Such a statement would naturally lead viewers to accept it as true and disregard other brands of chyawanprash. In evaluating the overall impact of the impugned advertisement, it is necessary to consider factors such as the stature and influence of the endorser,"" the court noted.The high court, while granting an ad-interim injunction, restrained Patanjali from issuing, broadcasting, telecasting or disseminating in any form the advertisement in any media forms. It also directed the removal, blocking, or disabling of the advertisement from all media within three days.","Dabur India was aggrieved by the 25-second ad issued by Patanjali.

BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court awarded an enhanced compensation of Rs 22.5 lakh to the family of a deceased schoolgirl, noting that her income must be calculated under the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act.The bench, partly allowing the appeal filed by Lt Col Rajinder Singh Shekhawat and his wife Vanitha, was led by Justice Umesh M Adiga who observed that the Supreme Court had, in Hitesh Nagjibai Patel case, laid down this principle.On Nov 10, 2018, Diya Shekhawat (15), a class X student at Poornaprajna Education Centre, Bhadravathi, succumbed to injuries sustained in an accident. Her schoolbus hit an electric pole due to the driver's negligence near Southikere of NR Pura taluk.Diya's parents, claiming they lost their only daughter who was a bright student and good at sports, sought Rs 78 lakh in compensation. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal at Shivamogga awarded them Rs 16.8 lakh in its order dated March 20, 2021. Dissatisfied, the parents and Sriram General Insurance Company filed separate appeals before the high court.The insurer of the offending bus argued the compensation was excessive, citing Supreme Court decisions in which awards ranged from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh in fatal accident cases involving minors.Diya's parents, on the other hand, contended the tribunal had failed to consider her prospects in computing the award.After perusing the materials on record, Justice Adiga noted the Supreme Court had directed compensation to be calculated based on prevailing minimum wages. The bench directed the insurer to pay an additional amount of about Rs 5.6 lakh with 6% interest to the claimants, over and above the compensation awarded by the tribunal, and dismissed the appeal filed by the insurance company.","Diya Shekhawat (15), a class X student at Poornaprajna Education Centre, Bhadravathi, succumbed to injuries sustained in an accident.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought the Election Commission's response to petitions filed by political parties and politicians from ruling dispensations in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry opposing special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls of their states as part of the pan-India exercise.After hearing senior advocate Kapil Sibal for petitioners from DMK and TMC, a bench of CJI-designate Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi wondered as to why the petitioners were opposed to correction of electoral rolls and said they can make suggestions to improve SIR. ""You all should endeavour to make the SIR exercise reach every voter,"" it said.However, when Sibal pressed for a stay on the ongoing SIR, it asked Election Commission to respond to the interim stay sought by the petitioners by Nov 24 and posted the matters for hearing on November 26.Sibal articulated the opposition to SIR saying the state always gets heavy rain during Nov and Dec when north-east monsoon is active. ""Because of this, the common people will be preparing for the same and the revenue officials who are enlisted as BLOs/EROs/AEROs will have to manage the flood reliefs as well. Hence, practically, this period of time is not conducive for conducting SIR,"" he said.As an additional ground to oppose SIR, he said Dec and Jan are harvesting seasons when most agriculturists and farmers would not be available at their homes to participate in the voter enumeration exercise under SIR.This would be followed by Christmas holidays and Pongal; thus, people would not be available from December 24 till Jan 18, he added.An MP from TMC, who has challenged SIR in West Bengal, told the bench through senior advocate Kalyan Banerjee that many areas of the state do not have 4G/5G mobile services making it difficult for the citizens to upload their data on the EC website or access the website for corrections.Appearing for Election Commission, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said it is surprising that when it comes to correction/revision of voter lists, the states are competing to show how backward they are.Sibal also termed the enumeration form as incomprehensible for the commoners and pointed out the departures from the Bihar-SIR to the pan-India exercise apart from accusing the Election Commission of squeezing the schedule to just a month when similar exercises earlier were carried out on a much longer period. ""This would result in lakhs of voters getting disenfranchised,"" he said.For an NGO, which had challenged Bihar SIR and now expanded its scope to challenge pan-India SIR, advocate Prashant Bhushan said EC has a software to erase duplication of voters but is not using it. SC asked EC to respond whether it could use such software to delete duplicate entries in the state voter lists.It also acknowledged the importance of Bhushan's plea for supply of acknowledgement slips to voters by EC against submission of voter enumeration forms. However, the SC was unsure whether it could direct the EC to upload machine-readable voter lists, given the earlier direction of SC contrary to it. Instead, it asked Bhushan to consider whether individual voters could be given OTP access to his own data in the voter list.","The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought the Election Commission's response to petitions filed by political parties and politicians from ruling dispensations in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry.

GURGAON: Al-Falah University, which started as an engineering college in 1997 in Faridabad's Dhauj, is run by Al-Falah Charitable Trust registered in Delhi's Okhla. It became a university in 2014 after UGC recognition. The trust is headed by Jawahar Ahmed Siddiqui, who is also chancellor of the varsity. The first medicine batch began in 2019, and it now has 200 MBBS seats and 50 MD seats.Over the years, the varsity has expanded its campus from 30 acres to over 70 acres through land acquisition from local villagers. In Jan 2025, former Haryana governor Bandaru Dattatreya inaugurated a newly constructed hospital building on the campus.The institution has come under scrutiny following the alleged involvement of three of its MBBS course professors in a terror module. The varsity's engineering department graduated its last batch in 2021, although some students are still clearing backlogs. The medical college, which began in 2016, admitted its first batch of MBBS students in 2019. Many of these graduates now serve as resident doctors at the university's hospital.Admissions are conducted through department of medical education and research (DMER), Haryana.University staffers, speaking anonymously, claimed the institution receives donations from Arab countries. ""Foreign fundraisers from Arab nations visit the campus once a year. Though the college is run by a charitable trust, it has donors outside the country,"" a staff member said.The varsity charges Rs 16 lakh annually for MBBS courses, while fees for MD programmes range from Rs 2.5 lakh for anatomy to around Rs 30 lakh per year for pediatrics.Another employee told TOI that the university organises short-term free medical check-up camps, usually lasting two to three months. According to a varsity official, recruitment across departments is managed by the Okhla head office under the supervision of chancellor Siddiqui's associates Irfan and Razi. ""They are key figures in the recruitment process,"" the official said.The university attracts students particularly from the Mewat region, Kashmir and Bihar. A staffer said the university was set up with an aim to provide educational opportunities to students from minority and underprivileged backgrounds. ""Al-Falah University was envisioned to uplift students from Mewat belt by providing access to quality technical and medical education,"" the official said.Al-Falah Hospital, which began as a small dispensary in 1997, has now expanded into an 800-plus bed super-specialty facility offering emergency and specialised care in medicine, pediatrics, radiology, orthopedics, dentistry and respiratory diseases, among others.","Al-Falah University started as an engineering college in 1997 in Faridabad's Dhauj.

NEW DELHI: As investigations into the recovery of explosives and assault rifles, and the Red For blast pointed to links of the accused to chat groups ‘Farzandan-e-Darul Uloom Deoband’ and ‘Kafila-e-Ghurba’ active on Telegram, senior functionaries in influential Muslim organisations, such as All India Muslim Personal Law Board and Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, claimed the outfits under the scanner were fake fronts set up by fringe elements to mislead people with their radicalisation agenda.Darul Uloom Deoband principal Maulana Arshad Madani, who also heads of one of the two Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind factions, decried the attempt to misuse and manipulate the name of ‘Deoband’ and ‘Deobandis’. “Anyone advocating for terror by using the name of Darul Uloom was against both Muslims and Islam,” he said. Darul Uloom Deoband, is an Islamic seminary where the Deobandi Islamic movement started in 1866.“Deobandis are spread all over the world, and at Darul Uloom, we focus on education. I am saying it clearly that we have nothing to do with anyone misusing the name of ‘Deoband’ to radicalise and propagate terror. We cannot be blamed for someone steering radicalisation in the garb of names like Farzandan-e-Darul Uloom Deoband. How can we stop or investigate this? But yes, we condemn such misuse,” Madani said.‘Farzandan-e-Darul Uloom Deoband’ came under the scanner of intelligence agencies after they started probing the source of posters that sprung up in Srinagar and other places expressing solidarity with the Jaish-e-Mohammad, a terrorist group which is widely seen to be of ‘Deobandi’ in orientation and which has claimed responsibility for a number of terror attacks in India, including that on Parliament and hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane.Jaish along with Lashkar-e-Taiba and Kashmir-based Hizbul Mujahidin were the prime targets of Operation Sindoor, which India launched in retaliation to the killing of tourists by Lashkar terrorists at Pahalgam.On the chat groups, All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) spokesperson SQR Ilyas said, “We must understand that these are fake fronts created by fringe elements and do not reflect in any way on the larger Muslim community. The attempt to build a narrative that the whole Muslim community is vulnerable to radicalisation is absolutely wrong.”Jamaat-e-Islami Hind vice president Salim Engineer said, “Regarding media references to certain online groups allegedly bearing Muslim or Islamic-sounding names such as ‘Farzandan-e-Deoband’ or ‘Ghurba-e-Islam’, we believe that such matters fall squarely within the domain of investigation. It is essential that reputable institutions and community organisations are not drawn into controversy without verified evidence. ”“In an age of digital misinformation, fake accounts and fabricated identities are frequently used to mislead the public and discredit legitimate platforms. Investigative agencies must proceed with fairness, professionalism, and responsibility to maintain public trust,” he added. “Terrorism and extremism, in all their forms, are alien to both the teachings of Islam and the ethos of India,” Engineer said.In a statement on the Delhi Red Fort car explosion, AIMPLB urged the govt to conduct a comprehensive, unbiased and multi-dimensional investigation into the incident. Jamaat-e-Islami Hind also sought the probe be timebound, impartial, and its findings be made public.","Senior functionaries in influential Muslim organisations, such as All India Muslim Personal Law Board and Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, claim the outfits under the scanner were fake fronts set up by fringe elements.

Amrutesh Vallabhaneni, an H-1B visa holder in the US, has brought a lawsuit against his employer, accusing the company of forced labor, labor trafficking and withholding visa documents, Breitbart News reported. Jay Palmer, Vallabhaneni's consultant who prepared the lawsuit, said it is a Squid Game for Indian workers in the US job market, as the ultimate goal is to stay in America, surviving the exploitative culture, created by Indian CEOs. These Indian-origin CEOs import their ""home-country caste discrimination politics"" to their workplaces in the US, Palmer said.According to the report, Vallabhaneni studied in India, got an F-1 student visa and a loan to attend a US college in 2015. Then he got OPT (Optional Practical Training), worked at a New Jersey company and then in 2018 moved to the company that he sued. He moved to the company as they promised him H-1B. The lawsuit said that the company violated laws and asked Vallabhaneni to pay his own salary for a period of six months. They also did not pay Vallabhaneni the prevailing wage.But after all this, Vallabhaneni was not free to leave the company as they allegedly threatened to withdraw his H-1B if he did not comply with their requests.The company also promised a green card but continued to pressure Vallabhaneni to accept their terms and conditions; otherwise he would have to leave the US.""Despite being guaranteed a wage by the DOL, AV (Amrutesh Vallabhaneni) often barely had enough money for rent and living expenses for himself and his family.

Bahraini woman reaches Captain status

Who is Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood?

Why does the A380 matter?

Bahraini women in aviation

Inspiration for the next generation





For the Kingdom of Bahrain, the year marks a soaring new chapter in its history books. Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood has landed an unprecedented achievement, becoming the nation's first female Captain to command the majestic Airbus A380. Taking the controls of the world's largest passenger aircraft, Captain Al Qaood has not only validated her own mastery of complex flight technology but has also symbolically lifted her entire country onto a global stage, demonstrating Bahrain's commitment to nurturing pioneering female leadership in one of the most demanding professions on Earth.The skies have a new commander, and she hails from the Kingdom of Bahrain. Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood has officially achieved the ultimate dream of commercial pilots: the prestigious rank of Captain. What makes this an extraordinary milestone is the aircraft she commands—the colossal Airbus A380. Captain Al Qaood is the first woman from Bahrain to reach this elite status while piloting the world’s largest commercial passenger jet.This achievement follows a rigorous and demanding journey.Reaching Captain status requires accumulating thousands of flight hours, passing complex technical examinations, and demonstrating flawless command ability—skills proven by Captain Al Qaood on one of the most sophisticated machines ever built.Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood's historic ascent to the command seat of the Airbus A380 is a defining moment for Bahrain and the Arab world, marking a major triumph for women in professional aviation. As a proud Bahraini national, her achievement is uniquely significant because she is the first woman from the Kingdom to achieve the rank of Captain while piloting the colossal A380, the world's largest commercial aircraft. While other pioneering women, such as Captain Yasmeen Fraidoon, previously broke the barrier by becoming Bahrain's first female Captains on smaller fleet aircraft, Captain Al Qaood has taken that legacy to the ultimate level of complexity and scale.Her success is the culmination of years of rigorous, demanding technical training and thousands of hours in the sky, positioning her not merely as a remarkably skilled pilot, but as a global symbol of the ambitious, highly-trained female workforce that is steadily shattering traditional ceilings throughout the modern Gulf region.To truly grasp the scale of Captain Al Qaood’s achievement, one must understand the significance of the Airbus A380, often nicknamed the ""Superjumbo."" It represents the pinnacle of commercial aviation engineering, and commanding it is a globally recognized feat of skill.The A380 is a double-decker giant that demands exceptional expertise:Unmatched Scale: It is the largest passenger plane in operation, weighing nearly 600 tonnes at takeoff and carrying over 500 passengers.Technical Mastery: Its complex systems require a Captain who possesses not only piloting skills but also superior crew resource management and emergency procedure expertise.The Elite Few: The number of pilots, particularly women, qualified to command this massive aircraft is incredibly small, placing Captain Al Qaood in an elite global cohort of aviators.Her position is a powerful testament to her technical precision and ability to lead a crew responsible for hundreds of lives.Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood’s achievement is the latest in a line of groundbreaking firsts for Bahraini women in the air, showing a consistent national commitment to female empowerment in the aviation sector.First Captains: Captain Al Qaood follows in the footsteps of pioneers like Captain Yasmeen Fraidoon, who became Gulf Air's first female Bahraini Captain on the national carrier's fleet (Airbus A320s/A330s). Captain Al Qaood's achievement extends this legacy to the A380.Military Milestones: In 2018, Sheikha Aisha bint Rashid Al Khalifa made history as the Kingdom's first female fighter pilot, flying a BAE Hawk.Engineering Excellence: Pioneering women like Hend Al Awadhi were the first female aircraft engineers, ensuring the safety of the fleet from the ground up.Captain Al Qaood’s command of the A380 is a symbol that the glass ceiling for women in the Gulf is not just cracked—it’s been completely shattered at the cruising altitude of 43,000 feet.Captain Al Qaood’s success is a direct, visible call to action for young women across the Middle East. Her journey is proof that dedication, passion, and rigorous training open doors to the most challenging and rewarding careers, regardless of background.By taking the ultimate seat on the ultimate jet, she has provided a powerful narrative: the complex technical fields of science and aviation are fully accessible. Her legacy, flying the world’s largest commercial aircraft, serves as a beacon of possibility, ensuring that the future of aviation is increasingly diverse and female-led.","Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood is the first woman from Bahrain to reach this elite status while piloting the world’s largest commercial passenger jet.

Authorities suspect that she may have been indoctrinated during this period.According to preliminary investigations, Shahid is associated with the newly formed Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, an organisation launched by the banned Jaish-e-Mohammed last month.She is alleged to be part of Jaish-e-Mohammed’s women recruitment wing in India and is believed to have been in contact with a handler in Pakistan, potentially tasked with recruiting more women for terror activities.Her arrest comes as part of a larger operation spanning Kashmir, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, which led to the seizure of 2,900 kg of explosives in Faridabad. Among the eight arrested, three are doctors.In Lucknow, Sayeed’s father expressed shock at his daughter’s involvement, stating he only learned about her arrest through the media and pleaded his ignorance regarding her alleged terror activities.Her father, Syed Ahmad Ansari, stated that he was ""shocked to hear of her alleged involvement.""""I have three children.

Mumbai: The Christian community has unitedly called upon chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to not proceed with the Maharashtra Freedom of Religion Bill that will be tabled in the winter session of the legislative assembly. Given the ambiguity and loopholes in the existing format, it is feared that the proposed anti-conversion law will open the door to harassment of religious minorities under the guise of ""attempted conversion"".On Sunday, Bombay Catholic Sabha (BCS) organised peaceful protests at 35 locations across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region where youths and senior citizens held placards that read ‘Our Faith Our Choice' and ‘Freedom of Religion, not Freedom to Discriminate'.Dolphy D'souza, BCS spokesman, said, ""The Bill threatens to undermine the very foundations of compassion and service that define our society. It risks criminalising acts of kindness like offering food, shelter, education and medical care without discrimination. Every gesture of compassion could be falsely portrayed as an attempt at conversion. In other states, similar laws have been weaponised by hostile groups to harass minorities, leading to persecution and abandonment of vital social services.The ultimate victims are the poor. India has sufficient legal provisions to address coercion and fraud.""Fr Nigel Barrett, spokesman for the archdiocese of Bombay, said, ""The Catholic Church in Mumbai is not opposed to the legislation if its intent is to prevent forced conversions. Coercion or inducement has no place in conversion. But implementation must be fair, just and constitutionally sound. The process to ascertain whether a conversion is voluntary must be simplified, not burdensome or intrusive. The freedom to choose or change one's religion is a fundamental right guaranteed under Articles 21 and 25 of the Constitution. ""Fr Nigel said ""conversion by inducement"" should be defined to avoid misuse. ""The burden of proof must lie with the complainant, not the accused. Complaints should only be accepted from the affected individual, or parents in case of a minor. Third-party complaints have led to malicious prosecutions — some have been quashed by Supreme Court for lacking evidence. We urge that making false or malicious complaints should attract stringent penalties. ""Auxiliary bishop Savio Fernandes pointed to the infamous case in Durg, Chhattisgarh, where two nuns were wrongly victimised for alleged conversion. ""The name Freedom of Religion law itself is a misnomer. Instead of safeguarding the right to convert by choice, the laws place restrictions on conversion. They presume guilt. The burden of proof rests not on the complainant but the arrested accused, who must prove his innocence,"" he added.","The Maharashtra Freedom of Religion Bill will be tabled in the winter session of the legislative assembly.

Winds may help improve air quality slightly today





NEW DELHI: The capital's air quality reached emergency levels on Tuesday and was the worst in nearly 11 months. With the noxious morning smog thickening amid dipping temperatures, Delhi recorded its first 'severe' air day of the year, prompting the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to enforce Stage III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) across NCR.The city's average AQI on Tuesday stood at 428 on a scale of 0 to 500, the worst since Dec 19 last year, when the index touched 451. The last 'severe' AQI in Delhi was logged on Dec 23, 2024, at 406.The sharp rise in AQI, from 362 on Monday, followed a night of calm winds and plummeting temperatures that allowed pollutants to accumulate near the surface, creating a dense smog blanket over the region. Visibility dropped to 600 metres at Safdarjung and 700 metres at Palam around 6.30am.Winds started to drop on Monday and were almost calm through the night. We also have dipping temperatures, which led to significant accumulation of pollutants,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president at Skymet, adding that winds picked up only post noon on Tuesday, touching around 12 km/hr. ""As per forecasts, we can expect winds to stay consistent on Wednesday, so there are chances of marginal improvement,"" he said.The stage III of Grap implemented on Tuesday would be effective across Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Gautam Buddh Nagar. It includes a ban on construction and demolition (C&D) activities and restrictions on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel four-wheelers, except those used for essential services.Non-essential diesel-operated medium goods vehicles and BS-IV light commercial vehicles (LCVs) registered outside Delhi are also prohibited from entering the capital till the curbs remain in force.Delhi's directorate of education directed all schools to conduct classes up to Class V in hybrid mode. The Commission also advised Delhi and NCR govts to stagger office timings for public and municipal employees to cut down vehicular congestion in peak hours. Similar directions were issued to the Centre for offices located in Delhi-NCR.Most construction activities are banned, which is likely to hit thousands of daily-wage labourers across NCR.""All implementing agencies shall keep strict vigil and intensify measures of the extant schedule of Grap,"" said CAQM, directing that all actions under Stage I, II, and III will continue simultaneously.Although conditions turned sunny in the late morning and visibility improved to around 2,000m, haze persisted through the day. Delhi's minimum temperature fell to 10.2°C at Safdarjung, the lowest this season and about four degrees below normal. It was 10.4°C on Monday. The maximum stood at 27.7°C, two notches below normal. As per IMD's forecast, shallow fog in the early hours and winds up to 20 km/hour may blow on Wednesday, which may aid in slight dispersion of pollutants.CPCB data at 9am, when stage III was invoked, showed 33 of Delhi's 39 monitoring stations in the 'severe' category. Bawana (463) recorded the worst air, followed by Wazirpur (460).Among the most polluted areas were Alipur, Bawana, Burari, Chandni Chowk, ITO, and Jahangirpuri, where early-morning PM2.5 levels touched 600 g/m³.Experts attributed the spike to meteorological inversion, a phenomenon where a layer of warm air traps cooler air - and pollutants - close to the ground. Forecasts by the Centre's Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) suggest the capital's AQI is likely to improve marginally to 'very poor' on Wednesday and remain at that level till at least Friday.","The city's average AQI on Tuesday stood at 428 on a scale of 0 to 500, the worst since Dec 19 last year, when the index touched 451.

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason





Gates Foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide. The funding aims to fuel dozens of projects, from life-saving maternal medicines to vaccines targeting infections that hit women hardest. The pledge marks a roughly 33% jump in the foundation's investments in women's and maternal health compared to the prior half-decade. It is the largest funding commitment the Gates Foundation has made in women’s health. The pledge also is a sign of the areas where Bill Gates wants to focus on as he seeks to donate the vast majority of his $114 billion fortune before winding down the foundation over the next 20 years. Gates spoke about the pledge during an event with STAT this week.The vast majority of the funds — as much as 70% — will go to research and development. About a tenth will go to market introduction of new technologies or generating better data around them. Only about 4% will go to manufacturing, and 3% to advocacy. ""It's curious why some of these areas are so under-invested, because the rich world health burden on preeclampsia specifically is still, you know, very high,"" Bill Gates remarked during a briefing, highlighting one of the hypertensive disorders that claim thousands of women's lives annually, even in wealthy nations.The portfolio brims with high-tech promise. Backed by the foundation's dollars will be self-injectable contraceptives for easier access, long-lasting contraceptive patches, lightning-fast diagnostics for STIs, and deep dives into the human microbiome's role in everything from pregnancy complications to broader women's health challenges, including disease transmission.Yet Bill Gates was clear-eyed about the foundation's boundaries. ""One thing we make very clear is we're not able to replace what the U.S. government has canceled,"" he said, nodding to recent federal budget trims in global health programs. Gates told STAT, ""It's just not our role to say, OK, the U.S. government wants to save money and so we'll help them do that.""In fields like malaria, tuberculosis, and non-hormonal birth control, the Gates Foundation already reigns as the world's top funder, Gates noted. Its R&D bets will yield lasting innovations that outlive the organization's support. But for on-the-ground health delivery, the clock is ticking: The foundation's aid is designed to be temporary, hinging on sustainable handoffs to other players.Even with Gates' immense wealth as a backstop, he stressed the need for collective action. A core aim, he and his team emphasised, is to ignite urgency among governments, pharmaceutical giants, and researchers to prioritise women's health disparities—long overlooked despite their outsized toll.""We'd love to have other people work on this stuff,"" Bill Gates said. ""It's crazy that this stuff isn't better funded. Drawing governments and other philanthropists in—we've had some success at that, and I'm putting more time into talking with other philanthropists about how impactful this work is. So I think we'll have a lot of additional partnerships, certainly at the end of the 20 years.""""Then we're gone,"" he added pointedly, ""and so other people will have to step up in these areas.""As the foundation accelerates its sunset strategy, this women's health push underscores a pivotal shift: from lone-wolf giving to catalysing a broader ecosystem. With maternal deaths still claiming a life every two minutes globally, advocates hailed the commitment as a vital spark—one that could, if multiplied, finally bend the arc toward equity.Recently, the Gates Foundation announced a $2.5 billion commitment through 2030 to advance women’s health, marking its largest-ever investment in the field. The funding will support a wide range of initiatives — from developing new medicines to prevent maternal deaths to creating vaccines that target infections disproportionately affecting women.The new pledge represents a roughly one-third increase in the foundation’s funding for women’s and maternal health compared to the past five years. It is also a small illustration of the kinds of commitments that Bill Gates is making as he seeks to donate the vast majority of his $114 billion fortune before winding down the foundatio",Gates Foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide.

Siddhant Awasthi’s journey through Tesla: From Model 3 to Cybertruck





Siddhant Awasthi’s impact on Tesla and the Cybertruck









Siddhant Awasthi, Tesla’s head of the Cybertruck programme, has announced his departure after more than eight years with the company. Rising from an intern to a senior leadership role, Awasthi played a key part in shaping several of Tesla’s landmark projects, including the Model 3, the Shanghai Gigafactory, and the groundbreaking Cybertruck. In a LinkedIn post, he reflected on his journey, highlighting the challenges and achievements that defined his career. Known for his technical expertise and leadership skills, Awasthi’s exit marks the end of a significant chapter for Tesla, leaving a lasting legacy on the company’s electric vehicle programmes and demonstrating the impact of innovation, dedication, and collaborative effort in advancing Tesla’s mission and shaping the future of sustainable automotive technology worldwide.Awasthi’s career at Tesla began as an intern immediately following his graduation in 2018. He quickly impressed the leadership with his technical expertise and drive, earning a promotion to engineering manager within two years. This rapid rise continued when he became senior technical programme manager, overseeing the development of the Cybertruck’s 48-volt architecture.By late 2022, as Tesla prepared to start production of the Cybertruck, Awasthi was appointed head of the electric truck programme.He oversaw not only the production ramp-up but also planned future upgrades for Tesla’s high-profile pickup. This trajectory demonstrates both his technical prowess and capacity to lead complex engineering projects at a young age. During his eight-year tenure, Awasthi contributed to multiple core Tesla projects. He was integral to the Model 3 ramp-up, ensuring production efficiency and reliability. He also worked on the Shanghai Gigafactory, helping establish Tesla’s manufacturing footprint in China.His work extended to the development of new electronics and wireless architectures, critical components in Tesla’s advanced electric vehicles. Finally, Awasthi delivered the Cybertruck, Tesla’s most ambitious pickup project to date, known for its futuristic design and advanced technology. His multifaceted contributions showcase a rare blend of engineering skill, programme management, and innovation.In his social media post, Awasthi expressed deep gratitude toward Elon Musk and Tesla’s leadership. He called his colleagues “talented, driven, and truly rockstar,” recognising the collaborative effort required to execute Tesla’s high-intensity projects. He also thanked Tesla’s customers for their support, noting that the company’s vehicles have positively impacted lives by improving safety and delivering tangible value.This acknowledgment underscores Awasthi’s perspective on teamwork and mentorship as essential to career growth, as well as his appreciation for the culture and leadership at Tesla. Despite Awasthi’s leadership, the Cybertruck has faced commercial challenges. Tesla initially aimed to produce 250,000 units annually, yet current sales reportedly remain around 25,000 per year. These figures highlight the complexity and unpredictability of launching a revolutionary vehicle.Nonetheless, Awasthi’s role in guiding the Cybertruck from concept to delivery has been significant. His work on vehicle architecture, production ramp-up, and future upgrades demonstrates a lasting legacy on Tesla’s electric truck programme. Reflecting on his time at Tesla, Awasthi described it as a “thrilling journey,” filled with high-intensity work across multiple programmes. From the Model 3 to the Shanghai Gigafactory and finally the Cybertruck, he emphasised the personal and professional growth he experienced.","Siddhant Awasthi has announced his departure from Tesla after eight years.

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London.

Issue a deportation order Replace the prison term with deportation Allow the individual to remain, depending on the specific case









Administrative deportation: Authority-issued expulsion for public interest

Deportation refers to the legal removal of a non-citizen from a country. In the UAE, deportation is a serious measure that applies to foreign nationals who commit certain offenses or are deemed a threat to public safety, security, or morals. The process is enforced under strict legal provisions and, once executed, can permanently bar the individual from re-entering the country unless an exemption is granted.There are two main types of deportation in the UAE:Each type is governed by different laws, authorities, and procedures, which determine whether a person is permanently expelled from the country, the possibility of return, and how appeals can be made.Judicial deportation is issued by a court after a foreign national is convicted of a crime. This type of deportation is governed by Article 121 of Federal Law No. 3 of 1987 (UAE Penal Code), as amended by Federal Law No. 34 of 2005 and further amended by Federal Decree-Law No. 7 of 2016.This means that for serious crimes like drug trafficking, rape, or violent assaults, deportation is not optional, it is automatically imposed by law.In contrast, for minor offenses such as bounced cheques or verbal disputes, the decision is up to the court’s assessment.Administrative deportation is not tied to a criminal conviction. It is executed by competent government bodies when a foreign national is deemed a threat to public safety, morals, or health, or lacks sufficient means of living.This type of deportation is issued under:Even if the foreign national holds a valid visa or residency permit, a deportation order may still be issued if deemed necessary for:The deportation order may also include dependents of the individual, such as a spouse or children, if they rely on that person for financial support. Even minors can be deported under judicial deportation if deemed necessary by the court. For example, repeat juvenile offenders involved in theft or violence may face expulsion, particularly if their actions threaten public order.Under Federal Decree Law No. 3 of 2017, all powers and responsibilities related to:...originally under the Ministry of Interior, are now transferred to the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship (now known as ICP). The ICP exercises full legal jurisdiction to manage deportation cases, entry permits, and related matters as part of its national mandate.Once a deportation order, judicial or administrative, is finalized:According to Article 17, the Chairman of the Federal Authority may direct that deportation-related costs be recovered from:A deported individual may have business dealings, employment, properties, or family responsibilities that require time to resolve.Under the law:This window is not automatic, it must be requested and is considered on a case-by-case basis.Yes. A foreigner who has been deported may, in certain cases, apply for special permission to return to the UAE. This applies to both judicial and administrative deportations, though not all applications are accepted.Alternatively, the individual may appoint a legal representative or lawyer to handle the process.In Dubai, applications for lifting deportation can be submitted online via the Public Prosecution’s website. A special legal committee reviews each case and makes a decision based on:There are no fixed requirements for what documents must be submitted, but stronger supporting evidence increases the chances of approval.","Deportation refers to the legal measure that applies to foreign nationals from the UAE.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Hundreds of cops resign ahead of Zohran Mamdani’s term in NYC: ‘How do you work for a mayor who wants to defund police?’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hundreds-of-cops-resign-ahead-of-zohran-mamdanis-term-in-nyc-how-do-you-work-for-a-mayor-who-wants-to-defund-police/articleshow/125193007.cms,"‘CITY THAT DEVOURS MAYORS’: Zohran Mamdani Faces BRUTAL Reality Of Running NYC | EXPLAINED

Workforce in numbers









New York City police officers are leaving the force in growing numbers, with morale sinking ahead of socialist Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral inauguration, according to the New York Post.NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year, according to Police Pension Fund data.“Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro. “You have a person who is supposed to be running New York City that does not believe in law enforcement. What’s coming out of everyone’s mouth is, ‘We’re in trouble.’”The Police Benevolent Association warned that attrition could worsen. “Every single month, we’re losing enough cops to staff an entire precinct,” PBA President Patrick Hendry said. “It will certainly get worse if our city leaders don’t work with us to fix our unsustainable workload, our expired contract and the constant second-guessing that is driving good cops away from the job.”New hires have helped cover up some of the losses. The NYPD has recruited 2,911 new officers this year, the highest in a single year since 2006, with the next class scheduled for December. The department currently has 33,745 uniformed officers, down slightly from 33,812 in 2024. Peak staffing was 40,285 in 2000, according to Independent Budget Office data.Concerns are mounting that Mamdani’s proposed reforms could further strain the force. The mayor-elect wants to create a Department of Community Safety to dispatch mental health professionals to crisis calls and shift disciplinary power to the Civilian Complaint Review Board.“How’s that going to work when the person pulls out a gun or a knife?” a Bronx cop questioned.Former and current officers voiced frustration at Mamdani’s past comments calling cops racist and homophobic. “How do you work for somebody who considers you racist and anti-queer and wants to defund the police? Things are hard enough already. If you’re eligible to leave, why would you want to stay in that situation?” said a retired officer.A police union consultant warned recruitment could become increasingly difficult. “Nobody wants to be a New York City cop. It’s not worth the money, the stress, the danger, especially working for a mayor who wants to take the department apart,” the source told the New York Post.","NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year. “Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125193072,imgsize-1148308,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

How Trump reacted?

Thune says 'the deal is coming together'



What is in the deal?



What would be next step if vote succeeds





US senators on Sunday reached an agreement to reopen the government after 40 days, signaling an end to the lengthy shutdown.A group of at least eight Senate Democrats, in consultation with Senate GOP leaders and the White House, reportedly reached a deal on Sunday to end the 40-day US government shutdown in exchange for a future vote on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.The Senate is expected to vote on the proposal between 8:30 and 9 pm ET (7:30 am IST Monday).President Donald Trump, who arrived at the White House from the Commander’s game, told reporters that the shutdown will end soon.""Looks like we're getting very close to the shutdown. We'll never agree to give any substantial money or any money to really prisoners, illegals that come into our country,"" Trump said."" And I think the Democrats understand that. And it looks like we're getting close to the shutdown ending. You'll know very soon,"" he added.Senate Republican Leader John Thune said a test vote was “coming together” as he prepared to put forward a narrow spending package. He cautioned, “We’ll see kind of where the votes are. This kind of stuff can drag on indefinitely if you allow it to.” He told reporters earlier that the chamber planned to vote on the House-passed funding measure to reopen the govt, along with a handful of year-long funding bills.The procedural motion has fallen short of the 60-vote threshold 14 times.According to CNN and CBS News, the deal was led by Sens Angus King of Maine, and Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, in coordination with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House.Under its terms, the Senate would vote on a Democrats’ bill concerning the Affordable Care Act by the end of the second week of December. The agreement also calls for the reversal of all shutdown-related layoff notices and extends the stopgap funding measure through January, among other provisions.Meanwhile, NBC news reported that the agreement contains a package of bills, known as a “minibus” — three full-year appropriations bills that will fund certain departments like Agriculture through the end of the fiscal year next fall — and a continuing resolution to fund the rest of the govt at existing spending levels through January 30.It also fully funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, once known as food stamps, through next September, a major flashpoint in the shutdown, according to sources. The sources said the deal also reverses Trump’s attempted layoffs of federal workers during the shutdown through RIFs, or “reduction in force” notifications.As per NBC, in a major concession from Democrats, it does not include an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Allowing the funds to lapse would raise insurance premiums for millions of Americans unless they are extended. Instead, the Democrats settled for a promise that the Senate will vote on a bill to extend the subsidies by the end of the second week of December, with the outcome uncertain, two of the sources said.Even if Sunday’s vote succeeds, the shutdown may not end immediately. House Democrats would need to approve the package, and their support was not assured. The Associated Press reported that necessary Democratic backing remained uncertain, in part because many Democrats continue to demand a one-year extension of the ‘Obamacare’ subsidies for low-income Americans in return for reopening the govt.Republicans need only five Democratic votes to clear the Senate threshold, and around 10 to 12 Democrats have been involved in the talks. Critics within their ranks have said the emerging deal falls short.

Oman extends expat resident card validity up to a maximum of 10 years - what changed and what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/oman-extends-expat-resident-card-validity-up-to-a-maximum-of-10-years-what-changed-and-what-it-means/articleshow/125215594.cms,"Oman extends expat resident card validity to 10 years / AI-generated illustration

What the new law changes for residents?

The previous maximum validity for an expat resident card was three years.

The new maximum validity is up to 10 calendar years from the date of issuance or renewal.

Fees and renewal

Service Cost Period Covered Issuance/Renewal RO 5 (Omani Riyals) per year Up to 10 years maximum Replacement (Lost or Damaged Card) RO 20 (Omani Riyals) flat fee N/A

Why is the 10-year card a game changer?

Reduces Red Tape: Frequent trips to government offices and endless paperwork for renewals are significantly minimized. This boosts operational efficiency for both the ROP and the employers.

Attracts Investment: Simplifying long-term residency makes Oman a far more appealing destination for foreign investors, high-value entrepreneurs, and top-tier professionals seeking stability for themselves and their families.

Fosters Stability: The longer validity period offers genuine peace of mind and long-term security to Oman’s large expatriate community, which includes roughly 1.8 million individuals working across the private sector, government, and domestic roles.

Modernization: This change aligns Oman's civil status processes with international best practices, similar to how the ROP simultaneously confirmed that the Omani national identity card validity remains at 10 years, matching the national passport duration.

Conclusion





Oman’s Royal Oman Police (ROP) has amended the executive rules for civil status so resident identity cards for expatriates can have longer validity, now up to 10 years in some cases, and Omani national ID cards are extended to 10 years as well. Fees were simplified: the resident-card cost is RO 5 per year (with total cost depending on chosen validity length) and replacing a lost or damaged card is RO 20. Cardholders must renew within 30 days of expiry. Several local outlets report slightly different references to the implementing decision number; the change was announced by the ROP’s leadership and has been widely published.The change was made official by the Royal Oman Police (ROP) under Decision No. 157/2025. This decree amends provisions of the Executive Regulations of the Civil Status Law.The key change is simple but powerful:The decision was issued by His Excellency Lieutenant General Hassan bin Mohsen Al-Shuraqi, the Inspector General of Police and Customs, reflecting the government's high-level commitment to streamlining services.Crucial Caveat: While the card can be issued for up to 10 years, this will apply to specific categories and controls to be determined and regulated by the Director General of the ROP.This suggests that certain long-term residents, investors, or highly skilled professionals may be the first beneficiaries of the full 10-year term.To support the extended period, the ROP has also simplified the fee structure, making it straightforward for residents and employers to plan for the long term:This means a resident opting for a five-year card, for example, would pay RO 25 (5 years * RO 5/year).Renewal Deadline: The ROP requires all cardholders to renew their documentation within 30 days from the date of its expiry to remain fully compliant with the Civil Status Law.This new structure replaces a previous decision issued just months ago, which offered flexible one-, two-, and three-year options. The adoption of the 10-year maximum showcases a faster-than-expected push toward long-term residency solutions.This administrative reform has immediate and powerful implications for Oman’s economy and its residents:By embracing this 10-year residency option, Oman signals a commitment to cultivating a stable, efficient, and welcoming environment for those who contribute to its development.Oman’s bold decision to extend the validity of expat resident cards up to a full 10 years is more than just an administrative update—it’s a powerful statement of clear intent. By offering a decade of stability, the Sultanate is not only easing the daily lives of its current residents but is actively shaping its promising future.This move clearly signals to the world that Oman is genuinely committed to a modern, efficient, and welcoming system for attracting and retaining the long-term global talent and sustainable investment crucial for its ambitious Vision 2040 goals. For the diverse expatriate community, the new 10-year resident card means less bureaucracy, more security, and a greater sense of belonging in the Sultanate.","Oman’s Royal Oman Police (ROP) has amended the executive rules for civil status so resident identity cards for expatriates can have longer validity, now up to 10 years in some cases.

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

: Foreign nationals seeking to immigrate to the United States could now be denied visas and green cards based on pre-existing chronic health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, under new guidance issued by the Trump administration.The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.A cable sent by the State Department to visa officers instructs them to flag applicants whose medical conditions could require ""hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care."" The list of conditions cited includes, but is not limited to cardiovascular diseases; respiratory diseases; cancers; diabetes; metabolic diseases; neurological diseases; and mental health conditions.The guidance also specifically advises officers to consider conditions like obesity, noting that it can lead to costly complications such as asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure. All these chronic illnesses are now being assessed as potential indicators that an individual might become a future financial burden on the United States.The policy shift, revealed on Thursday, is one of the most aggressive moves in the administration’s broader immigration crackdown, effectively linking an applicant’s health status to their eligibility for entry.It was not immediately clear if the directive applies to tourist and student visas. While it technically applies to all visa applicants, including those seeking non-immigrant visas for tourism (B-1/B-2) and studies (F1), it is expected to be primarily used for those seeking to permanently reside in the US.As things stand, tourist visa applicants are required to demonstrate they have sufficient financial means for their trip; they intend to leave the US at the end of their authorized stay; and they will not become a ""public charge"" during their temporary visit.At the heart of the new guidance is a stricter interpretation of the ""public charge"" rule—a century-old immigration provision designed to exclude those likely to become primarily dependent on government assistance. While health screenings have always been part of the visa process, traditionally focusing on communicable diseases like tuberculosis, the new directive vastly expands the list of conditions to be considered.Immigration advocates warn that the new rules grant consular officers, who lack medical expertise, sweeping authority to make subjective judgments about an applicant's long-term health since no one is expected to disclose their ailments in visa applications.Also read: Getting US visa could soon be harder for many – Who's affected? Under the new framework, visa officers are explicitly instructed to determine whether applicants have the financial resources to cover the costs of such long-term medical care ""over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.""Immigration experts contend that this policy will dramatically reduce legal immigration for older applicants and those with common chronic illnesses. Effectively, the policy will favor the wealthiest and healthiest applicants.","The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.
