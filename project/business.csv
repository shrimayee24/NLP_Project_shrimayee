Poll What do you think about the Election Commission's revision of electoral rolls? It is necessary for a fair election It raises concerns about voter exclusion

Why is the opposition protesting ?

Train halted, tyres Burnt

'SIR a normal exercise'

NEW DELHI: The Mahagathbandhan alliance on Wednesday kicked off a ""Bihar Bandh"" protesting against the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls by the Election Commission Opposition leaders, including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and RJD's Tejashwi Yadav, will lead a protest rally in Patna and plan to encircle the Chief Electoral Office in the state capital.Tejashwi claimed that the poll body has lost its credibility and become a ‘wing of a political party.’“The Election Commission has become a wing of a political party. Will two people from Gujarat decide which Bihari voter can vote and which cannot?” Tejashwi asked.“The Election Commission has lost its credibility. Preparations are underway on a large scale to remove the names of poor people from the voter list. First, their names are being deleted, and then their pensions and rations will also be taken away,” he added.The Opposition has alleged that the Election Commission, through its special intensive revision of electoral rolls, is snatching voting rights from migrants, Dalits, Mahadalits, and poor voters, calling the campaign a “conspiracy to block votes” ahead of the Bihar Assembly Elections , which are due in three months.Workers from the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and CPM burnt tyres and blocked roads in support of the Bihar Bandh on NH-30 in Patna's Maner.Party workers were seen raising banners and shouting slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and the Election Commission.Meanwhile, RJD's student wing blocked train tracks and NH-82 in Jehanabad.RJD workers also stopped the Namo Bharat train in Darbhanga.“We have called this Bandh against the Election Commission, which is working as per someone’s agenda… The public is tired of the government. RJD and the entire INDIA alliance have called for the Bandh,” an RJD worker said.Supporters of Independent MP Pappu Yadav also stopped an express train in Narpatganj, Araria.The poll body has claimed that the exercise is a standard procedure to update the voter list before every election as mandated by law. It has also undertaken a drive to weed out foreign illegal migrants from the electoral rolls in six states, starting with Bihar.The poll panel reminded the constitutional provision that says only Indian citizens can vote. ""The Constitution of India is supreme. All citizens, political parties, and the Election Commission of India follow the Constitution,"" EC said in a statement.The poll panel already has nearly 78,000 booth-level officers (BLOs) and is appointing over 20,000 more for new polling stations, it said.More than one lakh volunteers will be assisting genuine electors, particularly the old, sick, persons with disabilities, poor, and other vulnerable groups during the special intensive revision.Out of the existing 7,89,69,844 electors, 4.96 crore electors, whose names are already in the last intensive revision of the Electoral Roll on January 1, 2003, have to ""simply verify so, fill the Enumeration Form and submit it.""The enumeration form should be filled between 25 June and 26 July, after which the draft voter list will be published on 1 August 2025; the period for filing claims and objections will be from 1 August to 1 September, and the final voter list will be published on 30 September.","The Mahagathbandhan alliance on Wednesday kicked off a ""Bihar Bandh"" protesting against the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls by the Election Commission.

Bharat Bandh today: Public services likely to be hit; 10 things to know about nationwide strike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bharat-bandh-today-public-services-likely-to-be-hit-10-things-to-know-about-nationwide-strike/articleshow/122331219.cms,"Why are workers protesting?

Bharat Bandh : Here are 10 things to know -



The organisers expect more than 25 crore people across various sectors to take part in the bandh. This includes workers from both organised and unorganised sectors, with strong participation expected from farmers and rural workers as well.

The unions leading the strike include INTUC, AITUC, CITU, HMS, SEWA, AIUTUC, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC, and TUCC. These unions have come together to raise concerns about the government's labour and economic policies.

In defiance of police presence, members of Left party unions entered West Bengal's Jadavpur railway station and blocked railway tracks as part of their protest against the central government's ""pro-corporate"" policies. The unions also organised a foot march through the area.

A large police deployment was seen near the Jadavpur 8B bus stand, where both private and state-run buses continued to operate despite the 'Bharat Bandh'. Many bus drivers were spotted wearing helmets as a safety precaution.

They are especially critical of the new labour codes, which they claim will weaken workers' rights, extend working hours, and make it harder to form unions or go on strike.

They are also demanding more government jobs, an increase in MGNREGA wages and workdays, and similar employment schemes for urban areas. The unions have submitted a 17-point demand list to the Labour Minister, but they say there has been no serious response from the government.

Banks are expected to remain open, as July 9 is not a holiday listed by the Reserve Bank of India. However, banking services could still be disrupted if bank workers join the strike.

On the other hand, stock markets will function as usual, and there is no scheduled trading holiday.

Schools, colleges, and government offices are expected to remain open as well. No official closure has been announced.

However, public transport services may be affected in many regions, which could lead to delays for commuters, students, and office-goers. In past strikes, participation levels varied by location, and some areas saw last-minute announcements affecting school operations.

This is not the first time the trade unions have organised such a protest. Similar strikes were held on November 26, 2020, March 28–29, 2022, and February 16, 2024, focusing on issues like privatisation of public sector units, job insecurity, and the casualisation of the workforce.

NEW DELHI: The central trade unions have announced a nationwide strike for Wednesday, with over 25 crore workers from various sectors expected to participate.The strike is also supported by several rural and agricultural labour organisations. The unions say they are protesting against government policies that help big businesses but hurt workers, farmers, and the poor.The unions also claimed that government departments were increasingly hiring retired personnel instead of young professionals, citing examples from the Railways, NMDC Ltd, the steel sector, and education services. They argue this trend is harmful in a country where 65 percent of the population is under 35, and unemployment is highest among those aged 20 to 25.Also read | Bharat Bandh 2025: Will schools, colleges & govt offices be closed on July 9?","The central trade unions have announced a nationwide strike for Wednesday, with over 25 crore workers from various sectors expected to participate.

I book my return tickets first.

The aim is to saturate plantations along National Highways by involving multiple stakeholders, ultimately building a greener and more sustainable highway network.",Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari expressed concern over rising pollution levels in Delhi.

Bihar form collection nears halfway mark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-form-collection-nears-halfway-mark/articleshow/122329893.cms,"NEW DELHI: On a day the collection of signed enumeration forms under the special intensive revision (SIR) in Bihar just about touched the half-way mark, chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar defended the exercise, saying that “a pure electoral roll is inevitable for strengthening democracy”.Kumar’s statement came amid a flurry of legal challenges filed against SIR in the Supreme Court by 11 opposition parties, seeking a stay on the exercise that they claim shall “disenfranchise lakhs of voters in Bihar”. Incidentally, these very parties have been questioning the health of electoral rolls based on which Maharashtra elections were held last year, alleging arbitrary inclusions.“During the past four months, all 4,123 electoral registration officers (EROs), 775 district election officers (DEOs) and 36 chief electoral officers (CEOs) have held nearly 5,000 meetings with 28,000 political party representatives. ECI has also invited all recognised political parties for interaction. No one was satisfied with the current status of electoral rolls for one reason or the other,” according to Kumar. EC on Tuesday said 18.2% enumeration forms received in Bihar were now uploaded on ECINET. As of 6 pm on Tuesday around 47% forms had been collected, with 10.5% in the last 24 hours. “Maintaining the same momentum, with 50% forms remaining to be collected, the exercise would be completed well in time,” EC said.“The final roll will be published as scheduled on Sept 30, 2025,” an officer told TOI.EC officials on Tuesday underlined that SIR order dated 2406.2025 stands on four pillars — being all-inclusive in terms of coverage of electors; inclusion of all those who submit their signed enumeration forms by July 25, in the draft roll to be published on August 1, while allowing eligibility documents to be submitted till Sept 1; deciding eligibility of the elector as per Article 326 of the Constitution and Section 16 and 19 of Representation of the People Act, 1950; and exclusion only after inquiry by the ERO, who can rely on field inquiry and documents beyond the 11 listed by EC.Commission officials said pre-filled enumeration forms have been distributed to 7.7 crore of the 7.9 crore electors, with the remaining likely dead, shifted or migrated. Booth level officers are currently making the second of three visits to households to collect the filled-up forms. Volunteers are facilitating the old, sick, persons with disabilities (PwDs) and the poor to complete the forms.The draft roll to be out on August 1 will list all those who submit enumeration forms by July 25. Documents may be submitted separately till July 25 and also during the claims and objections period.All citizens of India aged 18 years and above and who are ordinarily resident in the constituency where they seek to be enrolled, unless disqualified, must be enrolled, as per SIR guidelines.Exclusion of a voter would be only after inquiry by ERO, based on scrutiny of the documents submitted (as per indicative and not exhaustive list mentioned by SIR guidelines) and a field report. The ERO/AERO shall pass a ‘speaking order’ on any exclusion, with due notice to such elector.Though the final roll will be published on September 30, two-stage appeals may be filed against the ERO’s decision, first with the district magistrate and then the CEO, as per Section 24 of the R P Act, 1950.","The draft roll to be out on August 1 will list all those who submit enumeration forms by July 25.

Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha? Government to take call on Yashwant Varma removal route,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lok-sabha-or-rajya-sabha-government-to-take-call-on-yashwant-varma-removal-route/articleshow/122329771.cms,"Justice Yashwant Varma

Others who faced removal

NEW DELHI: With many from the Opposition parties indicating support for the move to evict him from judiciary, the government is soon to take a call on whether to bring the motion for the removal of Justice Yashwant Varma, in Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha in the Monsoon session of Parliament, beginning on July 21. The law requires a motion for removal to be endorsed by 100 LS MPs. The required number is 50 in the case of Rajya Sabha.Govt has been holding consultations with the Opposition parties. The process for removal of a judge of the Supreme Court, or a high court, is provided under Article 124(4) of the Constitution, which says that ""a Judge of the SC, or the high court, shall not be removed from his office except by an order of the President passed after an address by each House of Parliament supported by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting has been presented to the President in the same session for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. ""To initiate a removal proceeding, Constitution has laid down very stringent conditions under the Judges (Inquiry) Act, which requires Parliament to set up a three-member committee comprising the Chief Justice of India or a judge of the Supreme Court, a chief justice of a high court and a noted jurist, to probe with evidence if the judge was indeed guilty of ""misbehaviour or incapacity"".The committee is constituted only after a motion is moved in Parliament for removal, addressed to the President 'praying for the removal of a judge'.Once the motion is moved, Speaker of Lok Sabha or the Chairman of Rajya Sabha, as the case may be, may consider admitting the motion and constitute an inquiry committee under Section 3(2) of Judges (Inquiry) Act.In this case, the Supreme Court has already constituted a three-member in-house inquiry committee comprising chief justices of Punjab and Haryana high court and Himachal Pradesh high court, and a judge of Karnataka high court. Based on their findings and examination and recording of statements of more than 50 witnesses, the then CJI Sanjiv Khanna recommended Justice Varma's removal to the President and the Prime Minister.The govt is likely to share the findings of the in-house report with the inquiry committee, which is mandated to be set up by Parliament after a motion for removal is adopted, under Judges (Inquiry) Act: something which may help the panel and enable it to submit its report soon.As reported by TOI earlier, Justice Soumitra Sen of Calcutta high court was the first judge against whom the Rajya Sabha had voted with the required majority on a removal motion in 2011. But the judge finally resigned to avoid his removal. The first case of a removal motion in Parliament was against Justice V Ramaswami, a judge of SC, in 1991. But he escaped being removed as the motion failed to secure the required two-thirds majority in Lok Sabha.Justice PD Dinakaran, the then chief justice of Sikkim high court, resigned in 2011 before the removal proceedings were initiated in Rajya Sabha. In 2015, a similar motion was moved in Rajya Sabha against Justice JB Pardiwala of Gujarat high court. However, the judge later removed a controversial statement from a judgment of his that had stoked the controversy. The latest case was against Justice SK Gangele of Madhya Pradesh high court when 58 MPs of Rajya Sabha moved the motion.However, an inquiry committee absolved the judge of sexual harassment charges against him.",Govt has been holding consultations with the Opposition parties. The law requires a motion for removal to be endorsed by 100 LS MPs. The first case of a removal motion in Parliament was against Justice V Ramaswami in 1991.

PATNA: A senior govt doctor was allegedly administered the wrong treatment by a technical staff member, not a qualified physician, during her journey on the New Delhi-Patna Tejas Rajdhani Express, raising fresh concerns over the quality and oversight of medical assistance provided to passengers on trains.Dr Divya, head of the eye department at Bulandshahr District Hospital in Uttar Pradesh, was travelling to Patna on Saturday. Midway through the journey, she began experiencing gastric discomfort and dialled the railway helpline 139, requesting urgent medical assistance.According to Dr Divya, she received a call back from an official of the Prayagraj division under North Central Railway (NCR), who informed her that a fee would apply if she wanted medical attention.However, at Kanpur Central station that night, she was shocked when a technical staff member, not a qualified doctor, arrived to attend to her.""He administered an antibiotic, despite my symptoms being clearly related to gastric discomfort. When I identified myself as a senior medical professional and questioned the treatment, he remained silent but still insisted I pay Rs 350 for the visit and an additional Rs 32 for the medicines.""She added that while no receipt was given for the consultation fee, she was sent a medicine bill via an instant messaging platform. ""Even after repeated persuasion, I was not given a bill for the so-called doctor's visit,"" she said.Responding to the allegation, NCR's chief public relations officer Shashi Kant Tripathi said on Sunday, ""The Railway Board has fixed Rs 100 as a nominal fee in some cases for a doctor's visit to attend to a patient on board. There is no such fee like Rs 350 for a doctor's visit. The railways will inquire into the matter.""Dr Divya has lodged an online complaint with the Railway Board and NCR authorities. ""I have demanded fair treatment for patients on trains and a complete check on this kind of extortion in the name of medical aid,"" she said.","Dr Divya, head of the eye department at Bulandshahr District Hospital in Uttar Pradesh, was travelling to Patna.

"UAE rolls out new golden visa: Lifetime residency at Rs 23 lakh, India among first to benefit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/uae-rolls-out-new-golden-visa-lifetime-residency-at-rs-23-lakh-india-among-first-to-benefit/articleshow/122280940.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major shift from its traditional investment-based residency model, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has introduced a new nomination-based Golden Visa, offering eligible Indians lifetime residency in the country by paying a one-time fee of AED 1,00,000 (approximately Rs 23.3 lakh), without the need to invest in property or business.Until now, Indian nationals were eligible for the UAE's coveted Golden Visa programme primarily through high-value investments, including a minimum AED 2 million (Rs 4.66 crore) in property. But under this new system, applicants can be nominated and approved based on their professional background, societal contributions, or potential benefits to UAE’s sectors such as culture, trade, science, startups, or finance.The pilot phase of the initiative has been launched for India and Bangladesh, with over 5,000 Indian applicants expected in the first three months, according to officials involved in the process.Rayad Group, the consultancy firm selected to pilot the nomination-based Golden Visa in India, is leading the process in partnership with VFS and One Vasco centres across India and Bangladesh. Applications can also be submitted through the group’s online portal and call centre.""This is a golden opportunity for Indians,"" said Rayad Kamal Ayub, Managing Director of Rayad Group. He explained that the vetting process includes anti-money laundering checks, criminal background verification, and social media screening. The final nomination decision rests with UAE government authorities.Approved visa holders can bring family members, employ staff, and engage in business or professional activities. Unlike property-based visas, which lapse upon property sale, the nomination-based Golden Visa is permanent.This initiative reflects the UAE’s growing economic and strategic ties with India following the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) signed in 2022. The program is expected to expand to other CEPA partner countries, including China, in later phases.Commenting on the move, Akash Puri, Director International, India Sotheby's International Realty said, “The recent overhaul of the UAE’s Golden Visa marks a significant shift in the country’s residency landscape. The new framework is more inclusive and strategically aligned with the UAE’s long-term vision. For Indian real estate investors, this change brings a two-pronged impact: Historically, property investment was one of the few avenues to secure long-term residency, prompting a surge of interest from Indian investors seeking both capital preservation and immigration benefits. With the visa now accessible through broader channels, the urgency to invest solely for residency purposes is likely to ease—particularly in the mid-market and entry-level segments. This could cool speculative buying and encourage more grounded investment behaviour.”“Investors who remain committed to the UAE property market—driven by rental yields, lifestyle advantages, or diversification—will now place greater emphasis on fundamentals like location, developer credibility, and long-term value. Luxury and trophy assets will continue to appeal to ultra-HNWIs, who are largely unaffected by the new professional-centric criteria. For Indian investors, this is a cue to recalibrate: from residency-led transactions to value-led strategies. Over time, this evolution could establish a more stable, resilient real estate market—one that rewards strategic, long-term participation over short-term speculation.” Akash Puri said.","The pilot phase of the initiative has been launched for India and Bangladesh. The program is expected to expand to other CEPA partner countries, including China, in later phases. Unlike property-based visas, which lapse upon property sale, the nomination-based Golden Visa is permanent.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122281127,imgsize-58518,width-400,resizemode-4/122281127.jpg"

At a gross income of Rs 18 lakh, the new regime offers savings of over Rs 29,432, despite the old regime having a significant amount of deductions. The total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 5.59 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

At a gross income of Rs 25 lakh, even with more than Rs 5.25 lakh in deductions, the old regime tax is Rs 26,000 higher than the tax outgo under the new regime. The total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 6.08 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

At a gross income of Rs 75 lakh, even with significant deductions/exemptions under the old regime, the new regime still proves better by Rs 45,760. The total eligible tax savings investments should be more than ~Rs 9.58 lakhs for the old regime to be beneficial.

The above examples take into account individuals contributing to NPS (employer’ contribution). However, if one does not contribute to such NPS, for an individual having gross income of more than Rs 15.75 lakh, he/she is better off taking new regime only if the eligible tax saving investments under the old tax regime are less than Rs 4,33,333/-

ITR filing FY 2024-25: The choice of the income tax regime while filing Income Tax Return (ITR) is an extremely important one. Your final tax outgo is dependent on the tax regime you opt for, hence the choice between the new and old income tax regime should be an informed decision.Salaried taxpayers have the option to choose between the new and old income tax regime every year. As your financial journey evolves, and changes are made in both the new and old income tax regime, it’s crucial for you to do a final check on which regime suits you best before filing ITR for FY 2024-25.“The Government has over the years brought significant revisions, in the New Regime, making the choice more compelling—and more consequential—than ever,” says Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner, EY India.Also Read | ITR filing FY 2024-25: Do you need to file your income tax return if TDS has been deducted? Explained If you are confused about the new versus old income tax regime and are still wondering which works out better for you, we have you covered.Before understanding the math to decide between the new and old regimes, here’s a look at the tax slabs in the respective regimes.The above tax slabs are applicable for resident individuals up to the age of 60 years. For senior citizens between the age of 60-80 years, the basic exemption limit is Rs 3 lakh.For super senior citizens the basic exemption limit is Rs 5 lakh.The tax slabs under the new regime are very different from those in the old regime, with new tax brackets and lower tax rates. However, there is no separate basic exemption limit for senior and super senior citizens.The table below by EY, gives a side-by-side comparison of the new and old Tax regimes, highlighting key differences in structure, eligibility, and suitability to help taxpayers make an informed choice.To illustrate how tax liabilities vary under each regime (for the Financial Year 2024-25), here’s a comparative snapshot across income levels for a Resident individual:Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner, EY India tells TOI that an income-wise comparison of tax liability under the new and old Regimes reveals a clear trend: the new tax regime offers lower tax outgo across all income brackets, from middle to high-income groups—even when taxpayers under the old regime claim substantial deductions like HRA, Section 80C, NPS, and standard deductions. He explains:“These findings suggest that the new regime is not only simpler but often more tax-efficient, especially for individuals who may not fully utilize all deductions or prefer a hassle-free filing process. While the old Regime still holds value for some with structured investments, the broader appeal of the new Regime continues to grow, making it a compelling default choice for many taxpayers,” Amarpal Chadha tells TOI.Yet another detail that you should not miss is that the new income tax regime is now the default tax regime. While filing ITR, you can choose between the old and new regime. But, if the return is filed after the due date (this year it is September 15, 2025), then you will have to by default file ITR under the new tax regime, the option of old regime would not be available.Also Read | ITR filing: Why are ITR-2 and ITR-3 forms still not available on Income Tax e-filing portal?

Yes, I fully support it. No, I do not support it.

NEW DELHI: More than 25 crore workers across sectors including banking, insurance, postal services, coal mining, and construction are expected to join a nationwide general strike on Wednesday, potentially disrupting key services across India, according to a joint forum of central trade unions.The strike, described as a ‘ Bharat Bandh ’, has been called by a forum of 10 central trade unions and their associates to protest against what they term “anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-national pro-corporate policies of the government”.“Preparations have been taken up in earnest by unions in all sectors of the formal and informal/unorganised economy” and urged supporters to make the strike a “grand success"", said the forum in a statement.“All India Trade Union Congress’s Amarjeet Kaur said, “More than 25 crore workers are expected to take part in the strike. Farmers and rural workers will also join the protest across the country.” Harbhajan Singh Sidhu of Hind Mazdoor Sabha added, “Banking, postal, coal mining, factories, state transport services will be affected due to the strike.”The forum said it had earlier submitted a 17-point charter of demands to Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya but received no concrete response.It also alleged that the government had not conducted the annual labour conference for the past decade and was instead pushing through four labour codes that would weaken collective bargaining, cripple union activity, and favour employers in the name of “ease of doing business”.It further claimed that economic policies were deepening unemployment, raising prices of essential commodities, suppressing wages, and reducing expenditure on education, health, and civic amenities, thereby widening inequality and burdening the poor, lower-income groups, and the middle class.The statement added, “The government has abandoned the welfare state status of the country and is working in the interest of foreign and Indian corporates, and it is so evident from its policies being pursued vigorously.”The unions are also protesting against the privatisation of public sector enterprises, outsourcing, contractual employment, and casualisation of the workforce. They claim that the four labour codes passed in Parliament were designed to “suppress and cripple the trade union movement, increase working hours, snatch workers’ right to collective bargaining, right to strike, and decriminalise violation of labour laws by employers. ”“We are demanding from the government to address unemployment, recruitments against sanctioned posts, creation of more jobs, increase in days and remuneration of MGNREGA workers and enactment of similar legislation for urban areas. But the government is busy imposing ELI (Employment Linked Incentive) scheme to incentivise employers instead,” the statement said.It also alleged that instead of hiring young professionals, government departments were increasingly recruiting retired personnel, as seen in Railways, NMDC Ltd, steel sector, and education services — a move the unions say is harmful to a country where 65 percent of the population is below the age of 35 and unemployment is highest among those aged 20 to 25.Unions from NMDC Ltd, non-coal minerals, steel, state government departments, and other public sector enterprises have also served notices for participation in the strike.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha and a joint front of agricultural workers’ unions have also extended support to the strike and announced large-scale mobilisation in rural areas.Similar nationwide strikes were observed by trade unions on November 26, 2020; March 28-29, 2022; and February 16, 2023.(With inputs from news agency PTI)","More than 25 crore workers across sectors including banking, insurance, postal services, coal mining, and construction are expected to join a nationwide general strike on Wednesday.

Air India Plane Crash: What Led To Ahmedabad Crash? AAIB Submits Preliminary Report To Centre

MUMBAI: As the 30-day limit to submit the report of the preliminary investigation into the June 12 Air India accident in Ahmedabad to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) ends this week, there is anticipation India will release it to the public.The ICAO places no obligation on the investigating country to make the report public and India had not released the preliminary report of the last major accident at Calicut in 2020. But the AI 171 probe is being followed by the global airline industry with keen interest as it was the first major one involving a Boeing 787.""Apart from the roles and responsibilities of Air India, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, and others, the investigation will crucially be a Boeing 787 systems-level case study. It's the first such global investigation of the 'more electric' B787 aircraft. The preliminary findings, if substantial and critical, could reshape B787 operations,"" said a senior commander, requesting anonymity. ""What we hear is that India will make the preliminary report public this time,"" he added.Prior to the June 12 accident, the last major fatal accident India investigated was the August 2020 Calicut Air India Express accident involving a Boeing 737 and 21 deaths.Back then, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) did not release its preliminary report to the public.Since an aircraft accident investigation is solely carried out to learn lessons and prevent a repeat — unlike a murder investigation, it does not apportion blame or trace culprits — most countries release their preliminary findings to the public.The last time the global aviation industry tracked an accident investigation closely was in 2018 after the Oct 29 Indonesian Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX crash. Keeping with the 30-day deadline, on Nov 28, Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee sent a preliminary report to ICAO and also publicly released it. In fact, it announced in advance that the preliminary report would be uploaded on its website at 10 am on November 28.“The preliminary investigation following Lion Air Flight 610 revealed that prior to the crash, a system called Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System or MCAS engaged without the Lion Air pilots’ knowledge. Back then, Boeing hadn’t disclosed MCAS to any airlines or pilots. The MCAS lowers the nose automatically to prevent a stall, or the loss of lift, if it detects that the angle of the plane’s nose is too high relative to the ground. What we learnt from the preliminary report is that a malfunctioning sensor may have led the MCAS to engage repeatedly, countering the pilots’ manoeuvres,” said a B737 examiner. “When Ethiopian Airlines B737 MAX crashed five months later, it was the Lion Air preliminary report that came back into focus. The final report into the Lion Air crash came a year later; by then, the B737 MAX was already grounded globally,” he added.“If Air India accident preliminary report points to any possible warning or technical fault in the B787, you can imagine the impact it would have on Dreamliner operations globally,” the examiner said. Of all the accident investigations carried out by India in the past decades, this one is arguably the most followed investigation globally. The AAIB can submit the preliminary report to the ministry of civil aviation if it chooses. Under Annex 13 of ICAO, which lays down the guidelines for carrying out an accident investigation, the preliminary report has to be submitted by the state (India, in this case) to ICAO within 30 days of the occurrence.",The 30-day limit to submit the report of the preliminary investigation into the June 12 Air India accident in Ahmedabad ends this week. There is anticipation India will release it to the public.

NEW DELHI: The central panel on air quality in Delhi-NCR has decided to delay the implementation of the fuel ban on end-of-life (EOL) or overage vehicles in Delhi till November 1, news agency PTI reported.EOL vehicles include diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years.""Direction 89 to be amended. Drive against End-of-Life vehicles in Delhi will now come into force from November 1, along with 5 NCR districts,"" CAQM (Commission for Air Quality Management) official was quoted as saying by the news agency ANI.Earlier, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) had directed that such vehicles would not be allowed to get fuel in Delhi from July 1, regardless of where they were registered.Last week, Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa wrote to the CAQM requesting it to hold off on the action. He called the move ""premature and potentially counterproductive"", pointing to ""operational and infrastructural challenges"".The CAQM reviewed the issue and decided to delay the enforcement of the directions, news agency PTI quoted sources.The drive will now be launched on November 1 across Delhi and five adjoining high-vehicle-density districts — Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar and Sonipat.Fuel stations in Delhi have installed Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras to identify EOL vehicles. The camera scans the number plate and checks the vehicle details, such as fuel type, age, and registration, through the VAHAN database.If the system finds a vehicle to be EOL, it alerts the fuel station staff not to refuel it. The violation is recorded and sent to enforcement agencies, who may then take action like impounding or scrapping the vehicle.The decision to postpone the ban followed public discontent and opposition, prompting the Delhi government to request CAQM to delay the rollout.The installation of ANPR cameras in the five neighbouring districts is expected to be completed by October 31, as per PTI report.",The central panel on air quality in Delhi-NCR has decided to delay the implementation of the fuel ban on end-of-life (EOL) or overage vehicles in Delhi till November 1.

Brics rejects EU's unilateral carbon border tax proposal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/brics-rejects-eus-unilateral-carbon-border-tax-proposal/articleshow/122327999.cms,"Brics Summit

NEW DELHI: The Brics nations have rejected the European Union's proposed carbon border tax, or the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), calling it ""unilateral, punitive and discriminatory protectionist measures"", and said the move, being made ""under the pretext of environmental concerns"", would undermine their capacities to invest in just energy transitions and development priorities.India has long been opposed to such measures and even flagged its concerns during the recent free trade agreement talks with the EU.The concerns of the group of 11 nations, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, over such trade barriers got reflected prominently in the 'Leaders' Framework Declaration on Climate Finance' adopted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Monday. The CBAM, to be implemented from next year, is a tool to impose border tax on carbon-intensive goods, such as iron & steel, aluminium and cement, that enter the 27 EU nations.Since it will impose a tariff burden on developing countries and impact their trade prospects, large exporters of such goods, including India and China, have consistently been opposing it.Condemning CBAM, the Brics nations declared that such measures are ""not in line with international law"", and said they oppose ""unilateral protectionist measures which deliberately disrupt the global supply and production chains and distort competition"".Besides flagging the EU's trade barrier, the Brics nations expressed ""serious concern"" over pre-2020 mitigation gaps for developed countries and urged them to urgently bridge the gaps between what they promised and what they have achieved in terms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The group asked the rich nations to increase their 2030 climate action targets and achieve net-zero emissions significantly ahead of 2050, preferably by 2030.Referring to the critical issue of finance that is going to dominate the climate talks (CO) in Belem, Brazil, later this year, the Brics nations called upon developed countries to meet their earlier goal of jointly mobilising $100 billion per year through 2025 to address the needs of developing countries, and achieve the finance goal of $300 billion per year by 2035.""We note that substantial gaps remain in fulfilling the financing needs identified by developing countries,"" the declaration said. The developed countries were also urged to increase their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation, doubling the amount from 2019 levels by 2025 at the least.","The Brics nations have rejected the European Union's proposed carbon border tax.

'Stop Funding Terror': Priyanka Chaturvedi Calls Out European Nations on 'Sweet' Trade Deals for Pak

NEW DELHI: Referring to the 2019 Pulwama attack , which resulted in 40 CRPF casualties, and the 2022 Gorakhnath Temple, the FATF on Tuesday said e-commerce and online payment platforms are being utilised for terrorist funding.The FATF's 'Comprehensive Update on Terrorist Financing Risks', a Global terror financing watchdog, highlighted state-sponsored terrorism, noting that various public sources and delegation inputs indicate ongoing financial and other support from several national governments to specific terrorist organisations.The FATF noted that delegations reported state sponsorship of terror financing as both a fundraising method and financial management strategy for certain terrorist organisations. Support manifested in various forms, including direct financial assistance, logistical aid, material resources, and training provisions, PTI reported.Following the April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed 26 lives, the FATF announced in June its intention to produce a detailed analysis of terrorist financing, incorporating cases from its global network of 200 jurisdictions.In an Indian case study, the FATF detailed how aluminum powder, a crucial component for an improvised explosive device, was acquired through EPOM Amazon to amplify the explosion's impact.""In February 2019, a suicide bombing targeted a convoy of Indian Security forces in Pulwama in Jammu & Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of 40 soldiers. India's authorities concluded that the attack was orchestrated by Jaish-I-Mohammed (JiM).""The investigation led to charges against 19 individuals under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, including terror financing provisions. Seven foreign nationals, including the suicide bomber, were among those charged. Law enforcement recovered related assets, including vehicles and terrorist hideouts.Indian officials have consistently highlighted Pakistan's ongoing support for terrorism and its diversion of multilateral funds for weapons procurement. Sources indicate India believes Pakistan's actions warrant its placement on the FATF's ""grey list"".The report identified terrorists' misuse of e-commerce platforms and online marketplaces for operational procurement of equipment, weapons, chemicals, and 3D-printing materials.These platforms enable terrorists to generate funds by selling items, including previously low-demand products.The FATF explained that EPOMs facilitate fund transfers through trade-based money laundering schemes. This involves purchasing items and sending them to accomplices via EPOMs for resale in different jurisdictions, using profits for terrorist financing.The report outlined methods for raising, moving, and managing terrorist funds, noting that online payment services offer greater anonymity than wire transfers, making it difficult to identify transaction participants.The report cited the April 3, 2022, Gorakhnath Temple incident where an ISIL-influenced individual attacked security personnel. The suspect transferred Rs 669,841 via PayPal internationally using VPNs and received Rs 10,323.35 from abroad.Financial investigations revealed the accused's VPN service payments and approximately 44 international third-party PayPal transactions totalling Rs 669,841 to foreign accounts. The suspect also received foreign funds through PayPal.The probe uncovered payments to multiple ISIL followers abroad supporting terrorist activities.""Due to the suspicious nature of these transactions and the potential for TF, PayPal suspended the accused's account, thereby preventing further illicit fund transfers,"" stated the FATF, citing India's finance ministry.The report noted the significant growth in Fintech payment services over the past decade, with terrorists increasingly utilising these services for their low cost, speed, and ability to obscure participants through pseudonyms or fake accounts.Europol's assessment indicates widespread use across terrorist organisations. Small cells, FTFs, and individual terrorists use P2P payment services for procuring military equipment, chemicals, and propaganda materials.The report noted EoRMT groups' use of peer-to-peer payments for selling merchandise promoting extremist ideologies, forming a key revenue source.Online payment services facilitate donations to larger organisations, particularly when integrated with social networks and content hosting services, enabling recruitment, crowdfunding, and fund transfers through a single platform.The report concluded that online payment services provide less transparency than wire transfers, complicating the identification of transaction participants.","The FATF said e-commerce and online payment platforms are being utilised for terrorist funding.

NEW DELHI: Global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has raised concerns about the exploitation of e-commerce platforms and online payment services to fund terrorist activities, citing cases from India, including the 2019 Pulwama attack , in which the Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) bought on Amazon a chemical that was added to the RDX used to kill CRPF troopers.In a report, FATF also said the lone accused in the 2022 attack on security personnel at UP's Gorakhnath temple had transferred funds to the Islamic State using PayPal.These cases, it said, illustrated the growing trend of terrorists leveraging online platforms to facilitate their activities. On the Pulwama attack in J&K, the report said, ""Investigations revealed the cross-border movement of a large quantity of explosives into India. Notably, a key component of the improvised explosive device used in the attack - aluminium powder-was procured through EPOM Amazon, an ad network. This material was used to enhance the impact of the blast.""During its investigation, NIA had probed an accused named Waiz-ul-Islam and found that he had used his Amazon account to procure chemicals for making IEDs, batteries and other accessories on the directions of Pakistani JeM terrorists.""He personally delivered the items to JeM terrorists after procuring the incriminating material online as a part of the conspiracy to carry out the Pulwama attack,"" NIA had said in its chargesheet. ""Accused Sajjad Bhat had purchased a Maruti Eeco car for the purpose of carrying out the IED attack,"" it added.This chargesheet, filed in a special court in Jammu, named JeM chief Moulana Masood Azhar, his two brothers Rouf Asgar and Ammar Alvi, suicide bomber Adil Ahmed Dar and 15 others as accused.On the temple attack, the FATF report said, ""On April 3, 2022, the accused individual attacked security personnel at Gorakhnath Temple, influenced by the Islamic State's ideology,"" the report said.As per FATF, the accused had been using a VPN for calling, chatting and downloading to evade detection, and had made 44 payments while using third-party transactions.",FATF has raised concerns about the exploitation of e-commerce platforms and online payment services to fund terrorist activities.

NEW DELHI: India and China were among 12 countries that abstained in UN General Assembly from voting on a resolution on Afghanistan, seeking political inclusion and urging Taliban to reverse its repressive policies resulting in the ""grave, worsening, widespread and systematic oppression"" of all women and girls. The 193-member UNGA adopted the draft resolution introduced by Germany with 116 votes in favour, two against (US and Israel) and 12 abstentions.Explaining its abstention, India cited Kabul's strong condemnation of the Pahalgam attack, and said a coherent policy to address a post-conflict situation must be a mix of policy instruments: incentivising positive behaviour and disincentivising harmful actions.Pakistan, which has had a turbulent relationship with Taliban in recent times, voted in favour. On the contrary, India's ties with the Taliban have improved dramatically even in the absence of a formal recognition by New Delhi of the regime in Kabul, as evident from foreign minister S Jaishankar's recent contact over phone with Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. ""An approach focused only on punitive measures, in our view, is unlikely to succeed. The United Nations and the broader international community have adopted more balanced and nuanced approaches in other post-conflict contexts.However, no new policy instruments have been introduced to address the worsening humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan since Aug 2021,"" said P Harish, India's permanent representative to the UN. ""A 'business as usual' approach, without new and targeted initiatives, is unlikely to deliver the outcomes the international community envisions for the Afghan people,"" he added.""While we remain committed to continued engagement with all relevant stakeholders and broadly support the international community's efforts towards a stable, peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan, India has decided to abstain on this resolution,"" said Harish in his statement, while calling upon the international community to work together for an Afghanistan free of terrorist activities.""The international community must direct its coordinated efforts towards ensuring that entities and individuals designated by the UN Security Council, the Al Qaeda and their affiliates, ISIL and their affiliates, including Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, along with their regional sponsors who facilitate their operations, no longer exploit the Afghan territory for terrorist activities,"" said the ambassador.According to a UN News report, the UNGA resolution called on Taliban to swiftly reverse policies that exclude women from education, employment and public life.

UAE Golden Visa : Has a Rs 23 Lakh Visa Been Launched?

UAE Golden Visa Confusion

UAE Golden Visa Route For Indians

Has the UAE launched a new golden visa pilot programme? Reports about UAE launching a pilot programme for a new golden visa have created excitement on social media. However, visa consultants and applicants are confused due to lack of official announcements, leading to doubt and frustration.The possibility of obtaining a permanent visa to relocate to Dubai, a highly sought-after destination, for the cost equivalent to a mid-range SUV, appeared unrealistic. Indeed, this might be the case, according to an ET report.A prominent Dubai-based golden visa consultant confirms that UAE officials have not announced any modifications to Golden Visa regulations permitting Indian nationals to obtain a lifetime Golden Visa for AED 100,000.While Indian media outlets have extensively covered the news about UAE's new golden visa pilot, there has been no coverage in UAE media outlets or the Emirates News Agency, which typically publishes all official announcements.The story has gained significant traction on Indian social media platforms, as affluent Indian citizens have shown keen interest in investment visas and residency programmes in recent years.Nomination-based visa schemes, despite being contentious, have become a preferred option for wealthy families worldwide seeking relocation opportunities for various reasons including taxation, quality of life, and educational prospects.Speaking to ET from Dubai via telephone, Iqbal Marconi, former chief executive of ECH Group (recognised by Khaleej Times as the region's principal golden visa facilitator), mentioned receiving numerous enquiries from India following the circulation of this information.""I checked with the authorities here, and they say they have no such information. So, the news is likely to be untrue. The only new update they have is that crypto investors won't be considered for the Golden Visa scheme.”“I checked with the GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs Dubai) also, they too said they don't have any information on this. I also checked with a couple of officials here who are in the same line of work, they also said they don't have any information in this regard,” he added.The speculation originated from a PTI wire service report, which was extensively shared, suggesting UAE was testing a new category of golden visa specifically for India and Bangladesh. The report indicated a substantial reduction in financial requirements from approximately Rs 4 crore investment to Rs 23 lakh, stating this nomination-based visa was being trialled exclusively for Indian and Bangladeshi citizens.The article references Rayad Kamal Ayub, MD of Rayad group, a consultancy that recently introduced an advisory programme for UAE golden visa in collaboration with VFS Global, serving India and Bangladesh.However, the nomination-based pathway, which acknowledges an individual's economic contribution potential to the UAE without requiring financial investment, has been available since the golden visa programme's inception in 2019, with approvals solely determined by UAE authorities.""Nomination-based UAE golden visa with no investment requirement is not new at all. Many of us working in this space have helped our clients get such visas and continue to do so. There has been no intimation from any official sources that any policy change has happened with regard to the UAE golden visa,"" Rajneesh Pathak of Mumbai-based residency and citizenship consultant Golden North was quoted as saying by the financial daily.The UAE golden visa programme includes options through property investments and business establishment that generate employment. This investment route, requiring AED 2 million (equivalent to Rs 4.66 crore), enabled Dubai property developers to promote premium properties as ""Golden Visa eligible"".Any relaxation in visa regulations could influence this sector's performance.Indians constitute approximately 7-8% of annual Dubai property transactions, primarily driven by Golden Visa aspirations, which will experience changes. The property market dynamics, including supply and pricing strategies, will undergo adjustments, according to Ritesh Mehta, senior director, residential services, JLL India.The UAE government has not officially commented, though relevant authorities have confirmed the Golden Visa programme remains under government regulation.A senior official, speaking anonymously, emphasised that UAE visas are not available for purchase. The government may grant Golden Visas based on various criteria, including AED 2 million real estate investments, business ownership, and notable achievements in science, medicine, arts, culture, media, and sports.An official communication clarified that all applications, including those from authorised agents, undergo thorough government scrutiny, with UAE authorities retaining exclusive decision-making authority. The Vision Dubai 2033 strategy aims to double the UAE economy, acknowledging population growth as essential for achieving this objective.The Gulf nation may consider expanding its visa policies for high-income individuals from various countries in the future. However, there is limited evidence suggesting such changes have already been implemented.","UAE Golden Visa: Has a Rs 23 Lakh Visa Been Launched?

Dwight Howard’s $200M empire at risk as wife files for divorce without prenup

Just six months after getting married to the NBA legend Dwight Howard, Amber Rose Howard, also known as Amy Luciani, filed for divorce on Monday, July 7, 2025. According to a report by EURWeb, irreconcilable issues were the cause of their divorce. She further requested that all marital goods and assets be ""equitably divided"" as per the laws. She asked for alimony as well.According to court records that TMZ Sports was able to get, on July 1, the reality star went to a Georgia judge and asked for a divorce from the basketball player. As stated by Amy Howard in the document:""The marriage is irretrievably broken… There are no prospects for reconciliation.""Additionally, she seemed to have deleted all ties to the NBA legend from her social media accounts. Their relationship has been scrutinised and trending on social media since the much-publicised problems with the player's ex-partner. Royce Reed, Dwight Howard 's ex-girlfriend, allegedly accused him of verbal, physical, and emotional abuse in an Instagram post, according to a report in Vibe.The ongoing controversy surrounding Dwight's lawsuit, in which he acknowledged having s*x with men, also caused a sensation. The internet was in a frenzy over the astonishing court confessions made in that lawsuit. It was filed by a guy who accused Dwight of s*xual assault. Dwight denied the assault and maintained that the actions were consensual, but the whole thing exposed his private life.The Detroit-born rapper kept her relationship with Dwight Howard a secret until formally announcing their engagement in December 2024.On Instagram, Amy Luciani shared the news. In a since-deleted post with a video, she flaunted her diamond engagement ring while out at a club with her partner. In the group of pictures taken at the time, they were both wearing diamond rings.Meanwhile, Dwight Howard now might find himself in a tight spot financially since Amy Luciani has filed for divorce. Without a prenuptial agreement in effect, Georgia courts may decide that his soon-to-be ex-wife will receive a fair share of the assets. She might also continue getting the financial help mentioned in the paperwork. The stakes are very high given the player’s lengthy NBA career, which included contracts worth over $200 million.Also read: Kevin Durant and Steve Nash revealed big issues with small guards in modern NBA games","Amber Rose Howard, also known as Amy Luciani, filed for divorce on Monday, July 7, 2025.

What is the Einstein visa? How Melania Trump qualified for a visa reserved for Nobel-level talent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-einstein-visa-how-melania-trump-qualified-for-a-visa-reserved-for-nobel-level-talent/articleshow/122204926.cms,"

What is the EB-1 or 'Einstein' visa?

How did Melania Trump qualify for the Einstein visa?

The larger debate: Loopholes, privilege, and policy





When Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the “Einstein visa,” in 2001, it raised eyebrows and continues to stir debate. Reserved for individuals with “extraordinary ability” in fields such as science, arts, education, business, or athletics, the EB-1 green card is typically associated with Nobel laureates, Olympic medalists, or globally recognized experts. Melania, a Slovenian model at the time, was not widely known for groundbreaking accomplishments, prompting questions about how she met the high bar required. So, what exactly is the Einstein visa, and how did the former First Lady qualify for a program meant for the world’s best and brightest?The EB-1 visa is a US employment-based green card designed for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in specific fields, or who are recognized as outstanding professors, researchers, or multinational executives. Applicants must prove “sustained national or international acclaim” and either win a major international award (like a Nobel Prize) or meet at least three of ten criteria set by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). These include published work, media recognition, contributions to a field of major significance, or commanding a high salary compared to others in the same field.While the standards are rigorous, the process is subjective.Immigration officers ultimately decide if the evidence supports a claim of extraordinary ability. This subjectivity has sparked debate over how consistently the criteria are applied and who benefits most from its loopholes.Melania Trump, then known as Melania Knauss, was living in New York as a model when she applied for the EB-1 visa in 2000. It was approved the following year. Though she was featured in magazines and had some runway experience, she had not received prestigious modeling awards or reached the supermodel status typically associated with international acclaim. Critics argue her qualifications were modest compared to the visa's intent.Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett recently reignited the controversy, questioning whether Melania’s case truly exemplifies merit-based immigration. Her approval has drawn comparisons to other questionable EB-1 recipients, including Playboy models and niche artists who managed to craft narratives aligning with the visa’s requirements.Experts note that while the visa is often seen as exclusive, it can be awarded to applicants whose accomplishments, though not widely known, are well-documented and strategically framed within a narrow field. In Melania’s case, her successful petition may have emphasized uniqueness in her modeling niche, media presence, or professional trajectory.The EB-1 program, limited to around 40,000 visas annually, has been praised for attracting top global talent. But its subjective evaluation process has also made it vulnerable to exploitation. Legal experts and immigration attorneys admit that certain applicants with the right legal guidance can tailor their portfolios to meet the criteria, even without widely celebrated achievements.Adding to the irony, Melania later used her citizenship to sponsor her parents for green cards through “chain migration,” a policy her husband, Donald Trump, has publicly opposed. This contradiction has further politicized her immigration journey and raised broader questions about fairness, privilege, and transparency in the US immigration system.","Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the ‘Einstein visa,’ in 2001.

Health concerns drive policy shift in Indian IT sector

India's second-largest IT services company Infosys has begun sending personalized warning emails to employees who exceed standard working hours, directly contradicting founder N.R. Narayana Murthy 's recent advocacy for a 70-hour workweek. The Bengaluru-based firm has implemented an automated monitoring system that triggers alerts when employees work beyond 9 hours and 15 minutes daily.""We must work for 9.15 hours a day for five days a week, and if we overshoot this while working remotely, it prompts a trigger,"" an employee told The Economic Times. The company's HR department now tracks remote working hours monthly, sending detailed notifications to staff members who exceed prescribed durations.The monitoring system was introduced following hybrid working arrangements for Infosys's 323,500 employees. When excessive hours are detected, HR sends comprehensive notifications including information about remote working days, total hours worked, and daily averages. The company's workplace policy, implemented in November 2023, requires staff to be present in office for minimum 10 days monthly.""While we appreciate your commitment, we also believe that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial for both your well-being and long-term professional success,"" states the HR communication reviewed by financial dailies. The emails emphasize that prioritizing health and work-life balance benefits both personal wellbeing and professional success.This initiative emerges amid growing concerns about young tech professionals facing health challenges, particularly cardiac issues attributed to irregular dietary and rest patterns. The company's guidance includes specific recommendations: ""Take regular breaks during your workday; Let your manager know if you are feeling overwhelmed or need support with reviewing priorities.""The policy represents a significant departure from Murthy's recent statements calling for Indians to work 70 hours weekly to accelerate economic growth. The move reflects evolving workplace norms in Indian IT sector , where employee mental health and sustainable productivity are gaining prominence over extended working hours.","Infosys has implemented an automated monitoring system that triggers alerts when employees work beyond 9 hours and 15 minutes daily.

Microsoft plans third round of layoffs this year



Poll Do you support Microsoft’s decision to lay off employees in the sales division? No Yes

Microsoft is preparing to eliminate thousands of jobs primarily tatgetting its sales division. Microsoft is expected to announce the layoffs early this month as the company continues its restructuring amid massive AI investments. Now just ahead of the fresh round of layoffs, Microsoft’s top sales executive Judson Althoff is stepping away for an eight-week sabbatical.As reported by Bloomberg, the company has confirmed Judson Althoff’s sabbatical. Judson Althoff who works as the chief commercial officer will resume his role in September after Microsoft will close the fiscal year. A company spokesperson told Bloomeberg that the sabbatical was planned and aligned with the company’s internal calendar, stating, “He will be back with his team in September.”This move of Judson Althoff’s sabbatical comes as Microsoft is planning to layoffs thousands of employees, particularly from the sales and marketing division . The layoffs will mark the third major workforce reduction this year for the Redmond-based tech giant, following 6,000 cuts in May and over 300 additional eliminations just weeks later. Bloomberg first reported the planned summer layoffs, with sources indicating the timing coincides with the start of Microsoft's new fiscal year beginning in July.Unlike previous rounds that primarily affected software engineers and product developers, the upcoming cuts will disproportionately target customer-facing roles. Microsoft's sales and marketing division employs approximately 45,000 of the company's 228,000 total workforce as of June 2024.The company signaled this shift in April this year when it announced plans to use third-party firms to handle more software sales to small and mid-sized customers. Sources told Bloomberg the reductions won't exclusively affect sales teams, though they will bear the brunt of the cuts.","Microsoft's top sales executive Judson Althoff is stepping away for an eight- week sabbatical.

ELON MUSK Forms New 'AMERICA PARTY', Declares War On Trump & Republicans | US News

James Fishback letter to Tesla Board slamming Elon Musk

Elon has gone too far.

My investment firm (@InvestAzoria) has decided to postpone next week's public listing of our Azoria Tesla Convexity ETF.

Our decision comes in direct response to @ElonMusk’s announcement that he is launching a new national political party.

This creates a conflict with his full-time responsibilities as CEO of Tesla. It diverts his focus and energy away from Tesla’s employees and shareholders.

Azoria believes that Tesla is the most compelling long-term investment in AI. With breakthroughs in robotaxis, Optimus, and full self-driving, no other company is positioned to lead the future like Tesla.

In May, when Elon stepped back from his work at DOGE and returned his attention to Tesla, we were encouraged. With Elon fully engaged, he gave shareholders renewed confidence in Tesla’s future.

Elon's announcement today undermines that confidence.

Unlike his work with SpaceX or xAI, which complement Tesla’s R&D efforts in AI, automation, and engineering, a political party not only fails to complement Tesla’s mission—it actively undermines it.

I just sent the attached letter to Robyn Denholm, Chair of Tesla's Board of Directors.

I encourage the Board to meet immediately and ask Elon to clarify his political ambitions and evaluate whether they are compatible with his full-time obligations to Tesla as CEO.

I remain hopeful that Elon will return his full attention to Tesla. If not, I trust the Board will take appropriate action.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants Elon Musk to worry about his companies, not politics

Former DOGE adviser James Fishback seems very upset with Tesla CEO Elon Musk's decision to start a new political party. Last week, Elon Musk made the announcement a day after polling his followers on the social media platform Twitter, declaring, ""Today the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom."" Slamming Musk's plans to create political party, Fishback has sent an open letter to Tesla Board. The letter urges Tesla board members to ask Elon Musk to clarify his political ambitions. ""I encourage the Board to meet immediately and ask Elon Musk to clarify his political ambitions and evaluate whether they are compatible with his full-time obligations to Tesla as CEO,"" Fishback wrote.Fishback added that the announcement undermines the confidence shareholders had in Tesla's future after Musk said in May he was stepping back from his role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He added that his investment firm Azoria Partners will defer the listing of its Azoria Texla Convexity exchange-traded fund due to Elon Musk's announcement. Azoria was set to launch the Tesla ETF, which would invest in the electric vehicle company's shares and options, next week.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the Tesla and SpaceX boss focus on business and not politics. When asked by CNN if Elon Musk's plan bothered the Donald Trump administration, Bessent offered a thinly veiled criticism. ""I believe that the boards of directors at his various companies wanted him to come back and run those companies, which he is better at than anyone,"" Bessent said.""So I imagine that those board of directors did not like this announcement yesterday and will be encouraging him to focus on his business activities, not his political activities."" Bessent went on to add that the principles of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk ran for several months as part of Trump's drive to slash government spending and jobs, were ""very popular.""",Former DOGE adviser James Fishback has sent an open letter to Tesla Board.

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says the companies that best leverage artificial intelligence won't use it to replace human developers, but instead will dramatically increase their engineering hiring to capitalize on AI-enhanced productivity gains.""The companies that are the smartest are going to hire more developers,"" Dohmke said in a recent podcast interview. ""Because if you 10x a single developer, then 10 developers can do 100x.""The GitHub CEO argues that AI serves as a powerful multiplier for engineering talent rather than a replacement, making individual developers significantly more efficient while creating demand for additional skilled professionals. He believes current industry layoffs and hiring freezes represent a temporary market adjustment as companies figure out AI's true potential.Dohmke emphasized that while AI has made programming more accessible to beginners and streamlined workflows for experienced developers, it hasn't eliminated the need for deep technical expertise in business environments. He dismissed the notion that AI alone can build billion-dollar companies without substantial coding knowledge.""I think the idea that AI without any coding skills lets you just build a billion-dollar business is mistaken,"" he said. ""Because if that would be the case, everyone would do it.""Rather than draining development backlogs, Dohmke observed that AI has actually generated more work by enabling teams to tackle previously impossible projects. He hasn't seen any companies completely eliminate developer workloads , even as AI accelerates project completion.The GitHub CEO called this the ""most exciting time"" to be a developer, noting that AI has brought closer the long-held dream of transforming Sunday morning ideas into functioning mobile apps by end of the day.","GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says companies that best leverage artificial intelligence won't use it to replace human developers.

RAIPUR: The Chhattisgarh High Court has dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking directions to the state government to permit cultivation and development of an ecosystem for industrial hemp/cannabis. The court observed that the petition, filed by Dr. Sachin Ashok Kale, appeared to have a ""personal gain, private motive and oblique motive"" and was an attempt to get permission for commercial transactions of cannabis products.Chief Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Bibhu Datta Guru, while hearing the petition, noted the significant increase in the consumption of narcotic and psychotropic substances across Chhattisgarh in recent years. The bench stated that such consumption has ""evil effects on the body and mind of the person consuming it, but it ruins the entire family and society as well.""The court emphasised that offences related to contraband and psychotropic substances are on the rise in the state, with numerous instances of crimes committed by individuals under the influence, leading to incarceration and hardship for their families.“Courts cannot direct the Government to make policy decisions, particularly in sensitive areas like narcotic control,” the order stated, adding that the petition amounted to a “misuse of judicial process,” the Division Bench stated.Dr. Kale, appearing in person, argued that industrial hemp, with its low tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content (0.3 to 1.5%), is not psychoactive and has various industrial, medical, and environmental benefits. He cited permissions for hemp cultivation in other states like Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, as well as its historical and cultural significance in India. He also referred to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) notification regarding hemp seed and oil, and the Ministry of Ayush guidelines for hemp oil in medicines.The petitioner contended that the Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, permits mass cultivation of hemp for horticultural and industrial uses, but the Chhattisgarh government has not framed rules to facilitate its medical or industrial use.Opposing the petition, the state government's advocate, Sangharsh Pandey, argued that the PIL was an attempt by the petitioner to secure permission for cannabis cultivation and commercial transactions.The High Court, in its order, reiterated the importance of preserving the ""purity and sanctity"" of PILs, stating that genuine public interest litigations must be encouraged while discouraging frivolous ones. The bench cited previous Supreme Court judgments on the misuse of PILs, highlighting that courts should verify the credentials of petitioners and ensure the PIL aims to address genuine public harm or injury, without personal gain or ulterior motives.The court stated, ""Under the garb of this public interest litigation petition, this Court cannot encourage any such activity nor issue any direction to the State, which may turn out to be a disaster in future. The reasons assigned by the petitioner to permit cultivation of cannabis in the State of Chhattisgarh are totally frivolous and baseless.""The bench concluded that Dr. Kale lacked locus standi and the petition was not a genuine public interest litigation. It observed that courts cannot direct governments to make policy decisions, particularly in sensitive areas like narcotic control, which fall within the domain of the legislative and executive branches. The court also noted that cannabis cultivation is generally prohibited under the NDPS Act, except for specific permitted purposes with government authorisation.The High Court dismissed the petition and forfeited the security amount deposited by the petitioner.","Chhattisgarh High Court dismisses a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking directions to the state government to permit cultivation of industrial hemp/cannabis.

MUMBAI: Mahim Samaritan and World Memon Organisation (WMO) Mumbai president Haji Mudassar Patel celebrated his birthday on July 9 by distributing college textbooks free among needy students.Accompanied by former minister Anees Ahmed, WMO India chapter president Haseen Aghadi, a senior functionary in WMO Ehsan Gadawala and a few other friends, Patel cut a cake at a simple function but used the occasion to underline the value of education.""I too could have thrown a birthday party at a five-star hotel, but I chose to use the money to buy books for poor students.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Wednesday amidst ongoing uncertainty on Donald Trump’s tariff moves. While Nifty50 was below 25,500, BSE Sensex was down over 100 points. At 9:18 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,497.85, down 25 points or 0.097%.

President Trump’s latest declarations of 50% tariffs on copper imports, 10% tariffs for just being in BRICS, no further extension of the August 1st deadline and a potential 200 % tariffs on pharmaceutical imports with a grace period of one year …are all not taken seriously by the markets since Trump has a track record of chickening out and changing his announcements. In brief the markets are waiting for clarity to emerge on the trade front.Therefore, Nifty is likely to continue in the range in which it has been trading.”“Perhaps, more important from the market perspective in the near-term will be the Q1 results. Midcaps are likely to continue with the earnings growth momentum of Q4 FY25. Largecaps are likely to slowly improve earnings growth, but nothing dramatic is on the cards.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Shaquille O’Neal left “upset” as $10 billion Lakers deal moves forward without a nod to his legacy



The Los Angeles Lakers were sold in a record-breaking $10 billion deal to billionaire Mark Walter. While the sale has sparked excitement and optimism in some corners, it left one Lakers legend feeling completely blindsided, or at least, unhappy. Shaquille O’Neal, who was one of the architects of the franchise's modern legacy, openly expressed his frustration over being left out of the picture.For more than four decades, the Los Angeles Lakers were synonymous with the Buss family, who bought the franchise in 1979 for just $67.5 million. Under Jerry Buss, and later his daughter Jeanie, the Lakers captured 11 championships and became one of the most glamorous names in professional sports.But the torch has now passed. Jeanie Buss and her siblings have agreed to sell a majority stake in the team to Mark Walter— CEO of TWG Global and co-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers— while keeping a 15% share and Jeanie staying on as governor.But for Shaquille O’Neal, the transaction stirred up something else entirely.“You know, I’m a little upset,” O’Neal said on The Big Podcast. “The Lakers got sold for $10 billion, and I ain’t getting no dually, I ain’t getting no brand escalade, I ain’t getting nothing.”Walter’s acquisition, reportedly worth $10 billion, marks the most expensive franchise sale in U.S. sports history, overtaking even the Boston Celtics' $6.1 billion deal earlier this year. For Jeanie, the sale was a move grounded in trust and legacy. “Now she can comfortably pass the baton to Mark Walter,” said Lakers icon Magic Johnson. “She’s witnessed him build a winning team with the Dodgers and knows that Mark will do right by the Lakers team, organization, and fans!”Also Read: Caitlin Clark delivers surprise answer when asked about her future with the Indiana Fever From a business angle, Mark Walter's growing sports empire includes teams like the WNBA’s Sparks, Premier League’s Chelsea, and the Cadillac Formula 1 racing team. But amid all the buzz and billions, the emotions of legends like Shaquille O’Neal show that the franchise should recognize the legends and valuable players who helped shape one of the biggest NBA teams. Regardless, not much change is expected as Jeanie will remain a governor of the organization, continuing the steady operation.","Shaquille O'Neal left ""upset"" as $10 billion Lakers deal moves forward without a nod to his legacy.
