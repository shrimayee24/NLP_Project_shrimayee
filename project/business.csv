What is UCC and what is its significance??

UCC criticism

What is the implementation process?

NEW DELHI: Uttarakhand is set to make history on Monday by becoming the first state in post-independence India to implement the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami will officially launch the UCC portal and issue a notification marking the adoption of the civil code, following the completion of government employee training, mock drills, and dry-run sessions.""The UCC's implementation represents a significant milestone, making the Himalayan state the first in the country to adopt this progressive legislation since independence,"" Dhami said.CM Dhami said that the UCC was drafted after extensive consultations with experts, locals, and representatives from various communities, with the goal of bringing uniformity in society and empowering women.The UCC addresses various societal issues, including marriage, divorce, inheritance, and live-in relationships. Key aspects of the law include the registration of marriages, divorces, and live-in relationships to ensure equal property rights and protect children's rights, with penalties for non-compliance.UCC is a set of laws that aims to standardise personal laws across religions. The move has sparked both support and criticism, with proponents arguing for equality and opponents warning of potential societal divisions.The UCC clarifies legal requirements for marriage, stating that only mentally capable individuals aged 21 (for men) or 18 (for women) who are not already married may enter into a union. Marriages can be performed according to religious customs, but registration will be mandatory to ensure legal recognition.The law also addresses issues related to the creation and cancellation of wills and codicils under testamentary succession. Marriages solemnized before March 26, 2010, or those outside the state will be eligible for registration if legal requirements are met.Opposition leaders have criticized the UCC, arguing that it may lead to societal division along religious lines and might be impractical and overly ambitious.The debate surrounding the UCC extends beyond Uttarakhand, as Article 44 of the Indian Constitution advocates for a uniform civil code across the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has referenced the Supreme Court's direction on the need for a common code, stressing that fulfilling the vision of the Constitution's framers remains a national goal.Uttarakhand's implementation of the UCC is likely to set a precedent, with other states potentially following suit. The success of the law's implementation will depend on its ability to balance individual rights and social harmony.As Uttarakhand stands at the forefront of this legal revolution, the coming weeks will offer a clearer picture of how the UCC will be received, both in the state and across India. The state's experience with the UCC will undoubtedly shape the future of personal law reform in the country.Shailesh Bagauli, secretary (home), stated that the government will issue two notifications: one for the implementation of the UCC and another for the rules and regulations, officially launching the UCC in the state.Dhami had promised to implement the UCC if re-elected during the 2022 state polls. After becoming CM, he appointed a five-member committee led by Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai to draft the code, which received feedback from over 2.3 lakh people, representing nearly 10% of Uttarakhand's families.The 740-page draft was presented to the chief minister on February 2, 2024, approved by the cabinet on February 4, tabled in the assembly on February 6, and passed the following day. Governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (retd) approved the bill on February 28 and President Droupadi Murmu subsequently signed it on March 11.","UCC is a set of laws that aims to standardise personal laws across religions.

No, It’s a Isolated Incident Yes, It Needs Immediate Attention

GBS treatment very expensive, each injection costs Rs 20,000

Ajit Pawar announces free treatment for GBS

PUNE: The Maharashtra health department reported Sunday what is suspected to be the first death linked to the Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) outbreak concentrated in Pune as the caseload spiked to 101 with 28 more confirmed infections, based on updated surveillance data, reports Steffy Thevar. The daily bulletin said the suspected GBS death occurred in Solapur but did not give details.Sixteen of the patients diagnosed with this rare but treatable condition are currently on ventilator support. Around 19 of those with symptoms are below nine, while the 50-80 age group accounts for 23 cases.A patient hospitalised on Jan 9 is suspected to be the first GBS case within the Pune cluster. Tests have revealed the Campylobacter jejuni bacteria in some biological samples drawn from hospitalised patients. C Jejuni causes about a third of all GBS cases worldwide and is also responsible for the most severe infections.Authorities are sampling Pune's water, especially in areas that are reporting cases. Test results released Saturday showed that a well near Khadakwasla Dam, Pune's main water reservoir, had high levels of the bacterium E. coli. But officials said it was unclear if the well was being used at all. Residents have been advised to boil water and heat their food before consumption.Health department officials said 25,578 homes had been surveyed till Sunday as part of a surveillance exercise meant to find more patients within the community and pinpoint the trigger for the surge in GBS cases, which otherwise don’t exceed more than two a month.GBS occurs when the body’s immune system, while reacting to a bacterial or viral infection, mistakenly attacks the nerves that carry brain signals to parts of the body, leading to weakness, paralysis or other symptoms. Doctors said 80% of affected patients regain their ability to walk without assistance within six months of hospital discharge, but some may take up to a year or more to regain full use of their limbs. GBS treatment is also very expensive.Patients will typically need a course of immunoglobulin (IVIG) injections. A family TOI spoke to earlier said their 68-year-old relative, who was admitted on Jan 16, needed an IVIG course of 13 injections, with each shot costing about Rs 20,000.Three major hospitals in the city sent out alerts to local health authorities earlier this week after they found a higher-than-usual number of GBS patients —26 on Jan 10 — among newly admitted patients. By Friday, the number soared to 73.Speaking about rising cases in Pune, Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar announced, “The treatment is expensive. After discussions with officials from the district administration and municipal corporation, we have decided to provide free treatment. Those from Pimpri-Chinchwad will be treated at YCM Hospital, while patients from Pune Municipal Corporation areas will receive treatment at Kamla Nehru Hospital. For citizens from rural areas, free treatment will be provided at Sassoon Hospital in Pune.”",Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) cases in Pune have spiked to 101 with 28 more confirmed infections. 16 of the patients diagnosed with this rare but treatable condition are currently on ventilator support.

Poll Is Compensation Necessary for Passengers Facing Inconvenience? No, It’s Not Sufficient Yes, It’s Fair for Affected Passengers

CHENNAI: An elderly couple's traumatic experience aboard a 10-hour Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt, where they endured wet seats and dripping water for a large part of the journey, has led to a Chennai court penalising the airline for deficient service. The ordeal extended beyond the flight, with delays and mishandling disrupting their journey and causing financial and emotional distress.Joju Dominic, 69, and his wife Jasmine, 65, had booked round-trip tickets from Chennai to Vancouver via Frankfurt for Rs 3.5 lakh. Their trouble began on June 12, 2023, when their Chennai-Frankfurt flight was delayed by 90 minutes for cleaning, leaving them waiting in the aerobridge.Upon boarding, they discovered their seats were soaked, with water dripping from the overhead compartment. Joju claimed they received no help, and a cabin crew even threatened to deplane him when he complained. ""The staff blamed the issue on Chennai's climate and suggested we use a blanket to deal with the dripping water,"" he said. After prolonged inconvenience, they were offered alternative seats.At Frankfurt airport, delays and lack of priority assistance caused them to miss their connecting Air Canada flight to Vancouver. Following arguments with airline staff, they were eventually accommodated on a later flight, but the delay caused them to miss their scheduled ferry in Canada.The return journey was equally harrowing. Shortly after take-off, the aircraft reported a fuel leakage and returned to Frankfurt. At Frankfurt airport on Oct 3, 2023, the couple was directed to a service centre, where Joju alleged they were treated harshly. Despite their age, their request for accommodation till the rescheduled flight was initially denied. Later, they had to walk nearly 2km to reach the lodging as they were also denied pre-booked wheelchair assistance.Joju alleged inadequate meal provisions during the delay and said they ran out of essential medicines.The couple sought Rs 3.5 lakh in compensation, equivalent to the cost of their tickets. The airline was ordered to pay Rs 55,000 for mental agony and legal costs. The commission said alternative arrangements were provided to the couple, which justified the limited compensation. Dissatisfied with the ruling, Joju has appealed to the state consumer commission, seeking higher compensation for their ordeal.","Joju Dominic, 69, and his wife Jasmine, 65, had booked round-trip tickets from Chennai to Vancouver via Frankfurt for Rs 3.5 lakh.

‘Brain’ loss puts Reds in leadership crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/brain-loss-puts-reds-in-leadership-crisis/articleshow/117584754.cms,"(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: The number of alive and active CPI (Maoist) politburo members, as per documents maintained by Chhattisgarh police, has depleted to barely four - general secretary Namballa Keshava Rao alias Basavraju, Mupalla Laxman Rao alias Ganpathy, Mallajulla Venugopal Rao alias Sonu, and Misir Besra - from 16 in 2004 on account of killings, arrests, surrenders and deaths due to illnesses.While Keshava Rao is around 67 years old, Ganpathy is a ripe 75, Sonu 62, and Besra 64.The other key decision-making body of the CPI (Maoist) - central committee - now comprises no more than 11-12 active members, as per Chhattisgarh police documents accessed by TOI. Apart from the four politburo members who are also members of the central committee, the documents mention Thippari Tirupathi alias Devji (64); Kadari Satyanarayana Reddy alias Kosa (72), Ganesh Uike (60) and Pullari Prasad Rao alias Chandranna (60) as its active and alive members. Patiram Manjhi alias Anil da, believed to be in hiding in Jharkhand, Modem Balakrishna and Gajarla Ravi, all central committee members, somehow do not figure in the Chhattisgarh police's list of ""active/alive"" top Maoist leaders.A senior officer of the central intelligence establishment said the CPI(Maoist) central committee undergoes new additions from time to time, with some leaders getting added by virtue of being in charge of special zonal committees and state committees. However, these are mostly armed, military-trained tribal commanders with little or no education, unlike the old leadership that had kept the Naxal movement alive with their ideological heft and commitment derived from high education in institutions like REC, Warangal, and a well-read background.According to the officer, more than the loss of Maoist boots on the ground in stepped-up operations, what may be dealing a body blow to Left-wing extremism is the 'brain' loss on account of advanced age, arrests, killing and natural deaths of top CPI(Maoist) leaders. The second-rung leadership largely comprises members high on guerrilla tactics and mostly hailing from Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, but low on ideological thought.Over the years, several politburo members have died due to illness or have been arrested and even expelled by the CPI(Maoist). For instance, Prashant Bose alias Kishen Da was arrested in 2021, while Katakam Sudharshan died of illness in 2023. Kobad Gandhy was arrested in 2019, but he was expelled from the party. Pramod Mishra too was arrested in 2023 and Sumanand, last year. Much earlier, Cherukuri Rajkumar alias Azad was killed in 2010 and Mallojula Koteshwara Rao alias Kishen ji in 2011. Sushil Rao and Narayan Sanyal died of illness in 2014 and 2017, respectively.The central committee has shrunk from 32 members in 2004, including 16 politburo members. Non-politburo members who died include Ramanna (2019), Yapa Narayan (2021), Bansindhar Singh (2020), Akkiraju Rajgopal (2021), Lakhmu (2021), and Mallaraji Reddy (2023). Members killed in anti-Naxal operations include Deepak 'Milind' Teltumbde in Gadchiroli in (2021), and recently, Ramachandra Reddy in Chhattisgarh.

When and where to watch in India?

Skywatchers are in for a celestial treat as six planets—Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—align in a rare astronomical phenomenon. This spectacular display will be visible from January 21 to January 31.An official told the news agency PTI, that Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn will be visible to the naked eye, creating a stunning formation in the evening sky.The official explained that while Mars, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn will create a visible spectacle observable without equipment, viewing Neptune and Uranus will require optical aids such as binoculars or telescopes.Parade of planets is a phrase people use when two or more planets are visible in the night sky. However, Nasa has specified that it is not an astronomical term. So why is the term is used?The presence of bright planets like Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Venus in a single viewing makes this particular event particularly rare and distinctive. Jupiter shines brightly, while Venus and Mars are reaching their peak brilliance in the post-sunset sky for the first time in years.With Saturn still prominently visible and Mercury making occasional appearances, four or five planets can easily be spotted with the naked eye, creating a captivating celestial spectacle.Space.com explains that all planets in our solar system follow orbital paths around the sun along a specific plane known as the ecliptic. This results in planets appearing in a linear formation when viewed from Earth. Although these linear arrangements are regular occurrences in our sky, they are typically classified as planetary alignments.In India, astronomers across India have prepared for events where people can witness the planets. However, if one can’t attend an organized session, several apps can guide you in exploring the night sky on your own.The Tamil Nadu Science and Technology Centre (TNSTC) had organised a special night sky observation for the public at Periyar Science and Technology Centre in Kottupuram from Jan 22 to 25 (from 6pm to 8pm).""You can see Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars from your terrace or from the beach. Mars will rise around 9pm,"" said I K Lenin Tamilkovan, executive director, TNSTC.The Department of Science and Technology's Pathani Samanta Planetarium in Bhubaneswar has established suitable facilities to accommodate astronomy enthusiasts for this event.The official confirmed that visitors can observe this uncommon phenomenon daily between 5.30 pm and 7.30 pm.","Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune will align in a rare astronomical phenomenon.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Bill Gates News: Bill Gates admits he regrets divorcing Melinda the most: 'It was miserable for me...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-gates-admits-he-regrets-divorcing-melinda-the-most-it-was-miserable-for-me-/articleshow/117563747.cms,"Bill Gates and Melinda split up in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.

Bill Gates said divorcing Melinda after 27 years of marriage will always be the thing that he regrets the most in his life. In an interview with the Times of London, he said though he is more cheerful now, the divorce thing was miserable for both him and Melinda for at least two years and this will remain on the top of the chart of his regrets. “Melinda and I still see each other — we have three kids and two grandchildren so there are family events. The kids are doing well. They have good values,” Bill said.Bill Gates,69, is now dating Paula Hurd, 62, the widow of Oracle CEO Mark Hudd. Melinda, 60, has also moved on with her new boyfriend, entrepreneur Philip Vaughn.""When Melinda and I met, I was fairly successful but not ridiculously successful — that came during the time that we were together. So, she saw me through a lot. When we got divorced it was tough and then she made the decision to leave the foundation — I was disappointed that she took the option to go off,"" Bill Gates said.Bill and Melinda were married in 1994 and have three kids Jennifer, 28, Rory, 25 and Phoebe, 22. They announced their split in May 2021 and said that they had been living separately for a year.

I made that clear to him,” Melinda said in an interview. “He was abhorrent. He was evil personified.” Bill has called his working relationship with Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, a “mistake.”","Bill and Melinda were married in 1994 and have three kids Jennifer, 28, Rory, 25 and Phoebe, 22.

Then numbskull Angels stepped out of nowhere, believing they honestly belonged to the race for the player and feeling they were about to offer a strong enough—$100 million, four-year deal to acquire Alonso.A lot of people are still scratching their heads, wondering how such a large, albeit lucrative, deal can be handed to Alonso, a year after MLB Enter Marc Luino, who expressed doubt as to what market value could ever possibly allow him to fetch such a sum. Remember when outfielder Anthony Santander inked a five-year pact with the Blue Jays? That was the line, and Alonso's worth has been measured against it. Angels are believed to have no limits. They are ready to go all in, and one can tell they are trying to bring a different angle down on their forgettable season of 2024.Now about the dismal days of 2024, the Angels, with a sordid eye-drop season and a decade's worth of vacation-less postseason, turned back onto their fortunes. In its most unexpected shape, an off-season has seen itself begin with 12 free agents they recently signed. Twelve! And this is no addition that came very much remotely easily, in sports that are deemed a bit of a contorted dance when it comes to making competitive adjustments. Many a free-agent signing spells camaraderie across the opportunities that the team can rein in this season. However, one of the glaring needs remains an impactful bat to strike with Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon. Enter Pete Alonso, with his career stats—192 homers and 499 RBIs in just five seasons—practically screaming ""missing piece.""Hence, could Pete Alonso turn the tide for the Angels before they come out of the 2024 crash? Indeed. Just picture a team with Trout, Rendon, and Alonso in the lineup. Then the magic starts happening, and a playoff experience is almost certain with a new flavor that fans may delight in dreaming of.Alonso thinks that he is due for a shakeup. According to the Mets, the recent offer might have insulted their home run expert, inviting speculation that Alonso is now ready to seek a fresh start in greener pastures. Now that the Mets are out of the scene, going on proves that he's all set to close the door on what can be called a not-so-nice chapter. Could Toronto be the city he's going to move to? Or are the Angels offering the next chapter of his life in Los Angeles? One thing is for certain: the Angels would undeniably send to the league some bold signals concerning Alonso leading their team. They are just going on and taking a real risk this 2025 season.As the season draws near, the anticipation grows. The fate of Alonso, and potentially the Angels, hangs in the balance.","The New York Mets have been the favorite for many months to re-sign their powerhouse first baseman Pete Alonso.

Budget 2025 income tax expectations : Ever since the last Union Budget was presented in July 2024, the world has seen significant changes ranging from various elections, global economic slowdown, geopolitical developments, volatile Indian stock markets, etc. Having witnessed all of this, the common man awaits with eager anticipation from the Hon'ble Finance Minister as she gears up to unveil her eighth straight budget. Some of the key expectations that individual taxpayers may have are discussed below.It is anticipated that with the thrust of the Government on the adoption of the new tax regime, there may be no changes to the old tax regime. The basic tax exemption limit under the new tax regime is currently at Rs 3 lakh. It is hoped that this limit may be increased to Rs 5 lakh, providing more disposable income for individuals to either spend or save, thereby boosting the overall economy.The full rebate of tax is available up to income limit of Rs 7 lakh currently under the new tax regime. It is expected that this limit can be raised to Rs 10 lakh, offering relief to middle income taxpayers and making it easier for them to manage their finances.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Top tax reliefs FM Sitharaman should consider in Union Budget To protect salaried taxpayers, there is a case in point to increase the standard deduction under the new regime from the current Rs 75,000 to Rs 1,00,000. This increase will help combat inflation and address the higher personal expenses incurred due to changes in work culture, such as working from home, hybrid work, and work from anywhere.n line with the Government's objective of ""Housing for All"" and fostering home ownership, it is suggested that the Government reconsider allowing deductions for interest on self-occupied housing loans under the new default tax regime.To reduce the carbon footprint and move towards clean energy, the Government should reintroduce the deduction provided under section 80EEB (deduction for interest on loan taken to purchase an electric vehicle) and extend it to the new regime as well.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Individual taxpayers want FM Sitharaman to lower tax rates, make new tax regime more attractive, says survey Currently, if a property seller is a resident, buyers must deduct tax at 1% of the consideration if the property value is Rs 50 lakh or more and file a challan-cum-statement, which is a simple and convenient process. However, if the seller is a non-resident, the buyer must obtain a TAN for this one-off transaction, deduct tax at a higher rate, and file a TDS return, which is a cumbersome process. The government should consider introducing challan-cum-statement for non-resident sellers akin to resident sellers to simplify the process.The proposed measures pave the way for significantly improving financial well-being and stimulate economic growth.","It is anticipated that with the thrust of the Government on the adoption of the new tax regime, there may be no changes to the old tax regime.

NEW DELHI: India celebrated its 76th Republic Day on Sunday with a grand parade on Kartavya Path, showcasing tableaux of various states and government schemes under the theme 'Swarnim Bharat: Virasat aur Vikas'.Just like India's maiden Republic Day celebration, where Indonesia's first President Sukarno was the chief guest, this year Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto was the guest of honor.The maiden Republic Day parade in 1950 was, however, held at the Irwin Amphitheatre, later renamed the National Stadium.The Irwin Amphitheatre, designed by Robert Torr Russell, was built in 1933 as a gift from the Maharaja of Bhavnagar.

The birth of the Indian Republic and the installation of its first president were announced by a 31-gun salute.""At the most solemn ceremony, held in the brilliantly lit and high domes of Durbar Hall at Government House, India was declared a Sovereign Democratic Republic exactly at 18 minutes past 10 on the morning of Thursday, January 26, 1950.

The procession made its way through the Irwin Amphitheatre, greeted by chants of ""jai"" from the gathered masses.President Prasad, in his historic speech, emphasized the significance of the moment, stating that for the first time in India's long and chequered history, the entire vast land was brought together under one Constitution and Union, responsible for the welfare of over 320 million people.""Today, for the first time in our long and chequered history we find the whole of this vast land from Kashmir in the north to Cape Comorin in the South, from Kathiawad and Kutch in the west to Coconada and Kamrup in the east, brought together under the jurisdiction of one Constitution and one Union, which takes over the responsibility for the welfare of more than 320 million men and women that inhabit it.""""The president drove out of the Government House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan) in state exactly at 2:30 pm in a 35-year-old coach specially renovated for the occasion bearing the new emblem of Asoka's capital and drawn by six sturdy Australian horses, at a slow trot, escorted by the president's bodyguard.""The amphitheatre, housing 15,000 people, witnessed a magnificent military parade with 3,000 officers and men of the three Armed Services of India and the police, along with massed bands and native contingents adding color and precision to the solemn occasion.","India celebrated its 76th Republic Day on Sunday with a grand parade on Kartavya Path.

Every year on January 26, Indians celebrate Republic Day-- the day when the Constitution of India came into effect, back in 1950, and India became a ‘sovereign democratic republic’.It is a day of great joy, honour, and patriotic spirit for Indians because back in 1950, this was the day when the Government of India Act was replaced by the Constitution, and Indians received a government and a form of governance that they fought so hard for.Every year on Republic Day Indians are glued to the screens of a TV or their phone in order to watch the Republic Day parade which is no less than a spectacle.

But when you unfurl a flag it is already positioned at the top, and you just spread it by loosening the ropes.See more: Republic Day 2025 Wishes & Quotes: Happy Republic Day 2025: Best Messages, Quotes, Wishes, and Images to share on Republic Day The Republic Day Parade has many highlights and that is why people are excited to not miss it.
