Thirty lives were lost on Jan 29, and among them, perhaps his fellow seer Binda Ram.Raj Kumar Giri emerged moments later, his search unfinished. He moved towards the new mortuary at SRN Hospital.If not alive, then at least in death, he would find him. ""I visit both these mortuaries every day,"" Giri said Saturday, holding a picture of Binda Ram. The missing seer had travelled to Kumbh in a group of seven devotees from Nepal. All but him have returned safely to their country.Across Prayagraj, families wandered through hospitals, police stations, and lost-and-found centres. They searched for closure, for a miracle, for the ones they had lost to the tide of humanity.Parul Sarkar, 55, had come from Uttarakhand's Rudrapur with a group of 50. She got separated during the stampede. Since then, there has been no trace of her. ""We have searched every police station, hospital, and even the mortuary, but there is no information about her.

Army gearing up to induct more heavy-duty drones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-gearing-up-to-induct-more-heavy-duty-drones/articleshow/117847274.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Army is chalking out a long-term roadmap to expand its fleet of heavy-duty drones for ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) as well as precision-strike missions, with their sheer operational utility being reinforced by the Russia-Ukraine and Armenia-Azerbaijan conflicts amid the ongoing shift towards unmanned and autonomous technologies in modern warfare.The force is basically looking at unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) systems that can operate at ranges beyond 1,000-km for long-range strategic ISR missions, fly at altitudes over 30,000-feet to evade detection, and have an endurance of over 24 hours at a stretch, top sources told TOI on Thursday.As per estimates, China has well over 2,000 top-notch UAVs, which includes combat drones like the Cai Hong-4, CH-5, CH-7, Wing Loong-II and the stealthy Hongdu GJ-11 `Sharp Sword’.China is also the world’s largest exporter of military UAVs , and has stepped up supply of the armed CH-4 and Wing Loong-II drones to Pakistan, which in turn has around 150-200 drones, including the Turkish Bayraktar TB2 and Akinci drones.The Indian Army, in contrast, has only around 50 Israeli-origin Heron Mark-I and Mark-II as well as Searcher-II medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) drones. Amid the military standoff with China, the force inducted four new satcom-enabled Heron Mark-II drones to boost surveillance along the Line of Actual Control.While the Army Aviation Corps operates these fighter-size UAVs for surveillance and precision-targeting, infantry battalions use a wide array of smaller drones for tactical reconnaissance, logistics and other tasks.While IAF and Navy have their own UAV fleets, there is an overall requirement of at least 150 new MALE drones for the three Services. Towards this end, the Army is focusing on indigenous development of MALE drones by DRDO as well as private sector companies, including through collaboration with friendly countries.DRDO has developed the Rustom series of UAVs, including the Tapas-BH-201 drone but it failed to fully meet operational military requirements, as was first reported by TOI. “Efforts are now underway to enhance the capabilities of Tapas,” a source said.The first flight of Archer-NG, a weaponised MALE drone developed by DRDO, in turn, is expected soon. With a maximum altitude of 30,000-feet, the UAV can carry 300 kg of payload, including anti-tank guided missiles and smart anti-airfield weapons. “With a 1,000-km range, Archer-NG is designed for ISR missions, target acquisition and precision-strikes,” he added.In the arena of the much more capable high-altitude, long endurance (HALE) drones, the armed forces of course will get 31 armed MQ-9B `Predators’ under the Rs 32,350 crore contract inked with the US last Oct. The delivery of these drones, armed with Hellfire missiles, GBU-39B precision-guided glide bombs and other weapons, will begin in 2029.“The Army also needs advanced MALE drones because of the two long `active’ borders with China and Pakistan, both of which require continuous real-time intelligence-gathering and monitoring,” another source said.“UAVs and RPA systems reduce risk to soldiers, allow longer operational endurance and provide precision-strike capabilities. They also enhance counter-terrorism operations by tracking cross-border infiltrations and carrying out strikes on terrorist hideouts,” he added.","The force is looking at unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) systems that can operate at ranges beyond 1,000-km for long-range strategic ISR missions.

"Kolkata weather: AQI improves as temperature rises, 5 of 7 stations in ‘satisfactory’ zone",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/temp-rises-aqi-improves-5-of-7-stns-in-satisfactory-zone/articleshow/117795741.cms,"KOLKATA: The city witnessed an extraordinary recovery in air quality on the last day of Jan, with five out of seven automatic air quality monitoring stations in the city registering ‘satisfactory' levels, marked by a light green AQI band (AQI: 51-100) for the first time this winter.This improvement was driven by a rise in the minimum temperature by 6 degrees Celsius, which largely negated the effects of thermal inversion that typically worsen air pollution during winter.Thermal inversion restricts vertical wind movement due to lower radiative temperatures at the ground level, creating calm wind conditions that prevent pollutants from dispersing, thereby leading to a spike in pollution levels.However, with the warming trend, dispersal mechanisms became more effective, allowing air quality to recover significantly across the city.Salt Lake, where the International Kolkata Book Fair is currently being held, emerged as the cleanest air zone, much to the relief of book lovers and visitors, as the air quality gradually improved throughout the day.Meanwhile, Ballygunge, which was the most polluted zone in recent days, showed the most significant recovery, returning to a ‘satisfactory' AQI level. In contrast, the Rabindra Bharati University (BT Road) monitoring station, which previously boasted the best air quality in the city, recorded a deterioration to ‘moderate' (AQI: 101-200), along with Victoria Memorial Hall (VMH), which was found to be the worst polluted zone in the city, said a PCB official.Hourly AQI readings reflected these trends. At 5 am, Ballygunge had an AQI of 84, which improved slightly to 81 by 11 am and remained steady through the afternoon before rising marginally to 83 by 7 pm.Salt Lake recorded an AQI of 76 at 5 am, improving to 68 by 11 am and maintaining that level throughout the day. Fort William's AQI remained consistently below 100, while Jadavpur showed a slight improvement from 90 at 5 am to 88 at 1 pm before stabilising.RBU (BT Road) showed a moderate AQI trend, starting at 102 and gradually worsening to 104 by 7 pm. Rabindra Sarobar displayed steady improvement, moving from 79 at 5 am to 72 by 7 pm.However, Victoria Memorial Hall stood out as the worst-affected area, with pollution levels worsening from 156 at 5 am to 164 by 7 pm, maintaining a ‘moderate' status throughout the day.While most of Kolkata saw an encouraging trend, the worsening pollution at Victoria Memorial and RBU is largely driven by automobile emissions and construction and demolition activities, respectively, said sources.","Kolkata saw an extraordinary recovery in air quality on the last day of Jan.

Many in govt feel affection of middle class and poor should be reciprocated

NEW DELHI: PM Modi on Friday sought ""special blessings"" of Goddess Lakshmi for the middle class and poor, fuelling expectations that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman may give relief to taxpayers and announce more welfare measures for the needy.""Today, at the beginning of the Budget session, I bow to Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity. And on such occasions, for centuries, we have been remembering (her) virtues.Ma Lakshmi gives us success and wisdom, prosperity and well-being. I pray to (her) that every poor and middle-class community of the country should be blessed..."" Modi said.The hope of Sitharaman announcing such special measures was raised afterwards by President Droupadi Murmu in her address to a joint sitting of Parliament. ""The economic progress of a nation like India is defined by the aspirations of the middle class and fulfilment of those aspirations,"" she said.The bigger the dreams of the middle class, the higher the nation soars. It is my govt that has, for the first time, openly acknowledged and appreciated contributions of the middle class on every occasion,"" President Droupadi Murmu said as she listed welfare measures taken by Modi govt since 2014. The President's address is seen as a declaration of govt's intent.The middle class and a chunk of the poor have largely stood by Modi. Although his govt, as Murmu stressed, has reduced the tax burden and has also widened and deepened the welfare net, there seems to be a feeling in govt that the affection of the two constituencies needed to be reciprocated. This ties in with the opinion of many economists that relief to the middle and new-middle classes will help govt's effort to accelerate growth by boosting consumption.Murmu flagged the recent decision to constitute 8th Pay Commission for central govt employees.""Govt employees are significant representatives of the middle class. So, this decision will lay the foundation for substantial salary increases for govt employees in the coming years,"" she said.""Centre has decided to provide 50% assured pension to lakhs of employees under Unified Pension Scheme, which is widely welcomed. My govt is committed to fulfilling the middle class's dream of owning a home. Laws like RERA have been introduced to safeguard their dreams. Subsidies on home loans are being provided,"" she added. Murmu said through the UDAN scheme, about 1.5 crore people had fulfilled their dream of flying.","Many in govt feel affection of middle class and poor should be reciprocated.

NEW DELHI: The opposition on Saturday criticised the Union Budget presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and claimed that the government missed the opportunity to cut slacks for several groups.Congress MP and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi accused the government of putting a ""band-aid for bullet wounds"" and claimed that the Centre is bankrupt of ideas.Taking to X, Rahul said, "" A band-aid for bullet wounds! Amid global uncertainty, solving our economic crisis demanded a paradigm shift.""""But this government is bankrupt of ideas,"" he added.Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal attacked the government for not waiving off home loans and vehicle loans of the middle class and farmers.Taking to X, Kejriwal said, ""A large part of the country's treasury is spent on waiving off the loans of a few rich billionaires. I had demanded that it be announced in the budget that from now on, the loans of any billionaire will not be waived off.""""With the money saved from this middle class home loans and vehicle loans should be waived off; farmers' loans should be waived off and Income tax and GST tax rates should be halved. I am sad this was not done,"" he added.AAP MP Sanjay Singh claimed the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government intends to continue waiving massive sums for capitalists.""AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal had demanded the government to announce that it will stop waiving off corporate loans and recover the Rs 16 lakh crore that Modi ji has forgiven of his capitalist friends. That money could have been used to halve GST and income tax rates—but no such announcement was made.

As you know that there are elections in Bihar this year, so keeping that in mind, the budget has been presented for Bihar. Everything has been given to Bihar,"" Banerjee said.""When the budget was presented in July 2024, everything was done for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar. For the last 10 years, BJP has been in power and Bengal has not got anything, it is sad and unfortunate,"" he added.Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav said that 'nothing new' was offered in the Union Budget.""Nothing new was there in the budget,"" Dimple said.""Samajwadi Party demands that govt give the details of all those devotees who lost their lives in Maha Kumbh. We demand the state govt to tell the reason behind the tragedy and also if they'll punish the officers responsible for that,"" she added.Earlier, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav emphasised that the lives lost in the Mahakumbh stampede are more significant than budgetary figures.Speaking to the media, Yadav criticised the government over the handling of the Maha Kumbh, stating that the death toll from the recent stampede is being misreported.""Maha Kumbh comes after 12 years. For us, the data of people who died in the stampede in Maha Kumbh is more important than the budget data. The government is not able to tell how many people died, went missing or got injured. The death toll that has been given by the government is false... What arrangements have you made? This government says that we are a party of Hindus but they are not able to make arrangements for this biggest festival of Hindus,"" he said.Sitharaman’s budget included several measures such as a new Income Tax bill to simplify the current system, an increase in foreign direct investment in the insurance sector to 100%, and support for India’s marine sector.She also announced initiatives like a national mission for cotton production and the establishment of a Makhana Board in Bihar. The opposition has linked the Bihar-centric announcements to political calculations, given the upcoming elections in the state.This marks the second consecutive year that Bihar has received significant allocations in the Union Budget. Last year, the Centre had announced development projects worth Rs 58,900 crore, including road projects, a 2,400MW power plant, and flood management initiatives.The finance minister also unveiled plans to establish daycare cancer centres in district hospitals, add 10,000 seats in medical colleges, and provide broadband connectivity to government secondary schools and primary healthcare centres.","Congress MP and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi accused the government of putting a ""band-aid for bullet wounds"" and claimed that the Centre is bankrupt of ideas.

MUMBAI: As 18 of 140 patients with the debilitating neurological disorder, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), are on ventilator support in Pune, there is some cold comfort in knowing this isn't the worst outbreak in the world - yet. It could, however, be considered one of the largest GBS outbreaks as medical literature classified 30 to 50 cases as an outbreak until 2019 when Peru registered the worst flare-up.The South American country had 1,120 cases in 2019, with 683 cases reported in two months.Its annual caseload stood at 59 in 2017 and rose to 262 in 2018 before peaking in 2019. Cases were recorded from across the country, but there is little data on deaths. The story didn't end there; Peru witnessed an outbreak again in 2023, when 130 suspected cases were reported between June 10 and July 15.The problem with GBS, as a professor of medicine in a medical college in Mumbai said, is that it is an autoimmune condition that technically doesn't seem like an epidemic-causing condition. ""GBS has been seen as an independent disorder that is sporadically seen across the country, but we now need to change our mindset and accept it can emerge as an outbreak and study it epidemiologically to look for links between the patients,"" he said.The only link between Peru and Pune is microbe Campylobacter jejuni . Smaller studies from across the world show GBS following this infection is linked with higher disability and mortality rates.GBS has been so rare - India has a reported annual incidence of 1.75 to 2 per lakh population - that there are few in-depth studies. The first-ever detailed analysis of the prevalence and disability burden of GBS was conducted in 2021. Using data between 1990 and 2019, the analysis showed that Japan, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, South Korea, the US and Mexico had much higher than expected burdens, while countries and territories such as China, Fiji, Taiwan, and Guam had much lower than expected burdens.","18 of 140 patients with Guillain-Barre Syndrome are on ventilator support in Pune.

The opposition party said the takeaway from Budget 2025-26 is that BJP is wooing the tax paying middle-class and the Bihar electorate.Addressing a press conference here on the Budget, senior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram said these announcements will be welcomed by the 3.2 crore tax-paying middle-class and the 7.65 crore voters of Bihar.But for the rest of India, the finance minister had no more than soothing words, punctuated by the applause of BJP members led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said.""There is nothing to cheer about the fact that the government has improved the fiscal deficit from the budget estimate of 4.9 per cent to the revised estimate of 4.8 per cent.

There was a huge crowd of advocates for an important case preceding my case. I struggled through the crowd and reached the front row to seek a Passover. But my vocal cord failed me. I struggled to make the request to the CJI,” he said.Apart from his legal acumen, he was known for his lighter vein comments to diffuse tense debates inside the courtroom, especially in sensitive and important issues before constitution benches. So much so that, CJI D Y Chandrachud always gave him the opportunity to speak the last word, which invariably was a joke rhyming with the issue.CJI Khanna modified Sibal’s statement that Justice Roy was a complete judge. The CJi said Justice Roy was a complete man, as apart from legal knowledge, reasonableness and a sense of justice, he was an allrounder being a voracious reader and golfer. Justice Kumar said Justice Roy was a champion hockey player and a footballer for DPS during his school days.

Health department data showed ICU admissions spiking from 45 until Friday to 83. The number of patients on ventilator support stood at 28, up from 18 the previous day.This was offset by some encouraging news in the form of hospitals discharging 38 GBS patients.

NEW DELHI: To encourage states to think innovatively for sustainable urbanisation and redevelopment in existing cities, the govt on Saturday announced setting up of the Urban Challenge Fund (UCF) of Rs 1 lakh crore. The grant for states will be utilised for 25% cost of projects that cities take up. The remaining 75% would be spent by states, including by raising finance in the form of municipal bonds , bank loans and private investment.Officials said the central grant will help infuse around Rs 4 lakh crore for infrastructure development , achieving saturation and redevelopment projects. They added that for innovative and efficient use of land, states would usher urban reforms related to governance, municipal services, and planning.In her budget speech, FM Nirmala Sithraman said UCF will be set up to implement proposals for ‘ Cities as Growth Hubs ’, ‘Creative Redevelopment of Cities’, and ‘Water and Sanitation’. “This fund will finance up to 25% of the cost of bankable projects with a stipulation that at least 50% of the cost is funded from bonds, bank loans, and PPPs. An allocation of Rs 10,000 crore is proposed for 2025-26,” she said.Sources said in the first year itself, cities, which qualify the challenge, would have to fund another Rs 30,000 crore for projects that would be identified. The grant will be for both new and existing cities, they said. “Imagine the impact of overall investment of Rs 4 lakh crore spanning over years — Rs 1 lakh as central grant and another Rs 3 lakh crore by cities — will have on cities,” said a source.Persuading states to take innovative steps for intensive urban development by improving physical and social infrastructure has become urgent considering that most of cities, including Tier-2 and 3, have witnessed unregulated growth, resulting in inefficient use of scarce land.TOI on Jan 13 first reported that PM Narendra Modi, while reviewing the urban development sector, had asked officials to focus more on creating facilities, amenities and better transportation network in zones in cities which naturally attract people and businesses, than develop new cities that push horizontal growth.","The grant for states will be utilised for 25% cost of projects that cities take up.

It helps them meet their short-term financial needs for activities like farming and post farming operations, animal rearing, poultry farming, and fisheries.The new district-based scheme, inspired by the success of the ‘aspirational districts’ programme, aims to enhance agricultural productivity , adopt crop diversification and sustainable agriculture practices, augment post-harvest storage at panchayat and block levels, improve irrigation facilities, and facilitate availability of long-term and short-term credit.The scheme will be implemented in partnership with states in the 100 agri-districts, grappling with low productivity, moderate crop intensity and below-average credit parameters. “This programme is likely to help 1.7 crore farmers,” said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.The six-year mission for pulses will focus on boosting tur, urad and masoor output through development and commercial availability of climate-resilient seeds, enhancing protein content, increasing productivity, improving post-harvest storage and management, and assuring remunerative prices to farmers. “Under this initiative, cooperatives Nafed and NCCF will procure pulses for four years from registered farmers who enter into agreements with these agencies,” said Sitharaman.A comprehensive programme to promote production, efficient supplies and processing of fruits, vegetables and millets will also be launched in partnership with states.Other initiatives proposed include launch of a National Mission on High Yielding Seeds and a Mission for Cotton Productivity; setting up of a Makhana Board in Bihar; bringing out an enabling framework for sustainable harnessing of fisheries from Indian Exclusive Economic Zone and High Seas with a special focus on Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands; and setting up a fertiliser plant with annual capacity of 12.7 lakh metric tonnes at Namrup, Assam.The national mission on high yielding seeds aimed at strengthening the research ecosystem, development and propagation of high-yielding, pest-resistance and climate-resilient seeds, and ensuring commercial availability of more than 100 seed varieties released since July 2024.Under budgetary allocation, the government proposed Rs 1.37 lakh crore for 2025-26, which is 2.75% less than the allocation for the current year. The allied sectors, on the other hand, got higher allocation with fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying witnessing 37% increase to Rs 7,544 crore.Lauding the budget as ""visionary"", the Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that the budget aimed at making India a self-reliant and developed country.Sitharaman in the budget also proposed launching a comprehensive multi-sectoral ‘Rural Prosperity and Resilience’ programme in partnership with states. ""This will address underemployment in agriculture through skilling, investment, technology, and invigorating the rural economy. The goal is to generate ample opportunities in rural areas so that migration is an option, but not a necessity,"" she said.The programme will focus on rural women, young farmers, rural youth, marginal and small farmers, and landless families. ""Global and domestic best practices will be incorporated and appropriate technical and financial assistance will be sought from multilateral development banks. In Phase-I, 100 developing agri-districts will be covered,"" she announced.",A six-year mission was proposed to make the country self-reliant in pulses. It also announced increasing the subsidised Kisan Credit Card (KCC) loan limit to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 3 lakh. The scheme will be implemented in partnership with states in the 100 agri-districts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117837073,imgsize-128256,width-400,resizemode-4/117837073.jpg"

PM Modi: People should reduce intake of edible oil by 10% to cut obesity risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/people-should-reduce-intake-of-edible-oil-by-10-to-cut-obesity-risk-pm/articleshow/117763507.cms,"NEW DELHI: While physical inactivity, junk food and other factors have drawn a lot of attention for their role in causing lifestyle disorders, and rightly so, edible oil has mostly escaped scrutiny. PM Modi, in his address at the 38th National Games opening ceremony, focused on it and called its excessive use a key factor for rising obesity, while urging for reduced oil intake in all households.Excess consumption of cooking oil, he said, was a key factor behind the rising incidence of obesity.""Every age group of the country, and even the youth, are being badly affected by it. And this is also a matter of concern because obesity increases the risk of diseases like diabetes, heart disease,"" the PM said.PM Modi appealed to people to reduce oil intake, in addition to working out daily and focusing on a balanced and nutritious diet, leading many to wonder if it was a precursor to a plan focused on tackling obesity by, among other things, discouraging high consumption of edible oil.“In our homes, ration comes at the beginning of the month. Till now, if you used to bring home two litres of cooking oil every month, then reduce it by at least 10%. Reduce the amount of oil we use every day by 10%,” Modi said.He is not alone in sounding the alarm. According to Dr Vineet Kumar Surana, consultant diabetes and endocrinology at Manipal Hospital-Dwarka, when you add excess oil in cooking, it can add hidden calories without causing fullness leading to weight gain and obesity. “One should not consume more than 600-700 ml per month, which translates to approximately 20 ml/day (equivalent to roughly four teaspoons),” he said.Fortis C-Doc chairperson Dr Anoop Misra said, “Normally, people tend to consume double the recom mended amount of oil or more.” To make matters worse, he added, many people tend to reuse oil which is dangerous. “Re-using oil for frying food items leads to an increase in trans-fats that are known to increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke among others,” he said.Apart from quantity, the quality of oil is equally important. The ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (ICMRNIN), says though mustard oil and groundnut oil are very good for cooking, it is best to use a combination of oils either blended or by rotation. e.g. groundnut oil, soya bean oil, sunflower oil, rice bran oil so that one can get the benefit of all. The PM’s call, sources said, suggests the govt is looking to initiate dedicated programmes to tackle and prevent a potential crisis posed by it.The Economic Survey 2023-24 has warned that unhealthy food and sedentary habits don’t just raise the risk of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases and certain types of cancer but they also pose a threat to the country’s economic potential.“For India’s working-age population to be gainfully employed, they need skills and good health. Social media, screen time, sedentary habits and unhealthy food are a lethal mix that can undermine public health and productivity and diminish India’s economic potential,” the survey report said. It adds that the private sector has made substantial contributions to this toxic mix of habits, and that is myopic.It recommended Indian businesses to embrace traditional lifestyle, food and recipes. These have shown how to live healthily and in harmony with nature and the environment for centuries. It makes commercial sense for Indian businesses to learn about and embrace them, for they have a global market waiting to be led rather than tapped, the report said.","Excess consumption of cooking oil, he said, was a key factor behind the rising incidence of obesity.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, announcing revamped income tax slabs and income tax rates for the salaried taxpayers, individual taxpayers, common man and middle class. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax!The three pillars - Democracy, Demography and Demand - form the foundation for our progression towards Viksit Bharat.India's middle class serves as a crucial driving force for economic advancement. The current administration, led by Prime Minister Modi, recognises the middle class's vital contribution and capabilities in building the nation, FM Nirmala Sitharaman said. With effect from assessment year 2026-27, it is proposed that the following rates provided under the proposed clause (iii) of sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC of the Act shall be the rates applicable for determining the income-tax payable in respect of the total income of a person, being an individual or Hindu undivided family or association of persons [other than a co-operative society], or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, or an artificial juridical person referred to in subclause (vii) of clause (31) of section 2:—Acknowledging the role of middle class, FM Sitharaman said that they have consistently reduced middle class income taxation burden. Since 2014, the 'Nil tax' threshold has seen progressive increases: initially to Rs 2.5 lakh, then to Rs 5 lakh in 2019, and subsequently to Rs 7 lakh in 2023, demonstrating the government's confidence in middle-class taxpayers.A significant announcement introduces tax exemption for incomes up to Rs 12 lakh under the new regime (excluding special rate income like capital gains). For salaried individuals, this threshold extends to Rs 12.75 lakh, factoring in the standard deduction of Rs 75,000.The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class to retain more disposable income, which should enhance household spending, savings and investment potential.The income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 under the old income tax regime continue to be the same:For regular income up to Rs 12 lakh (excluding special rate income such as capital gains), taxpayers receive a tax rebate alongside benefits from reduced slab rates, effectively eliminating their tax liability.The impact of these modifications can be quantified through specific examples:- At Rs 12 lakh income level: Rs 80,000 tax benefit (complete tax exemption)- At Rs 18 lakh income level: Rs 70,000 tax reduction (30% of previous tax liability)- At Rs 25 lakh income level: Rs 1,10,000 tax saving (25% of previous tax liability)The new income tax slabs have been announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman. These tax slabs and rates are applicable for the new income tax regime. In this article, a detailed table shows the latest income tax slabs for FY 2025-26.In order to calculate income tax under the new tax regime, an individual needs to first determine their gross income by adding earnings from all sources, such as salary, property, and other sources etc. Next, they should apply the rates available under new tax regime to their income. After calculating the tax for each income slab, sum these amounts to find the total tax. Then, add the Health and Education Cess (4%) and surcharge (if applicable) to determine the final tax liability.Unlike the old regime, the new tax regime does not allow most deductions, such as those under Section 80C or for HRA, but some exemptions remain, such as the employer’s contribution to NPS.From assessment year 2026-27 onwards, for an assessee, being an individual resident in India whose income is chargeable to tax under the sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, it is proposed to,–(i) enhance the limit of total income for rebate in clause (a) and (b) of first proviso under section 87A, on which the income-tax is payable as per the rates of income-tax under sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC, from Rs. 7,00,000/- to Rs. 12,00,000/- and the limit of rebate in clause (a) of first proviso to section 87A from Rs. 25,000/- to Rs. 60,000/-.(ii) rationalise the first proviso to section 87A by inserting a new proviso so as to provide that the deduction under the first proviso, shall not exceed the amount ofincome-tax payable as per the rates provided in sub-section (1A) of section 115BAC.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes in the new income tax regime. The biggest announcement was that people earning up to Rs 12 lakh income will not have to pay income tax! The comprehensive revision of tax slabs and rates aims to benefit all taxpayers, particularly enabling the middle class.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117821263,imgsize-56778,width-400,resizemode-4/117821263.jpg"

'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Budget 2025 income tax expectations : As we all gear up for the Union Budget later this week, the big question for individual taxpayers is whether the Hon’ble Finance Minister will completely scrap the old tax regime ? Well, time will only give the answer but the moot question is – would it be prudent to do so?Let’s step back for a bit of analysis! The new income tax regime was introduced in 2020 as an optional regime for individual taxpayers.The primary objective was to introduce a more simplified tax structure by removing the plethora of deductions and exemptions. The Government also provided significant relief to taxpayers by reducing income-tax rates, thus nudging them to adopt the new income tax regime. It was quite apparent that the Government intended to phase out the old income tax regime in due course. As per media reports, there were very few takers of the new income tax regime in the initial years.To give a further push, vide Finance Act, 2023, the Government made the new income tax regime as the default regime and brought more attractive changes related to the new income tax regime, by reducing the income-tax rates further, capping the maximum marginal rate (MMR) at 39%, introducing the standard deduction of ₹50,000 for salaried individuals, increasing the income level for 100% tax rebate etc. The trend even continued for the subsequent year wherein vide Finance (No. 2) Act, 2024, the slab rates were further tweaked for better, standard deduction for salaried individuals was hiked, deduction for employer’s NPS contribution increased by 4% etc. This seems to have worked its magic. As per Press Release issued by the Ministry of Finance on August 2, 2024, 72% taxpayers opted for the new income tax regime in FY 2023-24 ITRs filed until July 31, 2024.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Top personal tax changes on the wishlist While this appears to be a large percentage, one cannot disregard the fact that the 28% taxpayers opting for the old income tax regime in FY 2023-24 is still a considerable number. Furthermore, while we do not have the necessary data to understand clearly which section of taxpayers are still in favour of the old income tax regime, it is not difficult to guess. From salaried taxpayers’ perspective, the ones benefiting from popular tax exemptions and deductions such as, HRA, LTA, home loan interest, 80C deductions, insurance premia, charitable donations etc. would be still opting for old income tax regime.Also See: Income Tax Slab Given this, is it worth evaluating if the lower tax rates under the new income tax regime really offset the tax deductions/ exemptions which taxpayers have to forego?We have categorised individual taxpayers in four general baskets as per their annual gross income – (A) individuals having income up to ₹15 lakh, (B) individuals having income between ₹15 lakh - ₹1 Cr, (C) HNIs having income between ₹1 - ₹5 Cr and (D) ultra-HNIs having income beyond ₹5 Cr.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax: Why standard deduction should be hiked under new tax regime Category A represents the largest filing population, possibly young salaried taxpayers, many of them millennials, who may not have invested in long term assets like house properties and other savings schemes. Hence, they would typically prefer hassle-free filing and less burden of documentation proof, etc. At the other end of the spectrum are the ultra-HNIs who would prefer the MMR currently capped at 39% in the new income tax regime due to surcharge cap vis-à-vis 42.74% in the old income tax regime. For both these categories, new income tax regime seems to be the clear winner.It is the people in between who seem to make up the largest group as the old income tax regime filers. These individuals generally spend a significant part of their earnings and savings on rising house rent and home loan EMIs, children’s education, medical expenditure especially for their aged dependents and towards their own retirement savings. They also tend to donate to help a social cause. HNIs would comparatively spend, invest and donate more.The available standard deduction against salary income is definitely not commensurate with the rising YoY expenses. The continuity of existing tax benefits under the old income tax regime hence becomes a critical part of their financial planning to meet their cash budgets. As more consequential tax savings would be available to individuals in Categories B and C and their MMR in both the regimes is the same, they would generally find the old income tax regime more attractive. It is also important to remember that many of these tax deductions, e.g., for home loan interest, insurance premia, savings schemes, etc. were originally introduced to give a boost to the related industry, by incentivising taxpayers to spend on them.If discontinued, this could also have an adverse impact on such payee organisations and investee entities in meeting their objectives, fund requirements etc. In view of these, the Government should not rush to scrap the old income tax regime entirely, either in the existing income-tax law or the probable new Direct Tax Code, at least for a few more years till the average taxpayer develops the habit of prudent financial planning.In the interim, the Government could consider announcing its roadmap of phasing out the old income tax regime coupled with an additional carrot of lower tax rates to encourage this middle-income group to voluntarily adopt the new income tax regime.","Budget 2025 income tax expectations: In the interim, the Government could consider announcing its roadmap of phasing out the old income tax regime.

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday gave a big relief to the middle class as she announced zero income tax for up to Rs 12 lakh under the new tax regime .For salaried employees, this nil tax limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh per annum, after taking into account a standard deduction of Rs 75,000.Soon after the budget speech, DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran termed the budget ""confusing"" pointing out that while the minister initially announced that there would be no taxes for income up to 12 lakhs, she later revealed a 10 per cent tax slab for income between 8 and 12 lakhs.Like him, several users took to social media to post the same query.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday gave relief to the middle class by raising the exemption limit and rejigging slabs. ""I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable up to income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime,"" the finance minister said.As per the rejig, for people earning more than Rs 12 lakh per annum, there will be nil tax for income up to Rs 4 lakh, 5 per cent for income between Rs 4 and 8 lakh, 10 per cent for Rs 8-12 lakh, 15 per cent for Rs 12-16 lakh.A 20 per cent income tax will be levied on income between Rs 16 and 20 lakh, 25 per cent on Rs 20-24 lakh and 30 per cent above Rs 24 lakh per annum.Although the person earning up to Rs 12 lakh per annum (plus Rs 75,000 standard deduction) will not have to pay any tax, the mentioned slabs will be applicable when the income crosses this amount.The income exceeding 12 lakhs gets no rebate relief and is thus taxed from 4 lakhs.If your earning is Rs 13 lakh in an year under the new income tax regime, here's how your tax will be calculated:: Rs 13,00,000: Rs 75,000: Rs 13,00,000 - Rs 75,000 = Rs 12,25,000Now the tax will be calculated on this amount, Rs 12,25,000.: No tax (0%): 5% on Rs 4L = Rs 20,000: 10% on Rs 4L = Rs 40,000: 15% on Rs 25,000 = Rs 3,750Thus, if you cross the Rs 12 lakh limit by Rs 1 lakh, your tax outgo will be Rs 63,750 + health and education cess, which is 4%After today's announcement, a tax payer in the new regime with an income of Rs 12 lakh will get a benefit of Rs 80,000 in tax. A person having income of Rs 18 lakh will get a benefit of Rs 70,000 in tax.A person with an income of Rs 25 lakh gets a benefit of Rs 1.10 lakh.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday gave relief to the middle class by raising the exemption limit and rejigging slabs.

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented her eighth consecutive Union Budget on Saturday. This brings her closer to the record of 10 budgets presented by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who holds the record for the most budgets presented across different terms. She is also the first woman to serve as a full-time finance minister.The Budget for the financial year starting April 2025 (FY2025-26) was the 14th consecutive Budget under the Narendra Modi government since 2014.This includes two interim Budgets presented before the general elections in 2019 and 2024.Ahead of the Budget, there was interest in how the announcements would affect the prices of goods and services, especially for the middle class.Meanwhile, the Economic Survey presented in Parliament on Friday projected India’s economic growth to be between 6.3 per cent and 6.8 per cent for the financial year 2025-26.The survey said that India's economic fundamentals remain stable due to a strong external account, fiscal discipline, and private consumption. It also mentioned that the government plans to support long-term industrial growth by focusing on research and development (R&D), micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and capital goods.""The fundamentals of the domestic economy remain robust, with a strong external account, calibrated fiscal consolidation and stable private consumption. On balance of these considerations, we expect that the growth in FY26 would be between 6.3 and 6.8 per cent,"" the survey stated.The survey also noted that food inflation is expected to decrease in the last quarter of FY25 due to lower vegetable prices and the arrival of the Kharif harvest. A good Rabi harvest may help control food prices in early FY26. However, inflation risks remain due to uncertain weather and rising global agricultural prices.",The Budget for the financial year starting April 2025 (FY2025-26) was the 14th consecutive Budget under the Narendra Modi government since 2014.

What FM Nirmala Sitharaman said on Income Tax Slabs

“Democracy, Demography and Demand are the key support pillars in our journey towards Viksit Bharat. The middle class provides strength for India’s growth. This Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi has always believed in the admirable energy and ability of the middle class in nation building,” Sitharaman said.

There will be no income tax payable upto income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000.

Income Tax Slabs FY 2025-26 New versus Old Income Tax Regime: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has given the middle class, common man and salaried taxpayers a big income tax relief bonanza in the Union Budget 2025. With no income tax burden for income levels up to Rs 12.75 lakh, a big section of the middle class has found reason to cheer.All the changes in the income tax slabs and income tax rates for financial year 2025-26 have been brought in the new income tax regime.Hence, the most important question that is there in the minds of salaried income taxpayers is - after Budget 2025 which income tax regime is better for me? Is it time to switch to the new income tax regime or does the old income tax regime with higher tax exemptions and deductions still make sense? TOI answers this important question for you:According to EY, the simple thumb rule that every salaried taxpayer needs to follow is: calculate the total exemptions and deductions that you want to claim in a year under the old income tax regime.Also Read | Union Budget: No income tax up to Rs 12 lakh - a simple guide to what it actually means for taxpayers If the gross income is more than Rs 24.75 lakh, then a salaried individual is better off taking the new income regime only if the deductions and exemptions (Deductions and exemptions which are not allowed under the new tax regime) are less than Rs 8 lakh (excluding standard deduction).It is important to note that this threshold or break-even level of Rs 8 lakh is specific to the 30% tax bracket, that is for income above Rs 24 lakh or Rs 24.75 lakh (including standard deduction). This break-even level will vary for income levels below Rs 24 lakh, as is evident from the table below where specific examples have been given for gross salary levels of Rs 14 lakh, Rs 18 lakh and Rs 22 lakh.Also Check | Income Tax Slabs 2025-26 Budget 2025 Live Updates “The finance minister has proposed reforms to personal taxes with special focus on middle-class tax payers. While there are limited exemptions available under the new tax regime, taxpayers with a gross income exceeding Rs 24.75 lakhs will find the new tax regime beneficial if their total deductions and exemptions, such as those under Section 80C for specified savings, Section 80D for medical insurance, interest on education loan, donations, HRA exemption, and home loan interest under Section 24, which are not available in the new regime, are less than Rs 8,00,000,” explains Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India.“Therefore, when choosing between the old and new tax regimes, it is crucial for taxpayers to carefully compare their deductions and exemptions eligible under the old tax regime with the potential tax savings offered by the lower rates being proposed in the new tax regime,” she says.","New Vs Old Income Tax Regime: Which one should salaried taxpayers opt for post Budget 2025?

Budget 2025 income tax slab changes FY 2025-26: The Honorable Finance Minister presented her 8th consecutive budget, and this was perhaps one of those budgets that exceeded individual taxpayers' expectations. Although an indication was given in the Economic Survey about the need to boost consumption, particularly among the urban middle class, the budget clearly addressed these concerns.A budget for a ""Viksit Bharat,"" proposed to transform six major domains, with taxation being one of them.Today's proposals rightly focused on middle-income taxpayers, marking a significant step for the government to forgo one lakh crore of revenue in order to increase the disposable income of taxpayers. This essentially aims at enhancing the spending power of India’s middle class and uplifting household sentiment.Also Check | Income Tax Slabs 2025-26 Budget 2025 Live The proposal to increase the rebate limit under Section 87A of the Income-Tax Act, 1961, from INR 7 lakh to INR 12 lakh is set to reduce the tax liability to “zero” for a large number of taxpayers.The proposal to enhance the basic exemption limit from INR 3 lakh to INR 4 lakh, along with the restructuring of other slabs (including the introduction of a new 25% slab for income between INR 20 lakh and INR 24 lakh), ensures that the 30% tax slab now starts at INR 24 lakh (currently INR 15 lakh). This is an attempt to ensure that every taxpayer benefits from these changes, providing more disposable income. These adjustments are proposed under the new tax regime.Additional changes include increasing the TDS threshold limits for interest, rent, and other payments, as well as raising the TCS threshold for LRS payments from INR 7 lakh to INR 10 lakh. The removal of TCS on remittances for education funded through educational loans further ensures that taxpayers receive immediate financial relief. These measures are intended to boost the purchasing power of taxpayers and stimulate the economy.While presenting the budget, the Finance Minister emphasized the continuation of simplifying the tax system. The changes in tax rates and slabs under the new regime are likely to make the old regime redundant.Also Check | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: Post income tax slab changes, which tax regime is better for salaried middle class taxpayers? The extension of the time period for filing updated returns in certain cases from 2 years to 4 years will allow taxpayers more time to correct their returns if they find errors. However, this comes at the cost of higher taxes. Nevertheless, it insulates them from penalties and prosecution. Similarly, extending the decriminalization provisions of TDS to TCS is another step to ease the lives of taxpayers.This is not the end. The Finance Minister also announced the introduction of a new income tax bill next week, which will be half the length of the current laws, providing greater clarity and reducing litigation. While some changes have already been proposed to simplify the tax laws—such as removing conditions for exempting two self-occupied houses—many more changes are expected in the new income tax bill.In short, a big thumbs up to the Finance Minister for presenting an excellent budget for the middle class!","A budget for a ""Viksit Bharat,"" proposed to transform six major domains, with taxation being one of them.

Budget 2025 income tax slab changes 2025-2026 explained: In a big cheer for the salaried middle class taxpayers, FM Nirmala Sitharaman announced sweeping changes to the income tax slabs and income tax rates under the new income tax regime for FY 2025-26. FM Nirmala Sitharaman also announced that she will be tabling the New Income Tax Bill in Parliament next week.All income tax slabs and rate changes have been announced under the new income tax regime - and the biggest takeaway is that an individual earning Rs 12 lakh will have to now pay NIL or ZERO tax under the new regime.So, if you are a salaried taxpayer with income up to Rs 12.75 lakh, then including the Rs 75,000 standard deduction, your income tax outgo will be 0!“Right after 2014, the ‘Nil tax’ slab was raised to Rs 2.5 lakh, which was further raised to Rs 5 lakh in 2019 and to Rs 7 lakh in 2023. This is reflective of our Government’s trust on the middle-class tax payers. I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable up to income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000,” FM Nirmala Sitharaman announced in her Budget speech.FM Sitharaman went on to explain:Also Read | New vs old income tax regime after Budget 2025: Post income tax slab changes, which tax regime is better for salaried middle class taxpayers? “The Government has revamped the tax slabs and rates under the new tax regime in an effort to make it more attractive and widen its adoption by taxpayers. Individuals who are already being taxed under the new tax regime definitely stand to gain from the proposed changes in the tax rates, for instance, an individual having taxable income of Rs 27 lakhs will now save Rs 114,400 in taxes (including cess) under the proposed new tax regime as against the existing tax regime,” says Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India.","FM Nirmala Sitharaman also announced that she will be tabling the New Income Tax Bill in Parliament next week. A tax payer in the new regime with an income of Rs 12 lakh will get a benefit of Rs 80,000 in tax.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117836759,imgsize-70708,width-400,resizemode-4/117836759.jpg"
