"Person tailgating liable for accident if it occurs, says SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/person-tailgating-liable-for-accident-if-it-occurs-says-sc/articleshow/123006985.cms,"NEW DELHI: Apply emergency brakes or trail a moving vehicle too closely at your own risk as Supreme Court has said that using brakes all of a sudden in the middle of a road or not maintaining sufficient distance from a running vehicle make a person liable for an accident if it occurs.While adjudicating a motor accident claim in an accident involving a bike, a car and a bus in which bike rider collided with the four wheeler and was hit by a truck after falling down resulting in 100% physical disability, a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Aravind Kumar found fault with all three who were driving vehicles. The court said that the car driver was at fault for suddenly applying brakes in the middle of the road and the biker also committed a mistake as he was not maintaining safe distance from the car and also the bus driver whose negligence resulted in grievous injury and led to the amputation of a leg of the biker's.The court rejected the plea of the car insurer which contended that the biker had hit the moving car from behind and the car driver was not liable. The car owner had said that he had suddenly applied the brakes as his wife was pregnant and she had a vomiting sensation at that time, a justification which was rejected by the court.Examining the role of all three drivers, the court said that the biker, who was an engineering student and lost his one leg, was also liable for contributory negligence but only to the extent of 20% whereas the car driver and bus driver are liable for negligence to the extent of 50% and 30% respectively.The tribunal had exonerated the car driver and determined the negligence of the biker and the bus driver in the ratio of 20:80.The court awarded a compensation of Rs 1.14 crore to the biker but deducted 20% from it due to his contributory role in the accident. It said that since both the offending vehicles (car as well as the bus) were insured at the time of the accident, the liability for the negligence of the car driver and bus driver shall be borne by the insurer.",Supreme Court finds fault with all three who were driving vehicles.

Sacred Piprahwa Buddhist relics put up for auction brought to India after 127 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sacred-piprahwa-buddhist-relics-put-up-for-auction-brought-to-india-after-127-yrs/articleshow/123006932.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a significant assertion by India of its ""cultural diplomacy"", the sacred Piprahwa relics of Buddha - taken away during the colonial period - have been brought back after 127 years through an outreach that started with the govt stepping in to stop their auction by Sotheby's Hong Kong in May. PM Narendra Modi hailed the return of the relics -gems as ""a joyous day for our cultural heritage"", after culture minister Gajendra Shekhawat received them at the Delhi airport on Wednesday. ""It would make every Indian proud that the sacred Piprahwa relics of Bhagwan Buddha have come home after 127 long years,"" Modi said on X. The relics have been kept at the National Museum and will be placed on public display after a special ceremony. ""It may be recalled that the Piprahwa relics were discovered in 1898 but were taken away from India during the colonial period. When they appeared in an international auction earlier this year, we worked to ensure they returned home. I appreciate all those who have been involved in this effort,"" the PM said.These sacred relics highlight India's close association with Buddha and his noble teachings, he said. ""It also illustrates our commitment to preserving and protecting different aspects of our glorious culture,"" the PM said.The return of the relics is a benchmark in cultural diplomacy and marks the first of its kind public-private partnership to repatriate antiquities with the govt collaborating with Godrej Industries Group, which privately acquired the entire collection of 349 gems, according to the culture ministry. This 'PPP' is being cited as a model in cultural collaboration that can help protect and preserve global heritage.It said amid global solidarity post-Pahalgam terror attack, the return of relics also strengthens India's role as the national steward of Buddhist heritage. The Piprahwa relic jewels were discovered in 1898 at the ancient Buddhist stupa at Piprahwa in UP.The relics were part of a larger find, including bone fragments, soapstone and crystal caskets, a sandstone coffer, excavated by British civil engineer William Claxton Peppe from the stupa - widely identified as ancient Kapilvastu, birthplace of the Buddha.","The sacred Piprahwa relics of Buddha - taken away during the colonial period - have been brought back after 127 years.

Microsoft has responded to the criticism that it fired American employees to hire foreign cheap labor saying that H-1B applications are no way related to the recent job eliminations and many employees on H-1Bs also lost their jobs. The statement comes amid an intense debate over Microsoft's announcement of 9,000 layoffs while the company reportedly made 4712 applications for H-1Bs.“Our H-1B applications are in no way related to the recent job eliminations in part because employees on H-1B’s also lost their roles. In the past 12 months, 78% of the petitions we filed were extensions for existing employees and not new employees coming to the U.S.,” the company said in a statement emailed to CFO Dive by a spokesperson.Vice President JD Vance recently slammed Microsoft and he said it makes no sense to him that companies fire Americans and then claim that they can't find workers in America and bring in foreign workers. ""You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me,"" he said.""That displacement and that math worries me a bit. And what the president has said, he said very clearly: We want the very best and the brightest to make America their home. We want them to build great companies and so forth. But I don't want companies to fire 9,000 American workers and then to go and say, 'We can't find workers here in America.' That's a bulls**t story,"" he said.The H-1B visa program that allows companies to hire foreign workers has emerged as a contentious issue while the Donald Trump administration is planning a major overhaul of the program.

India Braces For Higher Tariffs

No India-US Trade Deal Before August 1?

India-US trade deal stalemate: Ahead of his self-imposed tariff deadline, US President Donald Trump has said that a trade agreement with India has not yet been finalized. “India trade deal not been finalized,” said Trump. Asked whether India would face 20-25% tariff rates, he said, ""Yeah, I think so. India is my friend. They ended the war with Pakistan at my request...The deal with India is not finalised. India has been a good friend, but India has charged basically more tariffs than almost any other country..."". However, he cautioned that the tariff rate has not yet been decided as negotiations continue.Trump’s remarks come just days ahead of the August 1, 2025 reciprocal tariff deadline. In the last few weeks Trump had said that the US is ‘nearing’ a deal with India. The likelihood of an interim trade deal announcement before the deadline appears slim for now.Earlier in the day, Reuters reported that India is preparing for a temporary reciprocal tariff rate ranging between 20-25%. India anticipates facing elevated US tariffs on certain export items as an interim arrangement, two officials from the Indian government told the news agency.""Talks are progressing well, and a delegation is expected in Delhi by mid-August,"" one of the Indian government officials said, adding that President Donald Trump could issue a tariff letter imposing duties of 20 or 25% in a ""worst-case scenario"".""However, we assume it would be a temporary measure, considering the five rounds of trade talks that have taken place. A deal will soon be worked out,"" the official was quoted as saying.Trump’s comments come right after a US trade official indicated that additional negotiations are needed for a trade agreement between India and the US.US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has confirmed ongoing discussions between both nations require further negotiation, reported Bloomberg.Also Read | ‘More negotiations needed…’: Trump administration official shares update on India-US trade deal; no agreement before August 1 deadline? Despite being amongst the first countries to begin trade talks with the White House this year, India has maintained a firm position, particularly regarding its agriculture and dairy sectors.Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Greer emphasised the necessity for additional discussions to finalise a trade agreement.India's historical approach to market protection suggests that any easing of trade restrictions would represent a major policy change, despite earlier suggestions of a forthcoming deal with New Delhi.""We continue to speak with our Indian counterparts, we've always had very constructive discussions with them,"" Greer said.""They have expressed strong interest in opening portions of their market, we of course are willing to continue talking to them,"" Greer said.

"After over 40 years, India issues tender for Sawalkote project as Indus treaty remains in abeyance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-over-40-years-india-issues-tender-for-sawalkote-project-as-indus-treaty-remains-in-abeyance/articleshow/123004488.cms,"SRINAGAR: India, taking advantage of its keeping in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, floated on Wednesday international tenders for construction of the Sawalkote Hydroelectric Project on the Chenab river a little over 40 years after it was conceived.The project, designated by govt as one of national importance, had suffered long delays due to objections from Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty framework as well as multiple regulatory and administrative hurdles, including compensation issues involving 13 affected villages, relocation of the Army transit camp in Ramban, and forest land within the project area requiring clearances and compensation under environmental regulations.he National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) initiated on Wednesday the tendering process for the power project, located near Sidhu village in J&K’s Ramban district. The last date for submission of online bids is Sept 10. It invited international bids on a competitive bidding basis for planning, design, and engineering works for the 1,856 MW project. The last date for submission of online bids is Sept 10.Construction of the Sawalkote project is a major strategic development aimed at optimising India’s use of Indus waters while the treaty with Pakistan remains in abeyance. The 1960 treaty had given India control of the Beas, Ravi and Sutlej rivers, and Pakistan the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum, with India being allowed a portion of waters from the “western rivers (those under Pakistan control)” for certain uses.J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah, who is also power minister, told TOI the project is of great significance and that he hoped it would finally take off. “The project was originally conceived in the 1980s, but it was shelved after some time. In 1996, Dr Farooq Abdullah attempted to revive it with the help of a Norwegian consortium but that effort didn’t succeed. Later, during my previous tenure, we tried to initiate the project again, but it encountered certain hurdles,” Omar said, adding that it was completely shelved during the tenure of the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed govt.Ramban MLA Arjun Singh Raju was the first to announce Wednesday’s development, calling it a landmark moment. “Sawalkote power project is the biggest in the country. Once completed, it will benefit not just Jammu and Kashmir, but the entire nation. I think it is a historical moment,” he said, adding, “And the credit goes to chief minister Omar Abdullah, who fought relentlessly for this project,” he added.The run-of-river project is estimated to cost Rs 22,704.8 crore and will be developed in two stages.“All issues have now been sorted out,” Raju said, adding that NHPC has also secured relaxation on the water cess, which had earlier delayed progress.Earlier this month, the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) granted “in-principle” approval for the diversion of 847 hectares of forest land for the construction of the Sawalkote project.Conceived in 1984, the Sawalkote project, sources said it was given to NHPC in 1985. In 1997 it was given back to Jammu Kashmir State Power Development Corporation (JKSPDC) for execution. Sources said approximately Rs 430 crore was spent by JKSPDC on “enabling infrastructure” around the project. But no work had started on the main project. Then, in 2021, an MoU was signed with NHPC to revive and implement the project under the build-own-operate-transfer model.","The project, designated by govt as one of national importance, had suffered long delays due to objections from Pakistan.

NISAR a milestone in Indo-US space ties; space minister says sat will be a ‘game changer in disaster management’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nisar-a-milestone-in-indo-us-space-ties-space-minister-says-sat-will-be-a-game-changer-in-disaster-management/articleshow/123005639.cms,"NISAR Will Help Global Community Monitor Earth Changes: ISRO Chairman V Narayanan

NEW DELHI: The successful launch of the world’s most expensive and unique earth observation satellite NISAR, jointly developed by US and Indian scientists over a decade, has given a big push to Indo-US space cooperation and has been hailed as a milestone in space collaboration between the two countries under the leadership of US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Wednesday’s launch came weeks after Nasa and Isro successfully collaborated on the Axiom-4 mission, under which Indian astronaut Shubanshu Shukla was sent to the International Space Station for microgravity experiments.Congratulating Isro and Nasa, space minister Jitendra Singh called the NISAR mission a “game changer in precise management of disasters”.In a post on X, he said: “NISAR’s capacity to penetrate through fogs, dense clouds, ice layers, etc., makes it a pathbreaking enabler for the aviation and shipping sectors. The inputs from NISAR will benefit the entire world community…in the true spirit of ‘Vishwabandhu’.” He also expressed pride in being “associated with the Department of Space at a time when Isro is registering one global milestone after the other”.Isro chairman V Narayanan said NISAR “has brought the two agencies closer than ever before”.Though Nasa began studying concepts for a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mission, inspired by the National Academy of Sciences' decadal survey of the agency's Earth science program in 2007, the US chose to collaborate with India for a huge SAR-based satellite, signing a formal agreement for the NISAR programme in 2014.The then Nasa administrator Charles Bolden and then Isro chairman K Radhakrishnan signed the pact for production and launch of NISAR in Toronto on Sept 30, 2014.Before 2014, US and India had collaborated on a slew of space missions, including the Chandrayaan-1 mission, under which saw Nasa sent its payload (Moon Mineralogy Mapper) on board Isro’s spacecraft for the moon mission, which played a crucial role in finding water on Moon. But the NISAR programme is said to be the first big-ticket ($1.5 billion) satellite mission invested in by both sides. Nasa has contributed L-Band SAR, a high-rate telecommunication subsystem, GPS receivers and a deployable 12-metre unfurlable antenna. Isro, on its part, has provided S-Band SAR payload, the spacecraft bus to accommodate both payloads, GSLV-F16 launch vehicle and all associated launch services.",The successful launch of the world’s most expensive and unique earth observation satellite NISAR has given a big push to Indo-US space cooperation. The launch has been hailed as a milestone in space collaboration between the two countries under the leadership of US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123005643,imgsize-419587,width-400,resizemode-4/123005643.jpg"
J&K Medical Council sets social media guidelines for doctors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-medical-council-sets-social-media-guidelines-for-doctors/articleshow/123003984.cms,"SRINAGAR: A week after an MBBS student filmed his career’s first stint in the operation theatre and posted it online as a reel, Jammu and Kashmir Medical Council (JKMC) on Wednesday issued social media guidelines for doctors in the Union Territory, prohibiting them from sharing images or videos of treatment results, surgeries, procedures, or healed patients.In the video, which was widely circulated on social media platforms, an MBBS student at GMC Srinagar’s LD Hospital, excitedly shared that he was about to perform his first surgery in the OT, and proceeded to the labour room, thus exposing the parts of the patient’s body.Taking serious cognisance, JKMC issued a set of guidelines to ensure such violations do not recur. While acknowledging the role of social media as “a powerful communication tool”, the Council, in a statement, cautioned against its misuse, particularly in ways that compromised patient privacy, confidentiality or autonomy.JKMC directed registered doctors to follow the set guidelines on the professional conduct of Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs) regarding the use of social media platforms in adherence to Indian Medical Council Regulations, 2002.“RMPs must not advertise services, claim superiority, or engage in self-promotional activities (posting self-photographs or publicity on signboards beyond basic details).Permitted announcements are — starting practice, change of address, or temporary absence,” the JKMC statement said.Patient information — including images, scans, treatments, and outcomes — must not be disclosed without explicit and informed consent, JKMC said. “Consent is invalid if the patient is in a compromised physical, mental, or emotional state. Patient testimonials, endorsements, or reviews cannot be solicited or shared in any case on social media,” it added.The Council asked RMPs to maintain dignity and avoid behaviour that discredits the profession on any media platform. “Sharing factual, verifiable, and non-misleading educational content is allowed, within one’s expertise. Public discussions of treatment or prescribing medications online is prohibited; patients must be directed to proper telemedicine or in-person consultations,” it said.Online presence must reflect medical ethics, truthfulness, and respect for the profession, patients, colleagues and the community, JKMC said, urging doctors to share content responsibly.","An MBBS student filmed his career’s first stint in the operation theatre and posted it online as a reel.

"Policy experts, civil society from Asia Pacific discuss country positions ahead of plastics treaty talks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/policy-experts-civil-society-from-asia-pacific-discuss-country-positions-ahead-of-plastics-treaty-talks/articleshow/123003545.cms,"AI-generated Image (Representational)

BATHINDA: Regional policy experts discussed country positions and negotiation dynamics of the Asia Pacific region, in a briefing by Break free from Plastic (BFFP), the global movement working to achieve a future free from plastic pollution, ahead of the INC 5.2 negotiations for the Global Plastic Treaty in Geneva, Switzerland from August 5-14, 2025. INC-5.2 refers to the second part of the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC).It discussed how countries frame their priorities around economic development, environmental protection, and regional and international cooperation.Asia Pacific countries sit at the epicentre of both plastic production and pollution impacts; the region's diverse economies and environmental challenges make it a key battleground in the global treaty negotiations. The negotiations outcome will determine global standards for plastic production, waste management, and industry accountability.The briefing also identified key challenges, including procedural issues affecting civil society access, potential delaying tactics, watered-down commitments favouring waste management over production caps, and industry influence promoting circular economy narratives over substantive pollution reduction.For more nuanced coverage of the treaty, the policy experts and researchers on the panel urged journalists to consider a human rights-centric, fossil-fuel-free development model for Asia Pacific.It was felt critical threats that could significantly weaken the treaty include chemical and plastic-producing countries challenging the treaty's scope to address the full plastics lifecycle, potentially removing obligations for primary plastic polymer production reduction and chemicals of concern from the final agreement.The most significant risk is that negotiations could result in a framework convention with voluntary measures rather than legally binding obligations, which would fundamentally undermine the treaty's ability to address global plastic pollution at the required scale and speed.A critical political obstacle to a strong, effective treaty is the decision-making process, which relies on a consensual decision-making process where all countries are not equal, instead of an equal voting process.With pressure to reach a consensus, countries may compromise on stronger provisions to secure a deal, with critical decisions on production reduction measures deferred to future COP processes.As diverse as the Asia Pacific region is, we are most impacted by plastic pollution, and often bear disproportionate blame.C Semee Rhee, Global Policy Advisor, BFFP said “It's not about whether or not we will have a treaty. It's about how many countries will be courageous enough to say that we can no longer continue producing the amount of plastics we currently produce for the sake of the environment and human well-being.”Siddharth Ghanshyam Singh, Centre for Science & Environment (CSE) said, “The moment to push for ambition is now. Opportunities like this don’t come often, and countries must remember who they are negotiating for; their people and our shared planet. We cannot allow a few vocal opponents to derail and delay progress. It’s time to stand firm and take a decisive step toward ending plastic pollution.”Pinky Chandran, Asia Pacific Coordinator, BFFP said “The plastic problem often resembles a kaleidoscope, with no single perspective illuminating the complete picture; in fact, each turn reveals a new representation. We must view the plastic problem as a tapestry, where every element is interconnected, interlinked, and interdependent. A fragmented, piecemeal approach simply won't suffice. And so there must be global binding measures to reduce plastic production, in order to tackle the plastic pollution problem, through just transition lens”.Siddika Sultana, Executive Director, Environment and Social Development Organization (ESDO) said ""South Asia is both a significant hotspot for plastic pollution and a center of innovation. To address this issue effectively, the region must shift from isolated national initiatives to coordinated regional action. A united approach—supported by enforcement, investment, and inclusivity—can establish South Asia as a leader in developing an effective global treaty on plastic waste. ""Punyathorn Jeungsmarn, Plastics Campaign Researcher, Environmental Justice Foundation said, “As a region, Southeast Asia is particularly affected by plastic pollution, and is increasingly becoming the dumping ground for plastic waste, misguided false solutions such as waste-to-energy technologies, and petrochemical expansion. It is therefore crucial for our representatives to stand up and put people and the planet over plastics and the petrochemical industry. Throughout the past rounds of negotiations, we have seen courageous stances from Southeast Asian countries. We hope to see those again in Geneva.”","Asia Pacific countries sit at the epicentre of both plastic production and pollution impacts.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a trade agreement with South Korea, imposing a 15% tariff on imports from Seoul, as part of what he called a “full and complete trade deal” between the two nations.He further declared that America won’t be subjected to any tariffs.As part of the deal, the Asian nation will also provide $350 billion for investments in the United States, which will be owned, controlled, and personally selected by Trump.Moreover, South Korea will also buy $100 billion worth of LNG or other energy products, and has also agreed to invest a major amount for investment.Posting on Truth Social, the US president said, ""I am pleased to announce that the United States of America has agreed to a Full and Complete Trade Deal with the Republic of Korea.

It was an Honor to meet them, and talk about the Great Success of their Country!""Since his return to the White House in January, Trump has pursued aggressive trade measures, rolling out a blanket 10% tariff on both allies and competitors. Those rates are set to climb from August 1, with particularly steep increases on select nations, 25% on imports from India and 50% on those from Brazil.Trump indicated the Brazil tariffs were in part retaliation for what he labelled a ""witch hunt"" against Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president and his far-right ally, currently facing a criminal trial.","US President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement with South Korea, imposing a 15% tariff on imports from Seoul.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, dropped sharply in opening trade on Thursday after US President Trump announced 25% tariff plus additional penalty on India. While Nifty50 went below 24,700, BSE Sensex was down 600 points. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,666.10, down 189 points or 0.76%. BSE Sensex was at 80,882.15, down 600 points or 0.74%.Markets are expected to respond to Trump's announcement of a 25% tariff on India. Analysts suggest maintaining prudent positioning and advocate for protected trading strategies, considering the expected market fluctuations.Individual stock movements are expected to remain prominent as companies continue to announce their financial results.US President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on Indian exports to America, effective August 1. The biggest risk seen by market experts is the 'additional; penalty' announced by Trump for India's oil and arms purchases from Russia.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The 25 % tariff on India plus an unspecified penalty for energy and defence-related purchases from Russia is very bad news for Indian exports and thereby on the growth prospects of the Indian economy in the short run.Since trade negotiations with India are continuing, perhaps, the 25 % tariff may come down eventually. But certainly, there is a short-term hit to Indian exports and GDP growth. This short-term hit will reflect in the stock market, too, in the short-term.”“From the investor perspective it is important to understand that the 25% tariff will come down after the negotiations which start in mid-August. The 25% tariff imposed on India is far higher than the rates reached in trade deals with other countries. This is the typical Trumpian strategy to get better deals from India in other areas and finally settle at a tariff rate around 20 % or less. Nifty is unlikely to go below the support level of 24500. Investors can buy the dip focusing on domestic consumption themes, particularly segments like leading private sector banking names, telecom, capital goods, cement, hotels and select autos which have done well in Q1.""US stocks retreated from session highs on Wednesday following Federal Reserve Chairman Powell's comments dampening hopes for a September rate reduction.Gold prices recovered on Thursday after hitting a one-month low in the previous session. The recovery was driven by increased bullion demand due to trade uncertainties following new US tariff announcements, with investors taking advantage of lower prices despite diminished expectations of a US rate reduction.Oil prices continued their upward trend for the fourth consecutive day on Thursday, as market participants expressed concerns about supply constraints amidst US President Donald Trump's efforts for quick resolution of the Ukraine conflict and warnings of tariffs for Russian oil purchasers.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 850 crore net on Wednesday, whilst domestic institutional investors made net purchases of Rs 1,829 crore.","US President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on Indian exports to America, effective August 1.

Thinking Machines Lab: a startup with billion-dollar belief

Why Murati’s team said no to Meta

A name to watch in AI’s future





Mira Murati, the Albanian-American tech visionary behind some of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, is once again in the spotlight—this time for turning down an eye-watering $1 billion offer from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . As the former CTO of OpenAI and now the founder of the AI startup Thinking Machines Lab, Murati has become one of the most influential figures in the global AI race. Her team's unanimous rejection of Meta’s massive offer speaks volumes about their confidence in her leadership and their belief in the startup’s long-term vision.Before launching Thinking Machines Lab, Mira Murati served as the chief technology officer at OpenAI, one of the most influential positions in the modern AI world. During her tenure, she played a pivotal role in leading the development of groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Codex—systems that have since transformed the way people interact with artificial intelligence. Her work helped bring generative AI into the mainstream, sparking a global wave of innovation across industries from education and healthcare to design and coding.Murati wasn’t just a technical leader—she was a strategic visionary. At OpenAI, she emphasized the importance of safety, alignment, and responsible development, pushing the organization to think deeply about the societal impact of powerful AI systems.Internally, she earned the reputation of being the “AI brain” behind OpenAI’s most ambitious projects, praised for her calm, focused demeanor and her ability to guide multidisciplinary teams through intense periods of innovation. Her combination of engineering precision and human-centered thinking set the stage for her next bold move: founding her own AI company.In early 2025, she delivered a keynote at the World Economic Forum in Davos, warning that “AI without values is intelligence without conscience,” sparking international dialogue on AI ethics and sovereignty. She’s also been advising the European Commission on emerging AI regulatory frameworks, a rare role for a startup founder.Founded in early 2025, Thinking Machines Lab has rapidly emerged as one of the most-watched AI startups. Despite not launching a single product yet, the company recently raised a stunning $2 billion seed round at a valuation nearing $12 billion, led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup’s goal: to create customizable, interpretable, and widely accessible AI systems that could redefine the AI landscape. Industry insiders say the company’s stealth mode only adds to its mystique. With Murati at the helm, expectations are sky-high for what comes next.According to a Wired report, Zuckerberg's Meta offered some of Murati’s team members compensation packages ranging from $200 million to $1 billion to join its newly launched Superintelligence Lab. But every single offer was turned down. Sources say the Thinking Machines Lab team believes their equity in the startup has the potential to be worth far more—and more importantly, they value their independence and Murati’s vision over big-tech paychecks.In a tech industry where massive paydays often drive decisions, the loyalty displayed by Murati’s team stands out. The rejection of Meta’s lucrative offers highlights their belief in the startup’s mission and long-term potential. Many observers also note that the chance to help shape AI’s future from the ground up, without the constraints of a corporate giant, is a rare and meaningful opportunity—one Murati has worked hard to create.Mira Murati’s leadership has already been recognized worldwide—she was featured in Time’s 100 Most Influential People in AI (2024) and Fortune’s 100 Most Powerful Women in Business (2023). With Thinking Machines Lab gaining momentum and Meta's billion-dollar offers rebuffed, Murati has solidified her place not just as a builder of AI—but as a shaper of its future.",Mira Murati is the founder of the AI startup Thinking Machines Lab.

Palava Power Bills: Power bills as high as monthly rent a ‘rude shock’ in Palava,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/power-bills-as-high-as-monthly-rent-a-rude-shock-in-palava/articleshow/123003204.cms,"



Mumbai: More than 300 residents of Palava, a posh township in Dombivli, are facing a peculiarly disturbing situation—their power bills for the past many months are not just inflated, in some cases, they are higher than the monthly rent or close to the home loan EMIs they pay for their flats. And the difference isn't a small one either. Those who received power dues in the range of Rs 2,000-Rs 2,500 per month for their 2BHK flats before March, are now getting bills as high as Rs 15,000-30,000 a month for the past four months. So much so that a resident had to take a personal loan to clear his Rs 20,000 outstanding bill to avoid disconnection.This, the residents allege, is due to the change of old meters to smart meters. A Mahavitaran official, though, said it was due to the unavailability of a person who collects meter readings. ""The person has not reported to duty, so physical meter readings haven't been taken for the past four months. We're looking for a replacement, but till then, average readings are being issued,"" said an MSEDCL official when approached by a resident.While Mahavitaran authorities also claim some meter readings are genuine due to high consumption during summer, residents hit by the power jolt said they have been suffering for eight months straight.""Last winter, for the months of Dec, Jan and Feb, when air-conditioners weren't used, I received a monthly bill of Rs 16,000 against Rs 1,800-2,000 during the same period the year before,"" claimed one, adding there ""seems to be a major billing scam"".New Zealand-based Vinay Kumar Jaiswal, who owns a flat in Palava, said it has been vacant for five years but he has received a bill of over Rs 10,000 for June, even when the meter put against his flat shows zero reading. There were others away during summer vacations in May, who have received power bills upwards of Rs 10,000. Resident Unmesh Rahatade, who received a power bill of Rs 3,860 for March, was handed a bill of Rs 28,920 for June and Rs 19,650 for July.A Palava housing society member said, ""Mahavitaran authorities told us the issue is between the power distributor and individual subscriber, and the society doesn't need to interfere as consumers can approach redressal forums.""Jagdish Bodke, executive engineer of Kalyan east division of MSEDCL, told TOI, the problem is due to poor network in some housing complexes or areas. ""There are 7,600 consumers whose meter reading has not been coming from SIM card due to network issues. Therefore, these people were issued higher bills mentioning ‘Reading Not Taken or Reading Not Available'. We installed boosters in some areas, and reading has started coming in for some. The problem now remains with only 1,400 TOD meters. This problem should end in the next few days. Those who have paid higher bills will see an adjustment or reduction in their future bills.""(With inputs by Pradeep Gupta)","More than 300 residents of Palava, a posh township in Dombivli, are facing a peculiarly disturbing situation.

GURGAON: Indian Medical Association's Haryana unit on Tuesday issued a notice announcing that 650 private hospitals across the state will stop treating patients under the Centre's Ayushman Bharat scheme from Aug 7 if reimbursements amounting to Rs 500 crore aren't cleared by then. Officials of IMA (Haryana), which had issued a similar warning in Jan earlier this year, said the state's administration of the scheme was in a state of ""chronic breakdown"".Most private hospitals have only gotten 10-15% of their billed amounts in reimbursements since March, forcing them to dip into their own reserves or turn patients away, they said.""The situation is worse than before.

US Senator sends letter to Elon Musk: Block Starlink in Southeast Asia's 'criminal compounds' using the satellite internet service to scam Americans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/us-senator-sends-letter-to-elon-musk-block-starlink-in-southeast-asias-criminal-compounds-using-the-satellite-internet-service-to-scam-americans/articleshow/122973251.cms,"Here’s the complete letter sent by Senator Maggie Hassan to Starlink CEO Elon Musk:

Dear Musk,

According to an October 2024 report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, transnational criminal groups have used Starlink, a satellite internet serviced owned by SpaceX, to facilitate fraud against individuals in the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has warned that these groups have caused billions of dollars in losses for Americans.

In addition, since November 2022, the Secret Service has received more than 8,000 complaints related to digital asset scams, many with traces to scam networks in Southeast Asia. Given the significant financial consequences for Americans, I write today to request information about SpaceX’s efforts to prevent the misuse of Starlink in transnational fraud.

Experts have stated that scam networks in Southeast Asia turn to Starlink for its portability, decentralized infrastructure, and independence from national telecom networks. In one example, a Wired investigation found that across eight scam compounds in Myanmar, at least 412 devices identified Starlink as their provider and recorded more than 40,000 logins. In another example, one law enforcement operation in Thailand seized more than 130 Starlink devices from scam compounds around the country.

While SpaceX has stated that it investigates and deactivates Starlink devices in various contexts, it seemingly has not publicly acknowledged the use of Starlink for scams originating in Southeast Asia — or publicly discussed actions the company has taken in response. Scam networks in Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, however, have apparently continued to use Starlink despite service rules permitting SpaceX to terminate access for fraudulent activity.

A United Nations report has confirmed that SpaceX can restrict access to Starlink through “geofencing,” making the service unavailable in specific countries or locations, but it is unclear whether the company has done so in Southeast Asia. According to one expert based in the region, “Starlink [is] failing the first basic test of business and human rights, which is to ensure that your operations do no harm.”

Transnational fraud has imposed significant human and economic costs in the United States, Southeast Asia, and around the world. According to recent estimates, scams emanating from Southeast Asia likely result in more than $43.8 billion in losses globally each year, with Americans losing $3.5 billion in 2023 alone. This fraud, often carried out by forced labor, can also cause profound psychological distress that drives victims of scams to suicide. The United Nations has also reported that scam networks in Southeast Asia force at least 220,000 trafficked individuals to carry out online scams — a situation its experts describe as a “humanitarian and human rights crisis.”

To aid Congress in understanding the scope of Starlink’s role in transnational fraud and efforts to prevent related criminal misuse of its devices, please provide responses to the following information requests. These requests cover the time period of January 1, 2020, to the present:

1. Is SpaceX aware of reports that scam networks in Southeast Asia are using Starlink to facilitate fraud? If so, when and how did SpaceX become aware of such use?

2. What are SpaceX’s policies and procedures for investigating, deactivating, or restricting Starlink devices?

3. What guardrails, policies, or procedures are in place to prevent scam networks in Southeast Asia from acquiring — directly or indirectly — Starlink devices?

4. Has SpaceX independently identified, or taken any actions in response to, indications of misuse or improper distribution of Starlink devices by purchasers or third-party intermediaries based in Southeast Asia?

5. How many third-party reports or complaints has SpaceX received concerning Starlink use in scam networks in Southeast Asia? Please break down this number by the entity issuing the report or complaint, including United States federal agencies, United Nations offices or agencies, or multilateral organizations.

a. How many of these complaints or reports, if any, led SpaceX to investigate, deactivate, or restrict Starlink devices?

b. In total, how many devices has SpaceX investigated, deactivated, or restricted due to their use in Southeast Asian scam networks?

c. How many devices has SpaceX investigated, deactivated, or restricted due to their use in fraudulent activity generally?

6. What vulnerabilities, if any, has SpaceX identified in Starlink's security protocols that bad actors, including criminal groups operating scam networks in Southeast Asia, may exploit, and what actions has the company taken to address them?

7. What steps, if any, has SpaceX taken to cooperate and work with U.S. and international law enforcement entities to address Starlink's reported use in scam networks in Southeast Asia?

8. What revenue, if any, has SpaceX generated to date related to Starlink devices that the company later investigated, deactivated, or restricted due to their use in scam networks in Southeast Asia?

'Dear Mr Elon Musk, Starlink satellite internet services are being used by criminals in Southeast Asia to scam Americans of billions,' says the letter from Democratic senator Maggie Hassan to Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. In the long letter, Hassan urges SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to block transnational criminal groups in Southeast Asia from using Starlink satellite internet service to commit fraud against Americans. Hassan cited United Nations and other recent reports to support her claim that Starlink is being used to facilitate fraud against Americans by a broad range of transnational criminal organizations operating ""scam compounds"" in Southeast Asia. The letter asks SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to respond by August 18, 2025.","U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan sent a letter to Starlink CEO Elon Musk.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells 202,797 company shares under a pre-arranged ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-sells-202797-company-shares-under-a-pre-arranged-/articleshow/122972408.cms,"Explained: What is is a rule 10b5-1 trading plan

How the plan works



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells $36.4 million in stock



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has recently sold 202,797 shares of the company's stock worth approximately $39 million. According to the filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the transactions were executed between July 24 to July 28. The shares were sold at prices ranging from $172.07 to $176.37, near Nvidia’s 52-week high of $177. Despite this sale of stock, Huang still owns more than 73.8 million shares of the company. This recent sale of stock by Huang is part of a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan which was adopted by the Nvidia CEO in March this year. The trading plan is created to allow company insiders to sell shares without facing any accusations of insider trading. The sale is said to be a part of a planned disinvestment strategy by Huang. However, the key to understanding these sales lies in the nature of a Rule 10b5-1 plan.The rule 10b5-1 is a regulation created by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The rule enables the corporate insiders to sell company shares via a predefined trading plan. It also acts as an affirmative defense against the charges of insider trading.- Pre-planned transitions: The plan enable the insiders to establish a written trading plan at a time when they are not in possession of material non-public information (MNPI) about their company.- Specific parameters: The plan must also reveal the amount, price and date of trades or include a formula for determining them.- No discretion: Once the plan is established, after the insider cannot exercise any influence over the trades. The transactions are they automatically executed as per the pre-set schedule.- Transparency: These trading plans are disclosed publicly via the SEC filings in order to provide transparency to the market.The main objective of the rule 10b5-1 trading plan is to enable insiders to diversify their portfolios, manage liquidity and meet personal financial obligations. So, in case of Nvidia CEO selling stocks under a Rule 10b5-1 plan suggest that these transactions were scheduled well in advance before the recent market developments or company-specific news.This is the second time in July that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold the company stocks. Earlier in July, Huang sold 225,000 shares of company stock worth around $36.4 million. According to the recent filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the transactions were executed between July 8 and July 10. This transaction made by Huang follows the previous batch of stock which he sold in June this year. Last month Huang offloaded 1,00,000 shares in the span of two days.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold 202,797 shares of the company's stock worth approximately $39 million.

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes. His rise underscores a shift in Silicon Valley’s power dynamics—where disciplined execution rivals disruptive invention. As Alphabet charts its future, Pichai’s story stands as a model for aspiring global leaders in tech and beyond.","Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. His rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122897715,imgsize-35776,width-400,resizemode-4/Sundar-Pichai-joins-the-billionaire-club-after-leading-Google-for-over-a-decade-his-net-worth-is.jpg"
TCS layoffs: Former Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani quotes Sholay line and sends a message to techies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tcs-layoffs-former-tech-mahindra-ceo-cp-gurnani-quotes-sholay-line-and-sends-a-message-to-techies/articleshow/122970365.cms,"A sector in transition



Time to change the working model



Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) recently announced its plans to lay off 12,000 employees which is roughly 2% of its workforce. Now, former Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani has shared a thought-provoking message to the Indian tech industry. Quoting the iconic dialogue from popular Bollywood film Sholay “Kitney aadmi the?... Thank God that period will be over.” Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Gurnani has urged the tech industry to move beyond the obsession of headcount and embrace outcome-based models. Gurnani stresses on a shift from the traditional pyramid-style delivery system which has long been associated with Indian IT. He further emphasise that the Indian tech industry should prioritise enhanced productivity, specialised skills, and advanced technological capabilities.During the recent round of layoffs, TCS insists that the job cuts are not driven by AI but by skill mismatch and the need to realign talent with emerging business demands. TCS CEO K Krithivasan also clarified that the decision of the company is majorly driven by deployment feasibility and not productive gains from AI.Apart from TCS, other India IT companies including Infosys and Wipro have also witnessed a decline in headcounters from over 12,000 and 25,000, respectively, in the past two years. Additional, HCLTech also announced restructuring at the company due to location and skill mismatches. Also, experts suggest that the roles such as low level coding, testing and documentation have now become obsolete.For decades, India's IT prowess has been built on its vast talent pool. However, as global demands shift towards more complex, niche, and AI-driven solutions, the emphasis is increasingly on quality over quantity. Former Nassscom chairman Ganesh Natarajan also spoke in support of Gurnani’s viewpoint. Natarajan called the pyramid model as ‘Jurassic Park material’. He also feels that agentic AI — software that autonomously performs complex tasks—will force companies to rethink team structures and delivery models.Analyst are also of the viewpoint that the layoffs may also increase due to the market share shifts and vendor consolidation, not just automation. The entry level jobs at BPO and customer service roles are the most vulnerable.CP Gurnani’s message aims to encourage Indian tech professionals to upskill and reskill and embrace new technologies.","CP Gurnani has urged the tech industry to move beyond the obsession of headcount and embrace outcome-based models.

India-Russia ties

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Thursday took a sharp jab at India and Russia, suggesting that the two nations could ""take their dead economies down together.""In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, ""I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India — their tariffs are too high, among the highest in the world. Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together.""He added, ""Let’s keep it that way, and tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia who thinks he’s still President, to watch his words. He’s entering very dangerous territory!""This comes after former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that Trump is playing ""the ultimatum game"" with Russia, and that such an approach could lead to a war involving the United States.""Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with (Trump's) own country,"" he said.Earlier, Trump announced a 25% tariff on all goods imported from India, along with an unspecified penalty, from August 1 after the two countries failed to reach an interim trade deal, triggering nervousness among exporters.After making several claims over the last four months of having got India to agree to slash tariffs, Trump took to social media to announce the stiff duties and linked the action to India's high trade surplus with the US and purchase of Russian oil and arms""Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.""Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE — ALL THINGS NOT GOOD! INDIA WILL THEREFORE BE PAYING A TARIFF OF 25%, PLUS A PENALTY FOR THE ABOVE, STARTING ON AUGUST FIRST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. MAGA!"" he said.Meanwhile, India has made it clear that it will put national interest first in finalising any trade agreement. “The Government attaches the utmost importance to protecting and promoting the welfare of our farmers, entrepreneurs, and MSMEs. The government will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest, as has been the case with other trade agreements including the latest Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the UK,” a statement from the ministry of commerce & industry reads.""The government has said that it is assessing the impact of the 25% tariffs and also added that trade deal negotiations have been ongoing with US. “Over recent months, both India and the United States have participated in discussions aimed at establishing an equitable and reciprocally advantageous trade agreement. The commitment towards achieving this goal remains steadfast,” it said.India’s access to discounted Russian crude oil has grown significantly, rising from less than 2% of total imports before the Ukraine conflict to over 40% by June 2024. Indian companies have also exported refined products made from Russian crude, with some shipments reportedly reaching Western markets.The two countries also maintain cooperation in the nuclear energy sector, built on a long-standing partnership.Russia has remained a key defence supplier to India, offering weapons at relatively lower costs, often without end-user restrictions, and providing sensitive technologies that are not readily available from other countries.","US President Donald Trump took a sharp jab at India and Russia, suggesting that the two nations could ""take their dead economies down together"" Trump announced a 25% tariff on all goods imported from India, along with an unspecified penalty, from August 1 after the two countries failed to reach an interim trade deal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123010724,imgsize-1298845,width-400,resizemode-4/123010724.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded its cleanest July in more than ten years, with an average Air Quality Index (AQI) for the month standing at 79 the lowest for July since 2015, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).The air quality falls in the ‘satisfactory’ category, marking a significant improvement in the capital’s pollution levels.The improvement in air quality comes as Delhi continued to witness intermittent rainfall through the week. On Wednesday, several areas, especially in south and southeast Delhi, saw heavy rain in the late afternoon. Safdarjung, the city’s base weather station, recorded 15 mm of rainfall between 8:30 am and 5:30 pm, including 14.4 mm in the afternoon alone.With 235.2 mm of rainfall recorded this July, Delhi has already exceeded the monthly average of 209.7 mm.

The US tariff implementation of 25 per cent, while not directly affecting Indian IT services, could have significant consequences as US firms might reduce their technology expenditure due to increased costs, according to EY India's Technology Sector Leader Nitin Bhatt on Thursday.This development coincides with the Indian IT sector already facing economic uncertainties and the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ""While the Indian IT services sector isn't directly hit by the newly announced 25 per cent US tariffs, the ripple effects could be substantial. Rising input costs may prompt US companies to scale back discretionary tech spending. Simultaneously, growing unease around workforce mobility and evolving digital taxation frameworks could redefine how cross-border services are priced and delivered,"" Bhatt said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Organisations that adopt hybrid delivery approaches, expand their geographical presence, and implement AI extensively will be better equipped to handle demand fluctuations and take leadership positions in an increasingly complex global environment, according to Bhatt.TCS, India's premier IT services organisation, plans to reduce its global workforce by over 12,000 professionals, representing two per cent, this year.The company frames this as part of its strategy to become a future-ready organisation, emphasising technology investments, AI implementation, market growth, and staff restructuring.Industry analysts suggest that the redundancies at TCS could create widespread concern across the technology sector.The leading Indian IT service providers recorded single-digit revenue growth in Q1FY26, following a challenging June quarter. Global technology demand and client decision-making have been affected by economic instability and geopolitical tensions.TCS Managing Director and Chief Executive K Krithivasan recently acknowledged experiencing ""demand contraction"" due to ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, indicating that FY26 revenue growth would not reach double digits.Krithivasan noted that the decision-making delays observed in the previous quarter have ""intensified"", expressing hope that discretionary spending, crucial for IT companies' revenue growth, would resume once uncertainties diminish.","US tariff implementation of 25 per cent, while not directly affecting Indian IT services, could have significant consequences.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
