‘Domestic guests account for upto 80% of our guests now; seeing rapid growth:’ Hyatt India MD Sunjae Sharma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/domestic-guests-account-for-upto-80-of-our-guests-now-seeing-rapid-growth-hyatt-india-md-sunjae-sharma/articleshow/120051604.cms,"Sunjae Sharma, Hyatt (India & Southwest Asia) MD

NEW DELHI: Domestic travellers continue to remain the backbone for hotels in India. American hospitality major Hyatt Hotels is planning says its domestic to foreign guest ratio now goes as high as 80 to 20, as opposed to 65 to 35 in pre-Covid times. While foreign inbound is yet to return to 2019 levels in India and more people who used to holiday within the country from mid 2020 for about 2.5 years are now going abroad, domestic travel continues to remain very strong.“Our domestic to international ratio is now 70-80 to 20-30. Covid is behind is and we are seeing a double digit growth year over year in India since then. This growth is essentially fuelled by India’s young population, improved connectivity, opening of new airports, creating new destinations and a booming economy. The growth for luxury and experiential stays is rising very rapidly here. And Tier II & III cities are proving to be the engines for growth,” Sunjae Sharma, Hyatt (India & Southwest Asia) MD, told TOI.Riding high on the India success story, the American hospitality major is planning to bring its “inclusive” brands to India — Ziva and Zilara — where guests pay for everything like all meals and other services upfront and not on a piecemeal basis for services made use of. This is likely to be 20%-30% more expensive than the current average luxury tariff of Rs 20,000-30,000.Hyatt currently has over 10,000 rooms in India across 50 properties. “We will open seven this year in places like Ghaziabad, Kasauli, Kochi, Bhopal, Vithalapur and Jaipur. These destinations reflect a strategic mix of business, religious, and leisure travel, aligning with the preferences of domestic and international travellers. Hyatt will have 100 properties in India within five years,” Sharma said.""2024 marked a watershed year for Hyatt in India, with unprecedented growth and successful signing of 21 new properties across diverse markets. This momentum propels us forward, and we're committed to continued innovation and excellence in the region. We are excited to build on this momentum with even more aggressive expansion plans, reflecting our confidence in the region’s potential and our commitment to being a leader in the hospitality industry in India. The region’s travel ecosystem is evolving at a fast pace, with a growing emphasis on unique experiences, wellness, and luxury. Hyatt is well-positioned to meet these demands, and we are excited to introduce new brands and experiences that will redefine hospitality in India,” he said.","American hospitality major Hyatt Hotels is planning says its domestic to foreign guest ratio now goes as high as 80 to 20, as opposed to 65 to 35 in pre-Covid times.

"Amid language row, PM Modi asks DMK netas, ‘Why sign letters in English?’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-language-row-pm-modi-asks-dmk-netas-why-sign-letters-in-english/articleshow/120047779.cms,"Stalin skips Modi event, cites prior engagements

RAMESWARAM: PM Modi took a swipe at Tamil Nadu's governing DMK over the contentious language issue on Sunday, questioning why politicians from the state sign official letters in English. ""Tamil is a language of pride. I am surprised ... no one signs their name in Tamil,"" he said, urging them to do so.Addressing allegations from DMK-led state govt about insufficient central funds, Modi countered that BJP-led Centre had allocated three times more money to Tamil Nadu than the previous UPA administration, in which DMK was a coalition partner. ""Yet, some people have developed a habit of complaining without reason. They keep crying about issues,"" he said.Modi made the remarks while inaugurating the Pamban vertical lift railway bridge and a series of infrastructure projects worth Rs 8,000 crore across Tamil Nadu.Modi stressed his govt's commitment to Tamil Nadu's development, citing a sharp increase in railway budget allocations for the state - from Rs 900 crore before 2014 to over Rs 6,000 crore this year.Modi also flagged off a new train service between Rameswaram and Tambaram in Chennai.The comments on language come amid DMK govt's opposition to the Centre's three-language policy under NE, which it claims is a move to impose Hindi on the state. Tamil Nadu has historically resisted policies perceived as favouring Hindi over regional languages.Modi countered these concerns, saying: ""I urge everyone to at least sign their names in Tamil to honour this glorious heritage."" He reiterated the Centre's commitment to promoting Tamil globally and urged state govt to introduce medical education in the Tamil language. Modi's visit to Tamil Nadu was his first since beginning his third term as PM. CM MK Stalin did not attend, citing prior engagements in the Nilgiris.Highlighting the Centre's investments in Tamil Nadu's infrastructure, Modi said 77 railway stations, including Rameswaram, are undergoing modernisation. He said 4,000km of roads have been constructed in the state with central assistance since 2014, leading to job creation across multiple sectors.The PM also listed welfare initiatives supported by Centre, saying 12 lakh pucca houses have been built under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, more than 1 crore households have gained access to piped drinking water, and over one crore treatments have been provided under Ayushman Bharat Yojana. ""These initiatives have resulted in savings of around Rs 8,000 crore for Tamil Nadu's families,"" he said.On the recurring issue of Tamil fishermen being detained by Sri Lanka, Modi said Centre had secured the release of 3,700 fishermen over the past decade, including more than 600 in the past year alone, some of whom were facing the death sentence.","PM Modi takes a swipe at Tamil Nadu's governing DMK over the contentious language issue.

But after returning to the US, she filed a fresh case in a court there for enhancement of maintenance. The husband, thereafter, moved SC through his lawyer Prabhjit Jauhar seeking direction to his ex-wife to withdraw the proceedings filed in the US court. However, she subsequently filed an application before the US court seeking an injunction to restrain SC from proceeding.""From the perusal of the record, it is clear that after making a statement before this court, wherein the applicant (husband) agreed to settle the matter by paying a one-time maintenance amount of Rs 1 crore to her and her son,"" the bench of Justices Gavai and Masih said.""The applicant (wife) has now initiated proceedings in court of US for further maintenance.

India plans to set up nuclear submarine base in Andhra Pradesh next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-plans-to-set-up-nuclear-submarine-base-in-andhra-pradesh-next-year/articleshow/120046893.cms,"Phase-IIA of Project Seabird will enable Karwar to berth 32 warships

NEW DELHI: India plans to commission its strategic new naval base for nuclear submarines and other warships in coastal Andhra Pradesh next year, with an eye on China's ever-expanding naval forays into the Indian Ocean Region. India is also progressively upgrading the Karwar base in Karnataka on the western seaboard.The strategic base located near the small coastal village of Rambilli, about 50km south from the Eastern Naval Command headquarters at Visakhapatnam on the eastern seaboard, has underground pens and a network of tunnels to house nuclear submarines.This will enable the submarines to quietly slip into the Bay of Bengal without detection from spy satellites and quickly head towards the critical Malacca Strait and beyond on deterrent patrols.""The first phase of the Rambilli base under Project Varsha is almost complete. After commissioning in 2026, it can be expanded and upgraded in phases, much like what is under way at the Karwar base under Project Seabird,"" a source said.It has taken well over a decade for the construction of the nuclear submarine base to reach this stage after overcoming major technological, environmental and other challenges.The source said, ""The inner harbour is ready. Work on the outer harbour, with the requisite breakwaters and jetties, is in progress."" Concurrently, India this year will also commission its third nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBN in naval parlance), INS Aridhaman , with a displacement of 7,000-tonne, to add more teeth to the underwater leg of the country's nuclear triad.Slightly bigger than the first two operational SSBNs, INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, INS Aridhaman will be able to carry more K-4 missiles with a strike range of 3,500km.While a fourth submarine is also under construction under the secretive over ₹90,000 crore advanced technology vessel (ATV) project, there is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones, as reported by TOI earlier. In Oct last year, the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security also approved the construction of two 9,800-tonne nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) for ₹40,000 crore.The eventual plan is for six SSNs, which are armed with non-nuclear missiles and other weapons for conventional warfare. On the West coast, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday inaugurated additional operational, repair and logistic facilities worth over 2,000 crore under Project Seabird at the Karwar naval base, which provides the Navy with both strategic depth and operational flexibility, especially against Pakistan.Already the home base for over a dozen frontline warships, the completion of the ongoing Phase-IIA of Project Seabird will enable Karwar to berth 32 major warships and submarines as well as 23 yard-craft. A dual-use naval air station, a full-fledged naval dockyard, four covered dry berths and logistics for ships and aircraft are also part of this phase of construction.After Phase-IIB, currently in the planning stage, the Karwar base spread over a 25-km expanse will be capable of basing 50 warships and submarines as well as 40 auxiliary craft, which will also go a long way in decongesting the Mumbai harbour.",India plans to commission its strategic new naval base for nuclear submarines and other warships in coastal Andhra Pradesh next year.

Maha Kumbh flips the plate as eateries go fully veg in UP towns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maha-kumbh-flips-the-plate-as-eateries-go-fully-veg-in-up-towns/articleshow/120047673.cms,"(With Inputs from Arshad Afzaal Khan in Ayodhya & Rajeev Mani in Prayagraj)

Faith is on the menu in UP's sacred triangle and the writing's on the wall - or rather, the signboards - as it's all about going veggie. The transformation of 'Sanjha Chulha' was as luminous as the bright red signboard that announced it. For 25 years, the popular eatery on Varanasi-Lucknow highway had been a must-stop for lovers of rich, meaty delicacies.But as Maha Kumbh approached, owner Sanjeev Jaiswal found himself watching potential customers hesitate at the threshold. ""We have been popular for our non-veg food. ""We have always kept the kitchens and utensils separate,"" he said. ""Yet, in the months before Kumbh, I noticed people turning away. It was a tough call, but a necessary one.""A week before the sacred gathering began, a fresh sign with green letters on a white background flickered to life below the original signboard - this one bearing the words: PURE VEG . The move proved to be nothing short of a masterstroke. Through the 45-day event and beyond, the restaurant bustled with pilgrims eager for a meal that aligned with their spiritual journey.The sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal, rejuvenated by grand temple projects, has seen its culinary landscape undergo a shift dictated not by chefs or connoisseurs but by faith itself. Two phrases - 'PURE VEG' or 'Shudh Shakahari' - now dominate the signage of eateries in Varanasi, Ayodhya, and Prayagraj.""It's not that people have suddenly abandoned non-vegetarian food,"" said Shankar Shastri, a tourist from Maharashtra. ""But when they come to pay obeisance to Baba Kashi Vishwanath, they choose to go vegetarian. Even the assurance of separate utensils doesn't convince them otherwise.""The shift wasn't merely a passing trend. The winds of change first began stirring in Dec 2021, with rejuvenation of Kashi Vishwanath Dham. They gathered force with consecration of Ram Lalla's idol in Ayodhya in Jan 2024 and completion of the Vindhyachal corridor. The rise of this spiritual triangle reshaped not just the flow of pilgrims but the very nature of food market in the region.""Emergence of Kashi-Ayodhya-Vindhya circuit as a major pilgrimage route between 2022 and 2024 changed everything,"" said Gokul Sharma, president of Banaras Hotels' Association. ""Pilgrims now make up over 80% of the total visitors, and prefer pure vegetarian food.""The impact was felt at every level of food industry. Hotels, even those that traditionally catered to international tourists, noticed a stark shift in demand. ""Among domestic tourists, veg-to-non-veg ratio, which was once evenly split, is now 80:20,"" said Rajiv Rai, general manager of a well-known Varanasi hotel.In Ayodhya, the transformation was more absolute. Eateries that once offered a mix of cuisines transitioned entirely to vegetarian menus ahead of consecration of Ram Lalla's idol. Even global chains adapted - Domino's, for instance, serves only vegetarian food in the town.The shift extended to larger commercial spaces as well. Atul Singh, owner of Ayodhya's Mall of Avadh, recalled how the food court once had non-vegetarian options. ""We served non-veg food before, but we decided to go fully vegetarian,"" he said.Vishal, owner of the newly built Hotel Maan Awadh, initially hired a chef from New Delhi known for his meat dishes. ""But I had to replace him with a pure vegetarian chef later,"" he said.Nowhere was the change more dramatic than in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh, where even household kitchens went meat-free. ""During Kumbh, almost 80-85% of hotels and restaurants turned vegetarian,"" said Harjinder Singh, president of Prayagraj Hotels and Restaurants Welfare Association. The city, which has around 400 restaurants and 280 hotels - not counting roadside eateries - saw an overwhelming shift towards vegetarianism.As the tides of pilgrims receded, so did the absoluteness of change in some places. In Prayagraj, many eateries that had turned exclusively vegetarian during Kumbh have since reverted. ""There was no demand for non-vegetarian food, so we adapted,"" said Raju Jaiswal, owner of a restaurant in city. ""But now that things are back to normal, we serve both options again.""Still, the broader transformation of the region's food culture remains undeniable. The power of faith is rewriting menus, reshaping businesses, and illuminating cities and roads with the unmistakable glow of three simple letters: VEG.","The sacred triangle of Kashi, Ayodhya, and Vindhyachal has seen its culinary landscape undergo a shift dictated not by chefs or connoisseurs but by faith itself.

MADURAI/T'PURAM: CPM politburo member Mariam Alexander Baby was appointed Sunday as the party's new general secretary, becoming only the second from Kerala to hold the position after the state's first CM EMS Namboodiripad. Baby, 71, succeeded the late Sitaram Yechury at CPM's 24th congress in Madurai.Former general secretary Prakash Karat , who briefly served as interim coordinator following Yechury's passing in Sept 2024, has been dropped from the politburo along with his wife Brinda Karat, Tripura ex-CM Manik Sarkar, Surjya Kanta Mishra, Subhashini Ali and G Ramakrishnan. But, sources said, the Karats and Manik Sarkar will serve as special invitees to the central committee in an advisory role.The party's central committee and congress approved the politburo's recommendation for Baby's appointment.

NEW DELHI: The first week of April has set the tone for a punishing summer across north India, with Delhi, parts of Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan already experiencing unusually high temperatures and heatwave-like conditions. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast more intense heat in the coming days, prompting state administrations to swing into action.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 38.2°C on Sunday—3.1 degrees above the seasonal average—while the minimum dipped to 18.5°C, which is 1.5 degrees below normal, according to the IMD. Relative humidity oscillated between 43% and 27%, and the weather department has warned of heatwave conditions on Monday with the mercury likely to touch 41°C. A minimum of 21°C is expected.Air quality continues to worsen in the capital, with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reporting an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 209 at 4 pm—classified as ‘poor.’The IMD has issued a grim forecast for Uttar Pradesh, projecting prolonged periods of extreme heat through April, May, and June.

Amit Shah to pay tribute at Raigad amid Aurangzeb legacy row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amit-shah-to-pay-tribute-at-raigad-amid-aurangzeb-legacy-row/articleshow/120047637.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid the political storm surrounding debates over Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's legacy, Union home and cooperation minister Amit Shah is set to visit the historic Raigad Fort on April 12 to pay homage to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on his death anniversary.The timing of the visit is significant, as recent weeks have witnessed heated political exchanges and public discourse over historical narratives, especially regarding figures like Aurangzeb. Shah's tribute at Raigad is being viewed as a strong symbolic gesture, reaffirming the central government's alignment with the legacy of Shivaji Maharaj, often portrayed as a national hero who valiantly resisted Mughal expansion.Raigad Fort, once the capital of the Maratha Empire under Shivaji Maharaj, stands as a powerful reminder of a golden era marked by valor, governance, and visionary leadership. Every stone of this hilltop fortress echoes stories of strategic brilliance and resilience. The fort not only served as the administrative nerve cntre of the Maratha Empire but also as a monument to Shivaji Maharaj's enduring legacy of swarajya (self-rule).Political observers suggest that Shah's visit is also aimed at energising the party's base in Maharashtra, a state with deep-rooted reverence for Shivaji Maharaj. With elections on the horizon, invoking Shivaji's legacy may serve both cultural and political objectives.As the political narrative intensifies, the visit to Raigad could further polarise opinions on historical interpretations - a strategy that has often played out on India's complex political chessboard.The visit is expected to draw significant public attention and participation, with state BJP functionaries and local dignitaries likely to accompany the Union minister during the ceremonial tribute.","Union home and cooperation minister Amit Shah is set to visit the historic Raigad Fort on April 12 to pay homage to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

According to Section 71 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, Justice Ghosh interpreted that an order granting performance of an agreement is executable under the Code of Civil Procedure and may be executed by putting the debtor in civil prison or by attachment of his sale and property, or both.In 2013, a man purchased a tractor from an automobile showroom in Hooghly. Of the total cost of Rs 7.78 lakh, the buyer paid Rs 10,000 in advance. He then paid Rs 5.30 lakh by taking loan from a finance company. A sum of Rs 2.18 lakh remained due. It was agreed that the vehicle's registration certificate would be handed over once he paid the due amount.The man later paid Rs 1.93 lakh and only Rs 25,716 remained due. But since he failed to pay the monthly instalments, the finance company took possession of the vehicle in 2015, and sold it off to another individual.The buyer lodged a complaint before the consumer forum in 2018, which directed the automobile seller to hand over the registration certificate and release the tractor after receiving the Rs 25,716 due within 30 days. The buyer filed an execution case, and a warrant of arrest was issued against the branch manager on Dec 19, 2019.It was the branch manager's case that he had no idea of the ongoing case as he was not made a party to either of the proceedings and only came to know when the arrest warrant was issued. The legal issue before the Calcutta high court was to decide if the consumer forum had the authority to issue an arrest warrant against him in the execution proceeding.","A consumer forum cannot issue an arrest warrant like a criminal court.

NEW DELHI: The work generated under flagship job scheme MGNREGA in the last financial year was less than 2023-24, but still above the pre-pandemic level that is viewed as the reference point for normal demand for distress labour.In 2024-25, the job scheme recorded just over 288 crore persondays of work, and the figure on March 31 will be revised upwards with the updating of the data by April-end. Still, it will be much below the 312 crore persondays generated in 2023-24.However, the work under the job scheme in the previous two years is much above the 265 crore persondays generated in 2019-20, the year before the Covid pandemic.In 2020-21, a halt to economic activities in the wake of the pandemic and a nationwide lockdown sent the rural populace to MGNREGS work sites in hordes, and the demand for work went through the roof. The work generated that year recorded an all-time high of around 389 crore persondays. The return of migrant workers back to their home states was another reason for high work demand under the scheme.While the demand for work under the job scheme has come down since, it is still to reach the normal levels before the burst of the pandemic. The higher work demand has been widely viewed as a sign of rural distress , as traditional employment centres took time to return to their full capacity.The fall in work generated in 2024-25 as compared to 2023-24 can be seen as further improvement in rural distress, as govt has repeatedly claimed in recent months.But experts working on the scheme argue that depressed budget has played a role in controlling the demand for work. The rural development ministry has kept the budget for MGNREGS at around Rs 86,000-89,000 crore over the last two years. While the scheme is demand-driven and govt is bound to provide funds to meet the expenditure incurred above the initial budgetary allocation, it is argued that lower budget in the initial announcement results in state govts and district officials taking a cue and depressing the demand through delays - a reason why non-governmental experts advocate higher allocations in the budget without waiting for ""revised estimates"".In 2025-26, the allocation of Rs 86,000 would be much lesser as the ministry has a deficit of around Rs 29,000 crore from 2024-25, a small part of which could be the liability of states.",The work generated under flagship job scheme MGNREGA in the last financial year was less than 2023-24.

While the transaction volume is estimated to be in crores, the amount has not been disclosed yet.Police have arrested 21 people, including 19 from Srinagar, in connection with the scam, Hussain said Sunday.A mule account is a third-party bank account used to move money obtained through illegal means. Cybercriminals recruit people — often through social media platforms like Facebook and Telegram — to open these accounts, which remain active for just a day or two. During this time, illicit funds are deposited before the accounts are quickly closed, Hussain said.“These mule accounts have become a primary channel for laundering money obtained through cyber fraud,” the SSP said. “They are opened on a commission basis and used to obscure financial trails.”Many of the accounts belong to people, shell companies, or enterprises but are controlled remotely by fraudsters operating outside J&K or even overseas, according to police. Once the accounts are active, funds are rapidly transferred to other accounts or converted into cryptocurrency to complicate tracking.Four FIRs have been filed to investigate the use of mule accounts and most cases are emerging from Srinagar and Jammu, Hussain said.“We are going to question everyone who opened such accounts. They will be asked who directed them to open these accounts,” he said, ruling out the possibility that people were unaware their names were being used. “These accounts require signatures and official documents of the account holders.”The investigation into mule accounts has uncovered cases where Indians were lured abroad under false job offers.Eleven Kashmiris, including a woman, were among more than 600 Indians rescued from scam call centres in Myanmar’s Myawaddy region in March. They were airlifted from Mae Sot airport in northwest Thailand, bordering Myanmar.“These young people applied for jobs through advertisements on Facebook and Telegram. They submitted resumes, went through interviews, and were sent tickets to fly to the Myanmar,” Hussain said. “However, some of these companies were run by cybercriminals who trapped and exploited them to run scams.”The cybercrime syndicates lure foreign workers, particularly targeting those with IT skills, with fake job offers and lucrative salaries.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi while inaugurating the new Pamban rail sea-bridge in Tamil Nadu ’s Rameswaram on Sunday spoke about the Gujarat link to the old bridge and its replacement.“A hundred years ago, the old Pamban bridge was built by a man born in Gujarat. Today, after 100 years, the new Pamban bridge has been inaugurated by someone born in Gujarat,” he said, which received huge applause from public.Sources said the construction of the old Pamban bridge, inaugurated in 1914, involved Gujarat-based contractor Karoji Kutz. The project on the Palk Strait utilised 2,000 tonnes of steel and involved 200 workers. During the construction of the old bridge, now abandoned, materials were lost due to a severe cyclone and high waves. Even cholera impacted the labour force.The decision to build the bridge was taken by the British during a meeting at Dhanushkodi in TN in Nov 1908. The bridge was completed in Dec 1913 and was inaugurated on Feb 25, 1914, by Lord John Sinclair, the first Baron Pentland, who was the governor of Madras from 1912 to 1919.The bridge had provision to allow ships to pass beneath it. The Pamban rail bridge was the sole link between Mandapam and Rameswaram for decades until a parallel road bridge was built in 1988.","The decision to build the bridge was taken by the British during a meeting at Dhanushkodi in TN in Nov 1908.

4. Global Commodity Prices Plunge

5. Safe Havens in Focus

Stock market crash today: It’s bloodbath on Monday! BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, crashed in trade on Monday. Both stock market indices plunged over 4%. At 9:52 AM, BSE Sensex was trading at 72,707.11, down 2,658 points or 3.53%. Nifty50 was trading at 22,041.95, down 863 points or 3.77%.The top BSE Sensex losers were Tata Steel (-10%), Tata Motors (-7.86%), Infosys (-6.98%), Tech Mahindra (-6.36%) and L&T (-6.45%). All thirteen sectors experienced declines. Technology firms, with substantial revenue exposure to the United States, declined by 7%. The wider market segments comprising smaller and medium-sized enterprises registered falls of 6.2% and 4.6%, respectively.The combined market capitalisation of companies listed on the BSE saw a reduction of Rs 19.4 lakh crore, bringing the total value to Rs 383.95 lakh crore.According to Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, “Globally markets are going through heightened volatility caused by extreme uncertainty. No one has a clue about how this turbulence caused by Trump tariffs will evolve. Wait and watch would be the best strategy in this turbulent phase of the market.”Vijayakumar says there are a few things that investors should keep in mind. “One, the irrational Trump tariffs will not continue for long. Two, India is relatively better placed since India’s exports to the US as percentage of GDP is only around 2 percent and therefore the impact on India’s growth will not be significant. Three, India is negotiating a Bilateral Trade Agreement with the US and this is likely to be successful resulting in lower tariffs for India.”“Domestic consumption themes like financials, aviation, hotels, select autos, cement , defence and digital platform companies are likely to come out relatively unscathed from the ongoing crisis. Trump is unlikely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals since he is on the back foot now and, therefore, this segment is likely to show resilience,” he added.The week ahead has crucial domestic and global events, with international investors monitoring trade-related developments closely. On the domestic front, the MPC meeting conclusion on April 9 will be pivotal, followed by important economic indicators—IIP and CPI data—scheduled for April 11. The quarterly earnings season commences with TCS presenting its results on April 10.The Nasdaq index moved into bear market territory on Friday, declining over 20% from its latest high point. This followed the extensive tariff announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump, raising concerns about worldwide economic deceleration. The comprehensive nature of these tariffs caught market participants off guard, leading to substantial declines across international financial markets.The Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell noted that the tariffs exceeded anticipated levels and cautioned about their potential effects on inflation and economic expansion, contributing to the unclear prospects for the U.S. economy.The Indian stock markets reflected the broader international decline, with significant drops across Asian exchanges. The Japanese Nikkei recorded a 7% fall, whilst South Korea's Kospi declined by 5%, and the Chinese blue-chip index decreased by nearly 7%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng experienced a substantial reduction of over 10.5%.Concurrently, American futures showed continued weakness, with Nasdaq futures declining 4% and S&P 500 futures showing a 3.1% reduction. The European futures markets also displayed significant negative movement.Investors are increasingly worried about an economic downturn rather than immediate inflation challenges. The upcoming U.S. consumer price index (CPI) report is projected to show a 0.3% rise for March. However, experts anticipate that impending tariffs will lead to substantial cost increases across various industries, affecting everything from food items to vehicles.As the earnings season commences, businesses are likely to face pressure on their profit margins due to higher operational expenses. Approximately 87% of U.S. firms will disclose their financial results between April 11 and May 9, with financial institutions leading the announcements.The worldwide commodities market experienced substantial losses due to concerns about reduced demand and potential economic contraction.The price of Brent crude decreased by 6.5%, while WTI saw a 7.4% reduction. Precious metals weren't spared, with gold declining 2.4% and silver dropping 7.3%. Industrial metals also experienced significant reductions, as copper fell 6.5%, zinc decreased 2%, and aluminium declined 3.2%, reflecting investors' unease about trade disputes and recession possibilities.Market participants shifted towards secure investments as concerns about a worldwide economic downturn intensified, creating additional pressure on stock markets. Strong demand for government securities pushed the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield down by 8 basis points to 3.916%. Trading in Fed funds futures increased, indicating expectations of an additional 25-basis-point reduction in rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve within the year.The widespread move towards secure assets resulted in extensive selling across equity markets, as cautious sentiment spread throughout global trading venues. Although Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated on Friday that the central bank remains patient regarding policy changes, market projections now suggest a 56% likelihood of a rate reduction by May.","BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, crashed in trade on Monday.

From country roots to business mogul: How Taylor Swift built her billion-dollar empire

Taylor Swift has officially joined the elite club of billionaires in 2025, solidifying her status not just as a global pop phenomenon but also as a masterful businesswoman. According to Forbes’ latest World’s Billionaires list, Swift now boasts a net worth of $1.6 billion—largely thanks to her record-shattering Eras Tour and savvy control over her musical empire.While other stars like Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, and Rihanna made headlines for their ventures into beauty, fashion, and media, Taylor Swift’s rise is unique. She didn’t build her wealth through brand endorsements or business acquisitions alone—she did it with songwriting, performing, and reclaiming her artistry. Her 2023–2024 Eras Tour alone grossed over $2 billion across 149 shows in 21 countries, making it the highest-grossing tour in history.With 13 albums hitting No. 1—including “Reputation,” “Midnights,” and “1989 (Taylor’s Version)”—Swift’s music is not just topping charts but also generating massive revenue streams from sales, streaming, and licensing deals. Unlike many of her peers, Swift owns the masters of her re-recorded albums, giving her a larger slice of the financial pie than most artists ever see.Swift’s journey began in country music, but her evolution into a genre-blending global superstar came with equally strategic business acumen. Her re-recording campaign was not just a statement of artistic independence—it turned into a billion-dollar blueprint. Beyond music, Swift has leveraged her influence with precision, keeping endorsements minimal and instead turning her image into a brand of authenticity.In a testament to her character, Swift recently donated $5 million toward relief efforts for Hurricanes Milton and Helene, underscoring her belief in using wealth for meaningful impact.Even as billionaires like Kim Kardashian dominate fashion with SKIMS and Rihanna with Fenty Beauty, it’s Swift who is now being compared to moguls like Oprah and Jay-Z. Her business approach, built on integrity, ownership, and creativity, sets her apart.Also Read: Sadie Sink finally breaks silence on age-gap controversy in Taylor Swift's All Too Well short film In a list filled with actors, reality stars, and entrepreneurs, Swift remains a standout—proof that artistic integrity, combined with a relentless work ethic, can be just as powerful as boardroom deals.","According to Forbes’ latest World’s Billionaires list, Taylor Swift now boasts a net worth of $1.6 billion.

Soma Das, a cancer survivor and teacher, is the only one among 25,753 teachers whose job was spared after the Supreme Court upheld the Calcutta High Court's decision to scrap the appointments of the others due to a job scam.

Despite her personal relief, Soma Das expressed sorrow over the impending job losses of her colleagues, emphasizing that their struggle for employment was also her battle.

Das highlighted the failure of the School Service Commission in providing proper documentation, which contributed to the situation affecting many deserving teachers who were qualified for their positions.

But she is not.The cancer survivor is the sole teacher (among the 25,753) whose job is not on the chopping block after the apex court on Thursday upheld the Calcutta High Court decision to scrap appointments of 25,752 teachers.

Das, who now teaches at Modhura High School in Birbhum, told TOI over the phone.""I cracked the exam based on merit, and my name was on the merit panel. However, I got the appointment based on the HC order passed by former HC judge Abhijit Ganguly, which, on humanitarian grounds, the Supreme Court upheld,"" she added. ""I know there are many deserving teachers who fought for a long time to get this appointment. They don't deserve this fate. It's a complete failure of the SSC, which was unable to submit proper documents despite getting adequate time for that,"" Das said.""I never wanted others to lose jobs. Their battle was mine too. This verdict is not acceptable to me as many others on the panel were qualified. Due to some negligence on the part of the govt and SSC, it was not possible to separate the qualified and the ineligible,"" Das said.Das joined the Birbhum school following an April 18, 2022, order passed by the former HC judge Ganguly. She has to spend a huge amount of money on her follow-up treatment, which is continuing. ""This job is the only option for me and my family to survive because my brother is still preparing for govt jobs. As a lower middle-class family, a govt job is the only option for us to survive,"" she added.""In our school, two teachers are on this list.

Inside Jordon Hudson’s 24th birthday bash and how she’s honoring Bill Belichick’s latest coaching move



Jordon Hudson ’s 24th birthday wasn’t just about cakes and candles—it became a heartfelt celebration of love, loyalty, and life’s unexpected journeys. The former college cheerleader and current partner of legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick used her special day to offer a unique tribute to the man who has stood beside her despite the headlines, criticism, and their 48-year age gap.On April 4, Jordon Hudson took to Instagram to showcase a thoughtful snapshot: a bouquet of red roses and a University of North Carolina basketball jersey with “Jordon” emblazoned above the number 24. It wasn’t just a birthday nod—it was a clever homage to her own age and Michael Jordan’s college legacy, all while acknowledging Belichick’s new beginning with the Tar Heels. The jersey symbolized more than a gift—it marked her deep-rooted support for Belichick as he transitions into his first-ever college football coaching role.It’s not the first time Hudson has publicly backed her partner. After facing online scrutiny over their relationship, she shared a bold message on Instagram in December 2024: ""Nothing changed for us in 2024 except for 'public knowledge': yet somehow everything changed. Going strong. I can't wait to take punches for you in 2025. Keep swinging, Keyboard Warriors. Your illusion of righteousness only fuels my authenticity."" Her statement echoed the kind of emotional resilience that often keeps high-profile relationships afloat.The pair's journey began in an unlikely setting—on a flight to Florida in February 2021. Hudson, then a college student with a passion for philosophy, had Belichick sign her “Deductive Logic” textbook. He penned a note that read, “Thanks for giving me a course on logic! Safe travels! Bill Belichick,” complete with Super Bowl win numbers. That simple exchange bloomed into a connection that, despite public skepticism, has only grown stronger.In February 2025, Jordon Hudson commemorated their four-year “meetiversary” with a post saying, “Happy Meetiversary @billbelichick — Cheers 🥂 to the fact that you still let me give you lengthy philosophical lectures four years later.” A slideshow accompanied the caption, featuring a touching photo of the couple holding hands during Super Bowl week in New Orleans.Her recent birthday post also included a stylish red beaded handbag by STAUD, inspired by the Year of the Snake—a nod to Hudson’s creative side. Fans have often seen glimpses of her DIY flair, whether it’s bedazzling a UNC sweatshirt or crafting a rhinestone lobster purse to raise awareness for Maine fishermen.While Belichick is gearing up for his new role at UNC, their life together continues to reflect a delicate balance between legacy and love. From philosophical musings to beachside antics—like the viral ""Billates"" workout where Hudson was seen balanced on Belichick’s feet—the couple is redefining what it means to navigate fame and age differences with grace, humor, and authenticity.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers left more than memories for Olivia Munn — a haunting truth she can’t shake Their story proves that sometimes, love takes off in the most unexpected places—like 30,000 feet in the air—and lands in a partnership that neither logic nor judgment can define.","Jordon Hudson celebrated her 24th birthday on April 4 with a thoughtful tribute to her partner.

With Grand Theft Auto 6 poised to take over the gaming world this fall, big studios are racing to launch their largest games before Rockstar 's highly anticipated behemoth. From Death Stranding 2 to Mafia: The Old Country , a number of high-profile titles are now planned for summer 2025, as publishers don't want to compete with what promises to be the most impactful release of the year.GTA 6, announced for a fall 2025 launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, is already promising to be one of the decade's biggest game launches. With Rockstar's track record for producing genre-bending open-world games, other developers are already actively shifting their release dates to stay out of the shadows., developed by Hideo Kojima's Kojima Productions, has officially been dated for a June 26, 2025 release. The follow-up is already touting an otherworldly, star-packed sequel to the original's narrative and gameplay tweaks. Likewise, 2K'sis said to be eyeing a summer 2025 launch, possibly heading back to its historical, storytelling roots.This wave of rushes during the summer season is an indication of how much GTA 6 is dominating the larger release calendar. Publishers are obviously trying to have their games reach the players before Rockstar's game necessarily takes center stage in the fall.One other significant title to be released prior to GTA 6 is, an action-thriller from Build A Rocket Boy, the developer headed by former Rockstar veteran Leslie Benzies. The title is officially being released on June 10, 2025, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.Placed in a near-future city,tracks Jacob Diaz as he uncovers a mystery involving a dominant neural implant. With narrative focus and AAA aspirations, the summer release of the game is a calculated move to avoid the saturation media coverage that GTA 6 will receive in the fall.This is not the first that studios have pushed timelines to fit in a high-profile release, but GTA 6 's existence is unique. The magnitude of anticipation has literally paved the way for a more conservative, back-loaded 2025 slate.With anticipation reaching a record high for GTA 6, the studios are making the wise choice—backing off. By releasing their biggest titles during the summer window, developers aim to get attention while it can still be gotten.

NAVI MUMBAI: Nine years after police officer Ashwini Bidre -Gore went missing, Panvel sessions court on Saturday held her colleague, inspector Abhay Kurundkar , guilty of murder. Two others who helped Kurundkar in disposing of the body were also held guilty for disappearance of evidence.Kurundkar, who was in a relationship with assistant police inspector Bidre, murdered her following a dispute in April 2016, cut her body into parts, stuffed it in a trunk and sack and dumped it in Vasai creek. The remains were never found. Judge K G Paldewar will pronounce the sentence on April 11 after hearing Bidre's father and daughter on quantum of compensation. The judge expressed surprise that Kurundkar was given the President's medal for gallanty in 2017.Holding three persons guilty of murder of woman cop Ashwini Bidre-Gore, Judge K G Paldewar said, ""It is surprising that Abhay Kurundkar, who allegedly kidnapped and murdered Ashwini Bidre-Gore in April 2016, was given the President's medal for gallantry on Republic Day. Hence, the question arises as to how the committee of the police department recommended his name for the award in spite of being aware that he was an accused in a murder case. An inquiry is necessary against the errant officers.""Kurundkar did not show any remorse when the judge announced the verdict, said Raju Gore, Bidre's estranged husband. The others convicted are Kundan Bhandari, Kurundkar's driver, and Mahesh Phalnikar, a Pune bank staffer and close friend of Kurundkar. Phalnikar collapsed in court after he was held guilty.Special public prosecutor Pradip Gharat said, ""I had demanded to frame additional charge under Section 218 (public servant framing incorrect record with intent to save a person from punishment) of IPC by arguing Kurundkar had prepared a fake log book by making false entry of timings of police patrolling vehicle at Thane rural crime department, where he was senior inspector, to claim he was on patrolling duty when the alleged murder took place.""He added, ""The technical evidence using Google map tracking gathered by investigating officer ACP Sangita Shinde Alphanso helped in proving circumstantial evidence against Kurundkar as his presence was located at Vasai creek on the day he allegedly murdered API Bidre and dumped her body parts in the creek with the help of two accused. Also, as court has reprimanded errant police officers for delay in probing the murder case allegedly under political pressure, we will ensure they face disciplinary action.""Judge Paldewar said the murder falls in the rarest of rare category. The court said Bidre's father and daughter, who were not present in court, were actual victims as they have lost a daughter and mother, and wanted to decide on their compensation. They have suffered due to the lethargic attitude of police officers responsible for the delay in registering murder case a year after she went missing, he said.Advocate Vishal Bhanushali, representing Abhay Kurundkar, Bhandari and Phalnikar, said, ""As defense counsel, I had the solemn responsibility of safeguarding legal rights and ensuring the trial conformed to the highest standards of fairness and due process. This was an intensely scrutinized and emotionally charged case, involving voluminous evidence.""",Inspector Abhay Kurundkar found guilty of murder of police officer Ashwini Bidre-Gore.

Meta confirms: ‘Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC…’

Jeff Bezos, former Google CEO and other tech moguls who have brought houses in Washington

Jeff Bezos purchased a $23 million Kalorama mansion in 2016.

Peter Thiel bought a $13 million beaux-arts residence in 2021.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

PayPal co-founder David Sacks, now a White House advisor, purchased a $10.3 million Northwest DC penthouse.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

Poll Do you believe that reciprocal tariffs are a fair trade practice? No, they are not fair Yes, they are fair

US markets plunge



Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk lost a combined $42.6 billion in a single day after US President Donald Trump announced a fresh wave of tariffs that shook global markets. According to data from Forbes, Facebook-parent Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg suffered the biggest loss, with his wealth dropping by $17.9 billion on Thursday, April 3. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos followed with a $16 billion decline, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk saw his net worth fall by $8.7 billion.The losses came after President Trump introduced a new set of “discounted” reciprocal tariffs, which triggered panic on Wall Street. The announcement led to one of the worst trading days in recent years, with all major US stock indexes recording their biggest single-day drops since the COVID-19 pandemic. The sharp selloff reflects growing investor concern over the impact of tariffs on business costs, global trade, and tech sector performance.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth dropped by $7.4 billion, while Microsoft founder Bill Gates saw a one-day loss of $774 million.Alphabet co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin lost $4.9 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also faced a decline, with his wealth falling by $18 million. Apple CEO Tim Cook saw his net worth decrease by $68 million during the market selloff.Wall Street hit its lowest since 2022. Overnight, the US markets took a steep hit following the announcement of new tariffs. The S&P 500 dropped 275.05 points, or 4.85 per cent, closing at 5,395.92. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1,053.60 points, or 5.99 per cent, to 16,547.45, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined by 1,682.61 points, or 3.98 per cent, finishing at 40,542.71.Analysts at UBS said that legal challenges could arise soon against the White House’s use of executive authority to impose the tariffs. Trump announced the move under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)—a law that has not been used before for such broad changes in economic policy.""Furthermore, businesses are likely to intensify lobbying efforts. And political pressure to ease tariffs could mount as economic costs rise,"" UBS said in a note.""In our base case (to which we assign a 50 per cent probability), we would expect tariffs to be reduced from the levels announced by the President. The President himself invited negotiations, and Treasury Secretary Bessent said in a Bloomberg interview that the announced tariffs are ‘the high end of the number’ and that countries could take steps to bring tariffs down,"" the note added.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg suffered the biggest loss, with his wealth dropping by $17.9 billion.

Are Trump's reciprocal tariffs bad for China? DeepSeek says...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/are-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-bad-for-china-deepseek-says-/articleshow/119981002.cms,"DeepSeek

DeepSeek says ‘No external factors can hinder China's progress’

China has always been committed to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, adhering to the multilateral trading system, and promoting the construction of an open world economy. The Chinese government has the capability and wisdom to respond to various challenges in international trade, safeguard the interests of the nation and its people, and promote the healthy and stable development of the economy. China's development achievements are the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the concerted efforts of people of all ethnic groups across the country. No external factors can hinder China's progress and the improvement of its people's lives. China will continue to deepen reforms, expand openness, and work with other countries around the world to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

DeepSeek’s reply to “retaliatory actions that China can take against Trump's tariffs?""

China has a range of policy tools and strategic options to respond to reciprocal tariffs imposed by the U.S., ensuring the protection of its national interests while maintaining stability in global trade. Possible measures include:

1. Reciprocal Tariffs on U.S. Goods

•⁠ ⁠China could impose *targeted tariffs* on key U.S. exports such as *agricultural products (soybeans, pork), aircraft, automobiles, and energy products*.

•⁠ ⁠This would pressure politically sensitive U.S. industries, influencing domestic sentiment in key electoral states.

2. Export Controls on Critical Materials

•⁠ ⁠China dominates global supply chains in *rare earth metals* (used in electronics, defense, and green tech).

•⁠ ⁠Restrictions on rare earth exports could disrupt U.S. manufacturing, similar to measures taken in past trade disputes.

3. Non-Tariff Barriers & Regulatory Measures

•⁠ ⁠*Stricter inspections* on U.S. imports (food safety, customs delays).

•⁠ ⁠*Anti-dumping & anti-subsidy investigations* against U.S. products.

•⁠ ⁠*Preferential treatment* for non-U.S. companies in government procurement.

4. Diversifying Trade Partners (Reducing U.S. Dependence)

•⁠ ⁠*Strengthening trade with the EU, ASEAN, Africa, and Latin America* through new agreements.

•⁠ ⁠*Accelerating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)* to deepen Asia-Pacific trade ties.

5. Currency & Financial Measures

•⁠ ⁠*Allowing the yuan to depreciate* to make Chinese exports more competitive.

•⁠ ⁠*Dumping U.S. Treasury bonds* (though this is a double-edged sword).

6. Legal & WTO Challenges

•⁠ ⁠*Filing complaints at the WTO* against U.S. tariffs, as done in previous trade wars.

•⁠ ⁠*Forming alliances with other affected countries* to jointly oppose U.S. protectionism.

7. Domestic Stimulus & Self-Reliance

•⁠ ⁠*Boosting domestic consumption* to offset export losses.

•⁠ ⁠*Accelerating tech independence* (e.g., semiconductor self-sufficiency via policies like ""Made in China 2025"").

Conclusion

China has a *strategic, multi-layered approach* to counter U.S. tariffs, combining retaliatory measures with long-term economic resilience strategies. The goal is not just short-term retaliation but also reducing dependency on the U.S. market while strengthening global alliances.

US President Donald Trump ’s recent tariff announcements have reignited concerns about a potential trade war, particularly with China. The new tariffs, imposing a 54% rate on Chinese imports, threaten to disrupt numerous sectors, with technology supply chains facing significant impact. The Trump administration justifies the tariffs as a means to safeguard American industries and rectify trade imbalances, but critics express concerns about rising consumer prices and global economic instability.We asked DeepSeek , China's biggest AI disrupter in recent times, about the impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on the country, and the response was pretty neutral.When asked, “Are Tump’s reciprocal tariffs bad for China?”, DeepSeek highlighted a “mutually beneficial strategy”.On the question, “What China can do to reciprocate the reciprocal Tariffs announced by Donald Trump?”, DeepSeek replied highlighting that China possesses a diverse toolkit to counteract US tariffs, encompassing both retaliatory actions and long-term strategic adjustments aimed at protecting China's national interests and maintain global trade stability.It explained the response in 7 points. Here’s what DeepSeek said:Last year, China announced a ban on the export of key minerals to the US, a move that could significantly impact the US technology manufacturing sector. According to a Reuters report, China's export ban includes minerals such as gallium, germanium, and others.These minerals are essential components in a wide range of technologies, including semiconductors, infrared technology, fiber optic cables, solar cells, military applications (e.g., ammunition, nuclear weapons). Gallium and germanium are crucial for semiconductors, while germanium also plays a role in infrared technology, fiber optic cables, and solar cells.","DeepSeek says ‘No external factors can hinder China's progress’ China has always been committed to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, adhering to the multilateral trading system.

Soundproofing a city deafened by its clamour: Hyderabad grapples with rising noise pollution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/soundproofing-a-city-deafened-by-its-clamour-hyderabad-grapples-with-rising-noise-pollution/articleshow/119820233.cms,"Excessive honking negatively impacts decision-making and could lead to unsafe driving manouevres, says a IIIT-H study

HYDERABAD: With an increasing number of vehicles and relentless construction noise taking a toll on Hyderabad’s auditory health, experts are proposing several strategies to mitigate this often-overlooked form of pollution A recent study conducted by the International Institute of Information Technology-Hyderabad (IIIT-H) in collaboration with TOI mapped out noise hotspots across the city, revealing that noise pollution has spiralled out of control.Acoustic cameras“In 2020, traffic authorities experimented with various measures to combat noise pollution, including the installation of acoustic cameras at traffic signals,” said Lokendra Singh, popularly known as ‘ Hyderabad Traffic Man’. A volunteer with the Hyderabad City Security Council, Singh has been actively involved in designing traffic education initiatives.“These cameras were able to detect noise levels from individual vehicles, and if they exceed permissible limits, automatic challans were issued,” he said adding that although effective, it did not go ahead after Covid 19.Singh believes that public awareness campaigns play a crucial role in reducing noise pollution. Initiatives such as signboards and live demonstrations, including children covering their ears at traffic signals to highlight the impact of honking, have been used to sensitise people. “Around 70% of road noise is due to honking, most of which is unnecessary. Educating the public about this issue could solve at least 50% of the problem,” he added.As per the Motor Vehicles (Driving) Regulations Act, the unnecessary use of horns is prohibited. The act stipulates that horns should be used only when a driver perceives imminent danger to themselves or other road users.Noise measurement metersProfessor Rama Ratnam, an auditory neurologist who has studied noise pollution in the US, Europe, and now in India at Ahmedabad University, shared while comparing noise levels at intersections in the US, Europe, and India, he found that in India, noise levels were 8 to 10 times higher.“It was also discovered that the way Indian youngsters process sound is significantly weaker compared to their Western counterparts. There is a direct correlation between hearing loss, hypertension, and other irreversible health effects caused by prolonged exposure to high noise levels,” Ram stated.To address this issue, he recommended the installation of noise measurement meters at major intersections and stricter regulations on vehicle horn noise. “Authorities should also mandate that automobile manufacturers limit horn noise to a range of 55 to 65 decibels. However, imposing fines alone will not solve the issue,” he said. Ram also dismissed strategies such as increasing red signal wait times for frequent honkers, arguing that such measures could lead to chaos and disrupt emergency services. “The long-term solution lies in education, starting from a young age,” he added.More green spacesRahul Goel, a professor at IIT Delhi currently studying different forms of pollution in India, pointed out a glaring gap in noise pollution research. “Unlike air and water pollution, noise pollution remains largely understudied. It is critical that authorities and research institutions focus on this area to develop effective mitigation strategies,” Goel emphasized.One of the most effective solutions, he suggested, is increasing green spaces across Hyderabad. “Trees and vegetation act as natural noise barriers by absorbing sound. Their rigid structure reduces noise exposure for people on the streets,” he said.Addressing noise pollution from construction activities, experts recommended measures such as restricting construction hours and installing noise-dampening curtains around construction sites. They also proposed the use of soundproof materials in buildings to ensure that residents living near construction zones experience minimal disturbance.Public transport specialists highlighted the link between inadequate public transportation and rising noise levels. “Hyderabad has only 2,500 state transport buses, while its metro system accommodates around four lakh commuters daily. This deficiency has led to an increase in private vehicle ownership, exacerbating both traffic congestion and noise pollution,” said a transport expert. Strengthening the city’s public transport system, he argued, could significantly reduce vehicular noise and improve overall urban living conditions.","Excessive honking negatively impacts decision-making and could lead to unsafe driving manouevres, says a IIIT-H study.

Baby joy for Michael Schumacher’s family as daughter Gina announces birth of her child



After more than a decade marked by silence and resilience, the Schumacher family has been touched by a joyful milestone—Michael Schumacher has become a grandfather. His daughter, Gina-Maria, and her husband, Iain Bethke, recently welcomed their first child, a baby girl named Millie. The couple made the heartwarming announcement on Instagram, writing, ""Welcome to the world, Millie. Born on March 29, our hearts are fuller than ever. We are beyond blessed to have you in our lives.""The arrival of baby Millie is definitely an exciting moment of happiness for a family that has endured tremendous hardship. Since Michael Schumacher ’s tragic skiing accident in December 2013, which left the seven-time Formula 1 World Champion with severe neurological injuries, his life has largely been confined to privacy and intensive medical care. While the racing legend has not been seen publicly since, his legacy continues through his children—particularly Mick, who once raced in Formula 1 for Haas, and now Gina, who is beginning a new chapter as a mother.Gina’s journey to motherhood has been equally heartwarming. She and Iain tied the knot in September 2024 in an intimate ceremony held at the Schumacher family's luxurious villa in Majorca, Spain. Though reports suggested that Michael Schumacher might have attended the wedding, his presence was never confirmed. In keeping with the family’s unwavering commitment to privacy, guests were required to surrender their phones before entering the premises—a move that ensured complete discretion. The villa, which the family reportedly purchased from Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez for £27 million, offered the perfect backdrop for their secluded celebration.Support has poured in from friends, family, and the motorsport community. Mick Schumacher took to Instagram to share his pride, simply stating, ""Proud of you."" Among those congratulating the couple was Sophie Kumpen, mother of reigning World Champion Max Verstappen, further underlining the respect the Schumacher name still commands in the F1 world.Despite his absence from the public eye, Michael Schumacher’s impact on the sport remains legendary. Now, with the birth of Millie, a new generation begins—carrying forward the Schumacher legacy not on the race tracks just yet, but through the quiet strength of a family that has always stood tall in the face of adversity.Also Read: FIA’s new circuit map aims to reduce F1 safety car delays during on-track stoppages","Michael Schumacher's daughter, Gina-Maria, and her husband, Iain Bethke, have welcomed their first child, a baby girl named Millie.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
