Inputs from Anuja Jaiswal, Lata Mishra and Eshan K

The discovery of human metapneumovirus , or HMPV, goes back to 2000, when a group of Dutch scientists set out to find what caused acute respiratory infections in humans. They found an unknown pathogen.By 2001, the Dutch scientists had sequenced the metapneumovirus using a complex mix of specialised culture and molecular techniques. But, later, serological studies (analysis of blood serum) of 28 children threw up something more interesting — the virus had been in circulation in the Netherlands since 1958. And it had spiked before. In fact, in the first months of 2023, the US recorded a spurt in HMPV detections.Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, a professor of microbiology at BJ Medical College in Pune, said: “Our bodies have adapted to their (virus’s) presence over time. In most cases, infections for all viruses remain asymptomatic or mild, but for some individuals — especially those with underlying medical conditions — they can lead to severe illness and hospitalisation. This was true for Covid-19, and it’s also true for HMPV. But unlike Covid-19, HMPV has been around for a long time and there is no evidence to suggest that it is spreading in India at a faster speed than before.”Senior expert Dr GC Khilnani, too, noted that “the virus poses significant risk to immunocompromised individuals and older adults”. Khilnani is a member of the WHO technical advisory group on global air pollution and health, and chairman of PSRI Institute of pulmonary critical care and sleep medicine.Dr Sandeep Budhiraja of Max Healthcare explained that HMPV elderly individuals with existing health conditions like diabetes, heart disease or kidney failure have to be especially careful. While healthy adults experience mild symptoms, elderly patients may develop serious complications.What are the symptoms? HMPV spreads among humans via respiratory droplets. Incubation period is believed to be between 3 and 5 days, but can vary. According to the US CDC, there is currently no specific antiviral therapy to treat HMPV and there’s no vaccine against it either. Managing the illness involves supportive care.Common cold-like symptomsPneumonia or bronchopneumoniaTesting for HMPV often involves advanced methods like the BioFire panel that can detect multiple pathogens, including HMPV, in a single test. Many private labs in India conduct this test, but the cost runs into thousands of rupees.Experts said HMPV is more common in the paediatric population, predominately in children less than two years of age.About 5% to 10% of paediatric patients may end up in hospital due to HMPV-triggered acute lower respiratory tract infections. On average, doctors say children less than 6 months old who contract HMPV infection are three times as likely to be hospitalised compared with those between 6 months and 5 years.Dr Amitav Banerjee, former field epidemiologist in the Indian Armed Forces, said: “The recent surge in China is due to ‘immunity debt’, that is, the children born during the pandemic did not get exposed to the virus in the first few months of life due to restrictive non-pharmacological interventions. They are immune naive and vulnerable, giving rise to a large number of cases.”Dr Karyakarte pointed out that the weather, too, has a role to play. “The mucus in our nasal passages, which serves as a protective barrier against pathogens, becomes less effective in cold, dry air. Reduced moisture in the mucus compromises this natural defence, making it easier for viruses to directly contact and infect nasal cells.”A pioneering 2003 study by BJ Medical College and NIV-Pune confirmed HMPV in children in Pune. The study found a 19.2% positivity rate in 26 paediatric cases. Four of the five positive cases were infants under one year. There were both mild and severe infection patterns.In a 2006 AIIMS study, 12% of children under five years with acute respiratory illness (ARI) tested positive for HMPV. Most of these cases occurred during winter months.A 2013 NIV Pune study analysed 224 clinical samples and identified multiple HMPV strains (A2, B1, and B2 lineages). A2 and B2 were found to be predominant subtypes.A 2014 Assam study found HMPV in 20 of 276 children (7.2%) under the age of 5 who had ARI symptoms. The study also noted that the highest prevalence of HMPV was detected in Jan (46.7%) followed by Dec (16.7%).A 2024 ICMR study in Gorakhpur examined 100 paediatric patients with respiratory illness of whom 4% tested positive for HMPV. Among the positive cases, one fatality was reported.➤ Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds➤ Avoid close contact with people who are sick➤ Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose with unwashed hands➤ Cover your mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing h Stay at home when sick➤ Regularly clean surfaces such as doorknobs, tables, etc","Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has been in circulation in the Netherlands since 1958.

Legislators have forgotten how to dissent respectfully: SC on neta targeting Nitish,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/legislators-have-forgotten-how-to-dissent-respectfully-sc-on-neta-targeting-nitish/articleshow/117004422.cms,"NEW DELHI: Commenting on frequent acrimonious proceedings in assemblies and Parliament, Supreme Court on Monday said it appears that legislators have forgotten how to be respectful while lodging strong dissent or criticising opponents.The remark came from a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh when it took up RJD neta Sunil Kumar Singh 's writ petition challenging Bihar legislative council 's decision to expel him from the House for alleged misconduct and misdemeanour and mimicking CM Nitish Kumar during the budget session.""Members of august Houses should be respectful of others even while being their bitter critic,"" SC said, prima facie disapproving Singh's comments.Sunil Kumar Singh's counsel A M Singhvi said even though the matter is sub judice, EC has announced a bypoll for Singh's seat which has fallen vacant, and apprehending this would create confusion. Singhvi said if elections are held and someone else gets elected, and at the same time SC sets aside Singh's expulsion, it would give rise to an incongruent situation of having two elected candidates for the same seat. SC should stay the elections scheduled for later this month, he pleaded.SC refused to postpone the elections, but said it would schedule the final hearing of Singh's writ petition on Jan 9. Singhvi said, ""Freedom of speech inside a House has been given wide latitude."" The bench said, ""This is how freedom of speech is used inside the House? You (Singhvi) are also a Member of Parliament. Do you subscribe to the use of such language against opponents inside a House?"" Singhvi said he does not subscribe to such language, but expulsion for use of such language would make the opposition benches empty. ""For a similar use of language by another MLC, he was merely suspended. But in the case of Singh, it was expulsion.""The Ethics Committee of the legislative council in its report had recommended removal of Singh, stating that ""Being the chief whip of the opposition, his legislative responsibility and adaptation of rules and regulations should be more than others. But his behaviour was otherwise.After coming into the well, he raised unrestrained slogans, hindered the functioning of the House, disrespected the instruction for the Chair, used defamatory words for the leader of the House, trying to humiliate him, and in a way damaged the dignity of the legislative council."" Based on the report, Singh was expelled on July 26.","Sunil Kumar Singh's counsel A M Singhvi said even though the matter is sub judice, EC has announced a bypoll for Singh's seat which has fallen vacant.

7 cases of HMPV detected; no cause for concern: Nadda,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/7-cases-of-hmpv-detected-no-cause-for-concern-nadda/articleshow/117004366.cms,"India reported Monday seven cases of human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) infection in children - two each in Bengaluru, Nagpur and Tamil Nadu, and one in Ahmedabad -amid a surge in respiratory illnesses in China. However, Union health minister J P Nadda allayed concerns, saying the rise in cases won't lead to a Covid-like outbreak.""HMPV is not a new virus. It was first identified in 2001, and it has been circulating around the world for many years,"" Nadda said.Experts said HMPV rarely requires hospitalisation, and timely intervention can prevent complications.Nadda said the health ministry, along with Indian Council of Medical Research and National Centre for Disease Control, was monitoring the situation in China and neighbouring countries. ""WHO has taken cognisance of the situation and will share its report shortly with us,"" he said.ICMR confirmed two cases at Bangalore Baptist Hospital. A three-month-old girl from Bengaluru, admitted with fever and cold in December, tested positive and has since recovered and been discharged.The second case of HMPV, detected on January 3, involves an eight-month-old boy admitted for fever following an injury. He tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and is currently recovering. Both children have a history of bronchopneumonia and neither has travelled abroad, suggesting they contracted the infection locally.A two-month-old from Dungarpur in Rajasthan was admitted to a private hospital in Ahmedabad on Dec 24 with respiratory illness and diagnosed with HMPV on Dec 26. Dr Bhavin Solanki of AMC said the hospital reported the case late, and the patient was isolated. Two children, aged seven and 13, tested positive at Meditrina Institute of Medical Sciences in Nagpur. They were initially treated for suspected H1N1 (swine flu) with Tamiflu, but PCR tests confirmed HMPV on Jan 3. The kids recovered through outpatient treatment.Although the hospital reported the cases, Nagpur Municipal Corporation decided to re-test the samples at AIIMS Nagpur. These cases were discussed in an ICMR video conference Monday.Tamil Nadu health secretary Supriya Sahu said the state has two active cases - in Chennai and Salem - and the condition of both is stable. ""HMPV infections are self-limiting and resolve with symptomatic care, including adequate hydration and rest,"" she said.First identified in 2001 in the Netherlands, HMPV causes illnesses from mild respiratory infections to severe conditions like bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In India, its prevalence varies between 1% and 19% across regions.Health minister Nadda said HMPV spreads through respiratory droplets and can affect all age groups. ""The virus spreads more during winter and early spring months,"" he said. ""Our health systems and surveillance networks remain vigilant, ensuring the country is ready to respond promptly to any emerging health challenges. There is no reason to worry. We are closely monitoring the situation,"" he assured.ICMR chair for disease elimination, Dr Rajni Kant, said HMPV is a known cause of respiratory illness in children and confirmed its presence in different parts of India. ""ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Gorakhpur, tested respiratory pathogens in 100 under-five patients... at BRD Medical College in 2022. Out of 100 enrolled paediatric patients, four (4%) were found HMPV positive,"" Kant said.Karnataka health minister Dinesh Gundu Rao said the virus is likely a local strain unrelated to the outbreak in China. ""Referring to any recent case as the 'first' is misleading. I don't think we should be pressing the panic button."" A Karnataka health official highlighted the potential severity of HMPV in vulnerable populations, particularly children under five, the elderly, and immunosuppressed people. ""About 10% of adult patients admitted with pneumonia test positive for HMPV, and 4-6% of viral illnesses in children are caused by this virus,"" the official said.Current data from ICMR and Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) confirmed no unusual surge in influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory illness cases in the country.A five-month-old boy in Kolkata, who travelled from Mumbai, was the last known case of HMPV in Bengal requiring intensive care. He was admitted to a private hospital with symptoms such as high fever, diarrhoea, vomiting and respiratory distress. After receiving breathing support for a week, he was discharged and is doing well.(Inputs from Sarfaraz Ahmed in Nagpur, Sumati Yengkhom in Kolkata)","India reported seven cases of human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) infection in children.

Infant's minor fall leads to unexpected HMPV diagnosis

BENGALURU: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has confirmed two cases of Human Metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) in Karnataka through routine surveillance. Both cases, detected at Bengaluru Baptist Hospital, were identified as part of ICMR’s ongoing monitoring of respiratory illnesses across the country.The first case involves a 3-month-old female infant diagnosed with HMPV after being admitted with bronchopneumonia. The baby has since been discharged.The second case is an 8-month-old male infant who tested positive on January 3, 2025, also with a history of bronchopneumonia. The infant is now recovering. Neither of the patients has any international travel history.ICMR and the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) have emphasized that HMPV is already in circulation globally, including in India, and no unusual surge in Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) cases has been reported.BBMP health commissioner Suralkar Vikas Kishore stated, “The hospital initially flagged the cases, and subsequent tests confirmed the infection. Further monitoring will help assess viral load and spread.”Medical reports confirm the diagnosis through Multiplex PCR testing, which detects microbial RNA/DNA in significant concentrations.A senior official from the Health and Family Welfare Department added, “Detailed investigations are ongoing to assess the virus’s impact. If needed, enhanced testing and control measures will be implemented.”The Union Health Ministry, in coordination with ICMR, continues to monitor HMPV trends. The World Health Organization (WHO) is also providing updates on the global situation, including the outbreak in China.Amid rising concerns over outbreaks of the HMPV infection, several state governments have issued health advisories.In response, the Maharashtra health department has urged residents to cover their mouths and noses while coughing or sneezing, wash their hands frequently with soap, and avoid public spaces if symptomatic.Meanwhile, Delhi's health officials have also issued guidelines to address the potential health risks posed by Human MetaPneumoVirus (HMPV) and other respiratory illnesses. Dr. Vandana Bagga, Director General of Health Services, held consultations with chief district medical officers and the state Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) officers to discuss preparedness for respiratory illnesses in Delhi.According to the advisory, hospitals are required to report cases of Influenza-like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) through the IHIP portal. They must also isolate suspected cases and adhere to standard safety protocols. Hospitals are further instructed to maintain proper documentation for SARI cases and laboratory-confirmed influenza instances to ensure accurate tracking.To manage mild cases, hospitals must stock essential medications, including paracetamol, antihistamines, bronchodilators, cough syrups, and oxygen supplies.HMPV, a respiratory virus that causes upper respiratory tract infections similar to the common cold, primarily affects young children, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems, especially during the winter months. It can have severe consequences for immunocompromised people.An infant’s seemingly minor fall has sparked a health mystery for his family after he developed a fever and tested positive for the HMPV virus at Bangalore Baptist Hospital. Despite no visible injuries from the fall, the unexpected diagnosis has left the parents bewildered.

Sullivan meets PM Modi

NEW DELHI: The United States is finalising the removal of longstanding regulations that have hindered civil nuclear cooperation between Indian nuclear entities and US companies, announced national security advisor Jake Sullivan during his visit to India. Sullivan described the move as a significant step in cementing the bilateral partnership, which he said was long overdue.""Although former President Bush and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh laid out a vision of civil nuclear cooperation nearly 20 years ago, we have yet to fully realise it,"" Sullivan said, adding that the Biden administration has determined it is ""past time to take the next major step."" He confirmed that the necessary paperwork is being finalised, enabling Indian entities previously on restricted US lists to collaborate with American private sector players, scientists, and technologists.""The United States is now finalizing the necessary steps to remove long standing regulations that have prevented civil nuclear cooperation between India's leading nuclear entities and US companies,"" he said while speaking at IIT Delhi.Sullivan said that the decision reflects the progress made in the strategic partnership and India's transparent engagement over the last four years.""The formal paperwork will be done soon, but this will be an opportunity to turn the page on some of the frictions of the past and create opportunities for entities that have been on restricted lists in the United States to come off those lists and enter into deep collaboration with the United States, with our private sector, with our scientists and technologists to move civil nuclear cooperation forward together,"" he said.The announcement comes as Sullivan concludes his two-day visit to India, during which he held discussions with national security advisor Ajit Doval. Sullivan credited Doval for his role in advancing the US-India relationship, noting their ""deep personal and professional relationship"" developed over the past four years.""This is likely the last trip overseas that I will lead as NSA and I cannot think of a better way to end my tenure in the White House, visiting India on my final overseas trip to mark the advances that we have made together over the past four years,"" Sullivan said.He predicted that within the next decade, joint initiatives could see American and Indian firms working together on advanced semiconductor technologies and conducting research in space exploration.Sullivan’s agenda also included a visit to the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, where he met with entrepreneurs and discussed the US-India alliance on innovation under the iCET initiative. External affairs minister S Jaishankar also met Sullivan, acknowledging his ""personal contribution"" to strengthening bilateral ties.During the event at IIT Delhi, US Ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, paid tribute to the late Jimmy Carter, former President of the United States, who passed away on December 29.Garcetti said, ""This week, we will mark the life of a great statesman who died at the age of 100 years. A great American President but also a great human being, Jimmy Carter."" He went on to highlight Carter’s pivotal role in US-India relations, saying, ""He came here at a low point of Indian-American relations and sought to lay down a foundation or to reclaim perhaps the friendship that had defined the relationship between our people that had lasted for more than 200 years.""Sullivan also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit.In a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his pleasure at meeting US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. He highlighted the growing India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership, noting advancements in areas such as technology, defence, space, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence.""Look forward to building upon this momentum in ties between our two democracies for the benefit of our people and global good,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.","US is finalising the removal of longstanding regulations that have hindered civil nuclear cooperation between Indian nuclear entities and US companies.

Preventive measures in Maharashtra

NEW DELHI: Three cases of the Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) were detected on Monday, among which two were reported in Karnataka and one in Gujarat.The virus, which is reported to have originated in China, serves as a reminiscence of the Covid pandemic, has alerted governments globally, with Beijing raising concerns about a surge in respiratory infections that has led to overcrowded hospitals and overwhelmed health systems.The two infants, who are reported to have HMPV, are a three-month-old girl and a six-month-old boy. While the girl has a history of bronchopneumonia, the boy was admitted with symptoms of fever and breathlessness before testing positive for the virus.In Gujarat, the virus was detected in a two-month-old boy, who was admitted to a private hospital in Ahmedabad on December 24 with symptoms of respiratory infection, news agency PTI reported quoting officials.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the HMPV belongs to the Pneumoviridae family, the same family as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It typically causes upper and lower respiratory infections, presenting symptoms similar to a common cold or flu.Union health minister JP Nadda reassured the public regarding the HMPV virus, stating that the ministry is closely monitoring the situation and there is no cause for concern. Nadda clarified that HMPV, first identified in 2001, is not a new virus and has been circulating globally for years.""It was first identified in 2001 and it has been circulating in the entire world since many years,"" he said.He explained that it spreads through the air, affecting all age groups, particularly during winter and early spring. The ministry is also monitoring HMPV developments in China and neighbouring countries, with no surge in cases reported in India.""The health systems and surveillance networks of the country remain vigilant, ensuring the country is ready to respond promptly to any emerging health challenges. There is no reason to worry. We are closely monitoring the situation,"" Nadda said in his video statement.On Saturday, the Karnataka health ministry had issued a statement stating that Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) primarily affects children, causing cold-like symptoms such as cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. The ministry advised the public to cover their mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing, wash hands frequently with soap, and avoid public places if symptomatic. It also recommended not reusing tissues or handkerchiefs, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and refraining from sharing towels or linen.The statement added that while there is no specific antiviral treatment for the virus, but symptom management focuses on ""alleviating symptoms with supportive care like rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications for pain, fever, and congestion.""Delhi health authorities issued an advisory to ensure preparedness for potential health challenges linked to HMPV on Sunday.According to a statement, Dr Vandana Bagga, Director General of Health Services, convened a meeting with chief district medical officers and the state programme officer of IDSP on Sunday to discuss preparedness to address respiratory illnesses in Delhi.The Union health ministry remains vigilant and continues to monitor the situation through all available surveillance channels. Additionally, the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR )will keep track of HMPV circulation trends throughout the year.India is well-prepared to handle respiratory illnesses and surveillance shows no unusual surge in the country, according to the government. In a joint monitoring group (JMG) meeting under the chairmanship of DGHS, ministry of health and family welfare, experts had detailed discussions around the spread of respiratory illnesses in China, where, according to them, it is not unusual in view of the ongoing flu season.The ICMR network also tests for other respiratory viruses such as Adenovirus, RSV, HMPV etc. and these pathogens also do not show an unusual increase in the tested samples.The number of laboratories testing for HMPV will be enhanced by ICMR as part of a precautionary measure. The ICMR will also be monitoring trends of HMPV for the entire year, according to health ministry.Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) for the surveillance of Influenza is already in place in India through both ICMR and IDSP networks and the data from both indicates no unusual surge in ILI and SARI cases.There are no reported cases of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) in Andhra Pradesh, a health official said on Sunday, assuring the public that there is no need to panic about the virus.Public Health and Family Welfare Director K Padmavathi stated that the virus spreads from person to person, similar to Covid-19, primarily affecting children, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immunity.In response, the Maharashtra health department has urged residents to cover their mouths and noses while coughing or sneezing, wash their hands frequently with soap, and avoid public spaces if symptomatic.","Three cases of the Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) were detected on Monday, among which two were reported in Karnataka and one in Gujarat.

With this, the total number of forged land record maps have touched 165.The tampering, which facilitated unauthorised construction on hundreds of properties along Mumbai suburban coastline, involves a nexus of govt officials, contractors, and estate agents, according to SIT.SIT, formed under the direction of Bombay HC, has so far arrested five individuals, including two retired officials from Land Records Department and a contractor, Narshim Puttawallu, who has emerged as a central figure in the scam, having been named in four FIRs. Investigators suspect that officials from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Land Records Department, and City Survey Office played a pivotal role in manipulating maps.TOI has learnt that SIT found that the forged maps facilitated illegal construction on 267 properties, with permissions issued in 32 cases under the BMC Act. Many permissions were granted by Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) and MHADA based on falsified documents.Investigators revealed that the syndicate used forged maps to modify land classifications during 2012-2020, allowing construction in areas marked as CRZ or NDZ. The scam was allegedly orchestrated by altering entries in official City Survey maps and leveraging fabricated records to show pre-1964 structures, which are protected under CRZ regulations.The SIT also found that 205 RTI applications were filed to create an illusion of legitimacy around the altered records. Fifteen landowners were questioned during the probe, with four admitting to seeking Puttawallu's assistance in altering their properties' classification. The scam came to light after a farmer from Erangal, Malad, Vaibhav Thakur, reported illegal construction on his ancestral agricultural land in 2016.","A Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing manipulation of documents for plots in ecologically sensitive Coastal Regulation Zones (CRZ) and no development zones (NDZ) in Mumbai has found 63 more forged records.

"States, private universities object to NEP rider for college ratings",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/states-private-universities-object-to-nep-rider-for-college-ratings/articleshow/117003843.cms,"NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: The University Grants Commission ( UGC )'s draft notification to grade Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) based on their implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has met with resistance from universities in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and other states. These states, which have not adopted the NEP, argue that the proposed framework could prove disadvantageous to their institutions and students.The notification, issued on January 3, 2025, outlines a plan to evaluate HEIs through a two-step process, emphasising NEP implementation to grant privileges and entitlements under various UGC regulations. Universities in states like Tamil Nadu, which do not recognise NEP-driven four-year integrated degree programs, have raised concerns over students losing out on govt job opportunities due to non-equivalence.Vice-chancellors of several universities have questioned the fairness of such a system. S Vaidhyasubramania, vice-chancellor of SASTRA Deemed University, Chennai, said, ""HEIs in states that are not aligned with NE will be disadvantaged if NE implementation status alone is used as a grading metric. Instead, grading and granting of privileges can be based on NIRF or NAAC or NE implementation score and gradually may be NE based only after UGC ensures that all states align with NE.""A key contention is the weightage given to admissions through the Common University Entrance Test (CUET). While the test is central to NEP's vision, universities from states not implementing the policy find the requirement problematic. Prof Niranjana, vice-chancellor of Bengaluru North University, highlighted the challenges: ""If we apply the same parameters, universities in our state are going to score very low. All the questions are based on the assumption that we continue with NEP. This will make it very difficult for the universities of Karnataka to get higher grades and thus central assistance. Students are going to lose out for no fault of theirs. UGC must reconsider the criteria for ranking.""Additionally, questions on foreign collaborations in the UGC document have raised eyebrows. The draft seeks detailed information on the nature and extent of collaborations with international institutions, including twinning arrangements, joint degrees, and faculty exchanges. Smaller and regional HEIs, lacking such partnerships, fear being pushed further down the rankings.Paul Newman, principal of St Joseph's Evening College, Bengaluru, pointed out the broader implications: ""It is not just Karnataka but many other states in India which have not implemented the NEP and it includes the states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Bengal that are the most productive, intellectual and industrious. UGC must realise that education was in the state list and then moved to the concurrent list and states are constitutionally empowered to have their own educational systems. In this politics between the states and the Centre it will be the students of the non-NEP states who would be losing out. UGC must refrain from coming out with such ideas and stick to the policy of grading purely based on NAAC assessment.""The UGC has invited feedback from stakeholders through an online platform, with a 30-day window for submissions. However, the growing opposition underscores the tension between centralised policies and state autonomy. Critics warn that unless addressed, the grading framework could deepen inequities, sidelining institutions in non-NEP states and smaller HEIs lacking global exposure.","The draft notification to grade Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) based on their implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has met with resistance.

But if a candidate wants to teach another subject, different from their highest academic specialisation, then the National Eligibility Test (NET) for that subject needs to be cleared.For example, a candidate with a PhD in chemistry, despite holding a bachelor's in mathematics and a master's in physics, would now only qualify to teach chemistry.The regulations have also significantly broadened the eligibility criteria for selection of vice chancellors - distinguished professionals from fields such as industry, public administration and policy-making, and with a proven record of academic contributions, can now be considered for this role. Stakeholders have been invited to review the draft and submit their feedback.Inclusivity is another important aspect of these reforms. The new draft explicitly includes relaxations for economically weaker sections and persons with disabilities, alongside existing provisions for SC, ST and OBC candidates. It also encourages the use of Indian languages in research and teaching, and promoting cultural alignment with national priorities.The proposed reforms, aimed at modernising the recruitment and promotion framework for teachers and academic staff in higher education institutions, supersede the 2018 guidelines, promising to foster inclusivity, flexibility and alignment with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.Releasing the draft, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said, ""By promoting flexibility, inclusivity and recognising diverse talents, we are paving the way for a dynamic academic future for India."" He emphasised the timely nature of these reforms in light of the ongoing implementation of NEP-2020.The draft also extends the scope of qualifications by introducing provisions that recognise professional achievements, such as innovative teaching methods, digital content creation and contributions to research funding. ""The revised regulations ensure that contributions to knowledge and community, rather than rigid qualifications, are valued,"" UGC chairperson M Jagadesh Kumar said.The draft regulations also emphasise transparency and objectivity in recruitment. For example, candidates applying for teaching positions may be assessed on their teaching and research aptitude through seminars or lectures. In addition, faculty promotion under the career advancement scheme will now account for periods of leave taken for maternity, childcare or study, ensuring fairness in career progression.The draft also outlines updated qualifications for positions such as librarians and directors of physical education. Librarians will now be evaluated on their contributions to library digitisation and community engagement, while achievements in indigenous sports and public health initiatives will form key criteria for physical education directors.",The proposed reforms are aimed at modernising the recruitment and promotion framework for teachers and academic staff.

The steps, as visiting US NSA Jake Sullivan said, are essential for realising full potential of the 2008 India-US civil nuclear deal .Sullivan was in India from January 5-6 for what was his last visit abroad before leaving office and met his counterpart Ajit Doval and also external affairs minister S Jaishankar, while also calling on PM Modi. Apart from announcing the easing of curbs on Indian companies to facilitate stronger nuclear cooperation, Sullivan underscored the growing India-US defence and technology cooperation as one of the core pillars of stability in the Indo-Pacific and spoke about the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor's potential to deliver a better growth and integration model than China's BRI.However, Sullivan also sounded a warning as he said for India and US to reach the ""boundless"" potential in ties, the two countries will have to together live up to values like ""respect for rule of law that creates conditions for dynamic growth, respect for pluralism and tolerance that powers innovation and protection of basic freedoms that unleash the human spirit"". He said these were the basic truths about how the two democracies would grow and flourish.On steps for delisting Indian nuclear entities to facilitate stronger civil nuclear cooperation, Sullivan said formal paperwork will be done soon. ""This will be an opportunity to turn the page on some of the frictions of past and create opportunities for entities that have been on restrictive lists in US to come off those lists and enter into deep collaboration with the US, with our private sector, with our scientists and technologists, to move civil nuclear cooperation forward together,"" he said while addressing a gathering at IIT-Delhi.""As we work to build clean energy technologies to enable growth in artificial intelligence and to help US and Indian energy companies unlock their innovation potential, the Biden administration has determined that it is past time to take the next major step in cementing this partnership,"" said the official, while making the announcement.Sullivan, who along with Doval is the architect of initiatives under the pathbreaking India-US Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), also raised concerns about the transfer of any dual-use technology to Russia. ""And as we see more and more new technologies diverted to unfriendly actors, the US and India are going to have to ensure that valuable dual-use technologies don't fall into the wrong hands. That means aligning our export control systems, looking at trade measures to protect our industrial strategies from overcapacity, better securing our supply chains. And reviewing outbound and inbound investment in sensitive sectors,"" said the official.On IMEEC, Sullivan said that while the initiative had been disrupted by developments in West Asia, he had personally engaged with key countries and key leaders to keep making progress. ""I've talked to the incoming administration about the enormous opportunity that it presents to deliver both growth and integration and a high standard alternative to what Beijing has on offer,"" added Sullivan.","US NSA Jake Sullivan was in India from January 5-6 for what was his last visit abroad before leaving office.

New Lawsuit Alleges Emmanuel Acho Had A Physical Relationship With Broadcaster Joy Taylor

On Sunday, news broke that Fox Sports, along with multiple on-air talents, and an executive had been named defendants in a workplace misconduct lawsuit filed in California. The 42-page suit has been bought by hairstylist named Noushin Faraji who worked at the company between 2012 and 2024 and has made claims of sexual harassment from former FS1 host Skip Bayless and executive Charlie Dixon , along with racially insensitive comments by current FS1 host Joy Taylor .Faraji further alleges that Taylor was involved in a physical relationship with former NFL linebacker-turned-analyst Emmanuel Acho and also with Charlie Dixon to advance her career. The lawsuit alleges that these relationships helped Taylor secure a more prominent position in the network. Fox issued the following statement to Front Office Sports: “We take these allegations seriously and have no further comment at this time given this pending litigation.”The lawsuit alleges that Joy Taylor who’s a popular FS1 host created a hostile work environment. Faraji’s lawsuit claims that Bayless allegedly offered her $1.5 million for a sexual encounter, eventhough she had turned down his advances multiple times in the past. When Faraji reported her issues with Bayless to Taylor the host allegedly dismissed her concerns and told her to “get over it.”“In approximately February 2020, Ms. Taylor asked Ms. Faraji to meet her for lunch in Beverly Hills. When Ms. Faraji arrived, she found Ms. Taylor with a man, Emmanuel Acho. Ms. Faraji did not know Mr. Acho but could tell that the two were romantically involved,” the lawsuit says.It further reveals, “A few months after meeting Mr. Acho at the lunch, Ms. Faraji noticed him in the hallway while at work. Ms. Faraji later asked Ms. Taylor if Mr. Acho also worked at Fox. Ms. Taylor confirmed and explained that she wanted Mr. Acho to eventually recommend her on the show Speak for Yourself. Ms. Faraji became alarmed and warned Ms. Taylor that she should probably not sleep with Mr. Dixon and Mr. Acho at the same time, as Mr. Dixon is a very powerful man that may become very angry.”“Ms. Taylor told her not to worry about it. She explained that she was also now powerful, and once Mr. Dixon was no longer useful to her, she would follow through on her plan to tell the company that he forced himself on her. She would not allow herself to be forced out by Mr. Dixon like other women talent,” it concluded.Though neither Acho or Taylor have spoken about this allegation, some fans spotted some suspicious online activity on Acho’s end; the NFL athlete, who at the time was a member of Speak for Yourself. recently deleted video from 2022 in which he praised Taylor.“I gotta take a moment to shout out my co-host Joy Taylor,” Acho says in the video which was shot in his car, after his rehearsals with Taylor. “A woman. A Black woman. Daily Show. Sports. Do you realize how hard it is to get to the position that she is in? So often there’s misogyny and sexism running rampant in sports and we don’t even care what women have to say in sports,” remarked Acho.He continued, “But Joy is not only in the position on television as a Black woman but as an opinionist. So not just asking men what they think but providing her own unique and distinct insight. It’s hard to do and Joy you have done it, so congratulations. Looking forward to working with you.”","Fox Sports, along with multiple on-air talents, and an executive had been named defendants in a workplace misconduct lawsuit filed in California.

What is The Rock’s net worth in 2025 after acquiring new shares in TKO Group?



Is The Rock making an appearance on RAW on Netflix debut show?



The Rock became an integral part of the TKO Group last year when he became a member of the Board of Directors. Ahead of RAW’s move to Netflix, The Rock’s net worth has significantly increased after the acquisition of more TKO shares.The Rock is one of the most legendary names in the business of professional wrestling and sports entertainment. After making his name inside the squared circle, The Great One transitioned to the world of film and acting. The Rock has been part of some iconic movies such as Jumanji, Fast and Furious, San Andreas and Moana.Furthermore, The Rock came back to WWE in 2024 and became an integral part of WWE’s parent company, TKO. He was named on the Board of Directors last year, which also became an inspiration for his new WWE gimmick called The Final Boss. Moreover, he even acquired full ownership of his ring name ‘The Rock.’However, witnessing recent events, The Rock has become more involved in TKO in terms of ownership, which has had a positive impact on his net worth.According to a report by PWInsider, The Rock has now acquired a new lot of 96,557 shares of TKO stock. The details from this filing reveal that he was granted 93,115 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) last year. The half part of those shares was vested in December 2024 while the rest were set to be vested in equal monthly installments in 2025. This brings his total share ownership of TKO shares to 289,673.Following the ownership of new shares, their total value is estimated to be around $41 Million after the share price closed at $142.40 on January 3, 2025. This boosts The Rock’s net worth at the start of 2025 to around $841 Million, with his net worth last year touching $800 Million as reported by sources such asCelebrity Net Worth and Sportskeeda.The Rock recently dropped a video on Instagram in collaboration with Netflix highlighting his rich Samoan heritage. The video ended with 1.6.25, the date of RAW’s debut on Netflix, seemingly confirming his presence for the show. The Final Boss is expected to become a part of the ongoing rivalry between Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa. Otherwise, he can also be expected to feud with Cody Rhodes, the man who he promised to come after before leaving WWE last year to go on his hiatus.Also read: Netflix Teams Up with The Rock for Huge WWE Project","The Rock became an integral part of the TKO Group last year when he became a member of the Board of Directors.

A Closer Look At Roman Reigns And Galina Becker’s Million-Dollar Empire Ahead Of Netflix’s Monday Night Raw



Galina Becker’s professional background



The Career Switch As A Heel Which Made Roman Reigns Richer



Few power couples in the WWE universe are as popular as Roman Reigns and Galina Becker. Last month, the couple celebrated their tenth wedding anniversary and 17 years of togetherness, and in a few hours, Reigns will accomplish a significant career milestone. He is set to face Solo Sikoa in tribal combat for the Ula Fala for WWE RAW 2025 Live Streaming, which is marquee pro-wrestling and is set to make its Netflix debut.While Reigns, whose real name is Leati Joseph ""Joe"" Anoa'i, is a celebrated wrestler, his wife and mother of his five children is a fitness model. The couple met while studying at the Georgia Institute of Technology and quickly became best friends. In a 2016 interview with WWE Unfiltered, Reigns discussed how they first met. ""When we first met, we were just having fun. We were kind of glued to each other… just not having a care in the world or worry about anyone but us,” he said.Reigns is currently the longest reigning Undisputed WWE Universal champion and is known for leading the famous wrestling family, The Bloodline . Besides wrestling and endorsement deals, Reigns also has several merch lines and business ventures. Here’s looking at the combined worth of Roman Reigns and Galina Becker and some of their prized assets.Roman Reigns is one of the highest-paid wrestlers in the WWE with a reported net worth of $20 million. His annual salary from wrestling alone is around $5 million. He is the third-highest WWE star to reach that mark in salary since John Cena ($8.5 million) and Brock Lesnar ($12 million) are part-timers.The Reigns family residence is a sprawling villa in Florida with state-of-the-art amenities, including a fully kitted-out gym. Reigns is also an automobile enthusiast and owns some swanky luxury cars.One of his best cars is the Range Rover Autobiography; other vehicles flanking his garage are Mercedes Benz G-Wagon, Chevrolet Equinox and Cadillac Escalade. Reports also suggest that Reigns owns a private jet for trips with his friends, but it has not been confirmed yet. Reigns also has a lucrative endorsement with C4 Energy, an energy drink brand.Galina, on the other hand, who was a terrific athlete during her college days and has an impressive track and field record, currently works as a fitness model. Although for the last few years, her priority has been her family especially since Roman’s leukaemia relapsed in 2018. Reigns was first diagnosed with leukemia in 2007 at the age of 22 and then again 11 years later, in 2018. The WWE star has spoken about how Galina has supported him through his medical journey.""I didn't really have anybody,"" he told PEOPLE. ""I didn't think it was anybody's fault, I just had my wife — who was pregnant at the time. My mom, just the kind of mother she is, she was my rock, she was my support system doing all the worrying and all the praying and it felt like I was a little bit on an island.""In early 2020 during the beginning of the pandemic Reigns temporarily stepped away from WWE to keep his family safe. Becker was pregnant with their second set of twins, and Reigns was immunocompromised as a cancer survivor.""I just had to make a choice for my family,"" Reigns shared during that time. ""I trust my life with my co-workers every time I step foot in the ring, but I just can't put the same trust when it has my children, my wife and my family involved.""In 2020 Reigns became a heel, a move that would see him have a 1,316 day title-reign, and lead him to become WWE's biggest-ever act. It’s no secret that his babyface run faced quite a bit of backlash from fans as viewers rejected his forced ""top guy"" image. This prompted WWE to turn him into a villain to better utilize his character potential with the introduction of his ""Tribal Chief"" persona alongside Paul Heyman as his manager.Reigns himself has admitted that he has found more success as a heel. “Well, the business is its most successful with me as a heel. But, the future looks bright so we’ll see, we’ll see,” he said. “It’s much easier — I think babyface is an easier side to actually perform in. But, it’s so much more fun as a bad guy.”During the interview, Roman Reigns also responded to John Cena calling him the GOAT. “The numbers don’t lie,” Roman Reigns said. “I wish I could say, ‘I’m Taylor Swift out there,’ but we have a great team. I have a Wiseman. Business has been really good. It’s one of those weird situations. This is where I would normally be like, ‘Paul, brag about me.’ At the end of the day, it’s subjective.With his Netflix debut, Reigns is set to become significantly richer especially since he has top billing. After two decades, One year on from the initial announcement at the start of 2024, Monday Night Raw has now moved off network TV and will be an exclusive Netflix show with worldwide reach and more than 282 million subscribers.The 1,650th episode of “Monday Night Raw” from the Intuit Dome outside of Los Angeles officially kicks off WWE's 10-year partnership with Netflix. The agreement is worth more than $5 billion, and Netflix has the option to extend it for an additional 10 years or opt out after five.Although it’s not confirmed how much Reigns is earning for his appearance on Monday night, the star has himself admitted recently that the debut is a big deal.“There’s no hiding that this is Netflix and this is huge and this is going to be on a global platform with a lot of people watching. I’m not sure exactly what that audience is going to look like. It’s going to be crazy, I know that,” said Reigns.",Roman Reigns is one of the highest-paid wrestlers in the WWE with a reported net worth of $20 million. His annual salary from wrestling alone is around $5 million.

In today's rapidly changing world economy, only a few individuals have reached a height of enormous financial success that exceeds the financial resources of several nations. This has been the result of some of the finest visionary leadership combined with innovation and strategic investments to solidify their positions in the list of the world's richest people. Their influence spans such industries as technology, e-commerce, luxury goods, and finance, and companies under their umbrellas have dramatically changed the way we live, work, and communicate.For those billionaires by 2025, it is no longer mere shaping of the economy but more so transforming it. Their excess wealth is not only due to a traditional business model but rather through disruptive technologies at the global scale, and therefore, bold decision-making. This elite group is composed of founders and CEOs of such giants in industries like SpaceX, Tesla, Amazon, Meta, Oracle, and Nvidia, among others.This report showcases the top 10 wealthiest people in the world according to Forbes, and the background details are given on the key business ventures and the strategies that enabled these billionaires to acquire such wealth.Elon Musk is the founder and CEO of SpaceX as well as Tesla. His wealth has significantly increased through his ventures in space exploration, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence with huge and recent surge in the valuation of SpaceX to $350 billion. SpaceX, Musk's aerospace company, has revolutionized the space industry as it develops technology capable of reusing rockets, which have significantly reduced the cost of space travel. Under Musk, Tesla has grown to become the world's most valuable electric vehicle manufacturer, a significant contributor to his wealth through its leadership in sustainable energy solutions and EV manufacturing. In addition to that, he is also a stakeholder in the microblogging service X (earlier known as Twitter) and in the AI firm xAI. These add up to his net worth. With innovation and careful risk-taking, he has risen to be one of the greatest figures in the technology and business world.Jeff Bezos founded Amazon as an online bookstore in 1994, but it has now evolved into the largest e-commerce marketplace in the world. Bezos' wealth largely stems from his huge stake in Amazon, ruling the global retail market, and further expanding to cloud computing, digital streaming, artificial intelligence, and much more. The arm of Amazon's cloud computing business is called Amazon Web Services. It has been increasingly a significant revenue driver for Amazon and propelling it to the top in its two areas of business: e-commerce and technology. Bezos resigned as CEO in 2021 but still maintains a significant equity stake in the company, contributing to his net worth. In addition to Amazon, Bezos also has Blue Origin, his privately held company for space exploration which he founded in the year 2000 and competes directly with SpaceX. Bezos' wealth becomes bigger as his companies and investments go further, especially now that Amazon has ventured into many new sectors.Larry Ellison is the co-founder of Oracle, a multinational technology company that specializes in database software, cloud computing services, and enterprise software solutions. Oracle was founded by Ellison in 1977 and has played a significant role in shaping the technology and software industries, thereby becoming one of the top companies in enterprise computing, data management, and cloud services. Ellison's source of wealth comes in the controlling stake he owns at Oracle, which has always fared very well at the stock markets. Besides Oracle, Ellison has invested in many pieces of real estate, some of which include taking a majority stake in the biggest private holding land in the Hawaiian Islands. He has diversified his portfolio investment by spreading out his investments on real estate and luxury projects, which has consequently spread out his wealth. He is also a major philanthropist focusing on health and education.Mark Zuckerberg is a co-founder of Facebook or nowadays Meta is the largest social media provider globally. Started by Zuckerberg in 2004, it eventually grew into the biggest network that reaches over 2.8 billion people on monthly active users. Growth in Facebook has been facilitated through the strategic acquisition of Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus in terms of growth and expansion for the company's presence in social media, digital messaging, virtual reality, and advertising industries. As Meta's CEO, Zuckerberg has demanded and encouraged the company to invest heavily in virtual reality and the metaverse he believes is the future frontier for digital communication and entertainment. With all these challenges and competition in the tech business, Zuckerberg remains one of the wealthiest in the world, due to Meta's significant dominance in the advertising market and its scaling up and increasing list of products.Bernard Arnault is the chairman and CEO of LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods conglomerate. He runs over 75 luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Sephora, and Moët & Chandon. According to the present date, the success of Arnault is highly, or rather very vibrantly, justified by his business based on such luxuries that has dominated the worldwide markets of fashions, cosmetics, fragrances, and wines. Arnault played an important role in building LVMH and making the portfolio diverse as he purchased more luxury brands into the different domains. His strategic approach toward high-end products retaining a sense of exclusivity has placed LVMH at the top of the list within the luxury goods industry. Outside business, he is also known for investing in real estate as well as in art, adding more diversification to his wealth and business ventures.Larry Page co-founded Google with Sergey Brin in 1998. Google was a search engine but has diversified into many lines of business, including ads, cloud computing, hardware, artificial intelligence, and self-driving cars. Google's core business includes making money through ad revenue connected with its search engine and YouTube. Page's net worth is connected to his considerable equity holding in Alphabet, Google's parent company, controlling other subsidiaries like Google, YouTube, and Waymo, an autonomous car initiative. Page also funds other ventures through Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" unit focused on the development of new prospective next-generation technologies in areas like healthcare, robotics, and more.Co-founder Sergey Brin co-founded Google with Larry Page in 1998. His riches are held in Alphabet, Google's parent company. The reason Brin and Page are as rich as they are is due to the immense profitability of their giant search, ad, cloud, and AI technology companies, which constitute Google. Brin deals with new-age technologies under an umbrella called ""Other Bets"" that Alphabet has set up: these involve self-driving cars, healthcare, and smart city initiatives. Although Brin quits being the Alphabet president, it is still present in the near future of its company and further enjoys the successful financial benefits provided by it.Warren Buffet is currently the chairman of the multinational conglomerate holding company-Berkshire Hathaway. He is known as the ""Oracle of Omaha"" and is considered one of the most successful investors in history. Berkshire Hathaway owns a diverse portfolio of companies in sectors such as insurance (Geico), energy (BNSF Railway), retail (Duracell), and consumer goods (See's Candies). The investment philosophy of Buffett, which emphasizes value investing and long-term growth, has enabled Berkshire Hathaway to consistently produce high returns. Buffett promised to donate nearly everything during his lifetime and after death for philanthropic causes especially to those organizations that end global health and education problems.Steve Ballmer served as the Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft between 2000 and 2014. His reign saw the enhancement of its positions in personal computing, enterprise software, and cloud computing. Under Ballmer's leadership, Microsoft became one of the world's first trillion-dollar companies. Most of his wealth derives from his Microsoft equity. After his resignation as CEO, Ballmer purchased the Los Angeles Clippers NBA team in 2014. He has since invested so much in it and its infrastructure. Some of the other sectors that Ballmer has been very keen to invest in include the technology, media, and sports sectors.Jensen Huang co-founded Nvidia with the mission of leading the industry in graphics processing units and AI hardware. Some of the most popular applications of Nvidia's GPUs include gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence. Growth has been constructed for the company on demand for AI-powered technologies as well as for gaming hardware. One of the leading companies in the tech world, Nvidia is due to its influential role in AI and deep learning technologies so much so that it has even improved Huang's net worth. Among other advanced ventures, the entry of its autonomous vehicles, AI-driven healthcare, and cloud computing further added to the prosperity of the company financially.","This report showcases the top 10 wealthiest people in the world according to Forbes, and the background details are given on the key business ventures and the strategies that enabled these billionaires to acquire such wealth.
