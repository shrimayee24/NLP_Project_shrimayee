BJP linked Gandhi’s remarks to ‘

George Soros

playbook’

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , has been summoned by the district judge court of Sambhal in connection with a complaint filed over his controversial remarks stating that the Congress party ’s fight was not only against the BJP and RSS but also against the Indian State itself.Issuing the notice on Thursday, the court has directed him to either appear or submit a response on April 4.According to the news agency ANI, Advocate Sachin Goyal confirmed that the court accepted the complaint and issued the notice to Gandhi.""Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had made a statement on 15 January 2025 that 'We are now fighting the BJP, the RSS and the Indian State itself'. Simran Gupta had filed a case in the special MP/MLA court to register an FIR against Rahul Gandhi. The CJM had quashed it on the grounds of jurisdiction,"" Advocate Goyal said.The complaint was initially dismissed by the CJM court on jurisdictional grounds, but a revision petition led the district judge court to intervene and summon the Congress leader.The controversy was triggered by a speech Gandhi delivered on January 15, 2025, during the inauguration of the Congress’s new headquarters, Indira Bhawan, in Delhi.In his speech, he alleged that the BJP and RSS had “captured every single institution” of the country and that opposition parties were now fighting the Indian State itself.""Our ideology, like the RSS ideology, is thousands of years old, and it has been fighting the RSS ideology for thousands of years. Do not think that we are fighting a fair fight. There is no fairness in this. If you believe that we are fighting a political organisation called the BJP or RSS, you have not understood what is going on. The BJP and the RSS have captured every single institution of our country. We are now fighting the BJP, the RSS and the Indian State itself,"" he saidApart from the Sambhal court case, Gandhi is also facing legal trouble in Guwahati, where an FIR was filed under Sections 152 and 197(1)d of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The charges include acts endangering the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India, which are considered cognizable and non-bailable offences.The FIR also accused him of inciting unrest and separatist sentiments.“Unable to gain public trust through democratic means, the accused now seeks to foster discontent against the government and the Indian State,” the complaint stated. It also accused Gandhi of trying to exploit his political platform to spread falsehoods and instigate rebellion.Rahul’s remarks also ignited a sharp political backlash from the BJP, with senior leaders accusing him of acting against India’s interests.BJP National President JP Nadda claimed that Rahul’s statements aligned with the agenda of US-based billionaire George Soros, who has been accused by Indian politicians of funding anti-government narratives.BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya also accused the Congress leader of declaring an “open war against the Indian State itself”, while finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman questioned how Gandhi could make such remarks while holding the Constitution in his hands during public events.During the same speech at Indira Bhawan, Rahul also raised concerns over alleged irregularities in Maharashtra elections , particularly regarding a sudden rise of one crore voters between the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha polls.“We are uncomfortable with the way the Election Commission operates. Why would the Election Commission refuse to make the voters’ list transparent?” Gandhi questioned. He accused the poll body of withholding critical electoral data, which, he argued, was necessary for transparency.Additionally, Gandhi attacked RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat , who had recently stated that India attained “true independence” only after the construction of the Ram Temple. Rahul labelled Bhagwat’s comments as “treason” and an insult to India’s independence movement.","Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, has been summoned by the district judge court of Sambhal.

LUCKNOW: Abhishek Prakash , CEO of Invest UP and former district magistrate of Lucknow, was suspended Thursday following charges of irregularities in the evaluation process for a proposed solar manufacturing project in the state. Also, the city police Thursday arrested a middleman on the charge of demanding a bribe for the approval of the solar project, at the behest of a senior official of Invest UP.The charges against Prakash, a 2006-batch IAS officer, were investigated and have been, prima facie, found to be true, a govt press release said. The inquiry concluded that his conduct could hinder objectives of the UP Industrial Investment and Employment Promotion Policy 2022, damaging investor confidence and tarnishing the state’s image as an investment-friendly destination, the press release added.Sources in the govt said the chief minister’s office (CMO) directed aprobe into the case after receiving a complaint. In the complaint, Vishwajit Datta of SAEL Solar P6 Pvt Ltd wrote to the CMO on March 20 stating that his firm wanted to set up a manufacturing unit for solar cells and solar powerrelated parts in UP. He further stated that officials at Invest UP demanded 5% of the project cost to clear the proposal, which he refused to pay.The complainant said their application was submitted to both Invest UP and online. However, before the application was presented to the evaluation committee, a “senior official in Invest UP” gave him the number of one Nikant Jain and told him if Jain recommended his project, it would be cleared immediately by the evaluation panel and state cabinet. Jain then made a demand of 5% of the project cost as commission and asked for the amount in cash in advance, a demand Datta said he rejected. Though the project went on to receive approval by the evaluation committee, it was not finally cleared. Datta stated in his complaint that Jain again told him that only he could help get this project cleared. Police arrested Jain Thursday.","Abhishek Prakash, CEO of Invest UP and former district magistrate of Lucknow, was suspended Thursday following charges of irregularities in the evaluation process.

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday conducted extensive searches on Open Society Foundations (OSF), promoted by US billionaire currency speculator and hedge fund operator George Soros who has been accused by BJP of acting against India’s interests.The raids in Bengaluru at OSF and linked entities were the fallout of an inquiry into FDI sourced by OSF in violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act guidelines.Sources said Open Society Institute, US, has been put under prior reference category (PRC) by the home mini stry since 2016 due to allegedly undesirable activities. So, OSI is required to secure prior sanction from the ministry to send funds to FCRA-registered organisations in India.Sources said investigation found Soros Economic Development Fund (SEDF), OSI’s social impact investment arm, provided funds to 3 Indian companies — Rootbridge Services Pvt Ltd (RSPL), Rootbridge Academy Pvt Ltd (RAPL), and ASAR Social Impact Advisors Pvt Ltd (ASAR). These companies received approximately Rs 25 crore from SEDF between 2020-21 and 2023-24.SEDF funds to RSPL were through compulsorily convertible preference shares. However, since SEDF could not make foreign donations directly to Indian NGOs without MHA approval, the George Soros-funded entity explored alternative options to bypass PRC restrictions. FDI in RSPL is suspected to be a colourable arrangement violating FDI norms, officials said.“RAPL, incorporated in 2019, received Rs 2.7 crore from SEDF as commission agent services without rendering any services. This suggests RAPL acted as an agent for SEDF to bypass FCRA provisions for funding NGOs in India,” a source said.ASAR, incorporated in 2016, received Rs 2.9 crore from SEDF as ‘service fees’. The investigators, however, are not convinced and suspect the funds to be donations in disguise, meant for NGOs in lieu of services which were, in fact, never rendered to SEDF.OSI group also set up an investment company, Aspada Investment Company (AIC), in Mauritius to channelise funding to India.Aspada Investment Advisors Pvt Ltd was established in Bengaluru to manage SEDF’s investments in India. However, the body, now Lightrock Investment Advisors Private Limited, was not in the loop about Rs 300 crore SEDF provided to 12 NGOs.ED action coincides with the heat Soros has been facing back home in the US after the election of Donald Trump as President.

What is Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act?

NEW DELHI: Elon Musk-owned X filed a case against the central government on Thursday for allegedly using the IT Act to block content on the micro-blogging site. The case has been filed in the Karnataka high court.In the plea, the X has challenged what it called unlawful content regulation and arbitrary censorship.It raised concerns over the Centre's interpretation of the Information Technology (IT) Act, particularly its use of Section 79(3)(b), which X argues violates Supreme Court rulings and undermines free expression online, according to the news agency PTI.The lawsuit alleged the government is using the said section to create a parallel content-blocking mechanism, bypassing the structured legal process outlined in Section 69A.Section 69A of the IT Act allows the government to order content removal for national security, public order, or sovereignty concerns, giving companies a clear legal basis to act. In contrast, Section 79(3)(b), companies argue, is vague, forcing platforms to decide what content is illegal, exposing them to lawsuits or backlash.Companies often use Section 69A as a defense, arguing they should only be liable if the government explicitly orders content removal, rather than guessing what is illegal. This shifts responsibility to the government, protecting platforms from legal risks and accusations of bias while ensuring compliance with official directives.X further claimed the government's current approach contradicts the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in the Shreya Singhal case, which established that content can only be blocked through a proper judicial process or the legally defined route under Section 69A.Social media companies complain about Section 79(3)(b) of the IT Act because it creates legal uncertainty, forcing them to remove content even when it's unclear if it's illegal. The social media platforms allege that the vague definition of ""knowledge"" of illegal content makes them fear lawsuits, leading to over-censorship and suppression of free speech. The law also places a huge burden on platforms to police billions of posts daily, which is technically challenging.Social media platforms have also legally challenged the government's Sahyog portal, a system developed by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) under the Ministry of Home Affairs to manage takedown requests under Section 79(3)(b) and enable direct coordination between social media companies and law enforcement agencies.X has refused to assign an employee to the platform, arguing that it serves as a ""censorship tool"" that pressures companies to take down content without proper legal scrutiny.

How flights will move from Mumbai to Navi Mumbai Airport & options for demolishing CSMIA T1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-flights-will-move-from-mumbai-to-navi-mumbai-airport-options-for-demolishing-csmia-t1/articleshow/119169626.cms,"Representative photo

NEW DELHI: Some flights of all big Indian carriers like Air India Group and IndiGo are likely to be shifted in the same ratio from Mumbai’s Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) when the latter gets operational later this summer. Foreign carriers with a few flights will operate fully from either of these two airports.The Adani Group is also weighing options for the demolition of T1 — whether to bring down the entire structure in one go this winter or do it piecemeal. T1 comprises of T1A, B and C buildings which were built over last 50 years with 1B being constructed in 1965; 1A in 1992 and 1C in 2010.“We are in talks with all airlines. As far as Indian carriers are concerned, the plan is to shift equal percentage of flights by them from CSMIA to NMIA. Foreign airlines with few flights will not like to split operations and will continue to operate from one hub only in Mumbai MMR. Some foreign airlines want to move fully to NMIA,” said people in the know. Air India has about 140 daily flights to and from CSMIA; Akasa 57 and AI Express about 15. IndiGo, the biggest Indian carrier in market share terms, did not give this figure.“We are weighing the option of either starting NMIA operations with domestic flights. In that case, domestic flights will be shifted first. Or we could start both domestic and international simultaneously, in which case both will be shifted,” said sources.The rate of shifting flights will also depend on how fast T2 capacity grows from 4 crore passengers annually (CPA) to 4.5 CPA and whether T1 goes down in one go or in phases — basically the capacity of CSMIA. “The existing T1 handles 1.5 CPA. T1 demolition will start 4-5 months after NMIA gets operational, which means by this Nov or Dec. We hope to increase T2 capacity by mid 2026. These decisions will be taken shortly,” they said.Airlines also want clarity on these issues. The reason: They are selling tickets for flights, some of which will get shifted. “Once we inform passengers that their flight, for say July/Aug, has been moved to NMIA, we don’t know whether it suits them or not. To minimise this, we need clarity at the earliest. We don’t have same issues with whenever Noida Airport opens as we are not selling tickets for there yet,” said a senior airline official.Meanwhile, Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) is also in talks with aviation authorities to lift the cap on hourly flight movements. This was done to ease the severe congestion seen perennially at CSMIA. The aviation ministry had two years back directed MIAL to reduce their flight operations from 46 to 44 per hour during ""high intensity runway operations” (HIRO) periods from 8-11 am and 5-8 pm and from 44 to 42 aircraft movement per hour during non-HIRO period.“We are confident of handling more flights without affecting time performance, at least from our side as an airport. MIAL has been in talks with authorities to lift that cap. We are in process of increasing CSMIA runway capacity. Gatwick, the world’s busiest single runway airport handles 54-55 flights an hour,” sources added.",Some flights of all big Indian carriers like Air India Group and IndiGo are likely to be shifted to Navi Mumbai International Airport. Foreign carriers with a few flights will operate fully from either of these two airports. The rate of shifting flights will also depend on how fast T2 capacity grows.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119169609,imgsize-62418,width-400,resizemode-4/119169609.jpg"
Philippines calls for India to join 'squad' alliance to counter China in Indo-Pacific,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/philippines-calls-for-india-to-join-squad-alliance-to-counter-china-in-indo-pacific/articleshow/119231037.cms,"Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr with armed forces chief Gen Romeo Brawner Jr

NEW DELHI: Bearing the brunt of China’s aggressive expansionist tactics in the South China Sea , the Philippines now wants India to join the relatively new `Squad’ strategic alliance it has forged with the US, Australia and Japan to counter such threats in the crucial Indo-Pacific region .Pointing to China’s “illegal, coercive and disruptive Grey Zone” tactics to claim territory and build militarised artificial islands in the South China Sea region, Philippines chief of staff of armed forces General Romeo S Brawner said countries like India and South Korea should also be `included’ in the Squad.China was clearly the big dragon in the room when top military officers of the `Quad’ (India, US, Australia and Japan) and the Philippines got together to discuss maritime security challenges in the Indo-Pacific during the Raisina Dialogue here on Wednesday.“The three artificial islands created by China give it effective control over the South China Sea. They have built a 2.7-km runway, with air defence and other missile systems, on Mischief Reef…Moving forward, it is our belief that they will take full control of the South China Sea,” Gen Brawner said.China has been strong-arming its neighbours in the South and East China Seas as well as the Taiwan Strait to push its territorial claims, flouting all international norms. Japan, on its part, is doubling its defence spending to improve its current war-fighting capabilities and prepare for the future, said Japanese chief of joint staff Gen Yoshihide Yoshida.US Indo-Pacific Command chief Admiral Samuel Paparo, who also dwelt upon the prospect of China forcibly intervening in Taiwan, in turn, said all countries that believe matters should not be “settled by force” should build and maintain a strong deterrence posture.China, with the world’s largest Navy of 370 warships and submarines, now of course also deploys seven to eight naval vessels on a permanent basis in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), including dual-purpose research or spy ships to map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.Navy chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said India believed it was its responsibility to ensure IOR remains peaceful and stable, with unhindered passage of trade. “A Navy that does not deploy does not deter. So, we have been deploying far and wide…We are quite capable of maintaining MDA (maritime domain awareness) in the IOR. We are aware of who is doing what, where and how,” he said.India is “keeping a close watch” on dual-purpose and other naval vessels operating in the IOR, sharing intelligence, building bilateral, trilateral and multilateral partnerships, and helping island nations build capacity, Admiral Tripathi added.Former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed, sitting in the audience, asked whether the new Trump administration can be trusted to remain steadfast about its partners in the Indo-Pacific. The consensus, by and large, was that while the US may rollback from Europe, the Indo-Pacific would remain on the top of Trump’s radar screen.“We foresee an increase in support to the Indo-Pacific,” Gen Brawner said. Admiral Paparo added that the Trump administration had reiterated its commitment to the Indo-Pacific and its partners there. One of the first meetings of the new administration was of the foreign ministers of the Quad, he added.","China has been strong-arming its neighbours in the South and East China Seas as well as the Taiwan Strait to push its territorial claims, flouting all international norms.

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Thursday dismissed speculation about his closeness to the BJP , saying, ""he is not the one who starts one game and ends up playing another.""Speaking in the J-K Assembly, Abdullah said, ""We are not those who start somewhere else and then end up playing another game. We have come to play cricket and with the blessings of almighty will be winners after our five years term.""""The intelligent captain and player is the one who adapts to the situation and changes his tactics and not the game.

NEW DELHI: Big indigenous guns are finally booming. The PM-led cabinet committee on security on Wednesday cleared the around Rs 7,000 crore deal to acquire advanced towed artillery gun systems ( ATAGS ) for the Army , in a major boost for home-grown capability to manufacture such heavy-duty howitzers .The deal is for 307 howitzers, which have a strike range up to 45-48-km, and 327 gun-towing vehicles to arm 15 artillery regiments of the Army, with the contract expected to be inked next week, top sources told TOI.Designed and developed by DRDO , the 155mm/52-calibre ATAGS will be produced by Bharat Forge and Tata Advanced Systems . Bharat Forge will manufacture 60% of the guns after it emerged as the L-1 (lowest bidder), while Tata will produce the remaining 40%.TOI was the first to report that the ATAGS deal would be inked within this fiscal after clearance from the CCS. The orders for ATAGS are likely to go up in the future because the Army plans to induct “more advanced versions” for a total requirement of 1,580 such guns.India, incidentally, has also secured a couple of export orders for the ATAGs, which officers say have “excellent” accuracy, consistency, mobility, reliability and automation, and can fire five-round bursts as compared to three-round bursts by other contemporary foreign guns.With ATAGS having an “all-electric drive technology” to ensure maintenance-free reliable operations over longer periods of time, India will be able to export the guns in large numbers in the years ahead, an officer said.The ATAGS, whose development began in 2013, has undergone a series of protracted field trials over the years. Finally, in 2021-22, the winter trials were successfully completed at high-altitude areas in Sikkim, which were followed by summer user-firing tests at the Pokhran field firing ranges.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has again driven home the operational utility of long-range, high-volume firepower. Consequently, the Army is progressively stepping up induction of howitzers, missiles, rocket systems and loiter munitions, as reported by TOI earlier.In Dec, for instance, the defence ministry inked a Rs 7,629 crore contract with L&T in collaboration with South Korean Hanwha Defence for the procurement of another 100 K-9 Vajra-T self-propelled tracked gun systems, which have a strike range of 28-38 km and can be deployed in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China.Then in Feb, the MoD inked contracts worth Rs 10,147 crore for high-explosive pre-fragmented extended rockets (45-km range) and area denial munitions (37-km) for the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems being inducted by the Army. Pinaka, too, is being exported to other countries.India has grappled with recurring scandals in import of artillery guns , from the Swedish Bofors in the mid-1980s to the South African Denel in 2005 and Singapore Technology Kinetics in 2009, repeatedly derailing the Army's modernization drive.","The deal is for 307 howitzers, which have a strike range up to 45-48-km, and 327 gun-towing vehicles to arm 15 artillery regiments of the Army.

NEW DELHI: Military modernisation proposals worth over Rs 54,000 crore, ranging from BrahMos missiles and six ‘Netra’ airborne earlywarning and control (AEW&C) aircraft to upgraded Russian engines for T-90 tanks, naval anti-aircraft missiles and torpedoes, were given preliminary nod by defence ministry on Thursday.Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council (DAC) accorded “acceptance of necessity (AoN)” to additional Army regiments and IAF squadrons of BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, whose strike range has been extended to 450km from the original 290km, worth around Rs 20,000 crore, sources told TOI.BrahMos missiles, jointly manufactured with Russia in India, have become the “prime conventional (nonnuclear) precision-strike weapon” for the armed forces, with contracts worth over Rs 55,000 crore already inked over the years. The grant of an AON, of course, is just the first step in the long-winded procurement procedure that can take years before the final contract is inked. Towards this end, DAC also approved guidelines to reduce timelines at various stages to make the process “faster, more effective and efficient”.Another key takeaway was the fresh AoN granted for six ‘Netra’ AEW&C Mark-1A aircraft or “eyes in the sky” for IAF to boost surveillance capabilities along the borders as well as help direct friendly fighters during air combat with enemy jets.The new Netra aircraft, which will entail mounting indigenous active electronically scanned array antenna-based radars, electronic and signal intelligence systems on Brazilian Embraer-145 jets, will cost over Rs 9,000 crore. With IAF currently making do with just three Netra Mark-1 planes and three Israeli ‘Phalcon’ radars mounted on Russian IL-76 aircraft, India is lagging far behind Pakistan, let alone China, in this arena.The Navy, in turn, got AoNs for additional indigenous shiplaunched Varunastra torpedoes and Russian Shtil antiaircraft missiles for its four 3,900-tonne upgraded Krivak-III class frigates. While the first frigate INS Tushil has sailed to India from Russia, the second will come later this year.The other two are being built at Goa Shipyard with transfer of technology at a cost of around Rs 13,000 crore. AoN was also granted for procurement of 1,350 horsepower engines from Russia for T-90S ‘Bhishma’ mainbattle tanks, which currently have 1000 HP engines. The force has inducted around 1,300 T-90S tanks of the 1,657 being produced by the Heavy Vehicles Factory under licence from Russia. “The engine upgrade will enhance the battlefield mobility of these tanks especially in high-altitude areas by increasing the power to weight ratio,” an official said.","BrahMos missiles, jointly manufactured with Russia in India, have become the “prime conventional (nonnuclear) precision-strike weapon” for the armed forces.

A securityman also died in the gunfight.Bastar range IG P Sundarraj told TOI that the bigger encounter was in Bijapur's Gangaloor, a hotbed of insurgency that has seen much bloodshed. This is the first major operation in Gangaloor after the March 3 surrender of Maoist commander Dinesh Modiyam, who called the shots in the area. As many as 26 of Modiyam's ex-comrades were killed in the encounter. The operations in Bijapur & Kanker - nearly 300km apart - were launched simultaneously.In just 80 days, 113 Maoists have been killed by security forces in Chhattisgarh - 91 of them in Bijapur. Last year, 287 Maoists were neutralised in the Bastar division.Union home minister Amit Shah lauded the forces' bravery, saying: ""Our soldiers have achieved another major success in the direction of ' Naxal-Free India Campaign '. Many Naxals were killed in two operations by our security forces in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur and Kanker. Modi govt is moving forward with a ruthless approach against Naxals, and despite various facilities for surrender and inclusion, it is adopting a zero-tolerance policy against those Naxals who refuse to surrender. The country is set to be Naxal-free by March 31 next year.""Sundarraj said a joint team of Bijapur and Sukma District Reserve Guards (DRG), CoBRA commandos and CRPF personnel set out on an operation in Gangaloor based on specific inputs about the presence of Maoists.The first exchange of fire took place around 7am and intermittent firing went on till after noon.When the guns fell silent, the forces found 26 dead Maoists scattered across the battleground.Police also rounded up a group of senior cadres in the forest, sources said, adding that the search is still under way.The body of DRG jawan Raju Oyam, who was killed in the encounter, has been evacuated. ""His sacrifice will not go in vain,"" chief minister Vishnu Deo Sai said, adding, ""Our fight against Naxalism continues with great strength.""In Kanker, a joint team of DRG and BSF hit Maoists of North Bastar Marh division. Four bodies were found in the forests along the borders of Kanker and Narayanpur districts, Kanker SP Kalyan Elesela said.

Apples from Thar: Rajasthan farmers cultivate a taste of Himalayas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/apples-from-thar-raj-farmers-cultivate-a-taste-of-himalayas/articleshow/119276846.cms,"JAIPUR: The Thar in Rajasthan stretches duney and dry. Summer temperatures climb to a blistering 49°C. But the desert is changing. A fruit synonymous with the Himalayas has found an unexpected home in this sea of sand and scorching sun. Apples - red and ripe. What seemed impossible is now a flourishing reality for farmers in Sikar and Jhunjhunu districts, defying conventional wisdom about the fruit's need for cool climates.Santosh Khedar, a farmer from Beri village in Sikar, never imagined her small experiment would turn into a successful apple orchard. A single sapling given to her in 2015 by National Innovation Foundation in Gujarat has multiplied into a thriving apple farm yielding more than 6,000kg of fruit each season.""Since we have a certificate of organic farming from Rajasthan Organic Certification Agency, if the market price for apples from Himachal and Kashmir is Rs 100 a kg, we are selling it at Rs 150/kg,"" said Santosh's son Rahul, who studied agriculture, determined to ensure the family farm continued to thrive.The family had long grown lemon, guava, and sweet lime on their 1.25-acre farm, but an apple tree seemed like a fantasy. ""We were initially sceptical,"" Santosh said. ""We watered the plant and used organic fertilisers as needed. A year later, we saw apples growing on it.""Her neighbours laughed at the idea. Apples? Here? They shook their heads at the thought. But Santosh's tree did not care for their disbelief. In its second year, it bore nearly 40kg of fruit.The secret to this unexpected success lies in the HRMN-99 apple variety , specifically developed to withstand extreme temperatures. ""This variety can grow in arid regions where summer temperatures exceed 40°C,"" Rahul said. Encouraged by the results, Santosh and her family acquired more saplings and used grafting techniques to expand their orchard to 100 trees. ""Ab to paani bhi koni laage jyada (Now, we barely need extra water),"" she said.Apple trees require minimal irrigation once they mature. ""By the time the plant is five years old, it only needs watering once every two weeks,"" deputy director of horticulture Madan Lal Jat said. ""Flowering begins in Feb and the apples are ready for harvest by June.""Those who once scoffed at Santosh are now eager to follow in her footsteps. ""Jo manya konya ve ib podho maange hai,"" she said in her native dialect, meaning: ""Those who didn't believe now ask for a sapling."" In nearby Katrathal village, farmer Mohit Chaudhary has cultivated 50 apple trees. Horticulture official Jat sees a growing trend. ""Ten years ago, people in Barmer cultivated dates and pomegranates. Now, we have farmers growing strawberries in Chittorgarh and Bhilwara,"" he said. ""In five years, apple farming could spread across more regions,"" he said.","Santosh Khedar, a farmer from Beri village in Sikar, never imagined her small experiment would turn into a successful apple orchard.

Supreme Court ruling set to ease govt land acquisition process,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-ruling-set-to-ease-govt-land-acquisition-process/articleshow/119276265.cms,"SC: Validating bid to nullify state’s land buy nothing short of permitting fraud

NEW DELHI: Frowning at vexatious litigation relating to land acquisition, which delays projects for decades, Supreme Court Thursday ruled that when a govt acquires land for public purposes using its sovereign powers, it cannot be frustrated by creation of third-party rights after the acquisition.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said even a public body for whom an acquisition was done can't give the land to someone through a private agreement as only govt has the power to withdraw acquisition for the entire land, or a portion of it.Litigation relating to acquired land, mainly because of creation of third-party rights, has been a key factor for delay in execution of many projects, especially national highways.This ruling may help ease the impediments caused by post-acquisition litigation.The case that warranted the ruling pertained to acquisition of 33 acres abutting Narela-Bawana Road to enable Delhi Agricultural Marketing Board to establish its grain market. The acquisition notification was issued in Oct 30, 1963 and the award determining compensation issued on Jan 10, 1986. When a woman claimed ownership over a portion of the land, the Board chairman surreptitiously entered into a private agreement with her and agreed to release half of the claimed land to her while permitting her to claim compensation for the other half.Writing the judgment, Justice Kumar said the flow of events turned curiouser and curiouser as in 'Alice in Wonderland'. After the chairman's retirement, the Board disputed the agreement. But Delhi high court allowed the woman's plea for arbitration of the dispute with the Board relating to the acquired land. The arbitrator appointed by the HC ruled in favour of the woman and said the return of the land was valid.""When the state uses its sovereign power of eminent domain and acquires land for a public purpose, such an exercise cannot be set at naught by the beneficiary of such acquisition, the Board, by entering into a private agreement shortly after the acquisition so as to reverse the usage of the power of eminent domain by the state,"" Justice Kumar said. ""Validating this dubious enterprise by a statutory beneficiary of a compulsory acquisition would be nothing short of permitting a fraud on the exercise of such sovereign power by the state,"" he added.""Given the further fact that the only objective of the said agreement was to thwart the compulsory acquisition of the subject land by returning a portion thereof to Bhagwan Devi, the agreement was patently opposed to all tenets of law,"" the bench said while quashing the orders of the HC and the arbitral award.","Litigation relating to acquired land has been a key factor for delay in execution of many projects, especially national highways. Ruling may help ease the impediments caused by post-acquisition litigation. Case that warranted the ruling pertained to acquisition of 33 acres abutting Narela-Bawana Road.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119276367,imgsize-1015725,width-400,resizemode-4/119276367.jpg"

HYDERABAD: Some of Telugu film industry 's top actors were charged Thursday with promoting online betting apps , allegedly luring people into investing in them. Police filed an FIR against Rana Daggubati , Vijay Devarakonda , Prakash Raj , Manchu Lakshmi, Pranitha, Nidhi Agarwal and Ananya Nagella, along with a number of social media influencers, for their role in endorsing these apps.In Telangana, online betting has been illegal since 2017 under an amended law that aims to protect people from financial harm linked to gambling. Cyberabad police commissioner Avinash Mohanty said officers are probing how these apps operate and the extent of the involvement of celebrities and influencers. ED is also set to investigate the actors and influencers. The agency will file enforcement case information reports (ECIRs) and summon those involved under the money laundering law (PMLA).Cops acted on a complaint by PM Phanindra Sarma, who alleged that betting apps aggressively advertise on social media, using star endorsements to attract users.Rana Daggubati responded to the FIR, saying his contract with a gaming company ended in 2017. His endorsement was limited to regions where skill-based games were legally permitted, he said.In a statement, his legal team emphasised that all partnerships undergo careful legal review before agreements are made. ""It is essential to highlight these online games have been recognised by SC as distinct from gambling,"" the statement read.Two more actors said they ended their associations with betting apps long ago. Prakash Raj posted on X, saying police had not contacted him but that he was ""ready to cooperate"". He said he worked with a firm in 2016 but withdrew in 2017 after realising its nature. When a new company used the same commercial in 2021, he issued legal notices.Actor Vijay's team said he endorsed a skill-based gaming app only in regions where the app was legally permitted.","Police filed an FIR against Rana Daggubati, Vijay Devarakonda, Prakash Raj, Manchu Lakshmi, Pranitha, Nidhi Agarwal and Ananya Nagella, along with a number of social media influencers.

The process becomes more complex and time-taking when matters reach courts after landowners create third-party rights or all affected parties seek rehabilitation. The issue of land acquisition getting stuck or delayed has been flagged in several govt reports and even at the Pragati meetings chaired by PM Narendra Modi.""Once the land acquisition issue is resolved, projects can be put on fast-track mode. Most highway projects delayed or stuck are due to land acquisition and forest clearance issues,"" said a senior official in an infrastructure ministry.In fact, the road transport ministry, which acquires maximum land among all govt entities, has proposed amending the National Highways Act , specifying a provision that no one will be allowed to make any transaction or create any encumbrance on land from the date of publication of notification till the process is complete.In fact, the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, says, ""No person shall make any transaction or cause any transaction of land specified in the preliminary notification or create any encumbrances on such land from the date of publication of such notification till such time as the proceedings are completed.""An official said, ""Some of the proposed amendments to the NH Act have been made to align it with the Right to Fair Compensation Act .

""Our estimate was $2.5-3.5 million which we thought was fair, but this was a phenomenal work,"" says Nishad Avari, head of South Asian Modern and Contemporary Art at Christie's.""The only comparable work is Husain's Zameen, which is in the collection of the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi,"" Avari adds.Husain, often known as India's barefoot Picasso, started his career as a hoarding painter, and like the Bollywood posters he painted, his story was quite filmy. It didn't have such a happy ending though as death threats and multiple lawsuits forced the artist into exile. ""This is a homecoming of sorts for Husain,"" says Yashodhara Dalmia, art historian and curator. A founding member of the Progressive Artists Group , Husain and his contemporaries gave Indian art a new modernist language post-Independence. ""Gram Yatra shows his modernist vocabulary and influences but is yet completely rooted in India. He spotlighted the ordinary Indian in the painting. You can see a farmer tilling the soil, a woman using a chakki to mill wheat and a couple strolling by.""Avari says his favourite panel is the farmer. ""The farmer is shown holding up the land - physically and metaphorically."" By choosing to highlight the farmer, Avari explains, the artist ""is forcing his viewers to focus on the foundational importance of rural India in the wake of the new nation, even as the country underwent urbanisation.""The painting, says Anand, realises Gandhi's vision . ""Gandhi said that India's soul lives in its villages and Husain captures that soul on canvas. His name is synonymous with Indian art."" But despite this fame, Anand admits that Husain's work has been relatively underpriced till now. ""When you compared the prices to his contemporaries, they were always lower, but this sale is going to change that.""Perhaps it will encourage many Indians, who have been holding on to sketches and paintings that the flamboyant and ever-generous Husain saab gifted to them, to bring out their bounty."," MF Husain Gram Yatra fetched $3.5 million at Christie's auction.

After much suspense, the doctor offered Husain a princely sum of Rs 1,000 for the painting. That, says Avari, was a record price for a work of Indian art then.

NEW DELHI: A fire that broke out in the residential bungalow of a Delhi high court judge resulted in recovery of a huge pile of cash, sending shock waves in judicial corridors and forcing the Supreme Court collegium led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna to decide to transfer him to another HC.When the fire broke out, Justice Yashwant Varma was not in town and his family members called the fire brigade and police. After the fire was doused, first responders found a huge amount of cash inside a room, leading to official entries being made about the recovery of what appeared to be unaccounted money.The local cops informed their seniors who briefed the brass about the accidental discovery. Soon, the news reached the higher-ups in the govt, who, in turn, informed the CJI about the hoard. CJI Khanna took a very serious view and immediately called for a collegium meeting.The collegium was unanimous that Justice Varma needed to be transferred immediately. He has been transferred to his parent HC, Allahabad HC. He had moved from there to Delhi HC in Oct 2021.However, some members of the five-judge collegium felt such a serious incident, if let off with a transfer, would not only tarnish the judiciary's image but also erode trust in the institution. They said Justice Varma should be asked to resign and if he declined, an in-house inquiry should be initiated by the CJI, as the first step towards his removal by Parliament.As per the in-house procedure devised by SC in 1999 to deal with allegations of corruption, wrongdoing or impropriety against constitutional court judges, CJI on receipt of a complaint, seeks response of the judge.He can set up the in-house probe panel comprising an SC judge and chief justices of two HCs in case he is not satisfied with the response or concludes that the matter requires deeper probe.","A fire that broke out in the residential bungalow of a Delhi high court judge resulted in recovery of a huge pile of cash.

Former Irish Formula One (F1) team owner, and television personality Eddie Jordan died on March 20, 2025, aged 76. Jordan was suffering from aggressive prostate cancer, and died in the early hours of Thursday morning. His life, on the track, in the boardroom, and in the television studio, has left a permanent legacy on motorsport and well beyond. His team first entered Formula 1 in 1991 and was famous for the nurturing of young drivers such as Michael Schumacher, Rubens Barrichello, and Eddie Irvine.Eddie Jordan OBE was a renowned retired racing driver, businessman, and media personality whose net worth was estimated at $600 million in 2025, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Despite financial cutbacks, an influx of financiers, and intensified competition to make it difficult to maintain an independent team, his era witnessed the team register very notable success like a 1998 Belgian Grand Prix victory as well as a legendary 1-2 display at the 1999 German Grand Prix and coming in the third position at the Constructors' Championship for the year. In 2005, Jordan sold the team to the Midland Group for an estimated $60 million, retiring as a team owner in style.Outside of F1, Jordan was a prosperous entrepreneur, investing in real estate, media, and entertainment industries. He also proved to be an enthusiastic F1 pundit for BBC and Channel 4, whose loud mouth and tight-knit industry insight made him a favourite across the board.Born on 30 March 1948 as Edmund Patrick Jordan in Dublin, Ireland, Jordan continually relocated between Dartry, South Dublin, and Bray, County Wicklow.He fell ill with pink disease as an infant and had to be moved for fresh air.He attended Synge Street Christian Brothers School. Initially he had wanted to become a priest but thereafter followed an accounting studies course in the College of Commerce, Dublin, before qualifying to join the Bank of Ireland's staff as a clerk. His existence was transformed in a 1970 bank strike when he came across kart racing in Jersey, which would remain his life-long motorsport enthusiasm.Jordan's racing career started when he won the Irish Kart Championship in 1971. He moved through Formula Ford and Formula Three before being obliged to switch his interest by a 1976 leg injury. In 1979, he set up Eddie Jordan Racing, tending to budding drivers like Damon Hill and Martin Brundle. His Formula 3000 team swept the board in 1989 with Jean Alesi taking the championship.In 1991, Jordan jumped to Formula One and set up the Jordan Grand Prix. His outfit was associated with a high-risk strategy and beating best-of-the-breed outfits on the bare minimum budget. Most memorable of all, Michael Schumacher drove Jordan's F1 debut in 1991 before he fell out with Jordan's outfit after the first race to move to Benetton amid controversy.The golden era of the team was 1998 and 1999, with Damon Hill's Spa win and Heinz-Harald Frentzen's championship run in 1999, finishing third overall. But by the mid-2000s, financial and legal issues compelled Jordan to sell his team, closing an era.After coming out of F1 team ownership, Jordan was highly in demand as a motorsport pundit. He started at BBC F1 in 2009 before joining Channel 4, his blunt opinions and tireless enthusiasm making him a celebrity among race fans.Jordan was married to Marie McCarthy, a retired Irish basketball player, since 1979. The couple had four children and shared time between houses in Ireland, London, Monaco, and Wentworth. He was a yachtsman, helicopter enthusiast, and fast car aficionado who enjoyed the high-octane lifestyle of an authentic motorsport legend.Eddie Jordan's transition from bank clerk to racing mogul exposed his entrepreneurial skills, motor racing expertise, and affable nature. His contribution to the sport was deeper than that of a team proprietor, influencing scores of careers and shaping modern-day F1. Rooted in both business and entertainment, Jordan's legacy as a motorsport personality will resonate for generations.","Eddie Jordan OBE was a renowned retired racing driver, businessman, and media personality whose net worth was estimated at $600 million in 2025.

The court has accepted the joint petition of both parties.

However, Section 13B(2) of the Hindu Marriage Act mandates a statutory cooling-off period of at least six months from the date of filing to allow for the possibility of reconciliation.In a landmark 2017 ruling, the Supreme Court held that the six-month cooling-off period is not mandatory and may be waived if the court is satisfied that there is no chance of the couple resuming cohabitation.Dhanashree, 28, is a well-known dancer famous for her fusion performances that combine traditional Indian dance forms with contemporary styles.Recently, Chahal was spotted among the spectators at the Champions Trophy Final, sitting next to social media star RJ Mahvash.

Q. But surely more people would have travelled for the CWG if not for the cancellation. Are you disappointed?

Q. What about Melbourne for rest of the year? When no Boxing Day Test, tennis, Formula 1. How do you keep everyone interested then?

For long Melbourne has been a global sporting and cultural hub, attracting visitors from China, India, and beyond. During the summer, at the heart of it lies the sporting calendar. From iconic events like the Boxing Day Test - which broke attendance and viewership records this time during Australia vs India; the Australian Open , the Formula 1 race to a first-time ever Pro Kabaddi League, the city offers a diverse blend of sports, food, and festivals.In a conversation on the sidelines of the Australian Open in Melbourne, Brendan McClements , CEO of Visit Victoria , sheds light on how Melbourne leverages these major events, its partnership with Cricket Australia , and how the city's multicultural charm boosts tourism and attract Indian travellers to Victoria.Yeah, well I think I'd extend it. I'd put December in there because of cricket (Boxing Day Test) obviously. First cricket, then to the tennis (Australian Open) and to the Grand Prix (Australian GP), it's just a fantastic time of year if you're a sports lover. And then it's not so visible on the broadcast but underneath that, Melbourne also has its Food and Wine Festival, its Comedy Festival, its Fashion Festival.This is a really good time to be experiencing Melbourne, whether you're Melburnian or a visitor, there's a lot of choices that are available for people. And this year in particular with Boxing Day and with obviously the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, as well as Kabaddi, the PKL, and then we're rolling into tennis and then we'll see where we go from here. But it's a fantastic time of year to be in Melbourne.This is the first time we've had a complete relationship with Cricket Australia. And so the experience we've had from our perspective has been fantastic with Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Obviously we're really blessed to have the MCG , an iconic stadium.This year with India coming through and the passion we know India possesses for that sport, and then the Australian-Indian rivalry, everything came together really well for us this year. The rivalry, the cricket itself, the players did a brilliant job. So the cricket was great.We put ourselves in the right position to get the outcome we did. The relationship with Cricket Australia, we have a great stadium, we know the Boxing Day Test is iconic, and then all of those together produced what we saw. And it's fantastic to think the most viewed series ever, the most attended match ever.We've got the Ashes this year so we know what level we've got to beat.So what we've done with Cricket Australia is said, 'How do we make sure as many people as possible experience the Boxing Day Test?' So the opportunity is to bring more people through the gates, and we've said to them, we want to work with you on that basis. If we're going to be partners in promoting the cricket, well, from our side, what we want to see is more and more people coming.So this year was great because obviously the biggest Test crowd in Australian history. So we give ourselves a tick about what we wanted to do, and it was great to work with Cricket Australia. We're lucky in Melbourne as well because we're quite a diverse, multicultural city, and one of the great communities we have is the Indian community, and we saw them come out in spades and support, whether it was India or they supported Australia, maybe second generation, but again, that made the experience even better.I thought it was fantastic and the feedback we're getting is equally the same. It was really great to have in Melbourne a sport that showcases Indian culture, not just the sport itself, but a partner in JioStar, they brought the whole show to town. So announcers, entertainers, experience, the match production, it was all based on what we see at a PKL game in India, and I thought the crowd really enjoyed it.So 5,000 people in the venue experiencing what it looked like to be in India. I went to Noida to see the PKL game there so it was a faithful representation of the excitement that goes from PKL game. So the Australian crowd reacted well to it and we understand in India we're still getting our numbers through, but the response has been fantastic.You know, the audiences, the people who viewed it, we ran a competition with Star Sports, we had a fantastic response to that. So we feel really strongly that it added a lot to it, and then having cricket, kabaddi, tennis all coming together, it's been a brilliant time to be a sports fan or a visitor to Melbourne.Oh, absolutely, yeah. I think one of the things that we've seen is the power of our partner in Star Sports in particular. Obviously, India from a travel perspective is one of the emerging superpowers in the world. So it's one of those markets that the world continues to recover from COVID.The response to India from Indians to the opportunity to travel has been through the roof. So what we see is an opportunity for those Indians who choose to travel overseas to really try and choose to come to Melbourne. So one of the things that we've learned is the power of the partnership we have through Star, and with Cricket Australia to be fair, because that's one of the parts of it, gives us an incredible platform to showcase Melbourne and Victoria in India.So we think that's the start of the journey, not the finish, but we've seen it. Travel searches for Melbourne were up 46 percent compared to the year before. So people were able to see that reasonably through a couple of providers.So in that period of something in the order of 450,000 Indian searches for trips to Melbourne coming through that period. So there is a hard to say what causes it, but there's an absolute correlation. Melbourne being very visible through Star, through those properties, resulting in potential Indian travellers being far more interested in coming.So we're really enthusiastic about that early review. We've got a bit more work to do about it, but the indications so far have been great. Big crowd in the venue, good crowd watching on TV, and then for us, the sky-scattered data we get about people actually thinking about coming indicates that that really had the effect we were hoping for.India's such a massive market and it is quite unique in each city. Obviously we have direct flights to Mumbai and Delhi with Air India and Qantas, fantastic partners for us. But with other airlines we work with, so you can come to Australia through Melbourne, through Thai, through Malaysia, through Singapore, through Sri Lankan. You can even go via Dubai or the Arabian Gulf if you want to.That means for virtually every part of India, Melbourne is accessible because Thai, for instance, fly 100 times a week from India to Bangkok, and one of their most popular routes is Bangkok down to Melbourne. So we've got an interest wherever the large population centres are, and the dynamics of India are so extremely exciting at the moment, whether it's Hyderabad, Chennai, Amritsar, these cities are all in the mix as being, in their own right, large powerhouses to drive.Not that we've seen. I think what you'll see, since that decision, we've had record numbers for the Grand Prix, record numbers for the tennis, extremely strong domestic AFL football finals. We've seen the growth in international travel. We've talked about the growth out of India.So what we're seeing is consumers are not making a decision about Commonwealth Games. The decision about the Commonwealth Games hasn't influenced the decision of consumers on whether they want to come to Melbourne or Victoria. So they're sort of independent of each other.One decision that's been made, we move on. But what we're pleased with is our numbers continue to grow across all the markets, including some of those Commonwealth markets.I'm not disappointed with the decision. It wasn't my decision to make, and the people who made the decision made the decision. One of the strengths that Melbourne has and Victoria has, we've always had quite a long and committed major events calendar. And for many of those markets, particularly if you think of UK and Britain, this year it's the Ashes.Halfway through the year it's the Lions Tour, the rugby Lions Tour. So we've got strong reasons for those countries to continue to think about coming to Melbourne. So we find ourselves in that position, and for many of them the Grand Prix is a great attraction as well.So we feel on balance that we've got enough diversity across the calendar and across the years to accommodate a decision that was made. And what we're seeing is the decision that was made hasn't impacted consumer decisions about to come to Melbourne or not. And we've got enough offerings in enough variety of things to continue to appeal those markets.So New Zealand with horse racing, India with the cricket, or rugby, Lions, Ashes. We feel lucky that we've got that sort of depth and breadth across our calendar.Yes, so there's a few different ways and it depends on which market you're talking about too. Certainly this time of year there's a real focus on many of the international markets. If I took this year for example though, in the middle of the year that's where we'll have the Lions come.So UK, England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales suddenly become focused on what it means to be in Melbourne. So we have a broadcast platform there. We never lose sight of the importance of the Australian market for us as well.So our Indigenous code, Australian Rules football, continues to flow through the year and then we reach its crescendo, the Grand Final in September. Then we go into horse racing in November. So we've got a horse racing that appeals to certain markets strongly, domestic importantly, but also to New Zealand, a bit to England and Japan.So we've got the ability to take the clay that we've been given and mould it as we need to and we do try and do that over time.Sports is absolutely an important part of it but we also have a strong cultural programme. So Kusama, an exhibition at the NGV at the moment, people can underestimate the power of the cultural offering to drive decisions on coming to.But we're seeing, I think opening in December, already we've had 100,000 people through Kusama exhibition. So it's just the layers of sport, culture, activities, all the things that can plug back into some of those drivers around what people want. The sports platform does allow us to talk about the other things because you're reaching large numbers of people.So that's where we think we can exploit, if that's the right word, our sporting major events to better showcase the diversity of destination. Whether it's wildlife, the penguins, Great Ocean Road, Twelve Apostles, whether it's the food, the culture, the coffee, that's the way in which we're trying to pull it all together.","Melbourne is a global sporting and cultural hub, attracting visitors from China, India, and beyond.

""Smart Indian-American children, whose parents work in engineering or tech, are moving to High Finance. This mirrors what smart Americans have done for well over a generation -when I got my PhD from Princeton in 1994, a former engineer from silicon valley, who moved to a Wall Street job, tried to persuade me to join their quantitative analysis and trading team and I instead took a lower paying job as an engineer at Qualcomm. I did not find the idea of making money on money appealing - probably my father's admonition from childhood.

Recently I have noticed that smart well-educated Indians are gravitating to Finance. This is not good.

We need to apply our talents to solve hard engineering and tech problems, hard urban and rural infrastructure problems, hard health care problems and so on.

Making money on money feels easy but a finance-driven economy would destroy society. This is ancient wisdom, and we must pay heed.""

‘Wise advice…’ commented users

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has a word of caution for the children of Indian-Americans working in the technology industry. In a post on Twitter, Sridhar Vembu has expressed concern about what he called 'Smart Indian-American children' increasingly pursuing careers in finance, warning of the risks of an economy overly dependent on financial systems. Vembu said that he has observed a growing shift among Indian-American youth, particularly those from engineering or tech backgrounds, towards high finance—echoing a pattern seen in the United States for decades.Drawing from his own life, he shared how he was once encouraged to join a Wall Street trading team after earning his PhD from Princeton in 1994 but opted for a lower-paying engineering role at Qualcomm instead. ""I did not find the idea of making money on money appealing—probably my father's admonition from childhood,"" he noted.He expressed concern that educated and talented individuals are increasingly choosing finance over sectors like technology, infrastructure, and healthcare, where their skills could have a more tangible and positive impact on society. ""Making money on money feels easy, but a finance-driven economy would destroy society,"" Vembu cautioned, adding that this is ""ancient wisdom"" that should not be ignored.The post has garnered significant attention, with many users engaging in discussions about the implications of finance-centric policies on societal well-being. “Basically, the essence of engineering in engineers must not fade. Wise advice ! But for grads with liabilities like 1st house, car, & marriage, how do they prioritize their love for engineering over higher-paying jobs? Not yet in college but would love to know your view,” commented one user.“Completely agree with the sentiment. Unfortunately solving hard engineering problems doesn’t pay high money. Something we’ll have to look at the incentives and compensation structures and the ecosystem. Ppl shouldn’t find it an aversion as they have to go through hoops to get the resources to work in hard engg problems. Some abundance mindset needed by capital allocators,” said another user.","Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has expressed concern about what he called 'Smart Indian-American children' increasingly pursuing careers in finance.

Kim Kardashian’s history with Tesla



Kim Kardashian , the global reality TV star and entrepreneur, has sparked intense backlash on social media following a recent photoshoot featuring a Tesla robot and a Cybertruck. The images, which were part of a campaign for Perfect Magazine, show Kardashian posing provocatively alongside Tesla’s humanoid robot and reclining in the back of a Cybertruck.The timing of the photoshoot has fueled criticism, as Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, are currently facing heightened scrutiny and controversies. Many online users have accused Kardashian of being tone-deaf, given the ongoing debates surrounding Tesla's corporate policies, Musk’s political stances, and labor-related concerns.Kardashian posted the images on her Instagram, where she has over 300 million followers, tagging photographer Steven Klein and Perfect Magazine. The pictures included:The photos quickly went viral, but instead of admiration, they sparked widespread criticism. Many users expressed concern over the promotion of Tesla products at a time when the company is under intense public scrutiny.The response to Kardashian’s photoshoot was overwhelmingly negative, with fans and critics alike questioning the intent behind the campaign. Many accused Kardashian of failing to acknowledge the controversies surrounding Tesla and Musk, particularly allegations of poor labor conditions and his political affiliations.Social media users suggested that the reality star’s endorsement of Tesla products was purely financial, rather than a genuine appreciation for the brand. Some found the photos with the Tesla robot unsettling, with critics likening them to a promotion of a “robotic future” and drawing comparisons to science fiction themes.On platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Reddit, thousands of users commented on the post, with remarks such as,Another user wrote,One posted,Despite the backlash, Kardashian has not responded publicly to the criticism.The criticism surrounding Kardashian’s photoshoot is closely tied to the broader issues Tesla is currently facing. Some of the most significant controversies include:Musk’s political views and affiliations have drawn widespread debate, with accusations of him aligning with right-wing ideologies. His comments on social media have frequently led to public and investor concerns about Tesla’s brand image.Tesla has faced multiple allegations regarding poor working conditions, including reports of unsafe factory environments, unfair labor practices, and opposition to unionization. These concerns have led to protests against the company.The company has been involved in legal battles related to its Autopilot technology, labor practices, and advertising claims. Regulators have questioned the safety of Tesla’s self-driving features, leading to multiple recalls.In recent months, Tesla has been at the center of global protests. The “Tesla Takedown” movement, which has gained traction in North America and Europe, urges consumers to boycott Tesla products due to Musk’s growing influence in politics and business. Given this context, many felt that Kardashian’s photoshoot was poorly timed and insensitive.Kardashian has been a known Tesla enthusiast for years, frequently seen driving custom-made Tesla vehicles, including the Cybertruck. However, this is not the first time her connection to the brand has led to controversy.In a separate incident, she was pulled over by the police while driving her Cybertruck due to the vehicle’s tinted windows violating California traffic laws. She had previously faced a similar issue in 2013.Despite the recent backlash, Kardashian’s support for Tesla products remains evident through her continued social media posts and luxury vehicle collection.","Kim Kardashian posed for a photoshoot with a Tesla robot and a Cybertruck.

Central government’s crackdown on betting apps

Telangana Police has registered an FIR against 25 celebrities, including actors Rana Daggubati , Prakash Raj, Vijay Devarakonda , and Manchu Lakshmi, for allegedly promoting illegal betting apps . The case, filed at Miyapur Police station, Hyderabad also names Praneetha, Nidhi Agarwal, Ananya Nagalla, Siri Hanumanthu, Sreemukhi, Varshini Sounderajan, Vasanthi Krishnan, Shoba Shetty, Amrutha Chowdary, Nayani Pavani, Neha Pathan, Pandu, Padhmavathi, Imran Khan, Vishnu Priya , Harsha Sai, Sunny Yadav, Shyamala, Tasty Teja, and Bandaru Sheshayani Supritha. The FIR was filed following a complaint by a businessman, Phanindra Sarma.According to the FIR, the accused promoted betting platforms through social media advertisements. It states that these platforms handle large sums of money and have led to financial losses for many individuals, particularly in middle-class and lower-middle-class families.“Thousands of lakhs of rupees are involved in these illegal platforms and it is also leading many families into distress, especially that of middle-class and lower middle-class,” the FIR reads.The complainant alleged that people have lost money through these apps and that celebrities and influencers accepted payments to endorse them. He stated that he had nearly deposited money in one such platform but decided against it after being warned by his family. The FIR claims these platforms encourage financially vulnerable individuals to invest money, leading to financial difficulties.The case has been registered under sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita related to cheating, along with provisions of the Information Technology Act and state laws.The crackdown is part of the government’s efforts to stop the promotion of betting apps, especially during major events like the Indian Premier League (IPL). In May 2024, the Consumer Affairs Ministry called for action against indirect and hidden advertisements for illegal betting and gambling platforms, saying they violated consumer protection rules. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) was asked to track violations and impose penalties, including banning these apps.A report published in July 2024 by Rashtriya Raksha University’s Security and Scientific Technical Research Association (SASTRA) highlighted the dangers of illegal online betting. It stated that these platforms are used for money laundering and terrorist financing, creating national security risks.","The case, filed at Miyapur Police station, Hyderabad also names Praneetha, Nidhi Agarwal, Ananya Nagalla, Sreemukhi, Varshini Sounderajan, Vasanthi Krishnan, Shoba Shetty, Amrutha Chowdary, Neha Pathan, Pandu, Vishnu Priya, Harsha Sai, Sunny Yadav, Shyamala, Tasty Teja, and Bandaru Sheshayani Supritha.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119255317,imgsize-84896,width-400,resizemode-4/119255317.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The brutal murder of Saurabh Rajput, an ex-merchant navy officer from Meerut , by his wife Muskan Rastogi and her lover Sahil, has sent shockwaves across the country.According to police, Muskan and Sahil Shukla confessed to having stabbed Saurabh to death on March 4. The two then chopped up his body, put the remains inside a drum and sealed it with cement.The two were arrested on Tuesday.Saurabh Rajput, a 35-year-old former merchant navy officer , matrimonially united with Muskan Rastogi, aged 27, in 2016 despite considerable familial opposition.The matrimonial pair dwelled in a leased accommodation with their six-year-old progeny.Rajput relinquished his familial responsibilities and severed ancestral ties to pursue matrimonial alliance with Muskan.Rajput returned back to India from London on February 24 to celebration his wife’s birthday the next day.Upon his homecoming, Rajput disbursed approximately Rs 1 crore amongst his intimate acquaintances.Bablu Rajput, Saurabh's sibling, stated, ""Muskan took some of my brother's money. He had brought Rs 1 crore from London, which he distributed among close people. We're not on talking terms. He never stayed with us.""Saurabh decomposed remains were discovered nearly 15 days later in his rented apartment.SP City Ayush Vikram Singh said, “Police received a tip-off about a foul smell emanating from the victim’s house.
