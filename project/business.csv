PUNE: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat lashed out Thursday against what he said was an ""unacceptable"" trend of wannabe Hindu leaders raking up ""Ram temple-like"" disputes at various sites.""India should set an example of how different faiths and ideologies can live together in harmony,"" Bhagwat said against the backdrop of new controversies surrounding the origins of places of worship, including Shahi Jama Masjid in UP's Sambhal and Ajmer Sharif in Rajasthan. The RSS chief was speaking in Pune as part of a lecture series on the theme ""Vishwaguru Bharat"".RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, who was speaking in Pune as part of a lecture series on the theme “Vishwaguru Bharat”, said Indians should learn from past mistakes and strive to make their country a role model for the world, showing how inclusivity could be practised by avoiding contentious issues. “The Ram temple was a matter of faith, and Hindus felt that it should be built... Raising issues about some new sites out of hate and enmity is unacceptable.”He said the solution to reducing friction in society was to hark back to ancient culture. “Extremism, aggressiveness, forcefulness, and insulting others’ gods is not our culture,” he declared. “There is no majority or minority here; we all are one. Everyone should be able to practise their way of worshipping in this country,” Bhagwat said.","Mohan Bhagwat: India should set an example of how different faiths and ideologies can live together in harmony.

"Is teacher recruitment 'scam' all pervasive, SC asks Bengal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-teacher-recruitment-scam-all-pervasive-sc-asks-bengal/articleshow/116485095.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday posed discomfiting questions to Bengal govt and its SSC on the 'scam' relating to recruitment of 25,000 teachers and non-teaching staff, and said there are too many flaws in the selection of candidates.Commencing final hearing on the issue, pending for over a year in SC, which had stayed Calcutta HC order cancelling appointment of teachers and non-teaching staff, a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar pointed out reasons why HC cancelled the selection process on grounds that tainted and untainted candidates cannot be segregated.The bench said tainted candidates can be divided into different categories - ineligible, those whose ranks were manipulated to bring them into the selection list, those whose marks were manipulated to make them leapfrog over meritorious candidates, manipulation of OMR (some of which were blank), and those not on the merit list getting appointed.While enumerating the alleged flaws in the recruitment process, which was advertised in 2016 while appointments made in Jan 2019, CJI Khanna in a lighter vein asked,""Dal mein kuch kala hai ya sab kuch kala hai?""More than a dozen senior advocates argued for tainted candidates seeking to question the evidence based on which HC quashed appointment of 25,000 candidates, and said this evidence can be tested only through a trial.The bench said the 'scam' in recruitment was detected by the Justice Ranjit Kumar Bag commission and confirmed by CBI. Even SSC admitted to irregularities, and based on all these findings, HC had set aside the appointments, it said and asked what was so fundamentally wrong with the HC order. As many as 22 lakh candidates had competed for 25,000 posts. But their answer sheets were destroyed by SSC in 2020.For SSC, senior advocate Jaideep Gupta said tainted candidates have been identified by CBI and the figure more or less matches with those identified by SSC. Those appointments can be cancelled, and the rest can be saved, he argued. When certain advocates argued that setting aside the appointments of thousands of teachers would tell upon studies of students from Classes 9 to 12, the bench rejected it point blank, saying, ""We will not accept such arguments.""However, the bench said it would sympathetically consider those departmental candidates who are untainted and had worked for long years before being appointed teachers through this recruitment process. ""We will consider allowing their reversion to earlier cadres,"" it said while adjourning further hearing to Jan 7. Calcutta HC's Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay, who has since resigned and become an MP on a BJP ticket, had noticed the 'scam' and sought inquiry through the Justice Bag commission.","Supreme Court on Thursday posed discomfiting questions to Bengal govt and its SSC on the'scam' relating to recruitment of 25,000 teachers and non-teaching staff.

PRAYAGRAJ: Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdheshanand Giri , the head of Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhara, lauded chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday for his exemplary leadership, calling him the ‘Sun of Sanatan'.He emphasised that under Yogi's guidance, remarkable standards are being set, advancing the cause of Sanatan Dharma as never before.Giri praised the preparations for Maha Kumbh under CM's leadership. He also lauded PM Narendra Modi's vision of making Maha Kumbh a ""Mahayagya of Unity."" He called for collective efforts to make the event clean, healthy, green, digital, and plastic-free.He emphasized the need for participation from every village across the country, alongside local administration, voluntary organisations, and pilgrims, to ensure the success of Maha Kumbh through cleanliness drives and charitable activities.Highlighting the identity Maha Kumbh gained in 2019, he expressed confidence that the 2025 edition would set new benchmarks. He said Kumbh has historically served as a centre for the exchange of ideas, a confluence of scholars, and a unifying force for Sanatani powers, playing a pivotal role in shaping the country's condition and direction alongside its religious authority.He also emphasised that Kumbh has been organised even during challenging eras, including the Mughal and British rule and under govts indifferent to Sanatan values.However, the 2019 Kumbh was a turning point, as it showcased the true and eternal essence of Sanatan to the world for the first time. Maha Kumbh 2025 would surpass past achievements and set new benchmarks of success.Praising India's balanced ""India First"" foreign policy in crises like the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Palestine conflict, he said this approach solidified India's position as a global power and a beacon of Sanatan and humanity.","Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdheshanand Giri praised the preparations for Maha Kumbh under CM's leadership.

NEW DELHI: Hours after invoking GRAP-III in Delhi-NCR as the capital’s AQI deteriorated to higher end of ‘very poor’, the Commission for Air Quality Management enforced the highest level of curbs ( GRAP-IV ) in the region soon after air quality had crossed into the ‘severe’ zone at 10pm.Previous implementations of GRAP Stage-I and modified Stage-II continue to remain active.

26/11 accused to be extradited to India? US government asks Supreme Court to dismiss Tahawwur Rana's plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/26/11-accused-to-be-extradited-to-india-us-asks-supreme-court-to-dismiss-tahawwur-ranas-plea/articleshow/116469774.cms,"Tahawwur Rana (File photo)

The US government supported India's request to extradite Tahawwur Rana, a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai attacks . The government called upon the top US court to reject ""the petition for a writ of certiorari"" submitted by Rana.Rana, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, recently petitioned the Supreme Court to block his extradition. The US Solicitor General, Elizabeth B. Prelogar , filed a response on December 16 urging the court to deny the petition.Rana had previously appealed his extradition in lower courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, but was unsuccessful. ""The (India US Extradition) Treaty permits Rana's extradition,"" the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had ruled in August.He then filed a ""petition for a writ of certiorari"" with the Supreme Court on November 13. This petition represents Rana’s final legal attempt to avoid extradition.A writ of certiorari is a request to a higher court to review a lower court's ruling. The term ""certiorari"" comes from Law Latin, meaning ""to be more fully informed.""Rana's ""petition for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"" contends that he was previously tried and cleared in the federal court of Northern District of Illinois (Chicago) regarding the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. His petition states, ""India now seeks to extradite him for trial on charges based on the identical conduct at issue in the Chicago case.""However, Prelogar argued that Rana is not exempt from extradition. She contends that the Indian charges against Rana are not fully identical to the charges he faced in a US federal court in Chicago. ""The government does not concede that all of the conduct on which India seeks extradition was covered by the government's prosecution in this case. For example, India's forgery charges are based in part on conduct that was not charged in the United States: petitioner's use of false information in an application to formally open a branch office of the Immigration Law Centre submitted to the Reserve Bank of India,"" she said as quoted by news agency PTI.She further explained that the prior US case against Rana, which resulted in an acquittal on some charges, does not cover all the conduct India intends to prosecute. ""It is not clear that the jury's verdict in this case - which involves conspiracy charges and was somewhat difficult to parse - means that he has been 'convicted or acquitted' on all of the specific conduct that India has charged.""","Tahawwur Rana is a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

"Flagging farm loan waivers, cash transfers & other sops, RBI says rationalise subsidies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/flagging-farm-loan-waivers-cash-transfers-other-sops-rbi-says-rationalise-subsidies/articleshow/116482663.cms,"NEW DELHI: Reserve Bank of India on Thursday flagged its concern over several states announcing farm loan waivers , free power to agriculture and households, free transport and cash transfers to women and youth, cautioning that these spends will lower the funds available to undertake expenditure on building social and physical infrastructure as well as research and development.RBI's red flag comes amid a series of schemes being announced targeting women and unemployed youth, with each state going to poll seeking to outdo the other. ""High debt-GDP ratio, outstanding guarantees and the increasing subsidy burden require states to persevere with fiscal consolidation while laying greater emphasis on developmental and capital spending,"" the report on state finances based on the budget announcements for the current fiscal year said.Since 2018-19, subsidies given by the states have grown 2.5 times to over Rs 4.7 lakh crore, the budgeted level for the current fiscal year.While lauding the overall effort towards fiscal consolidation, it pointed to the high revenue expenditure to capital outlay (RECO) ratio in several states. A large part of the revenue expenditure is seen to be going towards non-asset creating spending and is difficult to reduce given that it includes interest payments, salary and pension bills and the politically sensitive issue of subsidies. Punjab has the highest RECO of 17.1 this fiscal - which is more than three times the national average - followed by Puducherry (14.1), Kerala (10.6) and Delhi (10.3), RBI concluded.Post-Covid the Centre has been seeking to focus on increasing capital outlays to ensure job creation and generation of demand for inputs and reducing the proportion of revenue expenditure. Between 2021-22 and 2024-25, RECO is estimated to have declined from 6.3 to 5.2 with Manipur having the best ration (2.4), followed by Gujarat (2.9) and Sikkim & Arunachal Pradesh (3.1), a report on state budgets released by RBI said. For all the states, since 2020-21, expenditure has increased 68% to Rs 57.6 lakh crore (budgeted for this year), while capital outlay has more than doubled from Rs 4.1 lakh crore to Rs 9.2 lakh crore.The report said that for the states, a large chunk of the capital outlays have gone towards transport, irrigation and water supply.While capital expenditure was estimated at 2.5% of GDP during the last fiscal year, the Centre's long-term loan for capex too has played a part as it accounted for 14.4% of the states' capital outlays. In some cases, such as Andhra Pradesh, these loans accounted for over half the outlays in FY23 and FY24, while in Bihar it was around a quarter of the outlays of the state. While states have been sticking to fiscal responsibility legislations, RBI said the need is to focus on capital expenditure.","RBI's red flag comes amid a series of schemes being announced targeting women and unemployed youth.

If the construction is made in contravention of the Acts/Rules, it would be construed as illegal and unauthorised construction, which has to be necessarily demolished.""Authoring the 36-page judgment, Justice Mahadevan said no unauthorised or illegal structure can be legitimised under the ruse of passage of time, long inaction of authorities, or that a substantial amount of money has been spent on the construction.Justice Mahadevan said, "" Unauthorised constructions , apart from posing a threat to the life of the occupants and the citizens living nearby, also have an effect on resources like electricity, ground water and access to roads, which are primarily designed to be made available in orderly development.""Referring to instances where unauthorised constructions are registered due to collusion of registration authorities with land mafia, the bench said the power to remove unauthorised constructions is independent of the Registration Act and said, ""In any way, registration of a property would not amount to regularising the unauthorised construction.""Tackling the issue of prolonged litigations involving unauthorised constructions, the SC said, ""In the event of any violation being brought to the notice of the courts, it must be curtailed with iron hands and any lenience afforded to them would amount to showing misplaced sympathy.""The court also asked state govts not to mindlessly regularise illegal colonies, except only in exceptional circumstances. ""State govts often seek to enrich themselves through the process of regularisation by condoning/ratifying the violations and illegalities. The State is unmindful that this gain is insignificant compared to the long-term damage it causes to the orderly urban development and irreversible adverse impact on the environment,"" the bench said.It said, ""Hence, regularisation schemes must be brought out only in exceptional circumstances and as a one time measure for residential houses after a detailed survey and considering the nature of land, fertility, usage, impact on the environment, availability and distribution of resources, proximity to water bodies/rivers and larger public interest.""It issued a slew of directions to authorities not to allow builders to allot flats without obtaining completion/occupancy certificate concerning all aspects of building bylaws.

While Justice Gogoi, who retired as CJI in Nov 2019, was of the view coconut oil in small packaging was appropriately classified as edible oil, Justice Banumathi opined that coconut oil packed in small containers are to be classified as hair oil.A bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna, and Justices Sanjay Kumar and R Mahadevan, aware of the dual use of coconut oil in different parts of the country, said the classification would depend on the branding of the oil as edible to meet the criteria under food safety regulations, and conform to a different criterion under Drugs and Cosmetics Act to be classified as hair oil.Writing the judgment, Justice Kumar rejected argument of revenue dept that pure coconut oil should invariably be classified as hair oil and said, ""We are of the opinion that pure coconut oil sold in small quantities as 'edible oil' would be classifiable as edible oil"". Revenue dept had said the bunch of appeals involved Rs 160 crore in terms of excise duty, penalties, redemption fine and interest.SC said, ""The fact that such edible coconut oil was sold in smaller containers would not, by itself, be indicative of it being packaging of a kind fit for use as 'hair oil'.""""One may choose to buy one's cooking oil in small quantities, be it for economic or for health reasons or due to inclination to use fresh oil in food preparation, and the smaller size of the packaging of such oil cannot be taken to mean that it is to be used as 'hair oil' without any pointer to that effect, be it by way of a label or literature or by any other indication that it is to be used as 'hair oil',"" it said.""Small-sized containers are common to both 'edible oils' and 'hair oils'. Therefore, there must be something more to distinguish between them for classification of such oil, other than size of the packaging,"" the bench said.","A three-judge bench of Supreme Court on Wednesday solved a 20-year-old riddle that plagued levying of excise duty.

The joint call for the protest has also come from dalit leaders Nitin Raut, Rajendra Pal Gautam and Jignesh Mewani.Maharashtra has had a protest on Thursday, other states are catching on and there will be small gatherings from Friday. Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telengana, Haryana and Punjab have already responded, said Bharti. There will be gatherings at bloc headquarter and district headquarter level and then in towns and cities.The primary demand of the protestors is that the government (home minister) has to publicly apologise and also apologise on the floor of the House in Parliament, since the remarks have been made during a debate on the Constitution, to celebrate its 75year of adoption.The anchor theme for the Dalit groups is, “Dr Ambedkar is not a fashion he is the nation. Whoever insults the nation is a rashtradrohi (traitor), and traitors have no right to run the country,” said Bharti, soon after a meeting with Dalit groups. The theme is a counter to Shah saying, “Yeh fashion ho gaya hai, Ambedkar, Ambedkar... itna naam agar Bhagwan ka lete toh saat janmo tak swarg mil jata.” (It has become a fashion… Ambedkar, Ambedkar… if God’s name was taken so many times it would have taken you to the heavens), during his speech in the House.“Having NACDOR has also sought support of all sections of society for this mobilisation so that the sanctity of the Constitution and its makers is restored. OBC groups are also joining the protests,” Bharti said. The Dalit groups have also invited like minded political parties to support the protests.“When Chhatrapati Shivaji’s statue was damaged, Prime Minister himself had apologised for it, but the home minister who has publicly insulted Dr Ambedkar in Parliament, cannot apologise? Is his stature larger than that of the PM,” Bharti said. Afterall, “he was speaking from written notes in the House, so was this also part of his written text… to hurt sentiments of Ambedkar’s followers, he added.","Dalit organisations have called for nationwide protest on December 28, to register their anger over home minister Amit Shah’s remarks on B R Ambedkar in Parliament.

Russian President Vladimir Putin held his annual news conference and call-in show on Thursday. The event, broadcast live across Russia’s 11 time zones, is a yearly tradition.Putin uses the platform to address the nation and typically focuses on domestic issues.Putin began the tightly choreographed session by saying that Russia's economy is on track to grow by nearly 4 per cent this year. He acknowledged that consumer prices are high, with inflation at 9.3 per cent, but insisted that the economic situation remains ""stable."" He stated that many international financial institutions have rated Russia ""as number four economy when it comes to purchasing power parity"". He added that ""China, United States and India are ahead of us"", while Russia is ahead of Germany and Japan.The Russian president also hailed his troops' gains in Ukraine.We are not working against anyone. We are working for and favour of our interest and interest of the organisation's members. We are not trying to build any kind of adversarial narrative or agenda. India & External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said it best: ""BRICS isn't anti-Western. It's just not Western.""Well, first of all, I don't know when we will meet because he doesn't say anything about it. I haven't spoken to him at all for more than four years. And I am ready for this, of course, at any time. And I will be ready for a meeting if he wants it.(Addressing a reporter) - You said that this conversation will take place in a situation where I will be in some sort of weakened state. Dear colleague... you and those people who pay your salary in the United States would very much like Russia to be in a weakened position. I hold a different point of view. I believe that Russia has become much stronger over the past 2-3 years.I Have Warm Relations With PM Modi. The President said he has a ""lot of friends"" in Asia - amongst them India and China.We have always said that we are ready for negotiations and compromises, it's just that the other side, both literally and figuratively, refused to negotiate...Soon, those Ukrainians who want to fight will run out, in my opinion, soon there will be no one left who wants to fight. We are ready, but the other side needs to be ready for both negotiations and compromises.There is no chance of shooting down these missiles...Let Western experts propose to us, and let them propose to those in the West and the US who pay them for their analysis, to conduct some kind of technological experiment, say, a high-tech duel of the 21st century. Let them determine some target for destruction, say in Kyiv, concentrate all their air defence and missile defence forces there, and we will strike there with Oreshnik and see what happens. We are ready for such an experiment, but is the other side ready?I must say that the situation (at the front) is changing dramatically... There is movement along the entire front line. Every day...And we are moving, as you said, towards solving our primary tasks, which we outlined at the beginning of the special military operation...Everyone is fighting, literally heroically. And they are fighting right now. Let us wish them all, both those who are fighting in the Kursk region (of Russia) and those who are fighting along the entire front line, good luck, victory and to return home.In Russia, the situation is normal, stable, we are developing despite everything, despite external threats and attempts to influence us...Of course, inflation is ... an alarming signal...There are some issues here, namely inflation, a certain overheating of the economy, and the government and the central bank are already tasked with bringing the tempo down...There are subjective (reasons for rising prices), and there are shortcomings on our part. For example, some experts believe that the central bank could have started using certain tools that are not related to raising the key rate more effectively and earlier. Yes, the central bank started doing all this somewhere in the summer, but, I repeat, these experts believe that this could and should have been done earlier...This is an unpleasant and bad thing, in fact, the rise in prices. But I hope that in general, while maintaining macroeconomic indicators, we will cope with this too.The Russian leader said he hadn't yet met ousted leader Bashar al-Assad, who was given political asylum in Moscow, but plans to do so and will ask him about Austin Tice, an American journalist who went missing in Syria 12 years ago.","Russian President Vladimir Putin held his annual news conference and call-in show on Thursday.

Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce: A Look At Their Net Worth, Properties and Cars In 2024



Where Do Taylor And Travis Live?



Their Cars

Ever since Taylor Swift attended the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Chicago Bears at Arrowhead Stadium in September last year, Swifties haven’t stopped rooting for her relationship with tight-end Travis Kelce. Now that engagement rumours are swirling around the power couple, it’s worth exploring their combined net worth exceeding billion dollars and some of their prized assets.Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour has become a global phenomenon, with sold-out shows across the US, Europe, and Asia. Taylor Swift's Eras Tour grossed over $3.2 billion, making it the most lucrative concert in American music history; the concert film itself made more than $260 million. In October last year, she officially became a self-made billionaire and ended the year as one of the most powerful women in the world on Forbes‘ list. And in 2024 Taylor became the richest female musician in the world.In addition to the Eras Tour, Swift’s 11th studio album, ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ became the first album in Spotify’s history to reach 300 million streams in a day. According to a Forbes report which was released in October, the singer’s net worth is now pegged at $1.6 billion. Forbes estimates that Taylor has grossed at least $1.15 billion before taxes and fees, with pretax earnings of $400 million.Travis Kelce on the other hand isn’t doing so bad either. According to the website prestigeonline, Kelce's salary with the Chiefs currently sees him take home $17.125 million per year. Kelce has accumulated around $80 million in total salary since entering the NFL in 2013 and the three-time Super Bowl winner has signed a new two-year $34.2 million deal with the Chiefs, with an average yearly salary of $17 million.This means that the couple have a combined net worth of over $ 1.65 billion.Is it any wonder that Taylor Swift owns multiple homes across the US? From her Nashville apartment and her Hollywood Hills mansion to her Rhode Island vacation home, she owns some of the most gorgeous properties in America. She owns a penthouse condo in Nashville which was most likely the first home she bought for herself. The 3,240-square-foot condo has three bedrooms overlooking Nashville’s Music Row.In 2011, Taylor picked up Greek Revival-style estate Nashville for $2.5 million in the quiet Forest Hills suburb and she purchased a $1.78 million single-story midcentury-style Beverly Hills bungalow in 2012. Taylor’s famous fourth of July parties are hosted at her Rhode Island home on Watch Hill which overlooks Montauk point and cost her $17.75 million.Swift also bought two penthouses in New York’s Tribeca and combined them to create one large 8,309-square-foot condo with 10 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms which cost her $20 million. In 2017, Taylor spent another $18 million on a Tribeca townhouse right next door to her double penthouse and hired architect and designer Leopoldo Rosati to renovate the space.In comparison to Taylor, Travis is a minimalist when it comes to his real estate portfolio. His primary residence is a $6 million mansion in Leawood, Kansas which was recently in the news for being burglarized. It is a 17,000-square-foot French Regency–inspired property with six bedrooms, a wine cellar, a lighted tennis/pickleball court, a miniature golf course etc.In 2019, Travis bought a home with his brother, Jason Kelce (of Philadelphia Eagles), and their mother, Donna Kelce, in Orlando, Florida, which cost them $335,000. The two-bedroom, two-bathroom condo, located in Baldwin Park is also Donna’s primary residence.Taylor Swift's first-ever car was a pink Chevrolet Silverado which she still owns. In the last few years, Taylor has bought a Cadillac Escalade, a Mercedes Benz S class, a Mercedes G63, a Maybach S650, a Mercedes-Benz Viano and a Range Rover. She also reportedly owns a fleet of sports cars including a Porsche 911 and a Ferrari 458 Italia.Travis too owns an expensive collection of cars. He owns a 2014 GMC Terrain, a Mercedes-Benz AMG G63, and a 2016 Range Rover SV Autobiography. The GMC is his go-to vehicle for his errands around town and he uses the Range Rover for getting to practices and games. He also owns quite a few sports cars like the 2015 Hyundai Genesis, a 2014 Aston Martin Vanquish, a 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS Convertible and a prized $400,000 Rolls Royce Ghost.Also Read : Patrick Mahomes' $100K Christmas gesture for Chiefs teammates includes luxury Rolex watches, Louis Vuitton gifts, and other lavish surprises for the offense line","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are rumoured to be engaged.

Nikhil Kamath is a name that resonates strongly within the Indian business ecosystem. As the co-founder of Zerodha , one of India’s largest stockbroking firms, Kamath has carved out a significant space for himself in the competitive world of finance. At just 38 years old, Kamath has already achieved what many would consider the pinnacle of success, becoming one of the youngest billionaires in the country. However, his journey is anything but conventional. Kamath’s entrepreneurial spirit and business acumen were evident from an early age, even as he struggled to conform to the rigid structures of formal education. In a recent conversation with LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, Kamath shared fascinating insights into his early life, including his first entrepreneurial venture and how his unique path shaped his future endeavors.Nikhil Kamath’s entrepreneurial journey began much earlier than most people realize. While still in the 9th grade, Kamath embarked on his first business venture, driven by curiosity and a knack for identifying opportunities. He managed to acquire a cellphone, which he then sold for a profit. Encouraged by this initial success, Kamath reinvested the proceeds into purchasing more phones, effectively establishing a small-scale trading operation.This venture was going smoothly until his mother discovered his activities. Unhappy with her son’s sideline hustle, she intervened in a dramatic fashion—by flushing the phones down the toilet. While this marked the abrupt end of Kamath’s teenage entrepreneurial endeavor, it was a clear precursor to the innovative and determined mindset that would define his later career.During his conversation with Ryan Roslansky, Nikhil Kamath candidly admitted that he had a tumultuous relationship with formal education. ""I hated school. Always did,"" he stated, reflecting on his years as a student. Kamath’s disdain for traditional schooling was deeply rooted in his rebellious nature. “I was that one rebellious child who wanted to do the opposite of everything someone told him to do,” he said. By the time he was 15 or 16 years old, Kamath had stopped attending school altogether, setting the stage for an unconventional journey toward success.Despite his aversion to the classroom, Kamath’s early years were marked by a keen interest in exploring opportunities beyond the confines of academic learning. Dropping out of school came with its challenges, including feelings of insecurity. ""I was a fairly insecure young boy because my classmates of the time were in college,” he admitted. To compensate for this, Kamath developed a habit of voracious reading, consuming anything he could get his hands on to broaden his knowledge and skill set.Years after his early business experiment, Nikhil Kamath’s entrepreneurial streak found its ultimate expression in Zerodha. Co-founded with his brother Nithin Kamath, Zerodha was launched to address inefficiencies in India’s stockbroking industry. The company disrupted the market with its transparent pricing model and user-friendly online platform, quickly gaining traction among retail investors.Zerodha’s rise to prominence was fueled by the Kamath brothers’ focus on leveraging technology to simplify trading for everyday investors. Under Nikhil’s leadership, the company has not only grown into India’s largest stockbroker by active clients but has also set benchmarks for profitability and customer satisfaction in the industry.Although Nikhil Kamath’s decision to leave school eventually led to great success, he does not shy away from acknowledging the difficulties it entailed. “Dropping out of school and not pursuing formal higher education had its drawbacks,” he shared during his discussion with Roslansky. For Kamath, the absence of a structured educational framework meant that he had to work harder to gain credibility and knowledge.To bridge this gap, Kamath adopted a disciplined approach to self-education. His commitment to continuous learning played a crucial role in building the expertise and confidence necessary for navigating the complexities of the financial world. “Reading extensively allowed me to compensate for my lack of formal education,” he said.Nikhil Kamath’s journey offers valuable lessons for aspiring entrepreneurs. His story underscores the importance of resilience, adaptability, and the willingness to learn outside conventional systems. It highlights that success is not necessarily tied to formal education but rather to one’s ability to identify opportunities, take calculated risks, and persist in the face of challenges.Moreover, Kamath’s experience illustrates the significance of leveraging failures as stepping stones. From having his early business shut down by his mother to overcoming the insecurities associated with being a school dropout, Kamath’s path has been shaped by turning setbacks into growth opportunities.","Nikhil Kamath is the co-founder of Zerodha, one of India's largest stockbroking firms.

Due to untimely rains and changing weather conditions, their onions have suffered a large amount of damage.While it is necessary to get a good price based on cost for the remaining good onions, the market price is falling day by day. At present, red onions in the state are getting an average price of Rs 2400 per quintal. Since red onions are not sustainable, farmers and traders have to sell them immediately.Against this backdrop, it is necessary to export as much red onions produced in the state abroad as possible to get a good price for the onions of the farmers in the state. For this, the central government needs to remove the 20 percent export duty.The Deputy Chief Minister has clarified in a letter to the Union Commerce Minister that the prices of red onions should be maintained and onion farmers should get good prices based on the cost of production , and has demanded the abolition of the 20 percent export duty.","Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar has written a letter to Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal.

We are collecting all evidence as, in case the matter went to litigation, we will have to produce them before the court.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

5 WWE RAW Episodes with HORRIBLE Ratings

1) The First RAW Episode - January 11, 1993

2) Occupy RAW - March 3, 2014

3) WrestleMania Afterparty - April 3, 2023

WWE RAW is finally moving to Netflix on January 5, 2025 which marks a stark change in how the company promotes the show globally. RAW, also known as the Red Brand, has seen some really interesting segments and title changes, which can ideally put this show in the leagues with some of the most popular reality TV shows of all time.However, there are many episodes that have been so lackluster that they’re the absolute worst of the lot. Ideally, there’s not one particular reason for the episodes being bad. It’s just a mix of weird storylines to dull matches to bad promos. Keeping all these bits in mind, here’s a list of five worst WWE RAW episodes of all time.The following episodes are the absolute worst WWE RAW episodes that have been released so far:The very first episode of RAW was iconic by the standards of the early 90s. However, if you were to compare it to today’s standards, then the episode was pretty lackluster and dull. The matches were slow and borderline boring by today’s standards. Although still a milestone in the history of professional wrestling, this episode has laid the foundation for what RAW is today.This episode of RAW saw Daniel Bryan take over the entire arena in his fight against the Authority. Despite being one of the most iconic episodes, there’s nothing much that one can say about what happened here. In fact, if you were to take Bryan’s segment out of the episode, then there’s nothing else that happened, which was impactful enough, or could even match up to the standards of the said segment.The RAW after any Wrestlemania is one of the most significant showings in WWE, because it’s basically the fallout show of the event. While every year, the Stamford-based promotion has been able to keep up with the trends, the 2023 episode fell flat on its face. Not only did it not have any surprises, it was plain boring as well. This is probably the only post-Wrestlemania RAW that did so poorly in terms of telling compelling stories and showcasing decent matches.This episode was WWE’s peak of boring and bland content. During this year, the company was suffering from a lack of adequate creative direction, and what can be called as a directional slump. The storylines were bland and there wasn’t any spark of creativity in the matches either. This is probably one of the worst, if not, the worst RAW episode that the company has showcased in all this time.This episode was also during when the company was experiencing a creative slump. However, the company had advertised this as a major upgrade and was supposed to ditch whatever they were doing to produce a brand new show. However, their overdependence on the stale formula and the repetitive Baron Corbin storyline saw the plan for the show fall flat on its face.Also read: Reports: WWE Superstar Cody Rhodes is set to face wrestling legend John Cena at WrestleMania 41 in 2025 Apart from these five episodes there are others too which haven’t generated enough interest or hype amongst the audience. Considering that WWE is a Sports Entertainment company, such creative mishaps can happen. However, under the leadership of Paul Levesque , the company has moved forward a lot and such dull showings are a thing of the past, especially now that RAW is premiering on Netflix in the new year, to be specific, on January 6, 2025.","WWE RAW is finally moving to Netflix on January 5, 2025.
