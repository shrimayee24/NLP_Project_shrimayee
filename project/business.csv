Just 6 big states account for 55% of road fatalities in 2023,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/just-6-big-states-account-for-55-of-road-fatalities-in-2023/articleshow/114408275.cms,"AI Image/Lexica.art

NEW DELHI: Only six large states - Uttar Pradesh , Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra , Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan - accounted for nearly 55 per cent of the 1,73,000 road deaths in the country last year. Among them, Rajasthan saw the sharpest increase in fatalities, with an almost 6 per cent rise compared to 2022, according to data shared by state govts with Centre.The six states registered 95,246 road deaths in 2023 compared to 91,936 in the preceding year, data shows.Though the reports on road crashes and deaths are yet to be published by road transport ministry and National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the home ministry, the trend shows how the problem is getting bigger, despite India's global commitment to reduce these fatalities by half in the next six years.""Focussed efforts, proper investigation into accidents and designing interventions can bring down road deaths. That's what I had realised in my stint while dealing with Delhi's traffic issues. Most of the crashes and fatalities are preventable,"" said former IPS officer Satyendra Garg, who was joint commissioner (traffic) in Delhi.Experts said govt authorities need to come out of the mindset that big states would have higher share of fatalities as they have more roads and vehicles as well, to deal with this ""man-made crisis"". Naresh Raghavan, an road safety expert and author of driving manuals, said there is a greater need to focus on driver education along with enforcement of laws. ""Remember, only five or six rules can be policed or enforced. For the remaining 45 basic road rules have to be taught to people/drivers,"" he added.Raising concerns over the rising number of road deaths, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday urged officials and engineers to investigate all fatal crashes to find reasons and take corrective measures.""We lost 1.73 lakh lives in road accidents last year and remember nearly 60% of people killed every year are in the age group of 18-34 years. The socio-economic cost of road accidents is around 3% of our GDP. Please take it seriously. Deal with road safety issues with sensitivity, investigate accidents, fix black spots and address issues. We have never lost so many people even in wars,"" he had said while addressing a conference on emerging trends and technologies in road and bridge construction.","Rajasthan saw the sharpest increase in fatalities, with an almost 6 per cent rise compared to 2022.

NEW DELHI: In December 2020, Enforcement Directorate arrested KA Rauf Sherif, the general secretary of the Campus Front of India (CFI). That was the beginning of a multi-agency probe against the Popular Front of India (PFI) to unearth its entire network and source of finance.A dossier prepared by ED after a four-year probe revealed PFI has hundreds of enlisted members and offices across Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Delhi, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, J&K, and Manipur.The outfit, which was proscribed under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in 2022 after a failed attempt on PM Modi's life in July that year, has at least 13,000 members in Singapore and five Gulf countries, from where funds are generated in cash from 'unknown donors' and sent to India through hawala , according to the ED dossier.Cash was then deposited in 29 bank accounts of trusts and affiliated entities. Agencies have arrested 26 of its top office bearers and seized properties and bank accounts in India and abroad over the last few years. A terrorist camp was also unearthed in Kerala. The dossier said the outfit was behind the Delhi riots, the unrest in Hathras, and an attempt on the life of PM Modi during his rally in Patna in July 2022. Prominent among those arrested since 2020 include Rauf Sherif, CFI national general secretary; Shafeeque Payeth, a PFI member based in Qatar; Perwez Ahmed, president of Delhi PFI; and Sahul Hameed, dealing in hawala for PFI from Singapore. . ""Real objectives of PFI include carrying out an Islamic movement in India through jihad, though PFI masquerades itself as a social movement. Evidence reveals that the methods of protest employed by them are violent in nature,"" ED said.The agency said an arms training camp in Narath in Kerala's Kannur district was found, and there, PFI was training cadres in use of explosives and weapons under the garb of physical education classes.So far, the money trail has led to revelations of a collection of more than Rs 94 crore by PFI and its affiliates. ED has attached 35 properties worth Rs 57 crore dubbing them as 'proceeds of crime'. The outfit has been found active in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE from where most of its funds are generated.""PFI has formed well defined district executive committees for the non-resident Muslim diaspora living in Gulf countries. It has been collecting money in India and abroad, and using it for terror activities in the country,"" the agency said.","The Popular Front of India (PFI) has at least 13,000 members in Singapore and five Gulf countries.

IMA chief calls for legalising prenatal gender detection tests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ima-chief-calls-for-legalising-prenatal-gender-detection-tests/articleshow/114408224.cms,"Representative image

PANAJI: Indian Medical Association (IMA) president Dr RV Asokan called for the legalisation of prenatal gender determination tests, arguing Sunday that the current ban has not substantially impacted India's skewed sex ratio in three decades.Prenatal gender determination and sex-selective abortions have been illegal in India under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act since 1994, aimed at curbing female foeticide and improving the sex ratio.However, Asokan questioned the effectiveness of the law. ""After 30 years, what has this law produced? Has it reversed the sex ratio? Not a significant impact. In some places, there may have been (an impact),"" he said in Goa, where he attended the golden jubilee celebrations of IMA's Ponda branch.India's sex ratio has shown gradual improvement over the years, rising from 927 females per 1,000 males in 1991 to 943 females per 1,000 males in 2011, according to census data. However, Asokan emphasised that the issue remains persistent and suggested that legalising gender detection could help protect unborn girls by ensuring they are carried to full term.""IMA's central working committee is advocating for sex detection and child protection,"" Asokan said. ""We are demanding sex detection and protection of (the unborn) child...tag the child...carry that child to delivery. If anything untoward occurs, then hold people accountable. It's possible as technology is available.""The IMA president also argued that the current ban has led to the unnecessary targeting of ultrasound machines and medical professionals.",Prenatal gender determination and sex-selective abortions have been illegal in India since 1994.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI/KOLKATA: Indian carriers continued to grapple with a wave of bomb hoax threats for the sixth straight day, disrupting flight schedules and causing inconvenience during the busy festive travel season. More than 20 flights received threats Sunday — albeit lower than the single day’s highest of at least 40 flights Saturday.The pattern of threats that began Monday has so far affected nearly 90 flights.Most of the affected flights originated from major hubs such as Mumbai and New Delhi, leading to extensive security checks , delays, and operational challenges.Smaller airports like the one in Karnataka’s Belagavi were also targeted. It received a threat via email, but was declared a hoax after a detailed search of the premises. In Kolkata, the airport operations control centre received a bomb threat for an Alliance Air flight while it was mid-air. Flight 9I 0752, which departed from Lakhimpur in Assam, was just 12 minutes away from Kolkata with 73 passengers on board when the threat was received.Bureau of Civil Aviation Security has urged operators to strictly follow standard operating procedures. Initial investigations suggest many of the messages were sent through virtual private networks or dark web browsers.According to an official, the scale and frequency of the threats differ from earlier hoax calls, which were often made by passengers looking to delay their flights. “Given the number of threats, this could be part of a larger conspiracy to flood the industry with such messages so that one becomes lax. But we take every threat seriously,” the official said.(Inputs from Bengaluru)",The pattern of threats that began Monday has so far affected nearly 90 flights.

NEW DELHI: Actor Tamannaah Bhatia was questioned by the ED in Guwahati on Thursday in connection with a money laundering case probe linked to the ' HPZ Token ' mobile app in which several investors were allegedly duped on the pretext of mining Bitcoins and some other cryptocurrencies.The Enforcement Directorate said the statement of the 34-year-old actor was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) at its zonal office in Guwahati.Sources said Bhatia received some funds for making a ""celebrity appearance"" at an event of the app company and there were no ""incriminating"" charges against her.She was called earlier too but she deferred the summons due to work and chose to appear on Thursday, they said.A total of 299 entities, including 76 Chinese-controlled entities in which 10 directors are of Chinese origin while two entities are controlled by other foreign nationals, have been named as accused in the charge sheet filed by the ED in this case in March.The money laundering case stems from an FIR of the cyber crimes unit of Kohima Police that booked various accused under sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Information Technology Act for allegedly duping ""gullible"" investors by promising astronomical returns by mining Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.Police said the 'HPZ Token' mobile phone application was used by the accused to ""cheat"" the investors.The agency said bank accounts and merchant IDs were opened by various ""shell entities"" having ""dummy"" directors for the purpose of ""layering"" the proceeds of crime.These funds were ""fraudulently"" received for illegal online gaming and betting and investment for Bitcoin mining , it claimed.For an investment of Rs 57,000, returns of Rs 4,000 per day for three months were promised but money was paid only once and thereafter fresh funds were sought by the accused from the investors, the ED said.Country-wide searches were undertaken by the ED in this case leading to the seizure of immovable assets and deposits worth Rs 455 crore, it said.",Tamannaah Bhatia was questioned by the ED in Guwahati on Thursday in connection with a money laundering case probe linked to the'HPZ Token'mobile app. The Enforcement Directorate said the statement of the actor was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114332903,imgsize-39750,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/114332903.jpg"

Kashmir: Biggest Attack Of 2024 Along Ladakh Highway; 7 Killed, 5 Injured Near Sonamarg

SRINAGAR: Suspected Pakistani terrorists shot dead six workers and a doctor in the biggest targeted attack on construction employees in more than three decades of violence in J&K — firing automatic weapons around 8.15 pm Sunday at a camp of a private company building a tunnel in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district .The fatalities included Dr Shahnawaz from Budgam in central Kashmir; Gurmeet Singh (30) from Punjab’s Gurdaspur, Inder Yadav (35) from Bihar; Mohan Lal (30) and Jagtar Singh (30) from Kathua in Jammu; Fayaz Ahmad Lone (26) and Zahoor Ahmad Lone from Kashmir.Several others were wounded in the fifth targeted attack in Kashmir this year and the second since the new coalition government led by CM Omar Abdullah assumed office in J&K on October 16.The attack was also the biggest in terms of fatalities in Kashmir this year, underscoring the disturbing trend of terrorists targeting civilians after the June 9 shooting at a pilgrim bus in Reasi district of Jammu region. Seven pilgrims, the driver, and the conductor died, while 41 others were wounded that day.Omar, who represents Ganderbal assembly constituency, posted on X: “Very sad news of a dastardly and cowardly attack on non-local labourers… The casualty figure from the Gagangir attack is not final as there are a number of injured labourers, both local & non-local.”Sources said the camp was near the construction site of Apco Infratech , a UP-based firm building the 6.5 km Z-Morh tunnel for all-weather connectivity between Gagangir and the tourist hub of Sonamarg. The highway connects Kashmir valley with Ladakh. The project is slated to be inaugurated in the first week of November.Union home minister Amit Shah condemned the killings and promised that those “involved in this heinous act will not be spared and will face the harshest response from our security forces”. “At this moment of immense grief, I extend my sincerest condolences to the families of the deceased. Praying for the speedy recovery of those injured,” he posted on X.Highways minister Nitin Gadkari also condemned the terrorist attack, saying the “innocent labourers” were engaged in a vital infrastructure project in Gagangir. “I offer my humble tribute to the martyred labourers and extend my deepest condolences to their families during this difficult time.”So far, seven migrant workers have been killed in Kashmir this year. On Friday, the body of a 30-year-old man from Bihar’s Banka district was found riddled with bullets in a maize field in south Kashmir’s Shopian district. On April 8, a tourist cab driver from Delhi was critically wounded in Shopian, while a 35-year-old labourer from Bihar was shot dead in Anantnag on April 17. Earlier in February, two men from Punjab were killed in Srinagar.Sources said the doctor and two workers died on the spot, while the others were rushed to a nearby hospital, where four more were pronounced dead. Five of the critically wounded were shifted to SKIMS hospital in Srinagar.The Union territory recorded a surge in terrorist violence this summer, with 22 security fatalities since May 4 — 18 in Jammu and four in Kashmir.

Baseless and politically motivated: MEA

Accused India based on intelligence: Trudeau

India rejects Trudeau's statements

NEW DELHI: India's outgoing High Commissioner to Canada , Sanjay Kumar Verma , who was recalled by New Delhi last week, has denied any involvement in the killing of pro-Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar , adding that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has destroyed bilateral political relations between the two nations.In an exclusive interview to CTV News, Verma explicitly condemned Nijjar's killing, stating: ""Any murder is wrong and bad.I do condemn it and that is what I have said in many interviews.""When questioned if he had anything to do with Nijjar's killing, the envoy said: ""Nothing at all. No evidence was presented [by Canada]. (This is) politically motivated.""In the interview with host Vassy Kapelos on CTV that aired on Sunday, Verma asserted that Trudeau's decision to balme India for Nijjar's killing was based on intelligence information rather than concrete evidence.""On the basis of intelligence, if you want to destroy a relationship, be my guest. And that's what he [Trudeau] did,"" Verma added.In response to a question from Kapelos regarding Canada's allegations that diplomats and Indian government officials are allegedly involved in coercing cooperation and information from South East Asians living in Canada, Verma asserted that the process is entirely transparent.""There is nothing covert. It's all overt ... we read the newspapers, we read their statements, since we understand Punjabi. So we read their social media posts, and try to infer from there,"" said Verma.The envoy also firmly denied any personal involvement in such activities, stating, ""I, as High Commissioner of India, have never done anything of that kind.""He further emphasised the importance of staying informed about the actions of pro-Khalistani groups in Canada, as it aligns with India's national interests.When Kapelos asked whether the Indian government has ever targeted specific individuals with the intent of causing their death, Verma responded: ""Never"".Verma's remarks come on the heels of accusations made by the RCMP and the Canadian federal government, alleging that Indian diplomats and consular officials stationed in Canada have been engaging in covert activities connected to serious criminal offenses in the country, including homicides and extortions.When questioned by Kapelos about whether India's explanation leaves ""Canadians with the impression that (the Indian) government does have something to hide,"" Verma insisted ""absolutely not"".""In fact, we have been asking for (evidence) for the last one year, which the RCMP has also said ... And then if you do not share with us the reason for your visit, how do we know?"" said Verma.The diplomatic row between India and Canada erupted when Trudeau accused India of orchestrating Nijjar's killing in British Columbia in June last year.India labelled the claims as ""absurd"" and part of a broader political move by Trudeau to appeal to the pro-Khalistani vote.Canada is home to the world's largest Sikh population outside of Punjab and demonstrations advocating for the creation of a separate Sikh homeland within India have caused tension between the two nations.Tensions escalated when Canada identified India's High Commissioner and other diplomats as ""persons of interest"" in the Nijjar investigation.In response, India expelled six Canadian diplomats after summoning Charge d'Affaires Stewart Wheeler.The Indian government condemned Canada's ""baseless targeting"" as unacceptable and expressed concerns about the safety of its diplomats amid rising extremism.India also announced the withdrawal of High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, asserting its right to take further action against what it perceives as Canadian support for extremism.Earlier, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) labeled the allegations as baseless and politically motivated, suggesting they stem from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's domestic agenda. The MEA noted that Trudeau's ""hostility towards India"" has been evident for some time.""The government of India strongly rejects these preposterous imputations and ascribes them to the political agenda of the Trudeau government that is centred around vote bank politics,"" the MEA said in a statement.""Prime Minister Trudeau’s hostility to India has long been in evidence. In 2018, his visit to India, which was aimed at currying favour with a vote bank, rebounded to his discomfort. His Cabinet has included individuals who have openly associated with an extremist and separatist agenda regarding India. His naked interference in Indian internal politics in December 2020 showed how far he was willing to go in this regard. That his Government was dependent on a political party, whose leader openly espouses a separatist ideology vis-à-vis India, only aggravated matters,"" it added.The MEA referred to past events as a reminder of the strained ties between the two nations, worsened by what India sees as Trudeau's repeated interference in its internal affairs.Trudeau, testifying before a foreign interference inquiry, has acknowledged that his government initially accused India based on intelligence, rather than concrete evidence, in connection with Nijjar's assassination last year.Trudeau said intelligence from Canada and its allies suggested Indian agents were involved, but admitted there was no hard proof at the time.""We told India it is not hard evidence but just intelligence at that point,"" he said, adding: ""Behind the scenes (were trying) India to co-operate with us. Their ask was ... give us the evidence you have on us. Our response was it is within your security agency. You should be looking into how much they know, you should be engaging. 'No, no but show us the evidence'. At that point, it was primarily intelligence, not hard evidentiary proof. So we said let's work together.""India rejected Trudeau's statements, with MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal saying, ""What we have heard only confirms what we have been saying consistently all along — Canada has presented us no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations it has levelled against India and Indian diplomats."" Jaiswal went on to say that the damage caused to India-Canada relations is entirely Trudeau's responsibility.""The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone,"" he said in his statement.","India's outgoing High Commissioner to Canada Sanjay Kumar Verma has denied any involvement in the killing of pro-Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

Trudeau himself admitted there’s no evidence: Ex-envoy

NEW DELHI: Describing the charges against him as ""politically motivated"", outgoing Indian high commissioner to Canada Sanjay Verma accused Canadian PM Justin Trudeau of destroying the India-Canada political relations.He said Canada was acting on the basis of intel, not evidence, adding Ottawa was only encouraging Khalistan extremists , who were working for Canadian intelligence authorities.Canada last week claimed to have expelled Verma for alleged role in criminal activities.While Canada last week claimed to have expelled Sanjay Verma and five other Indian diplomats for alleged role in criminal activities, India had said it had recalled Verma and others. In a retaliatory action, India had expelled six Canadian diplomats too. “He (Justin Trudeau) himself admitted there was no evidence. On the basis of intelligence, if you want to destroy a relationship, be my guest. And that’s what he did,” Verma told Canada’s CTV in an interview Sunday, before his departure to India. Asked about extra-judicial killings, Verma said India has never done it but some G7 countries have and there shouldn’t be “double standards” about it. On whether he had had anything to do with Nijjar’s murder, Verma said, “Nothing at all. No evidence was presented. It’s politically motivated.”Verma said Canada didn’t follow the usual practice of sharing evidence first. “Evidence should have been shared first, but someone (Trudeau) decided to stand in Parliament and talk about a thing for which he himself has said there was no hard evidence,” he said, adding Canada hadn’t done anything to address India’s requests for extradition of 26 individuals involved in terror activities.“The day he did that, since then, he has made sure that bilateral relations with India only go downwards, spiralling down,” he added. According to Verma, the evidence that Canada claims to have is based on hearsay. “I know, for sure, that they go from one person to the other, asking them about the hearsay. Most of them are those who are pro-Khalistan elements, anti-India elements,” he said.Canadian authorities wanted to interrogate Verma and had asked India to consider waiving his diplomatic immunity . “If I am going to be interrogated, I need to see the evidence and know what am I being interrogated for,” said Verma. Asked why Canadian law authorities were not allowed to meet their counterparts and show the evidence they had, he clarified they didn’t follow the “proper procedure” and were late in applying for visas. “They wanted to leave for India on the eighth of October, they gave their completed application form only on the same day,” he said, adding the officials also didn’t mention the agenda for their visit.When asked if Indian govt has ever been involved in the targeting of certain individuals, with an end goal of their death, Verma said. “Never.” He accused the Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly of speaking “politically” and said she had “nothing in her hand”. Verma, according to CTV, also explicitly said he condemns Nijjar’s murder. “Any murder is wrong and bad. I do condemn. Let’s get to the bottom of the issue,” he said, strongly denying allegations that he and other Indian diplomats were collecting information that was used to target Canadian nationals.“I, as High Commissioner of India, have never done anything of that kind. That is one,” Verma said. “Second, my colleagues, do we want to know what pro-Khalistani elements in Canada are doing? Yes, we do. That’s my national interest.” On extra-judicial murders, Verma said India will never do it as the largest democracy, but accused some G7 nations of doing it, without naming them.","Outgoing Indian high commissioner to Canada Sanjay Verma accused Canadian PM Justin Trudeau of destroying India-Canada political relations. He said Canada was acting on the basis of intel, not evidence, adding Ottawa was only encouraging Khalistan extremists. Canada last week claimed to have expelled Verma for alleged role in criminal activities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114404903,imgsize-47936,width-400,resizemode-4/114404903.jpg"
Supreme Court refuses to extend child marriage ban to all faiths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-refuses-to-extend-child-marriage-ban-to-all-faiths/articleshow/114363674.cms,"SC refuses to rule on PCMA as sought by Centre



NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday spurned the Union govt’s invitation to direct application of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) to citizens irrespective of their religion and personal laws but suggested that Parliament should consider outlawing child betrothals as well.Delivering a 141-page judgment on a PIL highlighting the persistence of child marriages on an alarming scale despite enactment of PCMA 18 years ago, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said, “The issue of the interface of personal laws with the prohibition of child marriage under PCMA has been subject of some confusion.”Union govt, through ASG Aishwarya Bhati, had in a written note on behalf of WCD ministry submitted that there were conflicting opinions of HCs on precedence of PCMA over personal laws.“SC may consider issuing directions pronouncing that PCMA will prevail over the personal law governing marriage,” it requested.Authoring the judgment, CJI Chandrachud said Centre has not provided details of conflicting judgments from HCs and that PCMA was silent on the validity of child marriages. “Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was introduced on Dec 21, 2021. The bill was referred for examination to department-related standing committee. The bill sought to amend PCMA to expressly state the overriding effect of the statute over various personal laws. The issue, therefore, is pending consideration before Parliament,” SC said, refraining from ruling as requested by Centre.However, it laid down elaborate guidelines to strengthen measures to prevent child marriages. The CJI-led bench widened the scope of issue before its consideration to bring in betrothal of minors, and said PCMA was silent on this issue. “Marriages fixed in the minority of a child have the effect of violating their rights to free choice, autonomy, agency and childhood. It takes away from them their choice of partner and life paths before they mature and form the ability to assert their agency. International law such as CEDAW stipulates against betrothals of minors,” it said.“Parliament may consider outlawing child betrothals, which may be used to evade penalty under PCMA. While a betrothed child may be protected as a child in need of care and protection under the JJ Act, the practice also requires targeted remedies for its elimination,” the apex court bench added.Appreciating efforts of advocate Mugdha, appearing for the NGO ‘Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action’, in bringing to the court’s notice loopholes in implementation of PCMA, the bench said a studied approachby all stakeholders was needed for prevention of child marriages and protection of minors while penalising approach for violation of PCMA should be last resort.",Supreme Court spurned the Union govt’s invitation to direct application of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA) It suggested that Parliament should consider outlawing child betrothals as well.

RANCHI: While the NDA camp has avoided a major inter-party bickering over its seat-sharing formula for the Jharkhand assembly polls , infighting in the INDIA bloc seems to be out in the open. RJD , a junior constituent of the bloc, threatened to go solo but stopped short of breaking up the opposition alliance. Left parties have also upped their ante for a ""respectable"" share of seats.The infighting broke out at a time when nomination of candidates for the first phase of polling scheduled on November 13 has already begun.Even as RJD and Left parties continued to demand ""respectable"" share despite winning only one seat out of the seven it fought in 2019, both JMM and Congress downplayed the development and said they plan to go ahead with their decision to share 70 among themselves and leave 10 seats for RJD and Left.Insiders claimed that Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren has again reached out to RJD supremo Lalu Yadav and executive president Tejashwi Yadav on the issue.RJD, however, set Monday noon as deadline for JMM and Congress to increase and specify seat numbers. RJD said, after the deadline is over, it would announce candidates for 19 seats, considered their stronghold. It, however, would continue to support the bloc's candidates on the remaining 62 seats, RJD's Rajya Sabha MP and national spokesperson Manoj Jha said.""After we expressed displeasure over the seat-sharing announcement, we had a meeting at the CM's residence on Saturday evening, during which we were offered three to four seats. This is unreasonable and unacceptable to our leaders and workers. We are ready to consider about 12 seats,"" he added.Meanwhile, supporters of former minister and senior RJD leader Girinath Singh claimed that he would file his nomination from Garhwa on October 24. JMM's Mithilesh Thakur, who is also a minister in the incumbent Hemant government, represents Garhwa.CPI said they would wait until October 22 for talks with the INDIA bloc, failing which they will name their candidates on 15 out of the 81 assembly seats.Terming the seat-sharing deal announced on Saturday as unilateral, CPI-ML also said they are now in a wait-and-watch mode.Though JMM and Congress were yet to release their list of candidates, sources said JMM would contest 43 to 45 seats while Congress would contest on around 27 seats, according to their initial talks.JMM spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharjee said, ""Agreements and disagreements do happen within a family. We will sort it out.""","Infighting in the INDIA bloc seems to be out in the open. RJD threatened to go solo but stopped short of breaking up the opposition alliance.

MUMBAI: The Mahayuti government has added minority pilgrimage centres to CM Tirth Darshan Yojana ahead of the polls. All popular dargahs in and around Mumbai have been added to the list, such as Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai, Haji Malang Dargah in Kalyan, and Diwanshah Dargah in Bhiwandi.Apart from Muslim sites, holy places of Parsis, Buddhists, and Jain community are also included in the list.Under the scheme, state government provides Rs 30,000 per person for darshan of one pilgrimage site for senior citizens aged 60 and above, provided the annual family income does not exceed Rs 2.5 lakh.The decision is being viewed as Mahayuti government's significant minority outreach programme to win them over during the elections. According to government Resolution (GR) issued on Oct 15, government has added 95 holy places from Maharashtra and 15 outside Maharashtra to the scheme.Rais Shaikh , SP legislator from Bhiwandi (E), welcomed the move, but said that it is an election gimmick by the Mahayuti government to win over minorities for their political gains. ""When the scheme was launched in July, I immediately questioned the government as to why not a single holy place for Muslims in Maharashtra was included in this scheme. I wrote a letter to CM Shinde demanding the inclusion of three popular holy places of the Muslim community in the scheme,"" Shaikh said.Shaikh stated that the last-minute additions of the holy places of minority communities expose the government's motive. ""Maharashtra is the land of saints. Sufi saints have many dargahs in the state, which are also visited by Hindus. Notable dargahs like Haji Malang and Haji Ali are in the state. Despite such a rich history, the government didn't include them in the first list, which shows their true nature,"" Shaikh said.In July, Mahayuti government had launched the scheme with 66 holy places of various religions, excluding Muslim community sites, from Maharashtra, along with 73 religious places outside Maharashtra.","The decision is being viewed as Mahayuti government's significant minority outreach programme to win them over during the elections.

PRANPURA: An Indian ex-official charged by the US with directing a murder-for-hire plot has dismissed the allegations, his family said, expressing shock that Vikash Yadav was wanted by the FBI . Yadav, 39, described the claims as false media reports when he spoke to his cousin, Avinash Yadav, the relative said on Saturday in their ancestral village about 100 km from New Delhi.The US Department of Justice charged Yadav with leading an unsuccessful plot to murder Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun last year.Yadav was an official of Research and Analysis Wing ( RAW ), according to the indictment unsealed on Thursday.India, which has said it was investigating the allegations, said Yadav was no longer a government employee, without saying whether he had been an intelligence officer.""The family has no information"" about him working for the spy agency, Yadav's cousin said in the village of Pranpura in Haryana. ""He never mentioned anything about it,"" despite the two speaking to each other regularly. ""For us he is still working for the CRPF "", which he joined in 2009, said Avinash Yadav, 28. ""He told us he is deputy commandant"" and was trained as a paratrooper. The cousin said he did not know where Yadav was but that he lives with his wife and a daughter who was born last year.Indian officials have not commented on Yadav's whereabouts. The Washington Post, citing American officials, reported on Thursday that Yadav was still in India and that the US was expected to seek his extradition . His mother, Sudesh Yadav, 65, said she was still in shock. ""I do not know whether the US government is telling the truth or not."" ""He has been working for the country,"" she said.The US accuses Yadav of directing another Indian citizen, Nikhil Gupta, who it alleges paid a hitman $15,000, to kill Pannun.But in Pranpura, Yadav's cousin pointed to the family's modest, single-storey house, saying, ""Where will so much money come from? Can you see any Audis and Mercedes lined up?"" Most of the village's nearly 500 families have traditionally sent young men to join the security forces, locals said.Yadav's father, who died in 2007, was an officer with India's border force till he died in 2007, and his brother works with the police in Haryana, said Avinash Yadav.Another cousin, Amit Yadav, 41, said Vikash Yadav had been a quiet boy interested in books and athletics and was a national-level marksman.

North American Sikh organisation calls for dialogue between India and Canada amidst rising tension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/north-american-sikh-organisation-calls-for-dialogue-between-india-and-canada-amidst-rising-tension/articleshow/114366526.cms,"Satnam Singh Chahal

The escalating diplomatic tension between India and Canada will have a serious fallout for the Sikh community , not just in Canada, but in the US and in other countries around the world too, feels Satnam Singh Chahal , founder executive director, North American Punjabi Association ( NAPA ).“Constructive dialogue between India and Canada is the pressing need to safeguard the rights and well-being of the Sikh community across both nations and globally,” Chahal, who lives in northern California, told the Times of India, speaking as a representative of NAPA, a global non-partisan and non-sectarian organisation, founded in 2011, dedicated to serving and empowering the Indian diaspora worldwide.Chahal feels that the strong differences between India and Canada, that started with the murder of Khalistan activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, Canada; have highlighted the existing challenges faced by the Sikh diaspora community in western countries regarding issues of identity, safety, and political representation . “We are deeply concerned about the potential ramifications of strained diplomatic relations between India and Canada on the Sikh diaspora, which has long been a bridge between vibrant cultures,” Chahal, who was a nominated commissioner of Santa Clara county in California, said.Born and raised in Punjab, Chahal, who immigrated to the US with his family in 1997, feels that the growing animosity between India and Canada has been hitting the Sikh community hard in Canada as well as the US. “Globally, the Sikhs have been known for our philanthropic activities and service to the community wherever we are based. But now, the present acrimonious situation has created a deep rift even within some of our gurdwaras. The foundation of our religion is the concept of ‘sewa’ and we are a religious group that helps others always with service towards the larger community,” he said. But Chahal finds that the recent tensions, which have been highlighted by the falling out between the Indian and Canadian governments, have led to a changing perception about the Sikh community in North America.The killing of Nijjar, and the following stand-off between India and Canada, has exacerbated an existing divide within the Sikh diaspora, Chahal feels. “Some community members view the Canadian government’s stance as a legitimate defence of human rights, while others see it as an affront to India’s sovereignty. This polarisation can create rifts within families and social circles, leading to heated discussions and estrangement,” he said.He added that there was a lack of outreach to the Sikh community, in the US, on the part of the Indian government in the past several months. “All these factors have been hitting the American Sikh community hard with growing incidents of discrimination and racism being reported at schools, universities and workplaces by younger members of the community who wear turbans and have beards,” Chahal said.He added that in North America, many Sikh families are having to navigate complex relationships with non-Sikh neighbours and friends. “Misunderstandings about the community’s political affiliations can lead to stigmatisation or social isolation, especially if there are perceptions that they support militant factions. Within the diaspora, there can be significant pressure to take sides in the political narrative. Activists may push for solidarity with Nijjar’s cause, while others may urge caution to maintain good relations with India, particularly for those with family ties back home. Further, social media has amplified voices within the community, creating echo chambers where certain narratives dominate,” Chahal said.He feels that Sikhs in America and Canada are depending on the support of the US, Canadian and Indian governments to face such challenges and adds that many Sikhs in Canada, too, are feeling anxious about their safety and the possibility of backlash as tensions rise between India and Canada. “NAPA calls on both the Indian and Canadian governments to ensure the protection of all communities, particularly minorities. Our organisation also urges community members to engage actively in the political process, advocating for their rights and ensuring their voices are heard in discussions that impact their future,” Chahal added.","The escalating diplomatic tension between India and Canada will have a serious fallout for the Sikh community, says Satnam Singh Chahal, founder executive director, North American Punjabi Association. “We are deeply concerned about the potential ramifications of strained diplomatic relations,” he said.

India may send US Headley extradition reminder

NEW DELHI: The arrest of Vikash Yadav , a former RAW officer who has been accused by the US of masterminding a plot to kill pro-Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on American soil, may complicate efforts by the US to get him extradited.While a US move to secure the extradition of Yadav looks to be a logical corollary of the decision to put him on the “most wanted” list, Delhi Police ’s allegation about his complicity in offences of robbery and kidnapping, each punishable with 10 years, may prove to be a tough obstacle.Yadav, an assistant commandant with CRPF before he joined RAW on deputation, was held in Dec last year. He is out on regular bail and is sure to contest the charge that he took to serious crime after being discharged from service due to the US allegations.Going by the speed at which such cases move in Indian courts, it might be quite a while before the case is adjudicated.Yadav can be extradited only after the conclusion of the trial and not before he, if adjudged guilty, has served his sentence.There are also indications that India may send another reminder to the US about its pending request for the extradition of David Coleman Headley, aka Dawood Gilani, an operative of Lashkar-e-Toiba , who conducted recce for the gang that carried out the bloody 26/11 rampage in Mumbai, killing over 150 innocent civilians who, importantly, included US citizens. A US citizen of Pakistani origin who also worked as an informant for the US Drug Enforcement Agency, Dawood had travelled to India on a US passport to dodge the scrutiny that Pakistani nationals are subjected to.India’s request for the extradition of Tahawwur Rana , a Canadian travel agent of Pakistani origin who helped the Lashkar plot by arranging for tickets for Headley, is also pending. While the US court has cleared Rana’s extradition from a Los Angeles prison, his lawyers have deployed fresh tricks to frustrate India’s effort to face the law here.Rana had filed a habeas corpus petition to oppose his extradition, but it was rejected, and the extradition was approved last year. In its ruling, the panel also held that India had presented adequate and competent evidence to back the magistrate judge’s determination of probable cause that Rana was involved in the charged crimes. The jury found him guilty of providing material support to a foreign terrorist organisation and conspiring to support an abortive Lashkar plot in Denmark.Of the two, handing over Headley, currently in Chicago prison, may be more difficult for the US because of his deep links with DEA which appears to have led to overlooking of signs pointing to his links with LeT.Last year, Vikash Yadav and his alleged associates were booked on charges of robbery and kidnapping for ransom on the complaint of one Rajkumar Walia, the owner of Markaz Cafe and Lounge in Delhi. Both offences carry a punishment of 10 years.In his complaint, Walia had alleged Yadav and his aide Abdullah Khan had abducted him in an Ertiga car and taken him to a room in Defence Colony in south Delhi. Once there, Walia was informed that his Dubai-based rival named Jalaluddin alias Sameer had ordered a hit on him and that the matter could be settled if he paid money. They allegedly demanded Rs 20 lakh and took away Rs 50,000, besides a chain and a ring.","Vikash Yadav has been accused by the US of masterminding a plot to kill pro- Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on American soil.

More job cuts coming

Intel has begun implementing mass layoffs that it announced back in August, impacting more than 2,000 jobs across several US states. The company says these workforce reductions are part of its broader cost-cutting measures.According to multiple reports, the job cuts will affect approximately 1,300 employees in Oregon , 385 in Arizona, 319 in California, and 251 in Texas.The impact is particularly significant in Oregon, where Intel is the second-largest private employer with over 20,000 workers. The affected employees in Oregon are based at facilities in Aloha and Hillsboro.The job cuts are set to begin on November 15, with employees receiving either a 60-day notice or a four-week notice with additional pay and benefits.These layoffs are part of Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger 's plan, announced in August, to eliminate over 15,000 jobs globally and reduce costs by more than $10 billion. The company aims to streamline operations in response to worsening financial conditions and increased competition in the semiconductor industry. So, more job cuts across more regions are expected.An Intel spokesperson confirmed that these job cuts are necessary steps to create ""a leaner, simpler, and more agile company"" positioned for long-term sustainable growth.The layoffs come alongside other strategic changes, including delays in opening new facilities outside the United States and restructuring its contract chip manufacturing business.","More than 2,000 employees in Oregon, Arizona, California, and Texas will lose their jobs.

NEW DELHI: Countering the perception that tigers as a species can only evoke fear, tribal artists , who live in and around tiger reserves, are here in Delhi to tell a story of how the majestic beast, revered by many as ""Baghdev"" in their culture, is an inspiration for creativity that finds expression in art and gives a strong message for harmnious co-existence as the essence of sustainable development.To build on the message of conservation , 15 tribal artists, including 12 living within the ecosystem of tiger reserves, will be joining the prestigious 'Artists-In-Residence' programme at the Rashtrapati Bhawan , starting Monday, where they will create artworks to tell the story of co-existence. Their creations will be presented to President Droupadi Murmu on Oct 29.These artists have come from areas in and around the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand, the Kanha and Satpura in Madhya Pradesh, the Nawegaon Nagzira and Melghat in Maharashtra, the Indravati National Park in Chhattisgarh, Similipal in Odisha, the Kawal Tiger Reserve in Telangana, and Dampa in Mizoram.'Artists-in-Residence', launched in Dec 2013 by the then President Pranab Mukherjee, offers an opportunity for writers and artists to immerse themselves in the life of the Rashtrapati Bhavan . It also aims to foster an environment that inspires creative thinking and rejuvenates artistic expression.These 15 artists have been drawn from among 49, including tribals and other forest dwellers, whose artworks were showcased at an exhibition at the India Habitat Centre from Oct 17- 20. They brought forth stories of what the tiger symbolizes in tribal folklore, traditions, and culture. The exhibition ""Silent Conversation: From Margins to the Centre"" was organised by theNational Tiger Conservation Authority and non-profit Sankala Foundation that works on sustainable development. It was supported by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the International Big Cat Alliance.Stories of interface of humans and nature were spread over canvases of 200 paintings and 100 art pieces of artists who live in and around 22 tiger reserves spread across states like Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajashtan, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Telangana, Arunachal Pradesh, and Mizoram.A striking painting by Gujral Singh Baghel from the Indravati Tiger Reserve depicts the culture of the Abujhmadia tribal community. It celebrates the relationship between the tiger and local hero ""Tiger Boy Chendru"", known for his courage. In another soft portrayal, artist Arachand Soren from the Similipal Tiger Reserve shows a tigress named Khairi playing with humans. Artist Minakshi Khati from the Jim Corbett Tiger Reserve area pays tribute to the tiger of Kumaon in colourful Aipan motifs to bring out its features of strength.These artists will be part of the 'Artists-In-Residence' programme. According to Sankala Foundation by Sunday evening over 100 paintings in the exhibition were sold and many more reserved by buyers, including not just connaisseurs of art, but also embassies and govt offices that wish to showcase stories of conservation. ""Proceeds will be directly credited to accounts of artisans,"" the foundation said.NHRC secretary general Bharat Lal highlighted that tribal communities live in a symbiotic relationship between humans and nature, and promote the ""conservation ethos"". ""This relationship has been brought to cities through the works of art and is expected to introduce the youth to the concept of conservation,"" he added.According to govt data shared by Sankala Foundation, as per the 2011 Census, there are over 1,70,000 villages in India located close to forested areas, and as per the India State of Forest Report 2021, more than 300 million people are dependent on forests for their livelihood.","15 tribal artists, including 12 living within the ecosystem of tiger reserves, will be joining the prestigious 'Artists-In-Residence' programme.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Break the Rules? Deal's Off

WASHINGTON: Panda exchanges , like the one that sent two bears to Washington's National Zoo last week, are governed by closely held contracts. In most nations, they are never released. Lawyers for the Smithsonian , which operates the National Zoo, refused to release a 2020 contract. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, which regulates the import and export of exotic species, provided a San Diego Zoo contract with key passages blacked out.But NYT has found full copies of those documents and others in regulatory filings. The contracts govern two pandas at the National Zoo and two more that arrived in San Diego this summer. Comparing these contracts with past agreements revealed that American zoo administrators are ceding increasing authority to the China Wildlife Conservation Association , a government group.Here are a few of the terms.The arrival of pandas in Washington and San Diego were highly choreographed media events. But zoo administrators have agreed to limit what they tell journalists. Administrators cannot discuss panda illness, death, disease or ""any other important matters"" without first consulting with their Chinese partners, whose views ""shall be fully respected.""Zoos pay up to $1.1 million a year to rent pairs of pandas from China. To raise money, zoos court donations from everyday people and big-ticket philanthropists. China retains ownership of the pandas, and zoos pay for the right to display and breed them for a decade. But the China Wildlife Conservation Association prohibits zoos from discussing the deal in that way. ""Commercial terms such as 'lease,' 'rental,' 'loan agreement' or 'contract' shall not be used"", the contract dictates.Zoos have agreed to pay for Chinese experts to travel to the US regularly to give advice, including airfare, hotels, a daily stipend of $100 to $150 per person.Last year, a panda at the Memphis Zoo, Le Le, died after panda enthusiasts watched him deteriorate on the zoo's live video feed. The zoo's female, Ya Ya, came under scrutiny, too, with animal welfare groups saying that she was too thin and had mangy fur. Some even paid for a billboard in Times Square. Previously, zoos promoted round-the-clock panda feeds. Now, they have agreed to limit their live feeds. Melissa Songer, a Smithsonian conservation biologist, said the National Zoo pushed back. The zoo will offer footage on a delay, Songer said.The China Wildlife Conservation Association can terminate the contract and recall pandas to China for a variety of reasons. The ""unauthorized release of relevant information"" to the public is one example. NYT","The contracts govern two pandas at the National Zoo and two more that arrived in San Diego this summer.

All realised sales proceeds of tourist resorts and guesthouses, etc, are required to be deposited to the foreign currency account held at a licensed bank in Maldives, as per the rules.Also, every tourist resort, tourist vessel or tourist establishment operator (amongst others) have to exchange a minimum of USD 500 to MVR per tourist (through a licensed bank in Maldives), proceeds of which can be utilised by the tourist operator for their operations.",Maldivian economy appears to have taken a hit after calls to Indian tourists to avoid the picturesque island nation.

Elon Musk claims US regulators made Space X 'kidnap seals twice'; Here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-claims-us-govt-made-space-x-capture-seals-twice-heres-why/articleshow/114409440.cms,"Tech honcho Elon Musk has targeted US government and regulators while advocating for the growth of American businesses. On Sunday, in response to a user expressing concerns about SpaceX being compelled by the government to capture seals for a compliance experiment, Musk quipped, ""The regulators made us kidnap seals twice! So crazy.""Earlier in the morning, Musk said on X that he was ready to reveal to the public an alleged scheme where his company SpaceX was ""forced by the government to kidnap seals.""""Tomorrow, I will tell the story of how SpaceX was forced by the government to kidnap seals, put earphones on them and play sonic boom sounds to see if they seemed upset,"" Musk said in his post on X.Musk's remark was in response to a clip from Saturday in Pennsylvania, where he mentioned having a ""bunch of nutty stories"" about government overregulation. One such story involved SpaceX being required to assess the likelihood of its Starship rocket hitting a whale or shark . ""SpaceX had to do this study to see if Starship would hit a shark. And I'm like... it's a big ocean. There are a lot of sharks. It’s not impossible, but it’s very unlikely. So we said, 'Fine, we’ll do the analysis. Can you give us the shark data?'"" he said.Donald Trump, who has been endorsed by the billionaire, said he would make him the ""Secretary of Cost-Cutting"" for the federal government, if he is reelected.""We'll have a new position: Secretary of Cost-Cutting. Elon wants to do that, and we have incredible people. He's running a big business. He can't just say, 'I think I'll go into the Cabinet.' Other people can. He can't, but Elon's a little bit different in that sense,"" Trump said in a recent interview.Recently as part of his campaign trail for Trump, Musk in Pennsylvania said how Space X faced a $140,000 fine from the EPA for using drinking water to cool down a launch pad.""I’ll tell you like a crazy thing, like we got fined $140,000 by the EPA for dumping fresh water on the ground. Drinking water. It’s crazy. I’ll just give you an example of just how crazy it is. And we’re like, ‘Well, we’re using water to cool the launch pad during launch. You know, we’re going to cool the launch pad so it doesn’t overheat.

LAHORE: Describing foreign minister S Jaishankar ’s visit to Pakistan for the SCO meeting as a positive development that should provide an opening for more substantive engagements between the 2 countries, former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi saying the latter’s decision to visit Sharif’s home in 2015 was not an ordinary gesture. Sharif sought progress in ties saying the relationship should not be held captive by the past.Sharif, a 3-time PM and elder brother of Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif, also slammed former PM and rival Imran Khan for the foul language he used against Modi as PM.“Achhe bhare talukkat ko tabah aur barbad karne waali baat ki (he worked to destroy a healthy relationship). I would have never used that kind of language. We believe in certain values that must be respected,” said Sharif, adding he had fond memories of Modi’s only visit to Pakistan on December 25, 2015, Sharif’s birthday.As then Pakistan PM, Sharif had received Modi at his home in Lahore. “I got a call from him saying he was in Kabul and wanted to visit me on his way back to India. I told him he was most welcome. He also met my mother during the visit. What he did wasn’t a chota (small) gesture,” said Sharif, in a meeting with Indian journalists in Lahore who travelled to Pakistan to cover Jaishankar’s engagements. The former PM is also the leader of the ruling PMLN party. His daughter and Punjab CM Maryam Sharif was also present in the interaction.Khan’s personal attacks against Modi after India revoked the special status of J&K only led to further deterioration of relations between the 2 countries. Sharif did not comment on India’s recent actions in the union territory as he said this wasn’t the occasion to discuss it. PM Shehbaz too had avoided raking up the Kashmir issue even in a roundabout manner at the SCO meeting.Sharif also called upon both sides to look ahead and not be held back by the past even though he didn’t make any specific commitment on resumingtrade ties or reappointing high commissioner. He did say that if there’s an opening, cheezein niklengi (things will emerge).Asked about his 2015 peace initiative with Modi that was scuttled quickly by the Pathankot terror attack, Sharif said it’s important to ensure any such effort is not disrupted. “India is our hamsaya (neighbour) mulk and we can’t change that even if we want it. We would have liked Modi to come (for SCO) but it’s good Jaishankar came. We have tried and tried again (to normalise ties). We lost the past 75 years and it’s important we don’t lose another 75 years,” said Sharif, who is known to share a close personal rapport with Modi.“Both sides have their giley-shikwe (grievances). It will be better if we can bury the past,” he added. When asked if he would play the role of building bridges, he said he was doing it.Sharif also backed SAARC, trade and cricket ties with India, saying neither country gains anything by not allowing their teams to play each other. He also recalled how former Indian PM A B Vajpayee had approached him to buy electricity from Pakistan. “I would allow my team to play. If there’s a cricket tournament on India and Pakistan and India are playing in the final, I’ll travel to India to watch it. There should be progress. SAARC or any such opportunity should not be missed. It’s important to make full use of it,” he said.“I believe we are a potential market for each other. Why should Indian and Pakistani farmers and manufacturers go outside to sell their products. Goods now go from Amritsar to Lahore via Dubai. Who is benefitting from this? What should take 2 hours takes 2 weeks,” he added.",Former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif reached out to PM Narendra Modi. Sharif sought progress in ties saying the relationship should not be held captive by the past. He also slammed former PM and rival Imran Khan for the foul language he used against Modi as PM.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114332425,imgsize-945823,width-400,resizemode-4/114332425.jpg"
