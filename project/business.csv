Did basmati kill basmati?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/did-basmati-kill-basmati/articleshow/124189584.cms,"It has been described as the 'best rice in the world' by Taste Atlas, more evocatively as 'karza faad' (debt-breaker) by farmers, and even found a place in the tragic love story of Heer Ranjha written by famous Punjabi poet Waris Shah in the 18th century. Today, this aromatic variety is used to whip up everything from biryanis and kheers to foreign dishes like sushi. It has also sparked a cross-border row, with Pakistan looking to benefit from the 50% duty imposed by the Trump administration on Indian exports.Yet, a less-known fact about the much-feted basmati rice is that it is also a silent killer. The victim: traditional varieties of basmati and non-basmati rice that were once grown and consumed across India but have now nearly vanished from farms and dining tables.Agrarian scientist Debal Deb, who has been working on rice seed conservation for the last two decades, estimates that 60-80% of the rice bought off the shelf is not the variety claimed on the packet. ""The biggest challenge today is that farmers use cross-pollination and don't maintain genetic purity,"" says the Odisha-bases researcher.But before villainising the hybrids, it's important to understand the context in which they came about.India's desperate need for self-sufficiency in food grains led to agricultural research scientists creating sturdier grains of rice like the Pusa Basmati (PB) 1121 and PB 1509 over the years. These varieties could cope with the constant onslaught of pests and diseases such as bacterial blight and responded well to chemical fertilisers. This not only fed more mouths, it also meant that farmers, even those with small landholdings, gained from higher yield and fewer losses. Soon, large swathes of land in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh shifted to these hybrid varieties. This shift helped India become the largest producer of basmati rice, supplying 65% of global demand, with Pakistan accounting for most of the rest.However, this has come at a cost of traditional varieties. Across India, rice seed varieties have come down from 1,00,000 in the 1970s to less than 6,000 - a loss of 93%.Traditional strains such as Veliyan rice in Kerala, which is drought-resistant, or Jengoni in Assam, known for its medicinal qualities, are rarely cultivated.Umendra Dutt, founder of the Kheti Virasat Mission that works in conserving indigenous seeds and traditional methods of cultivation in Punjab and Haryana, says that the region had lost all its paddy varieties. ""When we started the mission in 2005, we had to get seeds from other parts of the country to bring traditional varieties back to our farms,"" he says. Over the past two decades, Punjab's Malwa region, where this initiative is based, has seen a surge of cancer cases that studies have linked to excessive and inappropriate use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers.""It was only after we found out how much damage had been done that we encouraged farmers to adopt organic methods and switch to traditional crops,"" Dutt says. The Mission conserves and distributes 10-12 varieties of rice.Deb, also called the Seed Warrior, says while not all the loss is directly due to basmati, the dominance of basmati in its traditional growing regions has accelerated the decline of other varieties. ""Farmers behave like businessmen who are seeking profits. They have no interest in conserving,"" he says.At Basudha, a 1.7-acre farm in Odisha's Rayagada district, Deb has been working towards conservation of 1,492 rice landraces (traditional strains) collected from farmers in India and abroad, including Sri Lanka, Thailand, Korea, Italy and the US. Beyond seed preservation, he has built awareness around genetic purity and the importance of crop diversity. The Vrihi Seed Exchange Network he started now connects over 8,000 farmers in 12 states who cultivate and exchange seeds among themselves. Vrihi also documents varieties rich in vitamin B complex, essential omega-3 fatty acids and those that can withstand drought, flood, salinity, or resist pests and diseases.In Assam's Jorhat, Mahan Chandra Borah, who has been working on saving seeds for the last two decades, criticises the profit-driven approach. ""This monoculture is destroying our living heritage. Conserving these seeds is necessary for sustainable food security in the future,"" he says. Borah recalls how his village, Meleng Kathgaon, would cultivate 10-12 varieties of rice when he was a child. ""The next village grew other varieties which were different from ours and we would exchange seeds. But now the landraces are down to a handful,"" he says. He conserves over 500 varieties through the Annapurna Seed Library.He highlights the benefits of conservation: farmers growing traditional varieties regain control over food production and reduce dependence on costly commercial seeds. Yet, he warns that the impact of individual farmers is limited. ""There is no govt initiative for conservation. All govt-run research institutes are focused on genetic engineering,"" he says.","India is the largest producer of basmati rice, supplying 65% of global demand. But this has come at a cost of traditional varieties. Across India, rice seed varieties have come down from 1,00,000 in the 1970s to less than 6,000.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124189594,imgsize-766999,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Russian FM Lavrov Hails Stronger India-Russia Ties, Putin’s Visit To India Confirmed By Year-End

At the recent 80th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov announced that plans are underway for President Putin to visit New Delhi in December.As per news agency ANI, he remarked, “In December, a visit from Mr Putin is being planned to New Delhi,” highlighting the significant bilateral agenda that includes trade, military cooperation, technological exchange, finance, humanitarian efforts, healthcare, and advancements in high-tech sectors such as artificial intelligence.Lavrov also expressed confidence in India’s ability to independently navigate its trade relations, stating, “India is perfectly capable of making their own decisions in its trade relations with Russia.”Reflecting on recent discussions with external affairs minister S Jaishankar, he added, “This year, my colleague, I spoke to him yesterday, will visit Russia, and I will visit India. We hold regular exchanges.”He also praised Jaishankar's diplomatic stance, which asserts India’s autonomy in deciding its energy partnerships.In regard to the US imposing sanctions on India for purchasing Russian oil, Lavrov firmly stated that the economic partnership between India and Russia is “not under threat,” reaffirming that India selects its own international partners.As per ANI, he noted, “If the US has proposals on how to enrich bilateral trade between the US and India, they are prepared to discuss the terms for that.”He also pointed out that India’s relationships with third states are matters to be decided independently, reflecting a broader sentiment of national pride.Moreover, Lavrov underscored the longstanding strategic partnership between India and Russia, which has been further upgraded to a “particularly privileged strategic partnership.”He stressed that the relationship extends beyond the influence of US-India dynamics and highlighted recent high-level meetings, including the recent gathering of Prime Minister Modi and President Putin at the SCO summit in China.Lavrov also reiterated Russia’s endorsement of India's bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ).According to ANI, he stated, “Russia supports the application of Brazil and India for permanent seats” on the Council, emphasising the need for reform to reflect the current global landscape. Lavrov’s remarks come as Mauritius and Bhutan have also voiced their support for India's UNSC aspirations, aligning with the growing demand for a more representative Council.He pointed out the differences that have emerged in the global balance since the UN's formation 80 years ago, advocating for adjustments that will make the UNSC more effective and inclusive. This sentiment is echoed in discussions around the need for collective representation from regions like Asia, Africa, and Latin America in international forums.These developments coincide with a broader call for UNSC reform, as outlined in joint statements from BRICS meetings that seek to create a Council that is “more democratic, representative, effective and efficient,” reflecting the voices of developing nations.","Russian FM Lavrov Hails Stronger India-Russia Ties, Putin’s Visit To India Confirmed By Year-End.

QRSAM offers 360° radar, jamming shield, mobile launchers

Poll Which aspect of the QRSAM systems do you find most impressive? Mobility and 360° radar coverage Integration with AI systems

NEW DELHI: India kicked off the acquisition process for three highly mobile regiments of indigenous quick reaction surface-to-air missile (QRSAM) systems that can detect and destroy aircraft, attack helicopters, drones, rockets and missiles at ranges of over 30km, at a cost of about Rs 30,000 crore.The Army this week issued the tender or RFP (request for proposal) for the three regiments of the air defence system named “Anant Shastra”, which has been developed by DRDO and will be co-produced by defence PSUs Bharat Electronics and Bharat Dynamics.The move comes after the intense cross-border hostilities with Pakistan from May 7 to 10 under Operation Sindoor. The Army Air Defence (AAD) has projected a requirement of 11 such QRSAM regiments in the long term, each with nine firing units, while the IAF at present is looking to induct three QRSAM squadrons, as was first reported by TOI.With missile launchers, 360-degree radars, automated command and control systems and all-weather tracking systems mounted on high-mobility 8x8 vehicles, the QRSAM systems are designed to provide air defence cover to tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns.""With their 'search, track and fire at short halt' capabilities, the QRSAM systems will be able to operate on the move with mechanised columns across plains, deserts and mountains both on the western (Pakistan) and northern (China) fronts.They will give protection not only against enemy aircraft but also new-age threats like swarm drones and loitering munitions,"" an officer said.The QRSAM systems, with a 30-km interception range to neutralise incoming threats at altitudes of 6 to 10km, are also designed to resist electronic jamming to ensure accuracy even under hostile conditions.""With pre-fragmented warheads, high-speed solid fuel propulsion and network integration with the Army's Akashteer command & control network, the Anant Shastra will be a tactical game-changer. It will replace old systems such as the Russian-origin OSA-AK to give the Army a faster, smarter and more mobile shield,"" another officer said.Once inducted, the QRSAM systems will add to the country's existing multi-layered air defence network of foreign and indigenous systems, which played a crucial role in thwarting multiple waves of Turkish-origin drones and Chinese missiles launched by Pakistan during the conflict.In addition to its existing Akash surface-to-air missiles, which have a 25-km interception range, the AAD is also inducting two new Akash Prime regiments designed for air defence in high-altitude areas above 4,500-metre along the frontier with China under a Rs 8,160 crore contract in March 2023.The AAD, which currently has 55 regiments of different weapon systems, is also going in for “smart and programmable ammunition” for its old L-70 anti-aircraft guns and ZU-23mm twin-barrel cannons, which incidentally performed well during Operation Sindoor.“Parallelly, quickly-deployable counter-UAS (unmanned aerial systems) guns, with a high rate of fire, as well as successors to L-70 and ZU-23 guns will be required. Counter-RAM (rocket, artillery and mortar) capability similar to the Phalanx close-in weapon systems of the US will also be needed,” a third officer said.The AAD will also have to go in for a major upgrade in its radars and sensors guiding the air defence guns. At present, they are geared to detect larger targets like aircraft instead of smaller ones like drones.","The Army this week issued the tender or RFP (request for proposal) for the three regiments of the air defence system named ‘Anant Shastra’ The move comes after the intense cross-border hostilities with Pakistan from May 7 to 10 under Operation Sindoor.

Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney said his country will soon announce some proposals to take in foreign workers for whom the American dream is now too costly because of the $100,000 H-1B visa fee. ""Not as many H1B visa holders will get visas in the US. These people are skilled, and this is an opportunity for Canada... We will soon bring a proposal on this,"" Carney said, adding that these people are enterprising and willing to move for work.In a major overhaul of the employment-based visa system, the Donald Trump administration has imposed a $100,000 fee on H-1B visas which will make it difficult for companies to hire foreign workers, as tech companies will now have to pay this fee if they want to hire foreign workers. The move is aimed at saving jobs for Americans, while it will hurt foreign workers from India and China.Several countries, including Germany and the UK, have seized the opportunity and reached out to Indian talent.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is said to have started exploring proposals to abolish visa fees for top global talent even before Trump's major H-1B move. Starmer has a global talent task force that has been developing ideas to draw the world's best scientists, academics and digital experts to Britain.One option being weighed is a zero-fee system for applicants who have studied at the world’s top five universities or won prestigious prizes.German Ambassador to India, Dr Philipp Ackermann, recently made an open call to highly skilled Indians to work in Germany. ""The average Indian working in Germany earns more than the average German. Because a high salary means Indians are contributing big time to our society and our welfare. We believe in hard work and giving the best jobs to the best people,"" he said.Indians are already Canada's top source of immigrants, as figures reveal that out of 32,000 tech workers who migrated to Canada from April 2022 to March 2023, around 15,000 were Indian. In 2024, about 87,000 Indians obtained Canadian citizenship, making them the largest group among new Canadian citizens.In 2022, about 118,095 Indians became permanent residents in Canada.

India has confronted this challenge since its Independence. Having a neighbour that is an epicentre of global terrorism. ""At the UN, he also recalled the Pahalgam incident, where 26 tourists lost their lives, and said that is the recent example of cross border barbarism.""For decades now, major international terrorist attacks are traced back to that one country. The US-designated list of terrorists is replete with these nationals. The most recent example of cross border barbarism was the murder of innocent tourist in Pehalgam in April this year,"" he added.The April 22 assault in Baisaran, a popular tourist spot in Pahalgam often called ""mini Switzerland"", marked the deadliest terror attack in the Valley since Pulwama in 2019.The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), claimed responsibility for the massacre.Talking about the Operation Sindoor, Jaishankar said that India exercised its right to defend its people against terrorism and brought its organisers and perpetrators to justice.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, 2024, targeting terror infrastructure inside Pakistan and PoK, following the April 22 Pahalgam attack.Indian forces hit nine key terror camps and support facilities, stretching from Muridke to Bahawalpur, long known as hubs for terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. The operation was mainly carried out by the Indian Air Force, backed by loitering munitions and ground-based artillery.He asked the UN to create a pressure on the entire terrorism ecosystem and the financing of terrorism must be choked.""When nations openly declare terrorism a state policy, when terror hubs operate on an industrial scale, when terrorists are publicly glorified, then such actions must be unequivocally condemned.

Calcutta High Court on Friday struck down Centre’s decision to deport two women and their families from Birbhum, West Bengal, to Bangladesh.The court said the deportation was illegal and ordered that all six people, including three children, be brought back to India within a month. The court also dismissed the Centre’s request for a temporary stay on the order.Petitions were filed by family members of Sonali Bibi and Sweety Bibi, both from Paikar in Murarai, Birbhum.The women said their husbands and children had been living and working in Delhi for over 20 years as daily wage earners. On June 18, Delhi Police detained them on suspicion of being Bangladeshi nationals. Nine days later, on June 27, they were deported across the border. Reports said they were later arrested by the Bangladesh police.Sonali’s family told the court that she was nine months pregnant when deported, raising fears about her newborn’s citizenship if the child was born in Bangladesh.Lawyers for the families argued that the deportation was carried out despite them showing proper documents, including land papers, voter ID cards of their parents and grandparents, and birth certificates of their children issued by government hospitals.The Centre, in its affidavit, said the plea was not valid before the Calcutta High Court since petitions had already been filed in the Delhi High Court. It also argued that Delhi Police acted under instructions from the ministry of home affairs, which had issued a memo in May 2025 detailing the process for deporting Bangladeshi or Myanmar nationals.After the judgment, Trinamool Congress MP Samirul Islam said the court’s order exposed the BJP’s attempt to brand poor Bengali families as illegal immigrants wrongly. Calling it a “victory for Bengal,” he said the deportation was part of an anti-Bengali, anti-poor agenda.","Calcutta High Court struck down Centre’s decision to deport two women and their families from Birbhum, West Bengal, to Bangladesh.

Such areas play a key role in hydrological cycle and flood control, water supply and providing food, fibre and raw materials. The global Convention to protect such areas was adopted in 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar. It provides a framework for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources across its 172-member countries including India.Announcing the addition of two more Indian sites in the global elite list, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said it underscored India’s resolve to safeguard its rich wetland ecosystems for biodiversity, climate resilience, and sustainable livelihoods.""India strengthens its commitment to wetlands conservation with the addition of two new Ramsar sites from Bihar,"" he posted on X.According to information on these two wetlands shared by India with the Convention secretariat, the Gokul Jalashay is an oxbow lake located on the southern edge of the river Ganga.

Local communities rely on the wetland for fishing, farming and irrigation. Each year, during a traditional festival, villagers work together to remove weeds and clean the catchment area.Udaipur Jheel is also an oxbow lake which surrounds a village. Over 280 plant species are found in the wetland, including Alysicarpus roxburghianus, a perennial herb endemic to India. The wetland is an important wintering ground for around 35 migratory bird species, including the vulnerable common pochard.","The two new additions are Gokul Jalashay in Buxar district and Udaipur Jheel in West Champaran district.

Courts are also directed to consider cancelling bail where the accused and their counsel are found collusively delaying proceedings. If a counsel is causing delay, the court may appoint an amicus curiae to ensure day-to-day trial.""The legal position is that once examination of witnesses starts, the court concerned must continue trial from day-to-day until all the witnesses in attendance have been examined,"" the court noted.The SC bench of Justices Pardiwala and Viswanathan observed: ""It is almost a common practice and regular occurrence that trial courts flout this mandate with impunity.

Ladakh Violence: Sonam Wangchuk Ends 15-Day Hunger Strike

NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs cancelled the FCRA- Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act certificate of Sonam Wangchuk-led Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh after the Central Bureau of Investigation had initiated an inquiry.According to official findings, SECMOL received and deposited foreign contributions in contravention of Sections 8, 12, 17, 18 and 19 of the FCRA . The ministry alleged that in FY 2021-22, Sonam Wangchuk deposited Rs 3.35 lakh in SECMOL’s FCRA account in violation of Section 17. While the association claimed the sum was the sale proceeds of an old bus purchased with FCRA funds and thus rightly deposited in the FCRA account, the government noted discrepancies between the transaction details in its returns and the actual bank credits, calling the explanation “untenable.”Authorities also flagged that in FY 2020-21, local contributions amounting to Rs 54,600 from three individuals were credited to the FCRA account instead of the local account, a violation admitted by the association as an “inadvertent” error.Further, SECMOL received Rs 4.93 lakh from Swedish organisation Framtidsjorden for youth-awareness programmes on migration, climate change and food security. While the NGO said the funds were used strictly for educational purposes, the ministry observed that part of the grant involved “study on sovereignty of the country,” which cannot be funded by foreign contributions under Section 12(4) of the Act.""We received RS.4,93,205/- from framstidjorden for educational program for youths under the FE project for creating awareness among youth on issues such as migration, climate change, global warming, food security and Sovereignty and organic farming through different workshops and trainings. The funds were utilized stricty in line with the organization's objectives and for the specific purposes for which they were allocated. Hence, all these activities were educational and there was no violation,"" association replied.The ministry also pointed to a Rs 19,600 foreign donation returned to a donor during the Covid lockdown and a Rs 79,200 deduction from staff stipends that was recorded as food-fee receipts instead of disbursed salaries, which it said reflected poor accounting and possible violations of Sections 18 and 19.""AND WHEREAS, in view of violations as enumerated above u/s 8(1)(a), 17,18,19 and conditions of registration under section 12(4)(f) (i) of the Act, the FCRA registration certificate of the association is liable to be cancelled in exercise of power u/s 14 of the Act,"" the statement read.""NOW THEREFORE, considering the facts and position narrated in preceding paras, the Competent Authority, hereby, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 14(1) of the Act, cancels with immediate effect the FCRA Certificate of Registration No. 152710012R granted to the association ""Students Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh,"" the statement added.The CBI 's investigation, based on a complaint from the Ministry of Home Affairs, began about 10 days ago when CBI officials visited the institution in Ladakh, PTI reported.Reacting to the MHA's statement, which had blamed him for provoking mob violence, Wangchuk stated that he is prepared to be arrested under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA).""To say it was instigated by me, or sometimes by Congress, is to find a scapegoat, rather than addressing the core of the problem, and this will lead us nowhere. They may be clever in making somebody else a scapegoat, but they are not wise. At this time, we all need wisdom rather than 'cleverness' because youths are already frustrated,"" Wangchuk told PTI over the phone.The activist, who has been leading the peaceful agitation for statehood and constitutional safeguards for Ladakh, also raised concerns over his personal safety.""I see they are building up a case to bring me under the Public Safety Act and throw me in jail for two years,"" he said, adding, ""I am ready for that, but Sonam Wangchuk in jail may cause them more problems than free Sonam Wangchuk.""Over CBI probe on his institute for alleged FCRA violation, Activist Sonam Wangchuk told ANI, ""In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk.""""A day later (after Leh protests), the Home Ministry of India issued a press release naming Sonam Wangchuk in it and blaming him... I had received a notice about a CBI inquiry stating that your organisation received foreign funding even when it did not have FCRA. We did not get FCRA because we don't want funds from abroad. United Nations team wanted to take our Passive Solar Heated Building to Afghanistan, and for this, they gave us a fee. We also got fees with tax from Switzerland and Italy organisations for supplying knowledge to them about our artificial glaciers...We are getting I-T summons. In the series of witch hunting, yesterday's events were the last and all blame was put on Sonam Wangchuk,"" he added.The investigation coincides with recent unrest in Ladakh, where the protest turned the violent protests that erupted in Ladakh on September 24 over demands for statehood and inclusion of the region under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. The protest took a violent turn with the BJP office and several vehicles set on fire and hundreds of people taking to the streets.The region experienced its worst violence since 1989 on Wednesday, with youth groups engaging in arson and vandalism at the BJP headquarters and Hill Council, including burning vehicles. Law enforcement had to use teargas to control the situation.","The ministry of home affairs cancelled the FCRA- Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act certificate of Sonam Wangchuk-led Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh.

Poll Should there be a review system for deportations involving elderly individuals? Yes, to ensure fairness and safety No, existing rules are enough





CHANDIGARH: A 73-year-old grandma, who lived in US for 30 years, ""did everything right, worked, paid tax, and never missed any immigration check date"" is heartbroken after being deported in cruel manner — denied access to even her medicines on flight and once handed a plate of ice as food during her detention.""After living there for so long, you are suddenly detained and deported this way, it is better to die than to face this. In such a situation, one should not live,"" Harjit Kaur said with anguish. Choking up while speaking to TOI on Thursday evening, she said: ""Look at my feet, they are swollen like cow dung cakes. I neither got medicine nor am I able to walk.""Kaur landed in New Delhi on Thursday afternoon and was on her way to her sister's house in Mohali when she narrated her ordeal to TOI. A native of Pangota village in Tarn Taran district of Punjab, Kaur moved to the US with her two sons around 33 years ago after her husband, Sukhwinder Singh, passed away.She lived in the San Francisco Bay area and worked at a cloth store in Berkeley till Jan this year when she had to quit because of complications from her knee surgeries.Kaur was taken into custody on Sept 8 during a routine check-in with immigration officials.Her asylum applications had been turned down, with the last rejection in 2012.Kaur was moved to Mesa Verde IC Processing Centre in Bakersfield. ""Despite the outrage over my detention and sympathy for me, the authorities in the US were simply unmoved,"" she said.She was flown from Georgia to Armenia and then to New Delhi, along with 132 others, many of whom were Punjabis, she said. She was the only one not shackled and handcuffed. ""I was the oldest, you see,"" Kaur said.Her lawyer in the US, Deepak Ahluwalia, put out a video narrating the 60-70 hours before her deportation flight to India. ""She was not given a bed and had to share a holding room. There was a concrete bench. She was made to sleep on the floor with a blanket. She was unable to get up when she would lie down because she had double knee replacement surgery.""Ahluwalia added, ""She would ask for food so she could take her medicines. Those requests were ignored. Not that she wasn't fed at all. She was given a cheese sandwich. When she asked again to have something or even water to take her medication, she was given a plate of ice. She explained she had dentures and could not eat them. The guard told her — ‘that's your fault'.""Kaur was even denied a shower the entire time, said the lawyer. ""Prior to the flight on Monday around 7pm, she and other detainees were given wet wipes and told to just clean up before they boarded. Throughout this entire ordeal, no food,"" he said.Ahluwalia said an officer was apparently going to cuff and shackle Kaur as they ""usually do on the plane,"" but another officer said not to because of her age. ""The point I am trying to make here is how a 73-year-old grandmother with no criminal record was treated. And everyone can keep saying she had a final order of removal and she was asked to leave. ICE has suggested in their response to media articles that she had exhausted all her appeal options. That's correct. What's completely incorrect is that she chose to stay here when her case was denied or the last appeal option ran out.""Kaur is heartbroken that she could not even bid a proper farewell to her home in the US. ""I couldn't go back even once to take care of my belongings, which were lying the way I left them,"" she told TOI.Now back in India, she said she was ""unwell"" and would stay with her sister in Mohali for the time being. ""Let's see what is in store for my life,"" she said.Kaur has all sympathy for those who were deported with her. ""They spent lakhs to go there. Some of them had spent 10 months to a year in detention and now return empty-handed. They were in distress as they had sold their land to reach US,"" said the elderly woman.Kaur's younger brother, Kulwant Singh, a farmer in Pangota village, told TOI that he and the entire family would take care of her.""We were able to get a travel document by ourselves and were trying to negotiate with ICE attorneys and US govt for her to depart on a commercial flight. That's all we were asking for,"" Ahluwalia said.""We had asked to release her for even 24 hours. You can put ankle monitoring, or do whatever you need to, but give her a chance to say her goodbyes and take care of what she needs to take care of, and she will depart from San Francisco on Monday. We had attached the flight ticket, but they stopped responding. And around 2am on Saturday, without notifying the attorney or anyone else, they took her from Mesa Verde and drove her to LA in handcuffs,"" he added.Ahluwalia said that a separate complaint would be given on the way Kaur was treated during her deportation. Kaur said whatever her counsel said in the video was true.Kulwant Singh, the younger brother, said that Harjit was second among four siblings. Their eldest brother Jasbir Singh passed away. ""It's sad the way she has been deported. She has been separated from her family. Now, I and our other family members will take care of her in Punjab, "" said Singh.","Harjit Kaur moved to the US with her two sons around 33 years ago.

America’s wealthiest philanthropists have seen their fortunes soar over the past two years, yet their charitable giving has not always matched this growth. According to Forbes, the top 25 US philanthropists collectively gave $241 billion through the end of 2024—a 14% increase over last year—even as their combined net worth rose 18.5% to $1.6 trillion. While this represents a massive contribution to society, it accounts for only 15% of their total wealth, the lowest percentage since tracking began in 2021, raising questions about philanthropic responsibility during global crises and growing inequality.Some, like Warren Buffett and George Soros, lead in lifetime donations and strategic giving, while others, including Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, give a smaller fraction relative to their fortunes despite increasing public scrutiny. The following are the ten most influential US philanthropists shaping society and redefining modern philanthropy through innovation, public engagement, social equity, and large-scale impact.In 2025, several billionaires are redefining philanthropy, channeling vast resources toward global challenges. From education and healthcare to climate action and poverty alleviation, these ultra-wealthy visionaries are driving transformative projects.Below, we spotlight the top 10 billionaires whose strategic giving and high‑impact initiatives are shaping a more equitable and sustainable world.Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has contributed a staggering $62 billion over his lifetime, representing 30% of his net worth of $146.7 billion. Buffett is renowned for his disciplined approach to philanthropy, primarily donating through the Gates Foundation and foundations run by his children.

Tyler Robinson Murder Probe: Partner Lance Twiggs Helping FBI With Evidence





The transgender live-in partner of Tyler Robinson, accused of assassinating Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, has been described by friends and family as a “good kid” with no part in the plot, according to interviews with those who knew him.Lance Twiggs, 22, had been living with Robinson in St. George, Utah, before reportedly relocating to a “safe space very far away from St. George” for security reasons, Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby said. Twiggs has not been charged in connection with the killing and is reportedly cooperating with authorities.During his high school years, Twiggs clashed with his family over their Mormon faith and reportedly experimented with alcohol and drugs, leading him to move between homes.He eventually stayed with a family of friends, including brothers who sheltered him during his junior year in 2021. Braylon Nielsen, 19, the sister of the two brothers, described Twiggs as “hardworking” and a “straight A” student who “went out of his way to make sure everyone was included”.Nielsen recalled Twiggs’ generosity and was quoted by the New York Post as saying, “We went to a dance once, a high school dance, and he was very involved with it.Made sure everyone had rides. Made sure everyone had clothes. He just took care of people. My sister’s car broke down once, and he came out to help her.”She added that she had no idea Twiggs was transgender, but emphasised that he “would never do something like that” in reference to the assassination.Nielsen’s mother, Jackie, echoed her support and said, “I don’t believe Lance would have any part of that. He’s a good kid. He’s a kid. He’s compassionate. He minds his own business. I hope the world lightens up on him and stops being so hateful until they have all the facts”.“He doesn’t deserve this”, she added, as per the New York Post.Twiggs’ community ties remain positive despite the shocking events. UT Success Academy executive director Ben Kaufman, who did not overlap with Twiggs, said he had only heard “glowing reports” of him, “Everything I’ve heard about him, he was a great kid. He was nice. He worked hard”.","Lance Twiggs, 22, had been living with Robinson in St. George, Utah. He has not been charged in connection with the killing and is reportedly cooperating with authorities.

Karnataka HC allows Russian woman found living in Gokarna cave to return home; travel documents issued,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnataka-hc-allows-russian-woman-found-living-in-gokarna-cave-to-return-home-travel-documents-issued/articleshow/124176017.cms,"'Snakes Are Our Friends': Rescued Russian ;Cave Woman' Living in Karnataka Forest Breaks Silencenina

Russian citizenship granted to child,

BENGALURU: Karnataka high court Friday allowed the central govt to issue necessary travel documents, enabling an overstaying Russian woman Nina Kutina and her minor daughters to return to Russia. The woman and her children were found living in a cave near Gokarna, Uttara Kannada district.Justice BM Shyam Prasad delivered the verdict, disposing of a petition filed by Dror Shlomo Goldstein, an Israeli national who claims to be the father of the children. Goldstein had sought to prevent the central govt from undertaking sudden deportation of his minor daughters from India to another country.The judge noted that the woman and her two children were discovered in an isolated cave in the forests of Gokarna without any facilities.""The action for rehabilitation of the mother and children is by the authorities once they are found. This court must opine that it would only be just and reasonable to examine the children's best interest in the backdrop of this. Apart from the other circumstances that could be peculiar to the parties concerned,"" the court said.Justice Shyam Prasad noted that all details had been disclosed to the Russian govt, from where the woman and her child had travelled on permits but had overstayed.“If these two circumstances are compelling for this court to conclude this would be in the best interest of the children, the other circumstance — also significant — is the imploration by the mother to travel back to Russia with the children. This has resulted in a response by the Russian govt for the return of these three as early as possible. It would be in the domain of the central govt to issue necessary documents to enable the mother and the children to travel back,” the judge further observed.Additional solicitor general Aravind Kamath, representing the central govt, informed the court that a DNA report of the child had been received and communicated to the Russian govt and Russian citizenship had been granted to the youngest child. Subsequently, emergency travel documents were issued for further action. The validity of the travel documents was from Sept 25 to Oct 9, requesting the issuance of exit permits to facilitate the departure of the mother and children from India promptly, Kamath further added.The petitioner’s advocate argued that the high court should assess whether the central govt was acting in the best interests of the two minor children.However, Kamanth said it is always possible for the central govt to deport any person who has overstayed. But in the present case, though the woman overstayed since 2017, sending her back with the kids cannot be termed deportation.","Nina Kutina and her two children were found living in a cave near Gokarna, Uttara Kannada district.

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate has filed a chargesheet against businessman Raj Kundra , accusing him of being a beneficial owner of 285 Bitcoins worth Rs 150.47 crore received from late crypto-scam mastermind Amit Bhardwaj.The chargesheet, filed before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court, states that Kundra concealed crucial evidence and failed to surrender the Bitcoins.The ED claims Kundra remains in possession and enjoyment of the proceeds of crime in the form of Bitcoins. The agency alleges he conducted a transaction with his actor wife Shilpa Shetty at below market rate to disguise funds obtained through criminal activities.The money laundering case originates from FIRs filed by Maharashtra and Delhi police against Variable Tech Private Limited and several individuals including Amit Bhardwaj, Ajay Bhardwaj, Vivek Bhardwaj, Simpy Bhardwaj, and Mahender Bhardwaj.According to the ED, the promoters promised investors huge returns in crypto assets through Bitcoin mining but instead cheated them and concealed the ill-gotten Bitcoins in obscure online wallets.The agency states Kundra received the Bitcoins from Amit Bhardwaj for establishing a Bitcoin mining farm in Ukraine. Though the deal didn't materialize, Kundra allegedly retained possession of the Bitcoins.""Thus, it can be safely concluded that the agreement was actually between Raj Kundra and Amit Bhardwaj (his father Mahender Bhardwaj) and the argument given by Kundra that he acted as a mere mediator is not tenable,"" the chargesheet stated.The ED noted that Kundra's ability to recall the exact number of Bitcoins received in five specific tranches after seven years ""solidifies the fact that he was indeed the recipient of Bitcoins as a beneficial owner and not acted merely as a mediator.""The agency reported that since 2018, Kundra has failed to provide the wallet addresses where the 285 Bitcoins were transferred. He attributed this to damage to his iPhone X shortly after his initial statement, which the ED interpreted as a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.The ED said Kundra ""did a genuine transaction with his actor wife Shilpa Shetty at far below market rate to disguise the origin of such funds obtained by commission of criminal activities.""The agency further stated that Kundra ""tried to frustrate the proceeding under PMLA by layering the proceeds of crime and projected the same as untainted.""The chargesheet also names businessman Rajesh Satija as another accused in the case.According to investigators, Kundra claimed to be a mediator in the transaction but failed to provide ""any underlying documentary evidence to prove the same."" Instead, the agreement titled ""Term Sheet"" was signed between him and Mahendra Bhardwaj.The ED explained that Bitcoins were meant to be used for mining operations, with investors promised substantial returns in cryptocurrency.

New AI agent 'Quick' signals strategic shift





Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman delivered a pointed message to staff during an internal meeting, criticizing the cloud computing giant for slow product rollouts ahead of its flagship Reinvent conference in December. ""The first and very most important thing we've got to do is make sure that we deliver on the roadmap that we have,"" Garman told employees, according to a meeting transcript reviewed by Reuters.The AWS chief emphasized that customers expect immediate access to announced products rather than mere pre-announcements. ""Increasingly, we're finding that when we launch innovative new things at Reinvent it's valuable if we can actually launch them, as opposed to just pre-announce them,"" Garman said during the all-hands meeting.The internal critique comes as Amazon grapples with mounting criticism over its artificial intelligence strategy. During the company's most recent earnings call, a Morgan Stanley analyst questioned CEO Andy Jassy about Wall Street concerns that ""AWS is falling behind in genAI with concerns about share loss to peers.""Jassy defended Amazon's position in an unusually lengthy eight-minute response, arguing that AI development remains in early stages with room for multiple winners.However, the internal pressure from Garman suggests ongoing urgency within the organization to accelerate product delivery timelines.At the meeting, Garman demonstrated a new internal AI product called ""Quick,"" per Reuters, describing as an ""agentic"" AI system designed to perform tasks with minimal prompting. The tool can analyze documents and web pages while automating customized workflows for regular business processes.Quick will soon be available for testing across all AWS employees, representing the company's latest effort to compete in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

""There were difficulties in containing the fire because of the nature of critical government systems being concentrated at one site,"" he acknowledged.The outage has crippled essential services nationwide. Mobile identification systems crashed, stranding airport travelers who rely solely on digital IDs. Postal banking collapsed entirely, blocking card payments and money transfers. The national legal database went dark while government email networks failed, according to Yonhap news agency.Emergency services faced critical disruptions as the 119 rescue system lost location-tracking capabilities. Citizens received emergency alerts Saturday morning warning of widespread service interruptions and directing them to physical offices for urgent needs.Officials plan to restore 551 of the 647 affected systems, prioritizing postal banking and legal databases. However, data center chief Lee Jae-yong told the Korean Herald no timeline could be provided, citing ongoing server overheating concerns.The government has extended tax deadlines and document submission periods while restoration continues. One worker suffered first-degree burns during the incident, with nearly 400 destroyed battery packs requiring emergency removal.This marks South Korea's second major data center disaster in three years, following a 2022 fire that disrupted KakaoTalk messaging for 50 million users, highlighting the risks of digital dependency.",A lithium-ion battery explosion at South Korea's main government data center has knocked 647 essential services offline.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Fastest-selling cars in US are used EVs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fastest-selling-cars-in-us-are-used-evs/articleshow/124187167.cms,"



A year ago, the new Ford Mustang Mach-E GT had a sticker price around $55,000. A month ago, Jeff Craig, a retired realtor, bought a slightly used 2024 version for $33,000. In exchange for 12 months and 13,000 miles, Craig got a 22% discount. ""I really did want an electric vehicle and I never had any intention of buying new,"" he said.Pre-owned electric cars and trucks in America are now almost as cheap as used gas-powered vehicles, on average, and are selling even faster, according to Cox Automotive, a services and technology company. What's more, sales of used EVs this year through June increased by 34% over the year-earlier period, while the market for new EVs only ticked up a tad.Several factors are feeding the buzz around used EVs. There's evidence that EVs may prove to be more reliable over time than gas-powered machines. Without radiators, spark plugs or oil, they require little in the way of scheduled maintenance. EV batteries are proving to be more durable than expected and in the US they are generally covered under warranty for at least eight years or 100,000 miles.",Pre-owned electric cars and trucks in America are now almost as cheap as used gas-powered vehicles.
