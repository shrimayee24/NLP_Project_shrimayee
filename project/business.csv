Centre pushes PPP medical colleges nationwide; 11 projects get nod under new funding model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-pushes-ppp-medical-colleges-nationwide-11-projects-get-nod-under-new-funding-model/articleshow/125825350.cms,"Representative image (ANI Photo)

NEW DELHI: India’s push to expand medical education into underserved districts has entered a new phase, with the Centre revealing in the Lok Sabha that 11 new medical colleges have received in-principle approval under a Public–Private Partnership ( PPP ) model. These colleges will come up by upgrading district hospitals — a shift in strategy aimed at accelerating MBBS seat creation without waiting for full government-backed infrastructure.The projects cleared so far are spread across Jharkhand (Giridih, Dhanbad, Jamtara, Khunti), Arunachal Pradesh (Namsai) and Uttar Pradesh (Baghpat, Mainpuri, Hathras, Kasganj, Mahoba, Hamirpur).The government explained that the model will rely on Viability Gap Funding (VGF) — a financial support mechanism designed to make socially important but commercially unviable projects feasible for private partners. Under the scheme, the Centre may fund up to 30% of the project cost, with states allowed to match this amount. For pilot projects, support can go up to 40% of the cost, plus 25% of operations-and-maintenance expenses for the first five years.In return, States must allow full and free access to district hospital facilities for the attached medical colleges and must provide land on concessional terms — conditions aimed at ensuring that medical education does not dilute public-hospital services.The Lok Sabha reply also stressed that faculty norms, curriculum rules, equipment standards and staffing requirements will remain under the National Medical Commission’s Minimum Standard Requirement (MSR) Regulations, ensuring that PPP colleges follow the same quality benchmarks as government medical colleges.Alongside the PPP push, the government also confirmed that the existing Centrally Sponsored Scheme for upgrading district hospitals into government medical colleges has already sanctioned all 157 planned institutions, including 14 in Madhya Pradesh and two in Maharashtra.While the PPP model is still at an early stage, the approval of 11 projects signals the Centre’s intent to create a parallel pathway for strengthening medical infrastructure, especially in districts that have historically lacked teaching hospitals.The next challenge lies in execution — from faculty recruitment to readiness of hospital facilities — but policymakers say the new structure opens a crucial opportunity to expand medical education faster, in areas that need it most.",India’s push to expand medical education into underserved districts has entered a new phase. 11 new medical colleges have received in-principle approval under a Public–Private Partnership ( PPP ) model.

Former CJI B.R. Gavai Clarifies He Never Faced Political Or Executive Pressure During His Tenure

CHANDIGARH: In a significant push for modernising the country's prison ecosystem, CJI Surya Kant has advocated bold, tech-integrated reforms, ranging from digital-skills training to UK-style inmate-monitoring systems, aimed at transforming prisons from punitive spaces into ""engines of reintegration"".Highlighting the need to align prison training with the ""economy of tomorrow"", the CJI stressed that inmates must be equipped with digital competencies, logistics expertise, & modern vocational skills. He urged deeper industry collaboration, proposing a model where companies ""adopt"" prisons, offer apprenticeships, & eventually recruit trained inmates, turning ability into opportunity.CJI Kant was speaking on correctional reforms in Gurgaon on Saturday while inaugurating skill development and polytechnic courses inside Haryana jails.While giving one of his four ""thoughtful proposals"" to strengthen correctional justice framework, the CJI said that the suggestion is regarding opening or establishing either the open jails or just following paradigm shift that has taken place in the United Kingdom with the help of a software company based in Bangalore, where a chip is provided to the convicts, who are allowed to stay at homes within defined radius.""Their movements are monitored through advanced software, ensuring compliance while allowing individuals to maintain family life, emotional bonds, financial stability, and continuity for their children, often the 'invisible victims' of incarceration,"" the CJI said.The CJI also pushed for creating or expanding open prisons in India as part of this humane rethinking of criminal justice.He concluded by reminding that data-driven reforms are essential. ""A modern incarceration system must track behavioural progress and post-release trajectories, ensuring that rehabilitation is measurable, accountable, and effective. Such a system, he said, would help measure the real effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes and reduce recidivism,"" he said.The CJI said that when individuals step out of prison and return to society without adequate support, their reintegration becomes not only difficult but dangerously uncertain. Without guidance, many are pulled back into a cycle of marginalisation and renewed conflict with the law. He said that in the absence of education, skills, psychological support, and structured reintegration, a prison, what he prefers to call a ""correctional home"", can unintentionally become a place where disadvantages deepen and custodial cycles repeat.Reformative justice today demands clear thinking, coordinated action, and systems designed for renewal rather than return, he said.CJI Kant has long been known for championing correctional reforms for jail inmates. Even during his tenure as a judge of Punjab and Haryana high court, he delivered a landmark judgment in the Jasbir Singh case, holding that the right of convicts or jail inmates to have conjugal visits - or alternatively to seek artificial insemination for progeny - is a Fundamental Right.Justices Ahsanuddin Amanullah, Rajesh Bindal and Augustine George Masih of SC and Sheel Nagu, chief justice of Punjab and Haryana HC, HC judge Justice Lisa Gill and executive chairperson, Haryana State Legal Services Authority, along with Judges of HC and other dignitaries from the state administration, attended the programme.","CJI Surya Kant has advocated bold, tech-integrated reforms to the country's prison ecosystem.

NEW DELHI: A thick blanket of smog covered Delhi on Saturday morning, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 333 at 7 am, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). While there has been a slight improvement compared to recent weeks, many parts of the city remained shrouded in dense haze.Areas including Ghazipur Mandi, Anand Vihar, and Wazirpur experienced severely reduced visibility due to the smog. CPCB data showed Anand Vihar recording an AQI of 366, Sonia Vihar 352, Wazirpur 359, and Ghazipur Mandi 366, all in the ‘very poor’ range. Bawana recorded the highest AQI at 375 at 7 am, while NSIT Dwarka measured 260, categorised as ‘poor’.The India Gate and Kartavya Path areas were also covered in smog, with the AQI in the region at 311, falling under the ‘very poor’ category.According to the AQI scale, 0–50 is ‘good’, 51–100 ‘satisfactory’, 101–200 ‘moderate’, 201–300 ‘poor’, 301–400 ‘very poor’, and 401–500 ‘severe’.In response to the worsening air quality, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change issued a statement on Friday following a question raised by MP Dr.Laxmikant Bajpayee in the Rajya Sabha. He had asked whether it was true that “one in every seven deaths in Delhi can be attributed to the city’s toxic air as claimed by several studies and reported in the media.”Minister of State Kirti Vardhan Singh replied that various studies have been conducted by academic and research institutes on the impact of air pollution. He added that in 2025, the AQI in Delhi had not reached the ‘severe plus’ level on any day.The government continues to take measures to tackle pollution in Delhi-NCR. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), established under the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas Act, 2021, oversees air quality in Delhi and neighbouring regions.The Commission has been working collaboratively with all major stakeholders to reduce pollution. It has issued 95 statutory directions to guide action against air pollution and has prepared a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to manage pollution during peak winter months. Stricter emission norms for polluting activities in the NCR have also been implemented, and regular review meetings are held to monitor progress.","A thick blanket of smog covered Delhi on Saturday morning, with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 333 at 7 am.

Sanchar Saathi App Row In LS: Cong Flags Privacy Fears, Scindia Says 'Snooping Not Possible'

NEW DELHI: A new controversy seems to be building up over discussions within govt for satellite-assisted location tracking of mobile phone users for the needs of law enforcement agencies and disaster management officials.The matter, which has been in discussion for over five years now, had seen a suggestion by the mobile phone operators lobby, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), that govt order compulsory activation of A-GPS technology. This uses satellite and mobile data to give accurate and accelerated location of an individual. However, no action has been taken on the matter by the ministry of electronics and IT (Meity), which had been conducting talks with the industry — both mobile operators as well as device makers. Currently, phone operators provide location of individuals by tracking users through mobile towers, which lack pinpoint accuracy, while also being delayed in giving the coordinates.Sources said not much progress had been made in five years around implementation over issues related to user privacy as well as reluctance of device makers such as Apple and Samsung over mandated activation. The device makers argue that user consent needs to be taken before activation of pinpoint satellite-based location tracking.Also, they have expressed fears that other service providers, and even hackers, may misuse the always-on location tracking services, violating user privacy.The issue has come to the fore at a time when govt rescinded on a plan to mandate pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi app after outcry over possible state surveillance as well as user privacy violations. In this case too, global manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung had told the department of telecom — which had issued the pre-installation order — of their objections to the measure, citing user privacy.",New controversy seems to be building up over discussions within govt for satellite-assisted location tracking of mobile phone users.

Decolonisation a route to Hindi imposition?

guru–shishya

NEP and Decolonisation

It depends on every individual what they want to consider as a link language. Many people want Hindi as a link language, and some may prefer another. The objective is not to impose one language over another. It is like an orchestra where everything will go in tandem with each other. Pradeep Bhandari said

INDIA bloc on NEP and Hindi 'imposition'

Undoing Macaulay or reimagining India?

In ancient India, knowledge often travelled into the subcontinent, not out of it. Scholars journeyed from China, Korea, Tibet, Central Asia and Persia to study in centres like Takshashila and Nalanda, where mathematics, astronomy, grammar, statecraft and medicine flourished.These were not mere stone structures but the heart of an intellectual civilisation whose instruction was rooted in local languages and knowledge systems. However, over centuries, invasions and later colonial rule thinned this tradition, and by the 20th century, India was no longer exporting knowledge as confidently as it once did.In modern India, polished English often opened doors. It helped in landing jobs, signalled education, enabled migration and allowed an engineer from Chennai and a banker from Delhi to collaborate without needing a common mother tongue.At the same time, English has long carried a social undertone. A fluent speaker is often assumed to be intelligent, cosmopolitan, and somehow ""smarter."" A hesitant speaker may be judged as less capable.It is this perception, not the language itself, that lies at the heart of India’s growing conversation on decolonisation, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a ""Macaulay Mindset"" during a Ram Mandir's Dhwajarohan event in Ayodhya on November 25.English entered India through trade, diplomacy and eventually conquest. The British East India Company and later the Crown used the language for administration and governance. But English did not spread organically. It was strategically introduced to build an intermediary class that would think like the colonial rulers.In 1835, Thomas Babington Macaulay, a British historian and politician, famously argued in “Minute on Indian Education” that English would create a class of Indians who were Indian by birth but English in intellect and sensibilities. Macaulay wanted Indians who were, in his words, “Indian in blood and colour but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.”Macaulay and other early British administrators were ignorant of India’s ancient glories — great literature and philosophy (Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads), sophisticated maths and astronomy (Aryabhata, Brahmagupta, Bhaskara), and fabulous architecture (from Mohenjo-daro to Sanchi and Nalanda). This ignorance and racism led Macaulay to say, “A single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia. ”The plan worked. Knowledge systems rooted in Sanskrit, Tamil, Persian and other languages were slowly sidelined. English became the language of courts, universities and bureaucracy. Access to power became tied to access to English.By the early twentieth century, a new elite had emerged. English-educated and urban, and influential. They authored newspapers, argued in courtrooms, entered civil services and steered nationalist politics. Ironically, the language of colonial control also became the language of resistance, enabling leaders like Nehru and Ambedkar to articulate modern political thought for the world.Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Sangh’s decolonisation project has widened from language to symbols and institutions. Rajpath was renamed Kartavya Path, the Indian Navy adopted a new ensign inspired by Shivaji Maharaj, and spaces like the National War Memorial, Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya and Yuge Yugeen Bharat gallery were created to showcase civilisational continuity.The address of the Prime Minister’s official residence at 7, Race Course Road (7 RCR) was renamed Lok Kalyan Marg in 2016 by the New Delhi Municipal Council, replacing a colonial-era name with one that emphasises welfare and public good. PM Modi has also renamed the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) as Sewa Tirth.Education reforms through the National Education Policy 2020 encourage mother-tongue learning and allow engineering, medical and law courses in regional languages. Technical textbooks are being translated into Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Bengali and more, with the UGC expanding regional-language undergraduate programmes. The three-language policy promotes Indian languages alongside English.In January 2022, the government installed a 28-foot hologram of Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate on his 125th birth anniversary, under the canopy where King George V once stood. It served as a temporary tribute before a granite statue replaced it later that year, symbolically shifting the space from colonial memory to the legacy of the freedom struggle.In September 2023, ahead of the G20 Summit in New Delhi, official dinner invitations sent by Rashtrapati Bhavan referred to Droupadi Murmu as the “President of Bharat” instead of the customary “President of India”, marking what was widely reported as the first such instance in an English-language state invite.Government vocabulary now includes terms like Seva Saptah, Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and Bharat in diplomatic use. Museum projects and tributes to figures like Birsa Munda and Alluri Raju widen the historical lens.However, the conversation around decolonisation is not without anxieties. In several non-Hindi speaking states, particularly in the South and the Northeast, language is tied closely to identity, history and political autonomy.Many regional leaders and scholars worry that the push to move away from English might gradually translate into privileging Hindi at the national level.To them, decolonisation could risk becoming centralisation if it does not explicitly protect linguistic diversity. The concern is less about opposing Indian languages and more about ensuring that Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Bengali, Assamese and others enjoy equal visibility and policy support.Calling PM Modi's decolonisation pitch an effort to recognise India's historical strength and move away from the mindset of a ""white man's burden"", BJP national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari said, ""It has nothing to do with what language you speak. The idea here is to focus on and promote indigenous education and inherent strength"".""If you see the New Education Policy, it focuses on recognising inherent talent in the individual irrespective of the language and the region you come from. If one recalls historically, India was an education capital. Our Vedic rituals, ourparampara, were something which the world wanted to emulate. In fact, Nalanda was considered to be a centre of excellence globally, where scholars from across the world used to come, learn, and then try to emulate it in their own countries,"" he said.The BJP leader also countered the notion that the decolonisation push is a route to Hindi imposition, calling it ""unfair and political"" criticism.Referring to the New Education Policy (NEP), he said it focuses on promoting education in one's own language. ""Whether one speaks Tamil, Telugu, Kannada or any other language... the idea is to focus and promote education and excellence in any language of choice.""On the question of language hierarchy and how Hindi-speaking states would connect with non-Hindi-speaking ones if English is deprioritised, he added that in the age of technology, linguistic barriers are dissolving.Chief ministers from the INDIA bloc have repeatedly expressed concerns that the NEP may lead to language centralisation. Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has been the most vocal, saying, ""The Centre knows it cannot directly impose Hindi without facing fierce opposition, so it uses education as a backdoor.""Kerala initially opposed NEP, calling it overly centralised and saffronised, although it later agreed to implement PM-SHRI schools while insisting that state autonomy in education must be respected.PM-SHRI, or Prime Minister’s Schools for Rising India, is a scheme launched in 2022 to upgrade around 14,500 existing government schools into modern model schools that reflect the vision of the National Education Policy.CM Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government has chosen not to fully adopt NEP, saying the state will follow its own education model instead. The broader concern among these states is that decolonisation should not turn into Hindi dominance and that regional languages like Tamil, Malayalam and Bengali must be given equal space.In Maharashtra, Uddhav Thackeray and Raj Thackeray have both opposed what they called attempts at ""Hindi imposition,"" particularly in schools. Uddhav described the move to make Hindi compulsory under the three-language policy as a threat to Marathi identity, saying, ""We will not allow the imposition of Hindi.""The Shiv Sena (UBT) and MNS even announced a joint protest in Mumbai, after which the state rolled back the order that proposed to make Hindi compulsory as a third language in Maharashtra schools, for Classes 1 to 5.Two centuries after Macaulay, India is not trying to erase English. It is trying to recalibrate identity. English no longer needs to sit at the top of an invisible ladder. Tamil, Bengali, Marathi, Manipuri and dozens of other languages do not need to stand below it.If decolonisation means confidence in one’s own language and culture while engaging the world without self-doubt, India might emerge more multilingual, more inclusive and more global than before. The challenge is to ensure that promoting indigenous languages does not turn into replacing one hierarchy with another.Undoing Macaulay will not be about removing English. It will be about removing the idea that language decides intellect. When English becomes one language among many rather than the measure of modernity, India will have truly decolonised.","In ancient India, knowledge often travelled into the subcontinent, not out of it.

IndiGo Fiasco: Civil Aviation Minister Slams Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Monopoly Model’ Remark

NEW DELHI: IndiGo will carry out a “root cause analysis” to determine what triggered the large-scale flight disruptions over the past week, a senior airline official said Sunday.India’s largest carrier has been cancelling hundreds of flights amid operational breakdowns linked to new pilot duty norms and planning gaps.The airline, which normally operates around 2,300 flights daily, expects to fly 1,650 services on Sunday — an improvement from 1,500 flights a day earlier. The official said operations are gradually stabilising and “full stability in operations is expected by December 10”.The official, as quoted by PTI, maintained that IndiGo has enough pilots and rejected concerns of shortages. “Our pilot numbers are fine while we may not have the luxury of having a buffer,” he said, adding that there is “no hiring freeze” and denying that a lean model triggered the crisis.He emphasised that the disruptions stemmed from several simultaneous issues. “We will need a root cause analysis, which will obviously take time...the disruptions happened due to a combination of factors and which factor played how much role (will be known after the root cause analysis),” he said. The official also described the episode as a “learning experience”, insisting “there was no question of inadequacy”.IndiGo has been struggling since November 1 when the second phase of the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) norms — which reduce the number of night landings allowed — came into effect. While all airlines transitioned to the new norms, IndiGo faced the sharpest impact, partly due to having a smaller pilot buffer. ""We did not have the same kind of buffer. But that does not mean that there is a question of inadequacy, no. These are two different things,"" the official said.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued show-cause notices to IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and Accountable Manager Isidro Porqueras, seeking explanations for the disruptions. Asked whether the meltdown could have been prevented, the official said, ""We will do our root cause analysis... we will do that and then we will come to know (what was the) planning lapse, if at all,"" as quoted by PTI.Looking ahead, IndiGo maintained it is ready for the fog season. The official said the airline has adequate number of aircraft and pilots and is “confident of managing the fog season.”","India's largest carrier has been cancelling hundreds of flights amid operational breakdowns linked to new pilot duty norms and planning gaps.

NEW DELHI: IndiGo flight disruptions have entered their sixth day, with the airline expecting to stabilise operations by December 10. The ongoing crisis has caused widespread inconvenience, as cancellations, flight delays, and other major operational issues have left multiple passengers across major cities stranded at airports.However, the airline has announced plans to operate over 1,650 flights by the end of the day and assured that refunds are being processed fully. The civil aviation ministry said that refunds totalling Rs 610 crore have been processed so far following IndiGo flight disruptions, news agency PTI reported.Here are the top developmentsIndiGo cancelled 650 flights on Sunday and plans to operate 1,650 of its 2,300 daily flights on December 7, as disruptions entered their sixth consecutive day. More than 220 flights were cancelled across the Delhi and Mumbai airports, even as efforts continued to stabilise operations. The ongoing crisis has led to hundreds of cancellations and delays in recent days, causing significant hardship for thousands of passengers.According to news agency PTI, at least 112 flights were cancelled at Mumbai airport and 109 at Delhi airport on Sunday. This follows a turbulent few days for the airline.After cancelling around 1,600 of its 2,300 daily flights on Friday, disruptions eased slightly on Saturday, with cancellations dropping to approximately 800.IndiGo also cancelled nine flights at the MBB Airport on Sunday, an airport official confirmed. “Due to the ongoing problem, IndiGo has cancelled nine scheduled flights, including both arrivals and departures, from MBB Airport on Sunday. It will, however, operate two flights as scheduled,” MBB Airport Director KM Nehra said.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers on Sunday said the airline will operate around 1,650 flights during the day as operations gradually stabilise after several days of large-scale cancellations and delays that caused hardship to thousands of passengers across the country.In an internal video message to staff from the airline’s operational control centre, Elbers said the airline’s On Time Performance (OTP) is expected to be around 75 per cent on Sunday. “Today, we have realised further improvements of the system in order to reach around 1,650 flights,” he said.Explaining steps taken to reduce passenger inconvenience, the CEO added, “We have been able to execute the cancellations at an earlier stage so that the customers do not show up at the airport in case their flights are cancelled.”According to IndiGo, 137 out of its 138 destinations are in operation today.Thousands of passengers remain affected due to massive cancellations, delays and other operational issues. Many passengers lost their temper with the ground staff at the airports. Various videos circulating online show passengers getting aggressive with staff.Flyers across various airports also shared accounts of getting stuck at the airport, disrupting their plans. A passenger at the Delhi airport shared how he was expected to return on Friday but was stuck at the Patna airport only touched down in Delhi on Sunday.Amid the chaos, some passengers also tried to keep up the spirit of their fellow crisis-bearers by recreational activities like singing and dancing.The government on Saturday cracked the whip on IndiGo and other airlines for charging exorbitant fares amid mass cancellations, capping domestic airfares at Rs 18,000 (UDF, passenger security fees, and taxes extra).In a late evening meeting, civil aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha summoned IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and other top officials to Rajiv Gandhi Bhawan and gave the airline two days instead of the 21 sought by the carrier to fully restore operations. The ministry invoked the Bharatiya Vayuyan Adhiniyam, using its powers directly rather than leaving the matter to the aviation regulator, DGCA.IndiGo, which controls 60% of domestic traffic, has been ordered to ensure refunds for cancelled tickets by 8pm on December 7 and return checked-in baggage within two days.The airline has also been barred from charging any rescheduling fees, which it had been levying despite failing for over a month to adhere to new flying time norms for pilots and crew.The civil aviation regulator gave a one-time extension till 6 pm on Monday (December 8) after IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers and COO–accountable manager Isidre Porqueras sought more time to submit a detailed response.The airline cited the scale of its network and multiple unavoidable factors behind recent operational disruptions while requesting the extension beyond the original 24-hour deadline.DGCA warned that no further extension will be allowed and failure to respond in time will lead to ex-parte action, while it continues to closely monitor passenger safety and regulatory compliance.IndiGo expects to gain back some stability by December 10, as per reports by the news agency PTI. The airline also issued an apology letter stating it expected to operate 1,500 flights by the end of Sunday.""Today, we are on our way to operate over 1500 flights by the end of the day,"" said IndiGo in their notice, ""With regards to destinations, over 95% of network connectivity has already been re-established as we are able to operate to 135 out of the existing 138 destinations in operations""As per the official statement by the airlines, the Board of Directors met on the first day the flight cancellations and delays began, and was given a detailed briefing by the management on the scale of the crisis.The company said the Board later held an internal session where it decided to establish a Crisis Management Group comprising the chairman, directors and CEO Pieter Elbers.According to the company, the group has been meeting regularly and receiving continuous updates on measures to restore normal operations, with additional telephonic consultations held with other Board members.Union minister of state for civil aviation and cooperation, Murlidhar Mohol, on Sunday, assured that the centre is monitoring the IndiGo flight disruptions seriously and immediate actions will be taken against the airlines after the investigation committee's report is submitted.The statement comes in light of the airlines not adhering to the Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL). The minister also noted the ""mental harassment"" being borne by the passengers affected.""All passengers have suffered mental distress and have had to face many difficulties. They had to endure mental harassment because of IndiGo,"" said the minister.The Railways has announced 89 special trains to operate across all zones over the next three days, beginning Saturday, to assist passengers affected by IndiGo’s large-scale flight cancellations. Officials said the trains, arranged at short notice after reviewing traffic conditions in major cities including New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Patna and Howrah, will together make more than 100 trips.They added that efforts are being made to widely publicise the special services, with some railway divisions sharing information at nearby airports to guide stranded travellers. The South Eastern Railway has also requested airport authorities to display details of the newly introduced special trains.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued a show-cause notice to IndiGo Chief Executive Officer Pieter Elbers, holding the airline responsible for the large-scale operational disruptions seen in recent days and citing “significant lapses in planning, oversight and resource management.”The aviation regulator on Saturday asked the CEO to submit an explanation within 24 hours, following a week of widespread cancellations and delays that have left thousands of passengers stranded across the country.“You are hereby directed to show cause within 24 hours of receipt of this notice as to why appropriate enforcement action should not be initiated against you under the relevant provisions of the Aircraft Rules and Civil Aviation Requirements for the above-mentioned violations,” the notice stated.","IndiGo cancels 650 flights on Sunday and plans to operate 1,650 of its 2,300 daily flights on December 7.

In a late evening meeting, civil aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha gave IndiGo two days — instead of the 21 sought by the airline — to fully restore operations.Sinha summoned the airline brass led by CEO Pieter Elbers to Rajiv Gandhi Bhawan after the ministry invoked the Bharatiya Vayuyan Adhiniyam, arming itself with powers instead of leaving it to aviation regulator DGCA. The carrier, controlling 60% of the domestic traffic, has been ordered to ensure refunds for cancelled tickets by 8pm on Dec 7, and return bags within two days. The airline has been barred from charging any rescheduling fee, which it was levying despite failing for over a month to adhere to new flying time norms for pilots and crew.Unlike other airlines which were updating DGCA periodically about flight duty time limitations (FDTL), IndiGo not only failed to implement it but even refused to disclose details to the regulator. Officials pointed out that the airline did not update authorities and travellers adequately during the chaos caused by its failure to adhere to FTDL despite being given two years to accept the globally accepted protocol.IndiGo has been instructed to improve its communication: it will now submit a report every fortnight on implementation of its commitment to recruit enough pilots to ensure compliance with resting norms.Separately, officials indicated the probe into IndiGo’s operational collapse may be expedited to find out why such a massive failure took place, and based on that the airline may be penalised. The role of the management is under the scanner as well. The airfare caps stay till IndiGo operations stabilise.Fares for short flights covering a distance of up to 500km (like Delhi-Lucknow/Jaipur) have been capped at Rs 7,500; for 500-1,000km (Delhi-Udaipur, Hyderabad-Chennai) at Rs 12,000; 1,000-1,500km (Delhi-Mumbai) at Rs 15,000 and above 1,500km (Delhi-Chennai/Bengaluru/Hyderabad) at Rs 18,000. India had last imposed fare caps during Covid (May 2020 to Aug 2022).Aviation ministry said it has “taken a serious note of unusually high airfares being charged by certain airlines during the ongoing disruption” and “invoked its regulatory powers to ensure fair and reasonable fares across all affected routes” to “protect passengers from any form of opportunistic pricing.”IndiGo is expected to normalise operations by Dec 15 after govt kept certain provisions of the new FDTL norms related to its Airbus A320 fleet in abeyance till Feb 10, 2026.A reduction in flight cancellation may have begun on Saturday when that number dropped to about 700 — from over 1,000 a day earlier. “We are on our way to operate over 1,500 flights by end of day (Saturday). With regards to destinations, over 95% of network connectivity has already been re-established as we are able to operate to 135 out of the existing 138 destinations in operations. We are committed to build back the trust of our customers,” IndiGo said in a statement. IndiGo used to operate over 2,200 flights daily.The fare-capping development may have come way too late for lakhs of passengers who had IndiGo tickets for travel from earlier this week when the airline started cancelling hundreds of flights, till mid-Dec when IndiGo expects to normalise operations. These passengers had to cancel their IndiGo tickets and buy on other airlines like Air India, AI Express, Akasa and SpiceJet at sky-high fares — touching upto Rs 90,000 on certain routes.Geeta Srivastava (name changed on request), for instance, bought tickets for Delhi-Udaipur-Delhi for Rs 11,000. While she travelled Delhi-Udaipur (Dec 5) on some other airline, she was forced to cancel her IndiGo Udaipur-Delhi ticket of Sunday. “I bought Udaipur-Delhi ticket on another airline for Rs 24,000. Of what use is govt directive? Throughout this crisis, aviation ministry has been nothing but a mute spectator,” she fumed.Like Srivastava, lakhs of passengers have had to shell out many times the usual airfare to get to their destinations. The arithmetic is against passengers as IndiGo has almost 65% of the domestic market share. Before the IndiGo crisis, more than five lakh daily domestic flyers were travelling daily this season. Until IndiGo operations are back to normal, almost the vast majority of travellers are chasing seats on airlines that have the remaining 35%. With such a demand-supply mismatch, fares have zoomed.Aviation ministry said in a statement Saturday: “An official directive has been issued to all airlines mandating strict adherence to fare caps that have now been prescribed. These caps will remain in force until the situation fully stabilises. Any deviation from the prescribed norms will attract immediate corrective action in public interest.”","Fares for short flights covering a distance of up to 500km (like Delhi- Lucknow/Jaipur) have been capped at Rs 7,500. IndiGo is expected to normalise operations by Dec 15 after govt kept certain provisions of the new FDTL norms related to its Airbus A320 fleet in abeyance till Feb 10, 2026.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125812083,imgsize-71090,width-400,resizemode-4/govt-caps-flight-fares-gives-indigo-2-days-to-normalise.jpg"

Watch: MPs Speak Out as SIR Row Dominates Winter Session Opening

BJP Rajya Sabha MP Bhim Singh introduced a Private Member's Bill in the Upper House seeking to remove the words 'secular' and 'socialist' from the Constitution's Preamble, on Saturday.The MP said these terms were added 'undemocratically' during the Emergency in 1976 through the 42nd amendment under Indira Gandhi's government, when opposition leaders were imprisoned.Singh introduced The Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2025, in the Rajya Sabha, arguing these words were not part of the original Constitution adopted in 1949.""I have introduced a Private Member's Bill to amend the Preamble of the Constitution, to remove the words 'socialist' and 'secular'. The original Constitution, adopted in 1949, which has been in force since 1950, did not have these two words. Mrs Indira Gandhi added these two words to the Constitution during the Emergency in 1976, under the 42nd Constitution amendment.

The Trump administration has moved to sharply curtail the validity of work permits issued to refugees, asylees and several categories of immigrants—including those awaiting green cards—marking another major tightening of the country’s immigration system.The new policy, announced recently by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), reduces Employment Authorization Document (EAD) validity from the current five years to just 18 months for multiple categories of applicants.USCIS said the step is aimed at enabling more frequent vetting following recent security concerns, arguing that shorter validity periods will allow officials to screen applicants more often. This will enable USCIS to deter fraud and detect aliens (foreign nationals) with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal from the US“Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorization will ensure that those seeking to work in the US do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies. After the attack on National Guard service members in our nation’s capital by an alien who was admitted into this country by the previous administration, it’s even more clear that USCIS must conduct frequent vetting of aliens. ” said Joseph Edlow, director, USCIS.In addition, late on Friday, USCIS made another announcement relating to the establishment of a specialized unit, headquartered in Atlanta, to strengthen the ability of officials to screen out terrorists, criminal aliens, and other foreign nationals who pose potential threats to public safety or who have committed fraud or other crimes.Immigration attorneys say the move to reduce the validity period of EADs could trigger widespread disruption, especially for thousands of Indians in the employment-based green card backlog who rely on these work permits to continue working while their adjustment-of-status applications (from non-immigrant visas like H-1Bs to green card) remain pending.In the context of the Indian diaspora based in the US, Kripa Upadhyay, immigration attorney with Buchalter, a law firm said, “The primary impact of this will be on the following groups of Indian applicants who are transiting to a green card: Investors seeking adjustment of status based on a pending I-526/EB-5 application (this relates to the investment linked green card program); parents or spouses of US Citizens seeking adjustment of status in the US and employees in the US who are seeking adjustment based on approved I-140 and available visas. ”For H-1Bs seeking an adjustment of status, she said the change will “leave people in a terrible situation,” with many now needing to file renewals several months in advance to avoid job interruptions. “One cannot work without valid work authorization, so the risk of falling out of lawful employment becomes very real,” she said.The problem is compounded as applications for EAD renewals can typically be filed only 180 days before the expiry of the existing work authorisation permit, whereas processing of the renewal application can take much longer.The move will also impact American employers, as delays in processing of renewals of EADs, especially of key employees, could disrupt projects. Compliance costs will also increase for sponsoring employers.","The new policy, announced recently by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), reduces Employment Authorization Document (EAD) validity from the current five years to just 18 months for multiple categories of applicants.

Delhi Air Pollution Protest At India Gate Turns Violent Amid ‘Madvi Hidma Amar Rahe’ Slogans

NEW DELHI: Delhi CM Rekha Gupta on Sunday, reacting to protests over over rising pollution levels, said the government needs at least 27 months to address the crisis.Speaking at an event in Delhi Pitampura, the chief minister said, “Those who make big statements and protest at India Gate… pollution is not something that appeared today, it has been a problem for years. What did the previous government do? Where were you at that time? This is a backlog of 27 years. The government needs at least 27 months to clear the backlog of 27 years.""Her comments came after a series of demonstrations across the city, including one at India Gate where several people were detained during a “clean air protest.” The protesters demanded urgent action and stronger policies to deal with what they called an “air emergency.” Some women brought their children carrying nebulisers and medical prescriptions, using them as symbolic reminders of the growing health impact of Delhi’s smog.Police have detained at least 15 people in connection with the protests. A senior officer said the group refused to disperse and allegedly used pepper spray on personnel, triggering a brief scuffle.Meanwhile, this November has turned out to be one of the most polluted months in recent years for the Delhi–NCR region. All of India’s 10 most polluted cities were located in the area, with Ghaziabad at the top of the list and Delhi ranked fourth. Except for Bahadurgarh in Haryana, none of these cities recorded a single day of clean air, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). The findings also highlighted how pollution in NCR is interconnected, with emissions in one city affecting air quality across the region.Delhi recorded a monthly average PM2.5 concentration of 215 µg/m³ — double the October average of 107 µg/m³. The capital logged 23 ‘very poor’ air days and six ‘severe’ days, underscoring the intensity of the winter smog cycle.",Delhi CM Rekha Gupta said the government needs at least 27 months to address the crisis.

Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

KOLKATA: The pre-hearing phase of Bengal’s SIR of electoral rolls is nearing completion with nearly 100% of 7.6 crore voters’ data having already been digitised. But, between 28 lakh and 30 lakh voters will, in all probability, have to attend poll officials’ hearings if they want to stay on the rolls as they remain unmapped (data not matching with the 2002 roll).All these unmapped voters will get notices to appear for in-person hearings and will have to produce one of the 13 SIR documents that EC has approved for Bengal. The hearings will be held between Dec 16 and Feb 7 next year before the publication of the final electoral rolls on Feb 14. Besides this number, till Saturday afternoon, 54.6 lakh voters remained untraceable or were categorised as dead or duplicate. These names will be deleted from the SIR draft list to be published on Dec 16, officials said. EC’s deadline to complete this phase of SIR ends Thursday.“A little over 7% (54.6 lakh) of the 99.4% digitised enumeration forms are now ‘uncollectible’ and these names will not be included in the draft SIR roll,” a senior EC official said. But voters can challenge and file fresh enrolment applications under Form 6 if they want to challenge this. Around 23.7 lakh voters have died, 19 lakh have shifted, 10.1 lakh are untraceable, and 1.2 lakh are duplicate voters. EC will publish a separate list of voters who have collected forms but are yet to return them to BLOs. These names (around 39,000), too, will not be included in draft rolls.","The pre-hearing phase of Bengal’s SIR of electoral rolls is nearing completion with nearly 100% of 7.6 crore voters’ data having already been digitised.

All IndiGo flights to Delhi were cancelled on Friday due to 'operational issues', prompting many travellers - especially those headed for international connections at IGI Airport - to book last-minute taxis. Several passengers told TOI that they had to fork out nearly twice the normal fare of Rs 5,000-6,000.Those who had time switched to trains, but most had to cough up extra for a cab ride. Arun Kumar and Naina, who were headed to Canada, said they had no option but to book a cab after their flight to Delhi was cancelled. ""We paid Rs 10,000 for a taxi to IGI. Just last week, our friends went for Rs 5,500,"" they said.In Nagpur, abrupt disruptions & repeated cancellations forced hundreds of passengers to turn to private sleeper bus operators, who stepped in to travel to major metros like Mumbai and Bengaluru at short notice. Unlike Chandigarh, however, operators did not hike charges despite the sudden influx, said private bus operator Mukesh Chaurasiya, who runs a fleet of sleeper coaches. ""We charged normal fares. People were genuinely relieved because they had no other option left,"" he said.""Yesterday alone, I provided four to five buses from Nagpur to Mumbai after flights got cancelled. My buses even had to go directly to the airport because so many passengers were stranded, especially after the Bengaluru flight was cancelled,"" Chaurasiya told TOI.""Even today, five to seven buses are coming from Mumbai to Nagpur. We're getting inquiries from Delhi and other cities as well, but our capacity is limited,"" he added.Other private bus operators, too, confirmed a spike in emergency bookings.

Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

Obstructed exits trapped victims: Official

PANAJI: The Birch by Romeo Lane had been dancing with danger for long.The inferno was the result of a critical failure in ""fire prevention engineering, regulatory compliance, and life safety preparedness"" by club owners. The nightclub also lacked a construction licence.""According to records, the establishment did not obtain a valid NOC from the fire department, indicating non-compliance with mandatory fire safety regulations,"" fire department director Nitin Raiker said. The list of violations included the absence of functional fire alarm systems, non-installation of automatic sprinkler systems, lack of smoke extraction and basement ventilation systems, inadequate number and width of emergency exits, absence of illuminated exit signage, lack of emergency lighting, lack of fire compartmentalisation or fire-rated doors, and lack of evacuation plans.The fire department noted that the absence of “fundamental fire safety infrastructure” and unauthorised hazardous external activities significantly contributed to the severity of the blaze and the tragic loss of lives.“Prima facie observations also indicate that firework activities were being undertaken on the external frontage of the premises at the relevant time.This activity significantly increased ignition risk. Fireworks near commercial establishments, without proper isolation distances and permits, present a severe and unacceptable fire risk,” fire department director Nitin Raiker said.While the emergency response was timely, the narrow access routes complicated firefighting efforts, Raiker said. “It was further observed that the basement had inadequate ventilation and obstructed means of egress, which contributed to the entrapment of the victims,” he added.The department called for immediate enforcement of compliance measures, strict regulation of high-risk activities, and implementation of modern fire engineering solutions to prevent the recurrence of such accidents.“In one word, there were zero fire safety measures,” a fire department official said.","The inferno was the result of a critical failure in ""fire prevention engineering, regulatory compliance, and life safety preparedness"" by club owners.

MUMBAI: The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, long seen as a launchpad for India's brightest startups, has quietly crossed an even more telling milestone. It incorporated a company of its own. This is not an incubated spinoff or a faculty-seeded venture, but an organisation owned and anchored by IIT Bombay itself.On Nov 7, 2025, BharatGen Technology Foundation was registered with the Registrar of Companies in Mumbai, carrying the Powai institution's address as its own-an unmistakable signal of how India's top engineering school plans to shape the future of artificial intelligence.BharatGen, the country's first attempt to build a Large Language Model that mirrors India's linguistic, cultural, and social diversity, first took shape last year after the Department of Science and Technology (DST) laid the groundwork with Rs 235 crore in initial support, signalling an early bet on public infrastructure for AI.The project is supported under the DST's National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems (NM-ICPS). Led by IIT Bombay, the BharatGen consortium brings together several leading institutions, including IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, IIIT Hyderabad, IIT Mandi, IIT Hyderabad, IIM Indore, IIT Kharagpur, and IIIT Delhi.""To take the models from the lab to market requires the functional freedom and autonomy of a corporation as opposed to being just an academic project,"" said Prof Ganesh Ramakrishnan, IIT Bombay's professor who is the founder director of BharatGen Technology Foundation Designed to work across more than 22 Indian languages, BharatGen combines text, speech, and document vision, so AI can interpret information the way citizens naturally speak, read, or interact.BharatGen's ambition is not just to build large language models, but to build ones that sound and think like India. Its strength, said Prof Ramakrishna, lies in training systems on home-grown datasets and Indian languages-an approach he believes will make them far more dependable in real-world use.He added that the foundation plans to release distilled versions of its models to developers, allowing startups and enterprises to plug into sovereign AI without the cost or expertise of training colossal systems on their own. In other words, hesaid, BharatGen will do the heavy lifting so the country's innovators can get straight to building.The initiative has now received an additional Rs 1,058 crore from MeitY under the IndiaAI Mission, expanding BharatGen into a national sovereign AI effort.","BharatGen is the country's first attempt to build a Large Language Model that mirrors India's linguistic, cultural, and social diversity.

: Rajnath

NEW DELHI: Inaugurating 125 border infrastructure projects, including the key Shyok tunnel in Ladakh, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said they will not only ensure faster mobility of troops & weapons, but also boost tourism, employment & stronger faith in democracy among people living in remote regions.The projects, the highest number to be inaugurated simultaneously, will significantly improve last-mile connectivity to remote villages & forward military locations, ensuring uninterrupted movement through landslide and avalanche-prone areas.From the site of the 920-metre Shyok tunnel on the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie Road in Ladakh, Rajnath Singh virtually inaugurated 28 roads, 93 bridges & four other projects spread across Ladakh, J&K, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Mizoram, which were completed at a total cost of Rs 5,000 crore by Border Roads Organisation.He also inaugurated the Galwan War Memorial.Noting the Modi government’s “unwavering commitment” to keep strengthening border infrastructure & developing border areas in line with the vision of Viksit Bharat, Singh said these connectivity projects are lifelines for security, economy & disaster management. The speed with which India is strengthening its borders with roads, tunnels, smart-fencing, integrated command centres and surveillance systems is proof that connectivity is a backbone of security, and not a separate entity, he said.“Our government, armed forces and organisations like the BRO are working diligently for holistic development of our border areas. We must continue strengthening the bond between the border regions andthe national mainstream so that the relationship is not influenced by any external factors,” he said.Referring to the successful conduct of Operation Sindoor, he said, “Our armed forces launched the operation in response to the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam. Everybody knows what befell those terrorists. We could have done much more, but our forces, demonstrating both courage and patience, only did only what was necessary.”“Such a massive operation was possible due to our strong connectivity. Logistics were delivered to the armed forces in a timely manner.

"Union power minister flags misinformation on smart meters, calls for consumer education",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/union-power-minister-flags-misinformation-on-smart-meters-calls-for-consumer-education/articleshow/125820127.cms,"Union power minister Manohar Lal

NEW DELHI: Flagging the widespread misconceptions about smart electricity meters among consumers, Union power minister Manohar Lal on Sunday urged power distribution companies to run a coordinated campaign to counter misinformation.“Farmers plan to hold a nationwide demonstration on Monday, demanding that the clause related to smart meters in the draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2025, be scrapped. They are not aware what smart meters are or what impact they will have, yet believe they are harmful. Moreover, they don’t even have to pay the electricity bills because the state governments give the subsidy,” Lal said. He added that both the govt and discoms need to actively step in and explain the facts.Farmers held protests against the bill by blocking railway tracks across 19 districts of Punjab on Friday.Drawing a parallel with the initial resistance to electronic meters, Lal said only a fraction of consumers today understand the benefits of smart meters, making large-scale awareness and training essential to prevent fear and confusion from spreading.As per the government, the draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2025, aims to transform the existing market structure by rationalising cross-subsidy, promoting cost-reflective tariffs, and enabling direct procurement of power by industrial users.It seeks to dismantle longstanding barriers to India’s manufacturing competitiveness, making industrial power more affordable, reliable and responsive to market demands, while at the same time protecting subsidised tariffs for farmers and other eligible consumers. The bill is likely to be brought to Parliament in the ongoing winter session.Installation of smart metres is part of the Centre’s revamped distribution sector scheme, which aims to modernise the power distribution infrastructure, reduce commercial losses and improve billing efficiency. Of a total target of 25 crore, nearly 4.8 crore prepaid smart meters have been installed across the country so far.The minister was speaking at the closing session of a national conference on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the power distribution sector, organised by the Union ministry of power at Bharat Mandapam. The two-day conference showcased smart meter data analytics, integrated IT/OT systems and smart home automation use cases aimed at improving operational efficiency and consumer satisfaction across discoms.Touching on the growing influence of AI across sectors, Lal expressed a mix of optimism and caution. “Innovation brings happiness, but AI also creates doubts. We should not let our natural thinking power decline,” he said. While noting that India’s power sector has made remarkable progress over the past century, he stressed the need to keep moving forward with scientific thinking, efficiency and public awareness. “We must keep moving forward, resolving the challenges that come in the way,” he added.Lal also underlined India’s progress toward the target of 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030, but cautioned that fossil fuels cannot be phased out abruptly. Coal, he said, will continue to play a role in power generation until renewable sources become fully stable.",Union power minister Manohar Lal urged power distribution companies to run a coordinated campaign to counter misinformation.

No Extension To Waqf Registration Deadline, Rijiju Reiterates Citing Parliament And SC Mandate

NEW DELHI: With over 5.17 lakh property uploads at final count, the UMEED central portal for management of waqf properties closed for the process on Dec 6 night, as per the six-month deadline set out under the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.Those who failed to upload within the stipulated timeframe will have to now approach the waqf tribunal, and the latter, only if convinced of the reasons for delay in uploading details, may give an extension of up to six months.However, while making it clear that there can be no extension of the deadline, minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Friday said that as a “humanitarian and facilitative” measure for those who were unable to register, no penalties or strict action will be initiated for the next three months, enabling those who may have not been able to upload due to genuine reasons to approach the tribunal.As of Saturday, of all the 5,17,040 property uploads, a little over 2.16 lakh properties have been approved by designated approvers, around 2.13 lakh submitted by ‘makers’ and remain in the pipeline for approval, and 10,869 rejected during verification.There was a sudden surge in uploads after Supreme Court on Dec 1 refused to extend the timeframe for mandatory registration of all waqf properties, including ‘waqf by user’, on the UMEED portal.The highest number of property uploads have been initiated by Uttar Pradesh (86,345), followed by Maharashtra (62,939) and Karnataka (58,328). A big state like West Bengal has uploaded 23,086 properties. Bengal which has been strongly opposing the amended waqf law, only in Nov reportedly issued directions to state authorities to adhere to the deadline and upload details of waqf properties.There have been zero uploads from the northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Sikkim and Nagaland. However, there have been 681 property uploads from Assam, 393 from Manipur and 13 from Meghalaya. Ladakh and Goa have also registered zero uploads.Sharing these details on X, the ministry said that “in the final count, the momentum significantly accelerated as the deadline approached. Many review meetings, training workshops, and high-level interventions, even at the secretary level, injected renewed pace into the process, making the upload surge in the last hours.”The conclusion of this phase marks a significant milestone in bringing transparency, efficiency and unified digital management to waqf properties across India under the Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency, and Development (UMEED) Act framework. It aims at creating a digital inventory of all Waqf properties that will be assigned a unique ID number, it said.","The UMEED central portal for management of waqf properties closed for the process on Dec 6 night.

Winter diseases you must be careful about as days get colder

NEW DELHI: Cold conditions prevailed across north India on Sunday, with the Amarnath yatra base camp being the coldest recorded place in Jammu and Kashmir at minus 4.3 degrees Celsius and parts of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan reporting minimum temperatures between three and seven degrees Celsius.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said cold wave conditions were ""very likely"" to prevail in isolated pockets over Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha on Monday and Tuesday.In Delhi, the minimum temperature was recorded at eight degrees, up from 6.8 degrees a day ago and yet 1.6 notches below normal.The maximum temperature was 24.7 degrees Celsius, 0.1 notch below normal, while the relative humidity was 92 per cent in the morning.For Monday, the weather department forecast a minimum of 10 degrees Celsius and a maximum of 25 degrees Celsius, with mist expected.Pollution levels in Delhi remained in the ""very poor"" category on Sunday, prolonging the spell of toxic air that has hung over its residents for several weeks now. The city logged a 24-hour average AQI of 308.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, an AQI between 0 and 50 is classified ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"" and 401 and 500 ""severe"".Further in the north, the night temperatures in Kashmir rose by several degrees but stayed below the freezing point, officials said.The Pahalgam resort in south Kashmir, which serves as the base camp for the annual Amarnath yatra, was the coldest recorded place in Jammu and Kashmir as the minimum settled at a low of minus 4.3 degrees Celsius.The minimum temperature in Srinagar -- the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir -- settled at minus 0.9 degrees Celsius, a rise of 3.2 degrees compared to the previous night.The gateway town to the valley, Qazigund, recorded a low of minus one degree Celsius, while the minimum settled at minus 0.8 degree Celsius in north Kashmir's Kupwara, and 1.1 degrees Celsius in south Kashmir's Kokernag, according to officials.The meteorological department said the weather would remain generally cloudy but dry on Sunday, and a brief spell of light snowfall at isolated places in the higher reaches of north and central Kashmir is likely on December 8.In Himachal Pradesh, The IMD predicted dense fog in parts of the state until Wednesday.A yellow alert for dense fog was also issued in parts of the reservoir area of the Bhakra dam in Bilaspur district and over some parts of the Balh valley in Mandi district during early morning till Monday.In Punjab, Faridkot remained the coldest place, with the minimum temperature settling at 4.4 degrees Celsius, while in Haryana, Narnaul saw the lowest temperature at 4.6 degrees Celsius, according to the local meteorological department.Chandigarh, the common capital of the two states, recorded a minimum temperature of 8.2 degrees Celsius.In Punjab, Bathinda and Gurdaspur recorded a minimum temperature of 4.6 degrees Celsius, while Ferozepur recorded 6 degrees, Amritsar 6.1 degrees, Ludhiana 6.8 degrees, and Patiala 8.9 degrees.In Haryana, Bhiwani recorded a low of six degrees, Hisar 6.2 degrees, Sirsa 6.6 degrees, Karnal seven degrees, Rohtak 7.8 degrees, and Ambala 9.8 degrees.Rajasthan, similarly, reeled under intense cold, the Meteorological Centre here said.Fatehpur in the Sikar district continued to record the lowest minimum temperature, albeit at 3.5 degrees Celsius, slightly up from 2.3 degrees a day ago.According to the weather department, Lunkaransar (Bikaner) recorded a low of 5 degrees Celsius, followed by Dausa at 6 degrees, Churu at 6.3 degrees, Vanasthali (Tonk) at 6.4 degrees and Jhunjhunu at 7.2 degrees Celsius on Sunday morning.The department said a fresh but weak western disturbance is likely to cause partly cloudy skies in some parts of the state over the next few days.Under its influence, the minimum temperature is expected to rise by two to three degrees Celsius, providing relief from the cold wave, it said.Meanwhile, in Jharkhand, eight districts recorded minimum temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius, the IMD said, noting a cold wave in parts of the state.Gumla recorded the lowest temperature in the state at 3.5 degrees Celsius - up from three degrees Celsius - while Khunti logged five degrees Celsius, the IMD weather bulletin stated.The minimum temperature in Jharkhand's capital, Ranchi, was 7.5 degrees Celsius, while Daltonganj recorded 6.5 degrees and Jamshedpur recorded 9.6 degrees Celsius.Deputy Director of the Ranchi Meteorological Centre, Abhishek Anand, said, ""North-westerly winds prevailing in the lower tropospheric levels over Jharkhand have caused the drop in mercury.""""Dry weather conditions are likely to prevail across the state over the next five days. The minimum temperature may rise by 2-3 degrees Celsius during the next 72 hours,"" he added.In West Bengal, the mercury dipped below the 10-degree mark for the first time this winter in the state's plains with Sriniketan in Birbhum districts recording a minimum temperature of 9.8 degrees Celsius on Sunday, the IMD said.Its forecast for West Bengal suggested dry weather across all districts of West Bengal for the next week, with shallow to moderate fog likely in the northern districts.Darjeeling was the coldest in the hills at 6.2 degrees Celsius, while the other Himalayan tourist town of Kalimpong was warmer at 10.5 degrees Celsius.The other places which recorded low night temperatures are Alipurduar (11 degrees), Kalyani (11.4 degrees), Purulia (11.4 degrees) and Panagarh (11.9 degrees).Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 15.2 degrees Celsius, the IMD said, forecasting mist in the morning on Monday.IMD further predicted dense fog conditions in isolated pockets of Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura between December 8 and 12.It was also ""very likely"" in parts of west Madhya Pradesh on Monday and in Odisha until Tuesday.In west India, a gradual fall by two to three degrees over the next three-four days is expected, and no significant change is anticipated thereafter, the IMD said.","Cold wave conditions ""very likely"" to prevail in isolated pockets over Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha.

Bottomline

US President Donald Trump has framed his sweeping tariff policy as essential for protecting American workers and manufacturing, promoting it as a cornerstone of his ""America First"" agenda.Since returning to office this year, the Trump administration has overseen a historic surge in tariff collections. According to Fox Business, total duty revenue reached $215.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2025 (ending September 30). October alone brought in a record $34.2 billion. The Treasury also already reported $41.6 billion in tariff revenue in Fiscal Year 2026, and since Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, monthly collections have climbed sharply—from $23.9 billion in May to $29 billion in July, with August and September together adding $62.6 billion.Trump’s logic was– tariffs raise the cost of imported goods, encouraging manufacturers to relocate production to the United States while generating substantial government revenue.However, examination of economic data and analysis from world-leading institutions reveals a fundamental contradiction between Trump's claims and the consequences unfolding in the American economy.At the core of Trump’s tariff strategy is the belief that foreign producers will shoulder most of the cost.But the economic mechanics of tariffs rarely work that way. A tariff is, fundamentally, a tax on imports — and unless foreign exporters aggressively cut prices, which happens only to a limited extent, most of the burden shifts inward. Economists call this tax incidence, the real-world distribution of who ends up paying once markets adjust. In today’s globalised supply chains, where imported components sit inside everything from electronics to machinery, the incidence is overwhelmingly pushed down the chain.That pattern has been evident for months. Even in mid-2025, when the distribution looked slightly different, Americans were still paying the overwhelming share of tariff costs, according to Goldman Sachs.US consumers absorbed about 22 per cent, while American businesses carried roughly 64 per cent, leaving foreign exporters with only 14 per cent. But the burden is projected to tilt even more heavily toward households by year-end.According to the estimates from earlier this year, US consumers are likely to shoulder around 55 per cent of tariff costs, with American companies taking on 22 per cent.Foreign exporters’ contribution rises only modestly to about 18 per cent, reflecting the limited extent to which they cut prices. The remaining 5 per cent falls into routing adjustments and other leakages rather than any identifiable group escaping the tax.The bottomline is– despite political claims that tariffs make foreign producers pay, the economic weight has always landed — and will continue to land — primarily on Americans themselves.The Federal Reserve's real-time analysis of 2025 tariffs provides definitive evidence of how costs flow through the economy.The Federal Reserve Board examined tariffs implemented in February and March 2025 on imports from China and found that tariffs passed through fully and quickly to consumer goods prices within two months of implementation.Their theoretical analysis predicted that a 10 percentage-point tariff increase on imports from China raises consumer prices across a variety of goods categories, with a large share of goods categories experiencing at least a 1 percent price increase following such a tariff change.By August 2025, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis quantified the cumulative effect: tariffs accounted for 0.5 percentage points of headline PCE annualized inflation and 0.4 percentage points of core PCE annualized inflation between June and August 2025. When measured over the 12-month period ending August 2025, tariffs explained 10.9% of headline PCE annual inflation.Former IMF Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath directly addressed Trump's tariff strategy in October, stating that while tariffs have ""significantly boosted government revenue,"" the gains have come ""largely at the expense of domestic firms and households hitting American businesses and consumers."" She noted specifically that tariffs have ""contributed to higher prices, burdening households,"" with costs rising ""in several everyday consumer items"" including ""household appliances, furniture, coffee. ""Yale Budget Lab's comprehensive analysis of all 2025 tariffs found that consumer prices rise 1.2% in the short-run, equivalent to an average per household income loss of approximately $1,700 in 2025 dollars. This price increase represents a transfer of wealth from American consumers and businesses to the federal government through tariff revenue collection.As we talk about who bears the real burden of the tariffs, it's also important to understand the basics of what happens when tariffs are actually imposed as per the rules of economics.This has indeed been the dominant pattern. Yale Budget Lab's July 2025 analysis found that 2025 tariffs disproportionately affect clothing and textiles, with consumers facing 40% higher shoe prices and 36% higher apparel prices in the short-run, with prices remaining 19% and 17% higher in the long-run respectively. The impact is regressive: lower-income households spend larger shares of income on these essentials, meaning tariffs function as a consumption tax that falls heaviest on those least able to absorb price increases.The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge rose to 2.6% in June, up from 2.4% in May, with core inflation rising to 2.8%—directly contradicting claims that tariffs wouldn't raise prices.The San Francisco Federal Reserve's analysis of 40 years of international tariff data found that following tariff increases, the unemployment rate increases by roughly 10 basis points for every 1 percentage point increase in tariff rates. This means that given Trump's tariff increases averaging 20-50 percentage points on major trading partners, unemployment would be expected to rise 0.5-0.6 percentage points—a substantial economic impact.Importantly, the analysis reveals that tariffs act initially as a demand shock—uncertainty causes consumers and businesses to reduce spending, which temporarily suppresses inflation while increasing unemployment. However, this dynamic reverses: ""Over time, the economy adjusts: The unemployment rate returns to its original level or even declines slightly, whereas inflation picks up and peaks three years after the initial change in tariffs, relative to the scenario where tariffs remain unchanged. ""Trump, who has long claimed that tariffs don’t hurt American consumers, ended up acknowledging the opposite — and his latest policy move proves it even further. When Fox News host Laura Ingraham recently pointed out that coffee prices are high, Trump said he would “lower some tariffs” to bring prices down “very quickly.”That admission became reality soon after, when the White House rolled back tariffs on more than 200 food products — including coffee, beef, bananas and orange juice — following rising public frustration over soaring grocery bills. Coffee, which is almost entirely imported, has seen prices jump roughly 15 per cent since January, according to CNN, in part because of Trump’s own sweeping tariffs imposed earlier this year.By suggesting that cutting tariffs will reduce prices — and then issuing a sweeping set of exemptions that took effect retroactively — Trump has inadvertently conceded that tariffs function like taxes that raise costs for Americans. This contradicts years of his rhetoric insisting that “foreign countries pay” and that his duties do not fuel inflation.Economists, businesses, and multiple studies have long shown that US importers pay tariffs and often pass those costs on to consumers. Even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration expects prices for items like coffee and bananas to fall once tariff reductions are announced. Time will tell whether companies reverse the increases.This was not the only recent contradiction. A few days before the “coffee price admission”, Donald Trump acknowledged that American consumers “might be paying something.” The remark came after a reporter cited Chief Justice John Roberts ’ description of tariffs as taxes paid by Americans. Though Trump insisted the US still “gains tremendously,” his comment amounts to a rare admission that tariffs do raise costs for consumers — contradicting his previous statements insisting “foreign countries pay”.When American companies import components from abroad to assemble products domestically, they now pay tariffs on those inputs. A World Bank analysis examining the US-China trade war demonstrated that tariffs on imports of Chinese upstream intermediate goods negatively affect US downstream exports, output and employment. The effects are particularly severe in US industries that rely heavily on targeted intermediate goods.This creates a cascade of cost increases. When companies face tariffs on inputs essential for production—semiconductors, steel, or automotive components—they have limited ability to substitute domestically, amplifying cost pressures throughout the economy. The Federal Reserve's June 2025 Monetary Policy Report acknowledged this dynamic, noting that ""input cost pressures were widespread in manufacturing and retail, largely reflecting tariff-induced increases. ""Trump administration officials have claimed that tariffs are not driving inflation, pointing to specific data suggesting certain metrics have declined. This statement requires careful interpretation based on the timing of tariff effects discovered through rigorous economic research.The San Francisco Federal Reserve's analysis of historical international data reveals that tariffs initially create a negative demand shock that temporarily suppresses inflation even as prices for tariffed goods rise. The mechanism operates as follows: Uncertainty about future trade policy causes firms to delay investment and consumers to reduce spending. This demand contraction creates downward pressure on overall price levels that can temporarily mask the upward pressure from higher tariff costs. Foreign exporters, facing reduced demand, may lower their prices to maintain market share.However, this is a temporary phenomenon lasting approximately 1-2 years. Subsequently, inflation surges as supply-side pressures dominate. The San Francisco Fed found that inflation ""peaks three years after the initial change in tariffs."" The administration's statements about stable or declining prices capture data from early 2025—the demand-shock phase—while ignoring the cost-push inflation that follows.This timeline is critical for understanding the economic logic: immediately after tariff increases, weak demand may suppress overall inflation even while specific goods prices rise. But this represents economic contraction, not success. Americans reduce consumption not because they choose to but because they face economic uncertainty and potential job losses. The cost comes later in the form of persistent, elevated inflation years 2-3 after tariff implementation.Tariff revenues have surged in recent months. According to Fox Business, the US collected a record $34.2 billion in October alone. Total tariff receipts reached $215.2 billion in fiscal year 2025, and the Treasury has already reported $41.6 billion in collections so far for fiscal 2026.Since Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” tariffs, monthly revenues have climbed sharply — rising from $23.9 billion in May to $29 billion in July, while August and September together generated $62.6 billion. Trump has repeatedly highlighted these figures, arguing that tariff revenues — now at historic highs — could finance his proposed one-time $2,000 dividend for low- and middle-income households.Yale Budget Lab's analysis quantifies this tradeoff: while all 2025 tariffs raise government revenue, they simultaneously reduce consumer welfare and economic output more than the revenue collected. As of November 2025, Yale estimates the short-run per-household income loss at approximately $1,700, with the post-substitution effect settling at a $1,300 loss per household.Furthermore, Trump's promise of $2,000 dividend payments faces a fundamental mathematics problem. The Tax Foundation estimated that Trump's new tariffs would raise only $158.4 billion in 2025 and $207.5 billion in 2026. But checks limited to tax filers with incomes below $100,000 could cost $279.8 billion—already exceeding two years of projected revenue. Expanding payments to include non-filers could push costs to $606.8 billion, nearly double the expected 2025–26 tariff revenue.The data points overwhelmingly in one direction: tariffs function as a tax on Americans, not on foreign rivals.As mounting evidence shows prices rising even as Washington records historic revenue, Trump’s strategy exposes a deeper dilemma — whether a policy can remain politically popular while imposing growing economic costs on the very households it claims to protect.How the administration navigates that contradiction may determine not only the trajectory of the economy but also the durability of its “America First” economic narrative.","President Donald Trump has framed his sweeping tariff policy as essential for protecting American workers and manufacturing.

Your Money Vanished? The Truth About Online Scams & How To Fight Back!

MUMBAI: Mumbai is seeing a surge in cyber financial fraud, with nearly 20,000 cases reported since 2020 and losses crossing Rs 2,000 crore, yet recoveries remain minimal.Victims, from businesswomen to retirees, are finding themselves trapped not only by sophisticated scammers who clone cards and steal data, but also by banks that routinely refuse reimbursement despite RBI's zero-liability rules.Experts say the financial system's own vulnerabilities are to blame. Instead of protecting customers, banks often shift the burden onto them, leaving countless citizens fighting legal notices, recovery calls and bureaucratic indifference long after the fraud occurs.Of the cases, 4,132 FIRs were for credit or debit card fraud, ATM fraud, SIM swap, cloning, activation and OTP sharing, with victims losing Rs 161.5 crore and the police recovering just Rs 4.8 crore.The cases spanned various methods of fraud. In one example, Sakinaka resident Romaljit Kaur Makkar, a businesswoman, lost Rs 2.5 lakh after her credit card was cloned. On April 3, while attending a meeting in a Mumbai office with her card in her possession, fraudulent transactions were carried out on a merchant machine in Lucknow.Makkar alleged that her PIN could have been captured by CCTV during a shopping trip earlier that day.In another instance, retired engineer Navneet Batra (64) of Borivli East has faced daily calls from recovery agents and legal notices since March 2023 over four fraudulent fund transfers totalling Rs 1.9 lakh.He alleged that scamsters stole his card details to buy herbal products from Bihar. Despite filing a complaint with Dahisar police and blocking his card, the bank has not reversed the transactions.RBI rules on card fraud stipulate that customers have zero liability if they report a fraud within three days. If reported within four to seven days, liability is limited to Rs 10,000-25,000 depending on card limit.In cases of customer negligence, such as sharing PINs or OTPs, the customer bears full loss until the unauthorised transaction is reported; the bank covers subsequent losses. Banks must reverse charges within ten working days and resolve outstanding complaints within 90 days.Maharashtra Cyber Cell's Yashasvi Yadav said fraudsters steal card data through leaks and ATM skimmers. Expert Ritesh Bhatia argued that blaming victims for sharing OTPs is misplaced, as such fraud usually stems from systemic failures like data leaks and weak verification, making banks - customers - responsible for securing the ecosystem.Former police chief D Sivanandhan said banks are liable unless victims deliberately share sensitive details. Cyber lawyer Dr Prashant Mali said banks routinely ignore RBI's zero-liability rules and called for stricter KYC, faster card blocking, better coordination and penalties for banks that fail security norms.","Mumbai is seeing a surge in cyber financial fraud, with nearly 20,000 cases reported since 2020.

Vikram Bhatt Booked In ₹30 Crore Fraud Case!

JAIPUR/MUMBAI: Filmmaker Vikram Bhatt and his wife Shwetambari Bhatt were arrested from Mumbai early Sunday in a Rs 30-crore fraud case registered in Udaipur last month.Udaipur-based IVF specialist Dr Ajay Murdia, founder of Indira IVF, had filed a complaint a month ago alleging that Bhatt, his wife and six others induced him to invest over Rs 30 crore to make a biopic on his late wife. He alleged that he was promised high earnings, but nothing materialised.Bhatt has denied the allegations, claiming the police were ""misguided"". Last week, Udaipur police had issued a lookout notice for Bhatt and his wife. Their daughter Krishna Bhatt is also named in the FIR.Sources said an Udaipur police team coordinated with the Mumbai police and arrested the couple from the residence of Bhatt's sister in Andheri. They were produced before a holiday magistrate in Mumbai. ""The Udaipur team came with an arrest warrant. The magistrate permitted the police to take them to Rajasthan on two days' transit remand,"" a Mumbai police officer said. Udaipur SP Yogesh Goyal told TOI they would be brought to the city.The cops are scrutinising agreements, bank transactions, and communications linked to the alleged investment based on the FIR registered at Bhupalpura police station on Nov 8. Besides the couple, the others named in the FIR include their associates Mehboob Ansari and Dinesh Kataria, an Udaipur resident.Two of the suspects — Ansari and vendor Sandeep Vishwanath — were arrested from Mumbai on Nov 17. Police are searching for Kataria who allegedly facilitated the deal.","Vikram Bhatt and his wife Shwetambari Bhatt were arrested from Mumbai early Sunday in a Rs 30-crore fraud case registered in Udaipur.

Goa: 23 Killed In Arpora Nightclub Fire; Cylinder Blast Suspected, CM Sawant Vows Strict Action

LOUD ON MUSIC, LOW ON SAFETY: Goa Tragedy Puts Focus On Violations, Hazards At Capital’s Nightspots

NEW DELHI: The Goa nightclub blaze that killed at least 25 people on Sunday has renewed scrutiny of fire safety measures at entertainment venues across the country, including Delhi, where officials say lax compliance, crowded interiors and neglected safety systems continue to leave thousands at risk.A senior additional divisional officer of Delhi Fire Services said the safety framework for nightclubs and bars is already well-defined. It draws from the Delhi Fire Services Act, 2007, its 2010 rules, the National Building Code, 2016, and the Unified Building Bye-laws. ""In theory,"" he said, ""every club is supposed to comply with all of these.""Another officer explained that the basics are routinely overlooked. He said DFS checks firefighting arrangements, exit provisions, prevention and protection measures, and whether all firefighting equipment are functioning before issuing a safety certificate, which is valid for three years. But the gap, he added, begins with the layout. Clubs are required to have at least two entry and exit points at the remotest ends of the premises, ""but this is hardly followed anywhere. ""He said the cramped designs are often dangerous. Narrow staircases should never be part of a public assembly building.Exit routes must be at least 1.5 metres wide with a clear height of 7-8 feet.Fire hydrants and extinguishers must not only be installed but also work. Eateries that serve alcohol, he said, require stricter standards because liquor is highly flammable. If the interiors are fitted with materials that are not fire-retardant, it ""becomes a recipe for disaster.""""Clubs often claim they have multiple entry and exit points, but one of them is usually treated like a service entry for staff. This is often blocked,"" station officer Nitin said, describing a hazardous firefighting operation about three years ago at M-Block in Connaught Place.""Most clubs don't have a separate kitchen. It is right next to the main dining space and they use LPG cylinders. Two years ago, I remember being on the second floor and there were so many cylinders. One exploded within minutes. The blast shook the concrete roof slab, and before we could stabilise anything, another cylinder went off. The whole platform felt like it had lifted,"" he said. Electrical hazards and poor upkeep inside kitchens add to the problem.Former Delhi Fire Services chief Atul Garg said: ""One of the most critical challenges in nightclubs and discos is that, even when the fire alarm system and all firefighting installations are fully functional, the environment itself prevents timely recognition of an emergency. High ambient noise from music, combined with strobe lights, laser effects, smoke machines and crowd density, muffle the sound of traditional fire alarm signals. ""People inside the building often fail to perceive the alarm, and this gap is one of the major life-safety vulnerabilities in nightclubs and discos. It requires specialised solutions beyond standard alarm systems to ensure rapid occupant response, Garg said.Another fire officer said that the wiring is often substandard and housekeeping in many bar and club kitchens is ""very bad,"" with no ventilation and storage piled to the brim. ""Many establishments operate in extremely dark, cramped spaces. At least during the day one can see where to go,"" a senior fire officer said. ""But these clubs are so dimly lit that nobody will understand where the exit is. Once there is smoke, visibility drops to zero. ""Sandeep Anand Goyle, the Delhi chapter head of the National Restaurants Association of India, explained how NRAI only engages with establishments that have valid fire NOCs. ""Whenever a restaurant seeks membership, these documents are mandatory to be submitted. There is a clear system of checks and balances. We review their trade licences and NOCs, and a trade licence itself cannot be issued without a fire NOC. Similarly a liquor license cannot be issued without a trade license. And if the establishment is 90 square metres and above the fire NOC becomes mandatory.""","The Goa nightclub blaze that killed at least 25 people on Sunday has renewed scrutiny of fire safety measures at entertainment venues across the country.

HYDERABAD: The state govt has decided to name several roads in the city after US President Donald Trump, Ratan Tata, Google, Microsoft, Wipro, among others. According to the CMO, the road along the United States consulate general in Hyderabad is set to be called ‘Donald Trump Avenue'.The upcoming greenfield radial road connecting the ORR at Raviryal with the proposed RRR will be named after Ratan Tata, with the interchange at Raviryal already named ‘Tata Interchange'.The govt will write to the Union external affairs ministry and the US embassy, informing them about the plans. Earlier this year, the chief minister, while addressing the annual US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) conclave in New Delhi, had proposed naming key roads in Hyderabad after leading global corporations.Additionally, a prominent stretch will be named ‘Google Street' in recognition of the global impact and contribution of Google Maps and the corporation at large.The road alongside its upcoming campus, set to be Google's largest campus outside the US, will bear this name. These proposals are part of the govt's initiative to position the state as a symbol of innovation-driven India, the CMO said.Microsoft and Wipro are also likely to find representation on the city's topography, with proposals for a Wipro Junction and a Microsoft Road, in line with the Chief Minister's vision. The govt is further considering dedicating additional roads in honour of distinguished individuals and major corporations.","Telangana govt plans to rename US consulate road as ‘Donald Trump Avenue’ The upcoming greenfield radial road connecting the ORR at Raviryal with the proposed RRR will be named after Ratan Tata.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

How Elon Musk sees AI and robotics reshaping global industries





Elon Musk: A Different Conversation w/ Nikhil Kamath | Full Episode | People by WTF Ep. 16

Elon Musk’s prediction of AI-driven instant manufacturing





Elon Musk’s view of AI evolving beyond human well-being goals





Elon Musk’s vision of a future where ‘money becomes irrelevant’









Elon Musk has once again shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour. During a conversation on Nikhil Kamath’s People by WTF podcast, the Tesla and SpaceX chief suggested that the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and robotics is pushing society towards a future where humans no longer need to work to survive. Musk’s view is rooted in the belief that machines will eventually handle all essential tasks, allowing people to approach work as a creative or recreational activity rather than an economic necessity.He expressed strong confidence that the world could reach this turning point within the next two decades. For Musk, this future is not a distant fantasy but a likely outcome of the accelerating technological breakthroughs unfolding today.Musk argued that the extraordinary pace of development in AI models, autonomous systems, and humanoid robots is already rapidly reshaping industries worldwide. According to him, the next phase of technological growth will create intelligent machines that can replicate or even surpass human capability in almost every domain, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare, education, and creative services.He believes that this massive transition may occur much sooner than most people expect, possibly within ten to fifteen years. Musk compared future labour to home gardening. Just as people may choose to grow vegetables for enjoyment rather than necessity, he thinks future generations will increasingly engage in work for personal fulfilment, creativity, or social contribution rather than mere survival. The essential work that maintains society will be managed entirely by advanced automated systems that require minimal or no human oversight.A core part of Musk’s argument is that AI systems will eventually be able to create anything a person can imagine. His own AI company, xAI, along with its chatbot Grok, reflects his belief that increasingly capable generative systems will expand into physical production through robotics, automation, and smart manufacturing techniques. As these technologies combine, they could enable a world where scarcity becomes obsolete and resource distribution becomes more equitable. Musk visualises a future in which goods and services can be produced instantly and efficiently.He emphasised that the ability to turn ideas into tangible products without traditional labour inputs would fundamentally reshape economies, social structures, and the global workforce. Once technology reaches this stage, he thinks most constraints on human consumption and lifestyle will disappear, creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation, creativity, and human progress.Musk also explored a lesser-discussed aspect of hyper-advanced AI. He suggested that there may come a time when AI and robotics complete every possible task aimed at improving human well-being. After satisfying all imaginable human desires and demands, these systems could reach a saturation point where they no longer have meaningful human-centred tasks to perform.At that stage, Musk believes AI may begin working on activities that serve its own optimisation because the catalogue of tasks that benefit humanity is finite. This idea raises profound questions about the long-term relationship between humans and intelligent machines once human needs are no longer the defining force behind technological activity. Musk’s predictions extend far beyond the automation of work. At the US Saudi Investment Forum earlier this month, he stated that humanoid robots and AI systems have the potential to eliminate poverty. His argument relies on the assumption that when machines can produce goods for virtually no cost and at limitless volume, wealth becomes universal because essential resources are accessible to everyone.If machines can meet all human needs, the traditional economic struggle for income, resources, and opportunity would disappear. Musk envisions a world where every person benefits equally from the capabilities of intelligent robots that can generate abundance without relying on human labour.In his discussion with Kamath, Musk introduced an even more radical idea. He predicted that money might eventually lose its relevance. In his view, money exists primarily as a tool for allocating labour and determining the value of goods that require human effort to produce. If production becomes entirely automated and unlimited, the need for money as a mechanism for distribution fades.Musk suggested that in such a world, the primary form of value might shift towards power generation. Energy would become the foundational currency because machines require it to operate, create and sustain the systems that support human life. The economy would therefore revolve around energy capacity rather than labour or manufactured goods.","Elon Musk has shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour.

KOLKATA: IndiGo Airlines pilots have alleged that the flight cancellation and delay crisis that brought India’s aviation sector to a standstill was engineered to undermine the implementation of new safety norms and pressure govt into putting the revised Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) rules in abeyance.They questioned how a shortage of just 65 captains and 59 co-pilots following the rollout of the revised FDTL norms could have led to the cancellation or delay of thousands of flights.“IndiGo operates around 2,200 flights a day. It has 2,357 captains and 2,194 first officers. That’s 4,551 pilots, with a deficit of only 124 pilots.

IndiGo has gone to extraordinary lengths to get its way and put profits before safety,” said Sam Thomas, president of the Airline Pilots’ Association of India.Sources in IndiGo claimed that SOPs meticulously followed for years to maintain on-time performance were deliberately altered to cause delays and trigger chaos.“Usually, there are pilots on standby. If a standby isn’tavailable, a pilot on a day off is requested to fill in and the call typically comes 5-6 hours before departure. But suddenly these calls were coming barely 1-2 hours before departure,” a pilot said.Another pilot said planes typically parked next to each other in remote bays at Kolkata airport were recently parked far apart, delaying ground crew operations.An increasing number of pilots are now demanding a forensic investigation into what triggered the crisis over the past five days, insisting that those behind the alleged orchestration be prosecuted.",IndiGo pilots allege that the flight cancellation and delay crisis was engineered to undermine the implementation of new safety norms.

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Safari Industries is consolidating its position as one of India’s fastest-growing luggage players, supported by a broad product portfolio, strong omnichannel reach, and expanding in-house manufacturing. Its emphasis on e-commerce and modern trade—combined with rapid growth of exclusive stores and deeper penetration into tier-2 and tier-3 cities—has created a solid demand engine. Improved efficiencies and backward integration at the Jaipur plant are strengthening cost management and aiding margin expansion.The company’s rising share in hard luggage and the premium Urban Jungle and SI-Select ranges reflects successful premiumization. With steady monthly store additions and increasing plant utilization, Safari is scaling smoothly. Despite competitive intensity in soft luggage, its focused execution, digital capabilities, and strengthening premium positioning support durable growth, healthy profitability, and expanding leadership in India’s organized luggage market.JSW Steel’s move to place Bhushan Power & Steel into a 50:50 joint venture with JFE Steel reflects a strategic pivot toward better capital efficiency and a technology-driven upgrade of its value-added steel offerings.The restructuring unlocks significant value created through the BPSL turnaround, demonstrated by the INR320b cash inflow and INR350b reduction in consolidated debt, enhancing JSW’s financial flexibility as it targets 50mtpa capacity by FY31. Access to JFE’s advanced steelmaking expertise, combined with a cleaner corporate structure post–slump sale, supports stronger governance and product capability.BPSL’s 4.5mtpa Odisha operations, now part of the JV, continue to benefit from post-acquisition efficiency gains, with the INR530b enterprise valuation reflecting fair value realization. With steel spreads expected to improve, EBITDA/t on an upward trajectory, and net-debt-to-EBITDA likely easing toward 1.7x by FY27, the transaction bolsters JSW Steel’s balance sheet and strategic headroom ahead of major capacity expansions.","According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting December 8, 2025) are Safari Industries and JSW Steel.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

By Jacob Bernstein





Last March, the filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola said he was nearly broke after spending millions of dollars of his own money to finance the film ""Megalopolis."" In Oct, he said in an interview with the New York Times that to ""keep the ship afloat"" he was selling several of his watches through Phillips, a leading auction house.On Saturday, during a frenzied bidding war on Park Avenue, an F.P.Journe timepiece from his collection sold for nearly $11 million. It was the sixth-most-expensive watch to ever be sold at auction. And it is the only watch on that list that was not manufactured by Patek Philippe or Rolex. Coppola designed the watch in 2014 as a collaboration with F.P. Journe, a Swiss watch company whose horological marvels are so expensive that they make Rolex look like Swatch.Called the FFC, the watch sold on Saturday has an openwork design, which means its inner workings are on display. (The style is referred to as a skeleton dial.) In the center of the face is a gloved hand with fingers that disappear and reappear in various configurations depending on the hour.F.P. Journe was founded in 1999 by Francois-Paul Journe. Today, it has a dozen stores around the world in cities such as New York, London, Dubai, Tokyo and Paris.It produces and sells around 900 watches a year. And watch geeks are notoriously nasty about the merits of the company's timepieces. Just a handful of the FFC watches, which retail for around $1 million, were ever made.In 2021, a prototype sold for close to $5 million at Only Watch, a biennial charity auction held in Geneva and sponsored by Prince Albert II of Monaco. Going into this week's sale, Paul Boutros, the deputy chairman and head of Phillips Watches for North America, professed to have little idea what Coppola's watch might fetch.After bidding topped out at $9 million (the final price of $10.755 million includes auction fees), there was a mix of shock and resignation among high-end watch industry dealers. ""It's an extraordinary price, but the Journe market is on fire,"" said Andrew Shear, a dealer who regularly sells watches that fetch six figures.Jacek Kozubek, who runs the site Tropical Watch, said many high-end watches appeal to men who want to look like superheroes. Journe timepieces, in his estimation, are more akin to watches for real-life Marvel villains.Eric Wind, a rival of Kozubek's on the secondary market, currently has two Journes available on his site. ""The worst of the worst is trying to buy them,"" he said. ""I never would have predicted these would be the ultimate catnip for watch enthusiasts,"" he added, ""but they're definitely the hottest watches today."".

Rise of Rehman Dakait and the Peoples’ Aman Committee





Feuds, betrayal and the making of Uzair Baloch





Parallel governance, ‘parchi’ systems and water mafias





Several informal systems operated during this period:

The ‘Parchi’ System: Residents, businesses and even small schools were required to obtain a stamped permission slip or parchi from PAC offices to build, renovate, operate stalls or open new ventures. What looked like a routine approval process effectively served as taxation, a tool of surveillance and a means to regulate economic activity.

Water and Tanker Control: Amid persistent water shortages across Karachi, PAC factions captured key pipeline points and operated illegal hydrants. Water was sold through tankers at inflated rates, turning a basic utility into one of the most profitable sources of revenue for the gangs. Control over water distribution also gave PAC leverage over entire neighbourhoods.

Welfare Patronage and ‘Robin Hood’ Politics: A share of illicit earnings was used to sponsor madrassas, support religious events, organise football tournaments, fund community funerals and assist poor families. This welfare strategy deepened PAC’s influence and aligned it with PPP’s political base, reinforcing the perception of gang leaders as protectors rather than mere criminals.

PPP, the Bhuttos and the contested 'protector' narrative





A factual account of the events surrounding Benazir’s return and death underscores this point:

Karsaz bombing (18 October 2007): Benazir was in an open truck surrounded by PPP volunteers, not in a car. Her protection was largely handled by party workers and an informal crowd, not gang networks.

Assassination in Rawalpindi December, 27, 2007: At the time she was targeted, she was travelling in a white Toyota Land Cruiser driven by Javed Rehman, a trained PPP driver, not Rehman Dakait. No credible evidence links the gangster to her security detail.

Post-war Lyari: Quiet streets, unresolved questions









NEW DELHI: Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the “mother of Karachi” – one of the city’s oldest settlements powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football-obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets, long branded as Karachi’s “wild west.”It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar’s recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema. The film revolves around characters that seem to be inspired by gangster Rehman Dakait, police officer Chaudhry Aslam and a shadowy military-intelligence player resembling Ilyas Kashmiri (fictionalised as Major Iqbal). Alongside Pakistani security figures, the narrative hints at a foreign intelligence angle featuring an unnamed “Indian spy chief” — a character with echoes of a former top security official who, in real life, has been involved in covert roles in regional conflicts in Pakistan. These references remain ambiguous on screen, but they mirror real allegations that have circulated for years through local press conferences, dossiers and counterclaims on both sides of the border.Reacting to the controversy around Dhurandhar and the a case file in Delhi high court, Major Mohit Sharma’s brother, Madhur Sharma, said the petition was filed due to ongoing speculation that the film was inspired by the Ashok Chakra awardee’s life without any transparency from the makers. Madhur clarified that the family is not opposed to a film based on Major Sharma, but objected to the possibility of using his story without consent. “We would be proud if a film is made on him. Even in 2021, a film was announced and we supported the producers. He has left a legacy, and it should live on,” he said. The family maintains that they are only seeking clarity and dignity for the officer: “There is no benefit the parents are looking for… If the film is based on him, just say, ‘Sorry ma’am, we didn’t inform you.’ If not, say the hype is untrue.”The Delhi high court heard the plea filed by Major Sharma’s parents seeking a review before the film’s release. While the court did not stay the December 5 release of Dhurandhar, it acknowledged the legitimacy of the family’s concerns regarding similarities to a real-life officer without consent. The court referred the matter to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) for examination, noting the need for regulatory scrutiny before the film proceeds.Following the controversy, director Aditya Dhar issued a clarification on X addressed to the family. He wrote: “Hi, sir - our film Dhurandhar is not based on the life of braveheart Major Mohit Sharma AC(P) SM. This is an official clarification. I assure you, if we do make a biopic on Mohit sir in the future, we will do it with full consent and in complete consultation with the family, and in a way that truly honors his sacrifice for the nation and the legacy it has left for all of us. Jai Hind.”This blurred mix of fact, rumour and state narrative reflects Lyari’s history itself. For more than six decades, the neighbourhood has moved on two parallel tracks. One is a working-class community that powered Karachi’s docks, produced champion boxers and footballers, and remained a loyal base of the Pakistan People's Party ( PPP ). The other is a network of gangs and protection rackets that emerged from the hashish trade of the 1960s and later expanded into narcotics trafficking, extortion, land capture and control of water tankers.Successive governments, including PPP administrations, did not simply fight these groups; at various points they bargained with them, funded them or turned a blind eye. Leaders like Rehman Dakait, and later Uzair Baloch, acted not only as crime bosses but as political intermediaries who ran parallel governance under the banner of the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), often brandishing PPP flags at their offices. As Taliban networks poured into Karachi in the 2000s and regional intelligence rivalries spilled into the city, Lyari’s gangs were no longer seen merely as enforcers protecting a vote bank — they were gradually treated as potential pieces in a wider security chessboard.With Dhurandhar reigniting attention, this story revisits how Lyari transformed from a labour colony to PPP stronghold to a battleground shaped by gang wars, state patronage, counter-terror operations and allegations of espionage. What emerges is not simply the tale of feared men, but the story of a neighbourhood where poverty, politics and competing security agendas turned everyday life into a prolonged and violent conflict.a long, violent war.Lyari is among the oldest continuously inhabited parts of Karachi and holds a foundational place in the city’s history. Long before Karachi became Pakistan’s financial hub, Lyari evolved as a working-class settlement dominated by Baloch communities who migrated from coastal and interior regions in search of livelihoods. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as the port emerged as the centre of colonial trade, Baloch labourers became indispensable to loading cargo, building roads and supporting maritime activities. This early dependence on manual workers gradually transformed Lyari into a labour colony closely interlinked with Karachi’s industrial and infrastructural growth.Despite its importance in sustaining the city’s economy, the locality remained neglected in terms of urban development. Narrow lanes, dense housing clusters, unreliable utilities and limited state services came to define its daily reality. Yet, Lyari’s social fabric remained strong: sports, community centres and local cultural traditions created a sense of belonging that distinguished it from other Karachi neighbourhoods.In politics, Lyari’s identity further crystallised with the rise of the Pakistan People's Party. Since the 1970s, the PPP’s populist messaging—centred on economic justice and empowerment of marginalised groups—found deep resonance in Lyari. During decades of shifting political power in Karachi, the locality consistently returned PPP candidates to provincial and national assemblies. This loyalty turned Lyari into the party’s most dependable urban stronghold, a constituency where electoral victories were seldom in doubt.Over time, however, this relationship between Lyari and the PPP took a complex turn. As Karachi’s security landscape deteriorated in the 1980s and 1990s, the party increasingly relied on local strongmen, community leaders and later armed groups to maintain influence and protect its vote bank. Patronage networks developed, blurring the lines between politics, street authority and organised crime. What began as a working-class community with a vibrant political identity would eventually become the focal point of Karachi’s most violent gang conflict—one in which loyalty, power and criminality became deeply entangled.The roots of the Lyari gang war go back to the 1960s, when the area emerged as a key node in the local hashish trade. According to both journalistic and academic accounts, early figures like Dad Muhammad (“Dadal”) and his brother Sheru moved into the hashish business in the mid-1960s, challenging the dominance of an older drug boss known as “Kala Nag”.Kala Nag was eventually killed in what was officially described as a police encounter, and the hashish economy fragmented into rival factions. Violence at this stage largely revolved around knives and small arms, with public killings used to send messages and enforce territorial control.In the 1990s, a more educated generation of criminals appeared. One of the most prominent was Iqbal, known locally as “Babu Dacoit”, who reportedly held a Master’s degree in physics. Operating across a wider network, he ran drugs and other rackets while remaining largely beyond the reach of the police. His later arrest, when he was already paralysed, symbolised a shift from small-scale street crime to more organised, networked operations.A major shift in Lyari’s politics and crime landscape came with the ascent of Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, widely known as Rehman Dakait. Born into a family already linked to smuggling networks, Rehman entered the criminal world at a young age. By the mid-1990s, he had developed a reputation for extreme violence, with local accounts even alleging that he murdered his own mother during a domestic dispute—an unverified but persistent story that reinforced his notoriety.By the early 2000s, Rehman had consolidated control over large parts of Lyari’s illicit economy, including drug trafficking, extortion and gambling rackets. Yet, he also cultivated an image as a benefactor. Oral histories, media reporting and academic studies describe how he funded small clinics, madrassas, football tournaments, neighbourhood parks and schools, using criminal proceeds to build patronage. This dual identity—provider and predator—helped him secure legitimacy among segments of the local population who felt abandoned by the state.Rehman’s rise coincided with Lyari’s continued loyalty to the PPP. As political competition intensified in Karachi, PPP leaders increasingly saw strategic value in a local armed actor who could protect the party’s dominance and mobilise votes. Political alignment, according to multiple accounts, allowed Rehman to operate with greater impunity and helped formalise gang influence under a new name: the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC).Formed around 2008, the PAC presented itself as a community “peace” organisation but functioned as an institutionalised version of Rehman’s operations. It opened offices, appointed local commanders, mediated disputes, collected protection money and distributed welfare. In a context of chronic state neglect, many residents began to rely on the PAC as a parallel administration, making it one of the most powerful non-state authorities Karachi had ever seen.The roots of Lyari’s modern gang war lie in an older conflict shaped by ransom kidnappings, shifting alliances and internal betrayals. In the 1980s and 1990s, parts of Lyari’s criminal economy were dominated by a figure known as Haji Lalu, with another notorious operator, Dadal, working as one of his trusted aides. Disputes over ransom money extorted from wealthy businessmen gradually fractured this relationship. The split laid the foundation for two rival blocs: one centred on Lalu and his son, Arshad Pappu, and the other aligned with Dadal’s family, including his son, Rehman Dakait.The rivalry intensified through the 1990s. Dadal’s murder—widely believed to have been carried out by a competing gang—created a vacuum that Rehman moved to fill, initially with Lalu’s support. But a later dispute over a substantial ransom sum allegedly taken behind Rehman’s back marked the end of that partnership. The fallout turned the former allies into adversaries, cementing a bitter feud between Rehman’s camp and that of Haji Lalu and Arshad Pappu.A separate event subsequently brought an important new actor onto the scene: Uzair Jan Baloch, the son of a transport businessman, Faiz Muhammad, known locally as Mama Faizu. According to both police records and local accounts, Faizu was kidnapped and killed in 2003 by men linked to Arshad Pappu. Uzair initially attempted to seek justice through legal channels but reportedly faced threats and obstruction. Sharing a common enemy in Pappu, he turned instead toward his cousin, Rehman Dakait, joining his organisation.Over the following years, the Rehman–Uzair alliance fought a sustained war against the Pappu–Lalu network. What began as a dispute over illicit profits evolved into a violent cycle of killings, reprisals and territorial battles. By the mid-2000s, the feud had escalated into one of the deadliest urban conflicts in Karachi, with casualties running into the hundreds and paving the way for a new era of militarised gang politics.With the rise of Rehman Dakait and, later, Uzair Baloch, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) grew beyond a criminal network and evolved into a parallel governance structure in Lyari. Between roughly 2008 and 2013, researchers describe Lyari as effectively under PAC’s informal administration, with neighbourhood “commanders’’ exercising authority over small jurisdictions. These commanders managed disputes, issued permissions and collected funds in a manner that closely resembled state functions.These overlapping spheres blurred boundaries between state actors and non-state power. PAC offices routinely displayed both their own banners and PPP flags, while police operations in Lyari were often delayed, curtailed or influenced by political pressure. For a period, the PAC did not simply challenge state authority—it partially replaced it.Within Lyari, Rehman Dakait was widely viewed as being closely aligned with senior leaders of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP). Journalistic reporting and local accounts repeatedly describe him as someone who maintained proximity to the Bhutto leadership and attended major PPP political events.A popular narrative in Lyari claims that Rehman “saved” former prime minister Benazir Bhutto during the 18 October 2007 Karsaz attack in Karachi, when two explosions targeted her homecoming procession. In these accounts, Rehman is portrayed as part of an informal security circle that helped her escape following the blast. The story has fuelled his “protector” image and contributed to his Robin Hood-style mystique.However, despite the narrative’s frequency in oral history, there is no independent, verifiable evidence confirming that Rehman personally rescued Benazir or served as her driver or official security guard at any point. What is more clearly documented is the broader political relationship: Lyari’s gangs and the PPP operated in a framework of mutual benefit for years, with the party relying on armed control of the constituency and the gangs receiving political space to operate.After the PPP returned to power in 2008, Rehman publicly rebranded himself as Sardar Abdul Rehman Baloch, presenting the Peoples’ Aman Committee as a community organisation rather than a gang body. His growing political visibility, and reported sympathies with certain Baloch nationalist circles, are believed by some analysts and residents to have contributed to his killing in a controversial police “encounter” in 2009.As media scrutiny of Lyari intensified and gang violence spread to other parts of Karachi, state pressure began to mount. At the centre of this response was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, an officer in the Crime Investigation Department (CID) known for aggressive policing tactics. Aslam cultivated a reputation as an “encounter specialist,” targeting both militant groups and organised crime. His public stance against Lyari gangs put him in direct confrontation with Rehman Dakait, who by the mid-2000s had become one of the most influential figures in Karachi’s underworld.Law enforcement records and press reports from the period describe a tense cat-and-mouse dynamic between the two men. Rehman repeatedly evaded capture; in at least two documented incidents, he escaped custody after allegedly bribing police officers. According to local media accounts and later investigations, Rehman paid select CID and jail officials to secure temporary releases or avoid charges, a practice facilitated by weak internal oversight and political protection. These incidents contributed to Aslam’s personal resolve. Journalists covering Karachi’s crime beat recall that Aslam increasingly framed the pursuit of Rehman as a matter of professional and personal credibility for the police force.On 9 August 2009, police announced that Rehman had been killed in a shootout near Steel Town, on Karachi’s outskirts. Officials claimed that Rehman and three accomplices opened fire on police and were killed in retaliatory fire. However, from the outset, rights groups and local residents questioned the official account. Activists, lawyers and researchers later described the killing as a likely extrajudicial execution, consistent with a broader pattern of “encounters” used in Karachi to bypass a slow judicial system and fragile witness protections.With Rehman removed, the gang landscape did not stabilise. Instead, the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC), which he had informally led, underwent a leadership transition. Within weeks, Uzair Jan Baloch was positioned as Rehman’s successor, assuming both the criminal networks and the political connections tied to PPP support. Unlike Rehman, whose authority rested heavily on personality and charisma, Uzair’s tenure was marked by greater bureaucratisation—defined commanders, more formalised extortion systems and deeper conflict with the state. This period would set the stage for some of the bloodiest episodes of the Lyari gang war.After Rehman Dakait’s killing in 2009, leadership of the Lyari network did not pass smoothly to a single successor. Uzair Jan Baloch projected himself as the political head of the organisation: educated, relatively well-spoken, and comfortable appearing alongside PPP leaders. His image contrasted sharply with the operational commander Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla”, who had a reputation for ruthlessness built over years as an enforcer in neighbourhood turf battles.Initially, the two worked side by side under the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC) banner. But disagreements over extortion routes, neighbourhood control and access to political patrons gradually turned into open rivalry. Within Lyari, some commanders gravitated toward Uzair’s political authority and alleged links to provincial leadership; others aligned with Baba Ladla’s street power. This divide transformed PAC from a single entity into competing armed factions.The conflict reached its most infamous moment in March 2013, with the killing of rival gangster Arshad Pappu. According to court filings and media reporting, Pappu and his brother Yasir Arafat were abducted from Karachi’s Defence neighbourhood and taken to Lyari. Both were tortured, killed and later mutilated. Their remains were reportedly burned and dumped—widely interpreted as Uzair’s retaliation for the killing of his father, Faiz Muhammad. Some later accounts, including police dossiers and local testimonies, alleged that gang members kicked or played football with severed heads, turning the murders into a grim public spectacle that circulated in local narratives.By this stage, the greatest toll fell on ordinary residents. Prolonged firefights between splinter factions left neighbourhoods barricaded for days. Homes and small businesses were commandeered as torture rooms or lookout posts. Young men were coerced into gang recruitment, teachers and shopkeepers were forced to pay “taxes,” and ambulance workers trying to retrieve bodies were threatened by both sides. In response, the state increasingly turned to large-scale fires, sieges and heavy weaponry, culminating in the militarised crackdowns that would soon follow.In April–May 2012, the Sindh government initiated one of Karachi’s largest security actions against gang networks, later known as Operation Lyari. The police deployed thousands of personnel, armoured carriers and specialised units with the stated goal of clearing the area and arresting key commanders linked to the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). For the first time, a formal state crackdown directly targeted the network that had operated for years through political patronage and parallel governance.The operation, however, quickly encountered intense resistance. Armed groups used heavy weaponry, including rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), to attack the advancing police. Several armoured personnel carriers were damaged or destroyed, and police units struggled to push through Lyari’s dense alleyways, where snipers and lookout positions gave gang members a tactical advantage. After several days of fighting, rising casualties, and growing criticism from political circles, the operation stalled. It ended without major arrests and was widely perceived as a failure that exposed both the state’s limitations and PAC’s entrenched power.For residents, the consequences were immediate and severe. Lyari was effectively sealed off for about a week, with restricted movement in and out of the neighbourhood. Power and water supplies were disrupted, markets were shut, and families already living under economic strain faced shortages of food and basic essentials. Humanitarian groups and ambulance services reported being blocked or delayed from providing aid, amid police suspicions that relief efforts could serve as a cover to transport weapons or militants.The failed siege deepened mistrust between civilians, gangs and the state. Many residents had already endured years of coercive “taxes” and violence under PAC rule; the security operation then subjected them to collective punishment, indiscriminate fire and deprivation. Instead of restoring confidence, the crackdown reinforced the perception that both the state and the gangs were willing to sacrifice ordinary people to protect their own interests.Even as Lyari’s gang networks fought prolonged turf wars, Karachi was simultaneously becoming a logistical base for militant organisations, particularly factions of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). As security operations intensified in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt, militants sought anonymity in large urban centres. Pashtun-majority neighbourhoods such as Sohrab Goth, Manghopir and SITE became key sanctuaries and transit corridors where fighters, explosives and finances could be moved with relative ease.The turning point came on 8 June 2014, when ten militants launched an armed assault on Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, using automatic weapons, grenades and a rocket launcher. The attack triggered an overnight battle that left at least 36 people dead, including all ten assailants. The incident severely embarrassed federal authorities and exposed vulnerabilities in Karachi’s security infrastructure. The scale of the attack underscored that the city’s violence was no longer just about gangs—it was also linked to national insurgency networks.In the aftermath, the state expanded its response. The federal and provincial governments granted Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) extensive policing and detention powers to target both militants and criminal networks. These operations aligned with ongoing national counterinsurgency campaigns, including Operation Zarb-e-Azb and later Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, which aimed to dismantle militant networks and disrupt their finances and recruitment pipelines.In Karachi, this translated into a sustained, multi-year crackdown led by the Rangers. Tactical raids, mass arrests, prolonged detentions under special legal provisions and high-profile encounters became common features of urban policing. In Lyari, the result was a shrinking space for gangs to openly control territory. The Peoples’ Aman Committee and splinter factions still operated, but their public influence diminished as armed checkpoints, displays of heavy weaponry and enforced taxation became more difficult to sustain. Although pockets of violence persisted, the crackdown marked the beginning of the end of large, overt gang administrations in the city.One of the most high-profile casualties in the post-2014 security phase was SSP Chaudhry Aslam Khan, the police officer who had led major operations against both Lyari gangs and militant networks. On 9 January 2014, a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into Aslam’s convoy in Karachi, killing him and at least three others. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility, calling the attack revenge for police operations against its fighters and financiers. Aslam’s death was widely perceived as a serious setback to the city’s counter-terror and anti-gang efforts, though operations continued under other police officers and with greater reliance on Pakistan Rangers (Sindh).For Lyari’s armed groups, the most decisive blow came three years later. Acting on intelligence reports, Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) launched a pre-dawn raid on 2 February 2017 in Phool Patti Lane, Lyari, targeting Noor Muhammad, better known as “Baba Ladla.” According to Rangers’ statements, a gun battle lasting over 30 minutes ensued, during which gang members used automatic weapons and grenades. By the end of the raid, Rangers announced that Baba Ladla and two close associates had been killed.Listed for years among Pakistan’s “most wanted” criminals, Baba Ladla faced cases ranging from murder and extortion to armed attacks on police and suspected collaborations with extremist groups. His death effectively dismantled a key pillar of the Uzair-era structure, removing the most prominent operational commander who had challenged both rivals inside Lyari and the security forces sent to eliminate them.By the mid-2010s, as state pressure intensified and gang structures were fractured by successive operations, Uzair Jan Baloch left Pakistan. In December 2015, Interpol arrested him at Dubai International Airport, reportedly while he was travelling from Muscat. He was subsequently handed over to Pakistani authorities and brought back to Karachi.From 2016 onward, Uzair was charged in dozens of criminal cases, ranging from murder and attempted murder to extortion, kidnapping and terrorism. Many of these cases have since resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence, hostile witnesses or procedural weaknesses—a pattern that has long characterised Karachi’s organised crime trials, where intimidation makes witness testimony difficult.In April 2017, a new dimension emerged when the Pakistan Army took custody of Uzair to try him under military law. He was accused of espionage and leaking sensitive information to a foreign intelligence agency, reportedly linked to Iran. In April 2020, a military court sentenced him to 12 years in prison on espionage charges, marking a significant shift in how the state officially characterized him—not merely as a gang leader, but as a potential national security threat.Pakistani officials and segments of local media have occasionally linked Uzair’s alleged intelligence connections to the controversial case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, the Indian national sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in 2017. One strand of narrative suggests that Uzair’s alleged contacts in Iran overlapped with networks also linked to Jadhav. However, India has rejected Pakistan’s claims in the Jadhav case as coerced and unsubstantiated, and publicly verifiable evidence connecting Uzair directly to operational support for Jadhav remains limited.What is clearer is that, from the perspective of the Pakistani state, Uzair Baloch’s profile evolved from that of a gang leader embedded in local politics to an alleged cross-border security risk—reshaping the narrative around Lyari’s gangs and their significance.As violence worsened and Lyari began drawing national and even international scrutiny, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) gradually shifted its stance on the Peoples’ Aman Committee (PAC). Between 2012 and 2013, amid pressure from rival parties, security agencies and media coverage, the PPP formally disowned the PAC, despite years of visible proximity.Senior party leaders later framed PAC figures as rogue actors or products of state neglect, arguing that they were not part of a deliberate political strategy. Critics, however—including journalists, residents and some researchers—contend that the PPP benefitted for years from PAC’s armed control of Lyari, only distancing itself once the political and reputational costs became unsustainable.This distancing reflected a broader shift: as the state redefined Lyari’s gangs from political intermediaries to security liabilities, political actors recalibrated their alliances. What had once been an informal partnership built on patronage and vote control became a liability in the age of counterterrorism and international scrutiny.Security indicators suggest that overt gang violence in Lyari has dropped sharply since the mid-2010s. Rangers-led operations, the removal or incarceration of key gang leaders such as Rehman, Uzair and Baba Ladla, and broader counter-terror campaigns have reduced the frequency of armed clashes and targeted killings in the area.The legacy of the Lyari gang war remains unfinished. For many families, the years of kidnappings, torture, blockades and forced recruitment left deep social and economic scars. Questions continue to surround extrajudicial killings, disappearances and the conduct of both the gangs and state agencies tasked with fighting them. Although large armed networks have been dismantled, traces of informal control and low-level criminality persist in new forms.At the same time, Lyari’s cultural and political identity is evolving again. The football grounds, community schools and cultural centres that once defined the neighbourhood are re-emerging, even as residents remain wary of new power brokers. In popular culture, recent portrayals such as Dhurandhar and other planned projects reflect an enduring public fascination with Lyari—its blurred boundaries between criminal groups, political actors and state security agencies, and the unanswered questions they leave behind.Seen in retrospect, the gang war was not merely the story of violent figures in a marginalised settlement. It grew out of structural inequality, weak state institutions and a political party’s reliance on armed intermediaries to protect its vote bank. As militancy and regional intelligence rivalries later intersected with local crime networks, a neighbourhood built from labour and sport became entangled in national security narratives.Lyari today is quieter, but its past continues to shape how residents understand politics, policing and protection. The names of Rehman Dakait, Uzair Baloch, Baba Ladla and Arshad Pappu remain part of local memory—sometimes condemned as criminals, sometimes recalled as flawed protectors, always as evidence of how quickly a working-class community can become a battleground when crime, politics and security policy converge.","Karachi’s Lyari has long been associated with a dual identity. To its residents, it is the ‘mother of Karachi’ – powered by dockworkers, truck drivers, boxers and footballers. To the rest of Pakistan, especially through the 1990s and 2000s, it came to signify something very different: a “mini Brazil” of football- obsessed alleys, heavily armed gangs, and extortion rackets. It is this layered, contradictory Lyari that Aditya Dhar's recent 'Dhurandhar' turns into cinema.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125768364,imgsize-87724,width-400,resizemode-4/lyari-gang-war.jpg"

Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), state media reported on Wednesday.The loss-making airline is being privatised as part of a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program , which requires the federal government to reform or divest struggling state enterprises. A previous attempt to offload PIA last year was scrapped after the government failed to receive a sufficiently attractive offer.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with corporate entities and company representatives involved in the process, according to a press release shared by state broadcaster PTV News. “PIA’s bidding will take place on December 23, which will be broadcast live on all media. We are ensuring transparency and merit in the privatisation process,” the statement quoted him as saying.Sharif said the process was proceeding “smoothly” and argued that privatisation would help restore the airline’s “lost prestige,” align it with modern aviation requirements and facilitate the restoration of PIA’s global flight operations — a step he said was crucial for overseas Pakistanis.If completed, the transaction would mark Pakistan’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.Founded in October 1946, PIA is based at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, the country’s second-busiest airport and its largest city’s main aviation hub.","Pakistan will hold bidding on December 23 to sell its state-owned carrier, Pakistan International Airlines.

IMD Issues Red Alert as Cyclone Ditwah Approaches TN; Sri Lanka Deaths Exceed 80

Thousands trapped, isolated

Early warnings wasted

Rescue teams stretched 'beyond capacity'



Opposition blames government for loss of life



Too few alerts in Tamil language







Days after Cyclone Ditwah tore through Sri Lanka, over 1.46 million people across all 25 of the nation's districts remain affected by the island's worst flooding disaster in two decades.According to the government's Disaster Management Center, the official death toll stands at 410, with 336 people still missing. More than 64,000 people from 407,000 affected families are sheltering in nearly 1,450 government-run safety centers across the country.Multiple countries have responded to Sri Lanka's appeal for assistance with India leading the charge, followed by pledges from the UK, China, Australia, and Nepal. Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has also declared a state of emergency to deal with the aftermath of the cyclone.Despite his declaration and the promise of international aid, however, the Sri Lankan public seems increasingly frustrated with the state's response. Authorities appear to be overwhelmed with rescue demands and are struggling to communicate in a timely manner as critics point out the absence of a unified relief-and-rescue system.Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based Centre for Policy Alternatives, accuses the Sri Lankan government of failing to heed warning signals and allowing the calamity to spiral beyond human control.""The government has not come off well in its handling of the crisis and should have called Parliament to convene urgently to review and strengthen disaster management policies,"" Saravanamuttu told DW.According to Saravanamuttu, ""this disaster reveals significant gaps in preparedness and response mechanisms"" and the existing frameworks need to be evaluated to ""prevent future failures.""While Ditwah made landfall in Sri Lanka on November 28, some voices point out that warning signals were present as early as two weeks before. Experts say that the loss of life was exacerbated by the government's failure to act in a timely manner.""Unlike tsunamis, hydrometeorological hazards like cyclones arrive with sufficient notice of several days to take precautions. As early as November 12, Sri Lanka's department of meteorology had publicly flagged the prospect of extreme rainfall later in the month. That should have triggered a process of preparations across the government at central, provincial, and local levels,"" Nalaka Gunawardene, a science writer from Colombo, told DW.""Apparently, that did not happen, and an official response has mostly been reactive when Cyclone Ditwah was imminent or after it made landfall,"" added Gunawardene.""The entire disaster management structure – from policymakers to state officials – should be held accountable for cascading failures that made a bad disaster much worse.""Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena, a public interest advocate and legal columnist, agrees that the aftermath is ""particularly horrendous as the deadly impact of the cyclone was not realized until it was far too late.""She told DW that the governments should have ""the ability and the competence to take critical decisions"" in times of emergency.""Sentimental outpouring by politicians lauding the people for 'coming together' in times of crisis does not substitute for that duty,"" she added.Sivanathan Navindra, a former Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) member, who has been involved in political activities post-conflict, said the cyclone has damaged roads and communication lines in northern Sri Lanka.""The situation in northern Mannar, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, and Kilinochchi districts is extremely severe. Mullaitivu has experienced a total power outage with telecommunication towers down, leaving residents without phone or internet access,"" Navindra told DW from Jaffna.""Road closures have effectively cut off the northern province, with travel between Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi and Jaffna impossible,"" he said.Chathuranga Abeysinghe, deputy minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development, warned that rising water levels will make evacuation ""extremely difficult."" He urged residents along the Kelaniya River and flood-prone areas to leave.""There have been immense hardships caused by Cyclone Ditwah, but the president has constituted task forces to study the impact and organize relief. It will take a while for rebuilding,"" Abeysinghe told DW.""We had initial difficulty in predicting the cyclone's course"" Abeysinghe said, noting that significant rainfall expected was many different areas which ""stretched rescue teams beyond capacity to reach everyone in need.""Abeysinghe also pointed out that the government was working on a war-footing to reach vulnerable populations that had been cut off.Government critics, however, remain unconvinced by the official narrative. Opposition party Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) recently pledged to launch legal action against the government.SJB lawmaker and spokesperson S M Marikkar compared the severity of the disaster to the Easter Sunday suicide attacks which killed nearly 270 people in 2019, and the more recent economic collapse under the powerful Rajapaksa family.""Similar to the criminal case filed against the Rajapaksas for bankrupting the nation, we will file a case against the current government, as they are responsible for every citizen that died in the disaster,"" Marikkar told the media on Monday.Despite some relief materials being delivered and emergency teams arriving to certain affected locations, many communities still lack clarity on when full help will arrive and when normalcy can be restored. A notable communication obstacle, according to Colombo-based disinformation expert and analyst Sanjana Hattotuwa, is the choice of languages officials use for disaster communications.The nation recognizes both the majority language of Sinhala and the smaller Tamil language as official, with English — a remnant of the British colonial period — also spoken to varying degrees by nearly a quarter of its population.""My research showed key updates were in Sinhala only, and sometimes mirrored in English, but rarely, if ever in Tamil. State television and radio did not communicate the risks, and threats, mirroring what was evident on social media,"" Hattotuwa told DW.""This contributed to [an] information vacuum in critical hours, impacting preparedness and community responses,"" he said. ""If information was available in a more effective and timely manner, lives now lost may have been saved.""","Cyclone Ditwah has left over 1.46 million people in Sri Lanka affected by flooding. The official death toll stands at 410, with 336 people still missing. More than 64,000 people from 407,000 affected families are sheltering in nearly 1,450 government-run safety centers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125759053,imgsize-1689988,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
