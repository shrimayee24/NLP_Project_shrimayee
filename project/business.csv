PANAJI: At 5.22pm Thursday, as Lt Cdrs Dilna K and Roopa Alagirisamy stepped on Indian soil after a 239-day historic voyage, they became the first Indian duo to sail across the planet.""Yes. We made it."" These four words from Dilna summed up the poignant and emotional 25,400-nautical-mile journey that began Oct 2 from the banks of the Mandovi.""We saw the ocean and waves rising in anger some days. The waves were as high as 20 feet tall, looking like a wall. But we also had days when the sea was as calm as a mirror, and it felt heavenly, and time felt meaningless,"" said Roopa, narrating their audacious endeavour to fly the Tricolour and naval ensign ""in every sea and land across the world"".The circumnavigation took them through four oceans, crossing the equator twice and rounding the three great capes - a route acknowledged as the gold standard in ocean sailing. The mission was part of the Navy's broader initiative to showcase women's role in maritime operations. It also aimed to inspire a new generation of women to embrace adventure and take to the seas - a domain long dominated by men.""I feel I lived all my seven lives in these eight months.This is not going to be my last journey, I am sorry,"" said Roopa with a laugh, as she addressed her family.The voyage tested not just mental endurance but seamanship too. The naval officers navigated some of the world's most treacherous waters, including the South Pacific and the Southern Ocean. They battled towering waves, gale-force winds and long spells of isolation with only each other for company and their 56-foot yacht as their shelter.During the circumnavigation, the duo suffered a complete navigation blackout in the middle of the night in the Pacific Ocean. ""We lost GPS, boat heading, wind instrument, auto-pilot... everything. It took us three hours, but it felt like an eternity to get back the systems. This actually gave us a false sense of security in modern equipment,"" Roopa said.The duo covered 25,400 nautical miles over a period of eight months with port calls at Fremantle (Australia), Lyttleton (New Zealand), Port Stanley (Falkland Islands) and Cape Town (South Africa).Commander Abhilash Tomy (retd), the first Indian to sail around the Earth non-stop, provided mentorship to the duo. His survival and maintenance experience helped the duo master the critical skill of dual-handed sailing. Captain Vipul Mehershi, Captain Atul Sinha, and Commander Nikhil Hegde also played a key role in preparing the officers and the vessel for the expedition.The two naval officers' triumphant return at Mormugao Port was witnessed by defence minister Rajnath Singh and chief of naval staff Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi.","Lt Cdrs Dilna K and Roopa Alagirisamy became the first Indian duo to sail across the planet.

PUNE: In a first at National Defence Academy, a girl Army cadet has topped the arts stream. ""Striking a balance between military training and academics was a tough challenge for me, but I managed to maintain that balance from the first term to the last. This dedication helped me excel academically,"" Shriti Daksh told TOI.Shriti, who secured 95% and 98% in her Class X and XII board exams respectively, opted for the squadron (Hunter) of her father, Wing Commander (retd) Yogesh Kumar Daksh.Yogesh, a helicopter pilot with a private airline, said with tears in his eyes, ""When she told me she would join my squadron, I felt very proud. But at the same time, I reminded her of the rich history and tradition of our squadron, where physical training is rigorous. But she overcame all the challenges and earned more laurels than I did. I'm extremely proud of her.""Recalling her preparations before joining NDA, he said, ""I took her to a garden in Noida and told her to run a few rounds. But her physical fitness was not up to par. Within a few weeks, she improved.""The chief guest at the convocation of the 148th course of NDA and vice-chancellor of Gorakhpur-based Deen Dayal Upadhyay University, Poonam Tandon, said on Thursday that the passing-out girl cadets were the torchbearers of change, courage and capability, and their example would inspire generations to come.""Girls, your achievement today is not just your own.

He is the fourth-generation Army officer in his family.""My grandfather and father both commanded the infantry battalion 3/3 Gorkha Rifles. Initially, when I joined the academy, I was a bit sceptical about completing three years of training.

ITR filing FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26): Deadline to file income tax returns extended from July 31,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2025-26-deadline-to-file-income-tax-returns-extended-from-july-31-check-new-date/articleshow/121438210.cms,"ITR Filing 2024-25: 10 Key Updates You Need To Know Before Filing Income Tax Return

Advantage taxpayers

New ITR Forms FY 2024-25

New ITR Filing Deadline FY 2024-25: In a major relief to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025.The extension comes amid significant revisions in ITR forms, ongoing system development, and the need for accurate reflection of TDS credits.""CBDT has decided to extend the due date of filing of ITRs, which are due for filing by 31st July 2025, to 15th September 2025 This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections. This ensures a smoother and more accurate filing experience for everyone. Formal notification will follow."" Income Tax Department, Government of India posted on X.According to CBDT, the notified ITRS for AY 2025-26 have undergone structural and content revisions aimed at simplifying compliance, enhancing transparency, and enabling accurate reporting. These changes have necessitated additional time for system development, integration, and testing of the corresponding utilities.Furthermore, credits arising from TDS statements, due for filing by 31st May 2025, are expected to begin reflecting in early June, limiting the effective window for return filing in the absence of such extension.""In view of the extensive changes introduced in the notified ITRs and considering the time required for system readiness and rollout of Income Tax Return (ITR) utilities for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has decided to extend the due date for filing returns. Accordingly, to facilitate a smooth and convenient filing experience for taxpayers, it has been decided that the due date for filing of ITRS, originally due on 31st July 2025, is extended to 15th September 2025. "" CBDT release stated.A formal notification reflecting the new deadline will be issued separately, said V. Rajitha, Commissioner of Income Tax (Media & Technical Policy) and Official Spokesperson for CBDT.""This extension is expected to mitigate the concerns raised by stakeholders and provide adequate time for compliance, thereby ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the return filing process."" CBDT added.Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India tells TOI, “Changes in the tax law in the past year and additional disclosure as well as other updates to the tax return form for Financial Year (FY) 2024-25 have necessitated additional time for updating the technology for the tax department. This will entail revising the tax filing utility on the income tax portal as well. Hence, extending the deadline to file the income tax returns for FY 24-25 by almost one and a half months from 31 July 2025 to 15 September 2025 is in line with the expectations. This extension aims to enhance the taxpayer experience by providing requisite time to file returns once the TDS credits are appropriately reflecting in taxpayers Form 26AS and AIS/ TIS following the submission of TDS statements by employers/ deductors of TDS due by May 31, 2025.“Nonetheless, it is in the taxpayers' best interest to file their returns as soon as the filing utility is made available to avoid additional interest costs where tax payments are due or to allow department time to process the returns at the earliest where refunds are due,” she adds.Sonu Iyer, Partner and National Leader, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India explains, “The ITR forms notified for the FY 2024-25 (AY 2025-26) incorporate the amendments introduced by the Finance Act 2024 and have enhanced reporting requirements relating to deductions being claimed, requirement to report TDS section codes, provide the bifurcation of capital gains for pre and post 23 July 2024, etc. If you recall, Finance Act 2024 has rationalized capital gains taxation on specific transactions on or after 23 July 2024. ”“Given the requirements of these new ITR forms, the e-filing utility (both online and offline) needs to be updated by the Government. Therefore, it is a very welcome move from the government to extend the ITR filing deadline from 31 July 2025 to 15 Sep 2025, allowing taxpayers the time required to comply with these enhanced reporting requirements and legislative changes,” she adds.As per CA Ashish Niraj, Partner at A S N & Company, Chartered Accountants: “This extension was very much awaited by Income Tax professionals and taxpayers, as the Income Tax portal had not yet enabled the filing of ITRs on its portal till May 27, 2025. Normally, July 31 is due date for the category of taxpayers whose accounts are not required to be audited. As the due date was approaching, professionals and taxpayers were tense about how they would prepare and file returns in such a short span of time once the portal allowed ITR filing. There were issues in fetching proper AIS data and TDS data in some cases. All these are required to be reconciled to file error-free returns. Even AIS is not getting fetched properly in many cases. Now that the ITR due date has been extended, taxpayers will get enough time to prepare returns, compare with AIS, 26AS, etc., to avoid mismatches and file them accurately. It’s really a welcome decision.”Meanwhile, the Income Tax Department has notified all seven ITR forms for AY 2025–26, incorporating structural updates and simplifications. ITR-1 (Sahaj) is meant for resident individuals with income up to Rs 50 lakh from salary, one house property, other sources (like interest), and agricultural income up to Rs 5,000. A key update now allows salaried individuals to report long-term capital gains (LTCG) up to Rs 1.25 lakh under ITR-1, which was earlier not permitted.ITR-2 applies to individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession but have income from capital gains. A new requirement mandates reporting capital gains separately based on whether they arose before or after July 23, 2024, due to changes in LTCG tax treatment introduced in the 2024 Union Budget.ITR-3 is for individuals and HUFs with income from business or profession. It now features an increased reporting threshold under Schedule AL (Assets and Liabilities)—from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore—reducing compliance for middle-income taxpayers.ITR-4 (Sugam) is designed for individuals, HUFs, and firms (excluding LLPs) with total income up to Rs 50 lakh who opt for presumptive taxation under sections 44AD, 44ADA, or 44AE. It too now permits reporting of LTCG up to Rs 1.25 lakh, providing relief to small taxpayers with limited capital gains.ITR-5 is meant for firms, LLPs, AOPs, BOIs, and co-operative societies, while ITR-6 is applicable to companies, excluding those claiming exemption under section 11. Both these forms include changes in the capital gains schedule in line with the revised tax rules post-July 2024.Lastly, ITR-7 is for trusts and charitable institutions required to file returns under sections 139(4A), 139(4B), 139(4C), and 139(4D).","The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has extended the deadline for filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) for the assessment year 2025–26. Returns originally due by July 31, 2025, can now be filed until September 15, 2025. This extension will provide more time due to significant revisions in ITR forms, system development needs, and TDS credit reflections.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121438242,imgsize-1565741,width-400,resizemode-4/121438242.jpg"

Poll Which factor is more important for strengthening national defense? Advanced missile systems Strong strategic partnerships

NEW DELHI: The S-400 system and the jointly-manufactured BrahMos missiles were used by India in the conflict with Pakistan and their performance was exemplary, said Russian ambassador Denis Alipov. The ambassador also said that discussions between India and Russia on the procurement of more S-400 air defence system units are ""ongoing"" as both countries continue to solidify the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership.""From what we know, India has clearly stated the goals and undertook actions after having identified the targets and the terrorists it promised to do. As far as we know, during the operation, the S-400 system was used and the BrahMos missiles were engaged. Judging by the reports available, the performance of these weapons was exemplary,"" Alipov told IANS news agency.The S-400 was credited with the shooting down of Pakistan drones and missiles during the conflict that followed India's Operation Sindoor that targeted terrorist camps in Pakistan. While India maintained that it had only hit terrorist camps and its actions on May 7 were non-escalatory, Pakistan chose to launch a military operation against India three days later that was rebuffed by Indian armed forces.India has longstanding and wide-ranging cooperation with Russia in the field of defence. India and Russia have been involved in several bilateral projects, including the supply of S-400, licenced production of T-90 tanks and Su-30 MKI, supply of MiG-29 and Kamov helicopters, INS Vikramaditya (formerly Admiral Gorshkov), production of Ak-203 rifles in India and BrahMos missiles.Sources indicate that considering the strategic planning and military preparedness, New Delhi may procure more S-400 air defence systems soon. ""Our discussion, on this particular topic, as on many others, is ongoing. It is a continuous one, but it would be incorrect for me and also premature to speak about the results,"" confirmed Alipov.He mentioned that Moscow is also ""very satisfied"" with the 'Made in India' BrahMos missiles, a product of joint collaboration with Russia.""We have a joint venture, designing and producing these weapons. We are very satisfied with the results of this collaboration. It has very promising prospects.

Pak To Get 'Chinese Version' Of U.S. THAAD Air Defence System? HQ-19 Shield Explained

NEW DELHI: Under Operation Sindoor , India did not just win a military conflict with Pakistan but also scored a victory over China in the technological domain as Pakistan essentially fought as a Chinese proxy by relying heavily on Chinese platforms, according to military expert John Spencer.“Operation Sindoor pitted India’s indigenously developed weapons systems against Chinese-supplied platforms fielded by Pakistan. What unfolded was not just retaliation but the strategic debut of a sovereign arsenal built under the twin doctrines of Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat (the two key programmes of the Modi govt that lay emphasis on self-reliance in the defence sector),” Spencer, a retired US army officer who is currently the chair of urban warfare studies at the Modern War Institute, wrote on X.“India fought as a sovereign power—wielding precision tools it designed, built and deployed with unmatched battlefield control. Pakistan fought as a proxy force, dependent on Chinese hardware that was built for export, not for excellence. When challenged, these systems failed — exposing the strategic hollowness behind Islamabad’s defence posture,” he said.The ‘Made-in-India’ BrahMos supersonic cruise missile with Russian collaboration, totally indigenous Akash surface to air missile and Akashteer missile defence system, Rudram anti-radiation missile, Netra airborne early warning and control (AEW&C), loitering munitions (SkyStriker, Harop) and D4S counter-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, an indigenous multi-layer drone defence system integrating radar, radio frequency jammers, sensors and kinetic kill options had an upper hand over several Pakistan-owned but Chinese-built HQ-9/ HQ-16 SAM Systems, LY-80 & FM-90 air defence systems and CH-4 drones (China), Spencer elaborated.India’s thrust for self-reliance in defence weaponry began as part of PM Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ initiative, he said.“The goal was clear: reduce dependence on foreign arms imports and build a world-class domestic defence industry. The policy incentivised joint ventures, opened defence to foreign direct investment up to 74%, and encouraged both public and private sector manufacturers to build sophisticated military hardware at home. Within a few years, systems like the BrahMos missile , K9 Vajra howitzer, and AK-203 rifle were being produced inside India—many with technology partnerships but increasing domestic control,” Spencer said.However, in 2020, the combined shock of the Covid-19 pandemic and Galwan Valley clash with China exposed the fragility of foreign supply chains and the urgency of operational self-reliance, he said. “India imposed phased bans on key defence imports, gave the armed forces emergency procurement powers, and poured investment into indigenous research, design and production. By 2025, India had increased domestic content in defence procurement from 30% to 65%, with a goal of 90% by the decade’s end,” the military expert said in his post.India’s T-72 main battle tanks and advanced fighter jets Russian-origin Su-30MKIs and French-built Rafales provided firepower and flexibility, launching multiple strike packages on Pakistan and ensuring airspace control.“India fought as a sovereign power—wielding precision tools it designed, built, and deployed with unmatched battlefield control. Pakistan fought as a proxy force, dependent on Chinese hardware that was built for export, not for excellence.

The evaluation of annual performance appraisal report of past five years of personnel must be at least 'good' and without any major punishment.Also, integrity of personnel must be beyond doubt, with departmental inquiry and vigilance approval being mandatory.The honorary rank shall be granted based on recommendation of the commanding officer, and conferred on the day of retirement. No financial or pension benefits will be admissible along with the honorary rank, which will only be granted where the rank to be conferred exists within the category to which the personnel belong.

NEW DELHI: India has redesigned and redefined its strategy and response to terrorism emanating from Pakistan and if talks do take place with Islamabad in the future, they will only be on terrorism and Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Thursday in what appeared a repudiation of Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif's suggestion that the two countries should engage in comprehensive dialogue that covers all their disputes.POK was an integral part of India and its people, who got geographically and politically separated, and would sooner or later voluntarily return to India ""listening to the voice of their souls and self-respect"", Singh said, addressing the annual CII business summit here.Echoing Singh, the external affairs ministry later in the day said any dialogue with Islamabad will have to be focused on the return of POK and also wanted terrorists to India. The ministry also said any engagement between the two countries would be strictly bilateral.""We want to reiterate that terrorism and dialogue cannot go hand in hand. And as far as the issue of terrorism is concerned, any discussion with Pakistan will focus on the list of terrorists we had provided them some years ago - they should hand them over to us,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.""Regarding J&K, any bilateral talks will only be about one thing - when will Pakistan vacate POK, which it has been holding illegally and unlawfully,"" he added.Singh earlier warned Pakistan that India could have inflicted much more damage between May 7 and 10 during Operation Sindoor, with 'Made in India' weapons having the power to ""penetrate any armour of the enemy"", but exercised restraint as a responsible country.Stressing that 'Make in India' was an essential component of national security, he said the country's home-grown weapons systems surprised the entire world by playing a key role in Operation Sindoor.","India has redesigned and redefined its strategy and response to terrorism emanating from Pakistan.

New Delhi: Supreme Court Thursday refused to entertain a doctor's plea seeking suspension of the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to him after being convicted under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso) for raping his seven-year-old daughter.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Satish Chandra Sharma said he was not entitled to bail, considering the kind of things he did to his daughter.The convict's lawyer contended that he was framed because of differences with his wife, and that she tutored the child to testify against him. His wife is also a doctor but despite that the medical examination of his daughter was delayed by three months and no injury marks were found on her body, the advocate said.The bench, however, said there was no reason to disbelieve the child's statement and she also withstood the cross-examination.

Vince McMahon’s net worth in 2025

Vince McMahon’s source of income



Vince McMahon’s life after WWE



Also Read

Vince McMahon, the former CEO of WWE and executive chairman of TKO, is one of the celebrated figures of WWE. The former chief of the Stamford-based promotion served as a promoter, commentator, film producer, and sometimes even stepped into the ring himself.McMahon's journey with WWE began as a commentator during the 1970s. He has immensely contributed to American professional wrestling and made WWE a popular household name.Though McMahon has been one of the celebrated figures of the company, he has landed himself in many controversies, too, including Janel Grant's lawsuit, where he was accused of sexual misconduct, including a coerced sexual relationship, sex trafficking, and repeated sexual assault.Let’s take a look at his WWE journey so far, his net worth, source of income, and more.According to Forbes, Vince McMahon's net worth in 2025 is estimated at $3 billion. It is believed that the former WWE Chief has amassed such a fortune due to McMahon unloading a lot of stock in recent years. He mainly earns from his TKO Holdings and also owns his independent entertainment company, Alpha Entertainment. Courtesy to his huge wealth, Vince enjoys an equally luxurious lifestyle, with his lavish mansions and noteworthy car collections.Reports suggest that Vince McMahon has more than $670 million worth of TKO Holdings shares in 2023. It is to be noted that TKO Holdings is the new brand name for the combined WWE and Ultimate Fighting Championship. In March 2024, he again sold off a slew of TKO shares for $412 million.Not long after, in early April 2024, he sold off $311 million worth of stock, followed by the final sale later that same month through which he earned $776 million for his last remaining TKO shares, meaning McMahon is no longer officially associated with the WWE.However, some rumors suggest that Vince McMahon might be currently earning from the shares of WWE and the TKO group that he may still be holding. Vince McMahon ’s life after WWE became tumultuous. His career ended after allegations of sexual misconduct and infidelity surfaced. He reportedly used nearly $19.6 million in company funds for settlements to suppress these claims.The latest complaint has come from Janel Grant , who has filed a complaint against McMahon of 'physical and emotional abuse, sexual assault, and trafficking.Janel Grant has filed a lawsuit against WWE and John Laurinaitis. Though Laurinaitis has been removed in the new filing submitted on May 28, 2025, Vince McMahon remains a defendant. Meanwhile, his former co-defendant has agreed to provide substantial evidence to Grant’s legal team, related to the case.With this development, it will now be interesting to witness where this case takes McMahon further, after Laurinaitis provides evidence as part of the confidential settlement.","Vince McMahon, the former CEO of WWE and executive chairman of TKO, is one of the celebrated figures of WWE.

Michael Jordan’s reported $40 million NBC salary debunked,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/michael-jordans-reported-40-million-nbc-salary-debunked/articleshow/121346918.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Michael Jordan’s new NBC role and What’s has been confirmed so far

When Michael Jordan declared his return to the NBA scene —not as a player, but as a special contributor for NBC’s upcoming NBA coverage — rumors began to swirl. The most outrageous? That NBC had enticed the Chicago Bulls legend back with an unbelievable $40 million per year deal, making him the highest-paid sports analyst ever. But is that figure correct? Let’s distinguish fact from fiction.NBC revealed on May 12, 2025, that Michael Jordan will be part of its NBA broadcast team as a special contributor when the network gets back the NBA broadcasting rights for the 2025–26 season through an 11-year, $76 billion agreement. Jordan shared his enthusiasm, saying, “I am so excited to see the NBA back on NBC.”Another thing to note is that the specifics of Jordan's position are not entirely clear. Reports suggest that his main contributions will be pre-recorded segments shown during pregame and halftime, rather than live commentary. This limited role has sparked questions about the legitimacy of the reported $40 million annual pay.If the $40 million number is right, it would beat Tom Brady’s $37.5 million yearly deal with Fox Sports, making Jordan the highest-paid sports analyst ever. But, neither NBC nor Jordan’s team has verified this figure.Considering Jordan’s small role and his lack of experience in broadcasting, experts in the industry are doubtful about how accurate this number really is.Additionally, with Jordan's impressive net worth—around $3.5 billion, thanks to his thriving partnership with Nike's Air Jordan brand and various other business endeavors—the financial aspect might not be the main reason he's coming back to the NBA limelight.It looks like NBC is using Jordan to attract old fans and grow their audience for NBA games. Since he spent a large part of his playing career with NBC, watching the network replay all six of his Chicago Bulls titles feels nostalgic for fans who have followed him closely.Even though the precise information regarding Jordan's role and salary is not public, his engagement is likely to improve NBC's NBA coverage, which will also showcase notable figures like Mike Tirico, Noah Eagle, Jamal Crawford, Reggie Miller, and Carmelo Anthony.Michael Jordan's return to the NBA as a special contributor for NBC has created a lot of excitement. However, the claim that he's making $40 million a year hasn't been verified and seems a bit off considering his expected role.Also Read: LeBron James and Luka Doncic could get the center they desperately need and Celtics fans won’t like it While fans are eager to see his contributions to the broadcasts, the actual details of his contract are still a bit of a mystery. Right now, Jordan's return is a symbol of the link between the NBA's legendary past and its lively future, reigniting passion among basketball lovers.","Michael Jordan's return to the NBA as a special contributor for NBC has created a lot of excitement.

US-China tech tensions 'escalate'



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly praised President Donald Trump while sharply criticising the Biden administration ’s export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, calling the policy 'a failure' that cost US companies billions. Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang blasts Biden-era AI chip export policy.

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has said that he is not impressed with the design choices of Tesla. Speaking at ""Your Mom's House"" podcast in March, he was asked ‘what's your favorite car?’. Cuban, who owns a Tesla replied with a grin “A Kia. EV6.” He further added “I like it. I'm comfortable with it.”Revealing that he hasn’t sold his Tesla ‘yet’, Mark Cuban explained: “On the Tesla you've got to find [the turn signal] and push the button… while you're driving. You can't pay attention to the road as much.”Praising Kia, he said: “It doesn't try to be too fancy. Your turn signal is like… a turn signal”.While Mark Cuban doesn’t mind driving a ‘cheaper’ Kia EV6, but his 15-year-old son isn’t impressed. When Cuban suggested handing down the car for driving practice, his son quickly shut it down, saying, “It’s not cool, Dad.” He even called it a “nerd car.” Cuban’s response? “Exactly,” he said, embracing the label.Mark Cuban is a known Elon Musk critic. Earlier this year on the ""Club Shay Shay"" podcast, Cuban admitted that he likes provoking Musk because he has ""really thin skin and it just makes it easy.""In another interview earlier this year, Cuban said “I have no problem throwing Elon under the bus, but I'll save it for when it's truly deserved.”Last year, when Musk encouraged users to share more positive content on X, Cuban wasted no time in delivering a sharp retort. “Please post a bit more positive, beautiful or informative content on this platform,” the Tesla CEO then wrote. Cuban commented “You first”.In a latest update, Musk has announced his exit from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In an X post, he wrote: “As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”","Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has said that he is not impressed with the design choices of Tesla.

CHENNAI: Around 180 passengers aboard an Air India flight from Singapore had a narrow escape on Wednesday morning after pilots were forced to abort landing at Chennai airport due to an unstable approach and crosswinds.The flight, which was scheduled to land at 10:15 am, descended to as low as 200 feet before the pilots initiated a go-around. It eventually landed safely on the second attempt after circling the airport, resulting in a delay of nearly 30 minutes.Airport Authority of India (AAI) officials confirmed the aborted landing, citing an ""unstabilised approach"" at the St Thomas Mount end of the runway. “A safe landing requires a controlled descent rate, correct speed, and alignment. In this case, the descent was too steep, and there was a sudden shift in wind speed,” a source familiar with the matter said.The incident raised fresh concerns over recent landing-related events at Chennai airport.In October last year, an Indigo flight from Jaipur had to make a touch-and-go due to similar issues, while in March this year, a Mumbai-Chennai flight suffered tail damage during touchdown.",Around 180 passengers aboard an Air India flight from Singapore had a narrow escape on Wednesday morning.

Meta AI shareholder meet

Meta’s artificial intelligence assistant – Meta AI now boasts one billion monthly active users across its family of apps, CEO Mark Zuckerberg . Speaking during the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Zuckerberg said “It may seem kind of funny that a billion monthly actives doesn’t seem like it’s at scale for us, but that’s where we’re at”. The milestone follows the April release of a stand-alone Meta AI app , signaling the company’s growing ambitions in the artificial intelligence space. Zuckerberg said the company plans to expand the product further before monetizing it.As Meta AI evolves, “there will be opportunities to either insert paid recommendations” or offer “a subscription service so that people can pay to use more compute,” he said.The social media giant introduced Meta AI app on April 29, giving users a direct path to its Gen AI models.During the shareholder meet, the CEO emphasized that the company’s “focus for this year is deepening the experience and making Meta AI the leading personal AI with an emphasis on personalization, voice conversations and entertainment.”According to a CNBC report, the shareholder meeting also saw votes on 14 items, including nine shareholder proposals covering issues such as child safety, greenhouse gas emissions, and a bitcoin treasury assessment.One notable proposal, submitted by JLens—an affiliate of the Anti-Defamation League—called for Meta to produce an annual report addressing hate content, including antisemitism, following recent policy changes that relaxed moderation guidelines.Preliminary results indicated that proposals not backed by Meta’s board, including one aimed at ending the dual-class share structure that gives Zuckerberg outsized voting power, were unlikely to pass. In contrast, board-supported items, such as approving board nominees and an equity incentive plan, appeared poised for approval.Meta said final voting results would be posted within four business days on its website and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.In a related news, the company reorganised its artificial intelligence (AI) teams to expedite the development and deployment of new products and features. According to a report by Axios, Cox said in an internal memo on Tuesday (May 27) detailed the new organizational framework. As per the memo, there will be two distinct units: an AI Products team and an AGI Foundations unit. While Connor Hayes will lead the AI Products team, the AGI Foundations unit will be co-led by Ahmad Al-Dahle and Amir Frenkel.This internal restructuring, announced in a memo by chief product officer Chris Cox, aims to enhance the company's competitiveness in the evolving AI space, where it faces significant rivalry from entities like ChatGPt-maker OpenAI, Google and Microsoft.","Meta AI now boasts one billion monthly active users across its family of apps.

India’s biggest brain drain isn’t to Silicon Valley. It’s to the scroll.

Yes, I believe the next wave of global entrepreneurs will come from India

I have put my money on it

But we’re ALSO building the largest army of thumb warriors - overstimulated, under-inspired people, who're weirdly okay with it.

A billion screens.

A billion brains.

And what do most do with them?

Watch prank videos, swipe choreographed dances, and overdose on AI-generated “wisdom” like it’s roti-sabzi.

We didn’t evolve with media like the West did.

Radio → TV → Cable → Internet

We leapfrogged straight to Reels. And then fell right in

Even my 7-year-old starts with Peppa Pig and ends up in a vortex of glitchy animation and algorithmic chaos.

TikTok, Insta & YT did their job — they captured attention and monetized it.

But what did we lose in the process?

Teens that don’t talk.

Adults that don’t think - just scroll.

With AI, the stimulation will only intensify.

Opportunity?

Dystopia? Also

Feels like a ‘Black Mirror’ episode no one signed up for

This isn’t a call to delete Social apps. It’s not even a solution.

It’s a rant from a concerned father.

And maybe, a conversation about our children.

Curious to hear from other parents, professionals, educators, and entrepreneurs

What are you doing about this?

And how do we make sure the India we’re building doesn’t forget to look up?

Shark Tank India judge Anupam Mittal recently started a debate on social media addiction . In a long LinkedIn post, Mittal said that India’s biggest brain drain isn’t talent leaving for Silicon Valley, but rather millions of minds lost to mindless scrolling. Mittal also expressed his concern over the digital consumption habits of Indians.

President Donald Trump seems quite not-so-happy with Apple's decision to make in India. The US President Donald Trump announced that Apple can build factories in India but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the US if manufactured overseas. Speaking in the White House Oval Office during the signing of executive orders on nuclear energy, Trump referenced a discussion with Apple CEO Tim Cook , stating, ""I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn’t be doing this. He said he’s going to India to build plants. I said, ‘That’s okay, but you’re not going to sell into here without tariffs.’""Trump stressed, ""We’re talking about the iPhone. If they’re going to sell it in America, I want it to be built in the United States."" Initially singling out Apple, he later broadened the tariff threat to include all smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung and Huawei, saying, ""It would be anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair."" The tariffs are slated to take effect by the end of June 2025.Earlier in a social media post on the same day, Trump doubled down, writing, ""I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple to the US. American jobs come first!""During a recent trip to Doha, Trump had pressed Cook to focus on US manufacturing , noting India’s high tariffs make it a difficult market for US companies. He added, ""They’ve offered us a deal where they’re willing to charge us no tariff, but I told Tim, ‘I don’t want you building in India. Build here.’"" The US President highlighted that India’s tariff policies, among the highest globally, complicate market access, but he emphasised on prioritizing domestic production.Apple CEO Tim Cook, addressing tariffs during Apple’s Q2 2025 earnings call, noted that they are determined by the product’s manufacturing location. Industry experts caution that relocating iPhone production to the US would sharply increase costs due to higher labor and operational expenses. If Apple passes these costs to consumers to maintain profit margins, iPhone prices could soar to $3,000 or more, potentially impacting demand. Analysts also point out that building a US-based supply chain would require significant investment and time, given the complex global network Apple currently relies on, primarily in Asia.The policy has sparked debate, with some economists warning that tariffs could raise consumer prices and disrupt global trade, while supporters argue it could boost US manufacturing jobs. The White House has not yet clarified how the tariffs will be implemented or whether exemptions might apply for companies investing in US facilities.In a related news, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly declined offer to join tech exectuives and representatives at Trump's recent trip to the Middle East. The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump, said a New York Times report.","President Donald Trump seems quite not-so-happy with Apple's decision to make in India.

Amazon confirms hiring Xbox co-creator J Allard to lead new product invention team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-confirms-hiring-xbox-co-creator-j-allard-to-lead-new-product-invention-team/articleshow/121505560.cms,"What are the major achievements of Xbox co-creator J Allard



What is Amazon’s ZeroOne team and what it is working on



“conceiving, designing, and bringing to market computer vision techniques for a new smart-home product,”

“You’ll be part of a team that embraces design thinking, rapid experimentation, and building to learn. If you’re excited about working in small, nimble teams to create entirely new product categories and thrive in the ambiguity of breakthrough innovation, we want to talk to you.”

Amazon's devices unit has established a new team, named ZeroOne, which is tasked with inventing “breakthrough” consumer products, a report claims. This new team is reportedly being led by J Allard, a former Microsoft executive who contributed to the creation of the Xbox. The ZeroOne team, which is said to be focused on both hardware and software projects, aims to develop product ideas from conception to launch – a ""zero to one"" mission, as its name suggests. The team operates across Seattle, San Francisco, and Sunnyvale, California, according to recent job postings. An Amazon spokesperson has confirmed to CNBC that Allard is overseeing the ZeroOne team but didn't provide further details about the group's specific projects. Allard's LinkedIn profile also shows that he's working as the VP of the ZeroOne team since September 2024.Allard, who worked at Microsoft for 19 years and previously served as its technology chief of consumer products before departing in 2010, was an architect of the Xbox game console.He also worked on the Zune, Microsoft's portable media player. Allard joined Amazon in September and reports to Panos Panay, who also moved from Microsoft to Amazon in 2023 to head the devices and services group.As per the CNBC report, job postings for Amazon’s ZeroOne unit revealed limited specifics about the team’s projects. One of the listings mentions involvement inthe report noted.The description of ther job posting (as seen by CNBC) says:According to LinkedIn profiles of ZeroOne employees, Amazon has brought in personnel from other divisions with backgrounds in developing technologies such as the Alexa voice assistant, Luna cloud gaming service, and Halo sleep tracker. The group is also being led in part by the former head of Lightform, a projection mapping startup acquired by Amazon.As Amazon expands certain parts of its devices division, such as the ZeroOne project, it is simultaneously scaling back others. Earlier this month, the company laid off around 100 employees across its devices and services group, affecting teams working on Alexa, Amazon Kids, and its hardware R&D arm, Lab126.More than 50 of those job cuts were at Lab126’s Sunnyvale facilities, according to WARN filings. While Lab126 has been behind major successes like the Kindle and Echo, it has also produced flops such as the Fire Phone and Halo tracker. Amazon noted that the layoffs impacted only a small fraction of its devices and services workforce, which numbers in the tens of thousands.","Amazon's devices unit has established a new team, named ZeroOne, which is tasked with inventing “breakthrough” consumer products.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Election Results 2025: Why AAP Lost,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-election-results-2025-aap-lost-reasons-arvind-kejriwal-new-delhi-manish-sisodia-bjp-modi-incumbency-corruptio-sheesh-mahal-liquor-freebies-congress-rahul/articleshow/118023276.cms,"Here are 10 reasons behind AAP's defeat:



Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Referring to the Indus Water Treaty (IWT), Pakistan Army chief, General Asim Munir, on Thursday described it as a ""red line"" for his country and declared that Islamabad would ""never compromise"" on the water issue.Munir made the remarks while talking to vice-chancellors of different universities, principals, and senior teachers and educators, according to the army.“Water is Pakistan's red line, and we will not allow any compromise on this basic right of 240 million (24 crore) Pakistanis,” he said, speaking about India's move to keep the IWT in abeyance following last month's Pahalgam terrorist attack.Pakistani leaders have repeatedly threatened India over New Delhi's suspension of the Indus treaty. Signed in September 1960, the agreement stands suspended for the first time.Tensions between the two rivals soared after the April 22 attack, in which Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 men in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam. The victims included 25 tourists and a local.India carried out precision strikes as part of Operation Sindoor on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in the early hours of May 7.It was followed by Pakistan’s attempt to attack Indian military bases on May 8, 9, and 10. The Indian side responded strongly to the Pakistani actions.The on-ground hostilities ended on May 10 with an understanding of stopping the military actions after Pakistan's director general of military operations (DGMO) contacted his Indian counterpart urging cessation of hostilities.","General Asim Munir made the remarks while talking to vice-chancellors of different universities, principals, and senior teachers and educators. “Water is Pakistan's red line, and we will not allow any compromise on this basic right of 240 million (24 crore) Pakistanis,"" he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121502065,imgsize-22724,width-400,resizemode-4/121502065.jpg"
