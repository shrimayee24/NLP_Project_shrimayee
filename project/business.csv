‘Slavery Destroys Heritage’: PM Modi’s Big Message After Unveiling Sacred Buddha Piprahwa Relics

NEW DELHI: Calling India not only the custodian of Lord Buddha’s sacred relics but also the living carrier of his tradition, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated a first-of-itskind international exposition of the Buddha’s Piprahwa relics, reliquaries and gem relics that were recently repatriated to India.Noting that the the departure from India and eventual return of the sacred relics of Buddha are both significant lessons in themselves, PM Modi stressed “slavery is not only political and economic, but it also destroys our heritage”. He remarked that the same happened with the sacred relics of Lord Buddha, which were taken away during colonial rule.He asserted that “for India, the sacred relics are not merely artefacts; they are a part of our revered heritage and an inseparable part of our civilisation”.PM also reflected on India’s role in spreading the message of Buddha around the world with the sacred relics having travelled from India to different countries with significant Buddhist populations, including Vietnam, Thailand, Mongolia and Russia, “where waves of faith and devotion arose” with people turning up to pay homage in large numbers.Speaking at the function organised at Qila Rai Pithora Cultural Complex where he inaugurated the exposition ‘Light and the Lotus: Relics of the Awakened One’, PM underlined that this “shared heritage of Lord Buddha is proof that India is not connected merely through politics, diplomacy and economy, but through deeper bonds.We are connected through mind and emotions, through faith and spirituality.”On the site of the exhibition which will be open to public from Sunday, PM said the space reflected India’s glorious history, where nearly a thousand years ago former rulers established a city surrounded by strong and secure walls.He recalled that the sacred relics returned to India after more than 125 years at the intervention of govt and the Godrej Group.Highlighting that Buddha’s Abhidhamma, his words, and his teachings were originally in Pali, PM Modi said, “We are striving to make Pali accessible to the common people. For this reason, Pali has been accorded the status of a classical language, which will make it easier to understand and explain the Dhamma in its original essence.”Striking a personal note, Modi said his birthplace, Vadnagar in Gujarat, was a major centre of Buddhist studies and Sarnath near Varanasi, where Lord Buddha delivered his first sermon, was his karmabhoomi . Modi is MP from Varanasi. He also shared that during his travels to China, Japan, Korea, and Mongolia, he carried saplings of the Bodhi tree.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated a first-of-itskind international exposition of the Buddha’s Piprahwa relics, reliquaries and gem relics that were recently repatriated to India.

From tents to towers: Mumbai pilgrims are opting for highrise-Haj in Mina,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-tents-to-towers-mumbai-pilgrims-are-opting-for-highrise-haj-in-mina/articleshow/126330464.cms,"Former actor Sana Khan, who stepped away from the entertainment industry in 2020 and married cleric-businessman Mufti Anas the same year, is preparing for Haj later this year. It will be her fourth pilgrimage, but this one comes with a different experience.For the first time, Khan will not be staying in Mina’s famed tent city. Instead, she and her husband will spend five days in a multi-storey tower in the Mina valley, close to Mecca. The shift that reflects a transformation in how some pilgrims now experience Haj.Sana is among the first wave of Indians opting to stay at a tower in Mina during the Haj. Staying for five days at Mina, traditionally known as the ‘tent city’, is a mandatory ritual of Haj. For centuries, pilgrims from across the world who visited Mecca for the annual pilgrimage stayed in these temporary ‘khemas’ or tents.However, in the last couple of years, Saudi authorities built several towers in the Mina valley and offered pilgrims accommodation in these multi-storey towers with enhanced amenities like air-conditioned, spacious rooms, clean toilets, bigger kitchens and wider prayer areas.The Haj division of the ministry of minority affairs in India asked private Haj pilgrims to book their seats by January 15.“Timely booking will help avoid lastminute difficulties and ensure smooth, well-organised arrangements for this sacred journey,” said minority affairs minister Kiran Rijiju in an X post. Out of 1,75,000 Indian Haj quota, 52,000 will travel through Haj group organisations and private tour operators, while the rest will use services of the Haj Committee of India.Several organisers and tour operators are reaching out to affluent pilgrims with packages for an ‘upgraded Haj experience’ and the lure of ‘classic and premium packages that now include a shift from tents to Mina Towers’, reads an online ad of Al Khalid Tours and Travels. “Shift from tents to towers is being done in phases. Stay at the towers is hassle-free and suited to change in weather,” says Khalid Kherada of Al Khalid Tours and Travels.The orthodox do not approve of the transition from tents to towers at Mina.“Tents have a primitive feel, even though they’re also air-conditioned. However, Shariat, or Islamic laws, do not prescribe that the stay at Mina mandatorily be in tents,” says a senior cleric requesting anonymity.","Sana Khan is among the first wave of Indians opting to stay at a tower in Mina during the Haj.

Indian Army Intensifies Anti-Terror Ops In J&K To Flush Out Pak Terrorists Amid Chillai Kalan

SRINAGAR: In a unique initiative, the J&K govt on Saturday brought together more than 100 mosque imams to spread awareness about heroin addiction as cases of drug abuse continue to rise across the region.The imams were assembled for a workshop at the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (IMHANS) in Srinagar. Senior officials and doctors briefed the religious leaders about their role in removing stigma from such patients in the community and encouraging them to seek medical help. They also asked them to spread awareness about harmful impacts of substance abuse in society.Divisional commissioner (Kashmir), Anshul Garg, said the active cooperation of religious scholars was crucial in sensitising people, particularly the youth, about the harmful and dangerous effects of drug abuse.“Through Friday sermons and other religious gatherings, scholars can send a strong message that drug consumption is prohibited in all religions and that it destroys individuals, families and society,” Garg said.He said the government would follow a three-stage strategy to deal with the menace, focusing on awareness campaigns, identification of drug users, and counselling and rehabilitation.Srinagar deputy commissioner Akshay Labroo said the administration is taking strong measures to curb drug abuse.Dr Arshad Hussain, head of the department of psychiatry, IMHANS-Kashmir, highlighted the growing burden of substance use disorders in the region and stressed the importance of early intervention and community participation in prevention efforts.Earlier, mental health experts in their detailed presentations on the subject.In the early years, drug addiction was rare in the Valley, they said, adding that between 1980 and 1990, only seven opium users were treated at the then psychiatric hospital, now called IMHANS-Kashmir. In 1992, the total number of substance-use patients had risen to 198. During the 1990s, doctors mostly saw patients who had become dependent on medicinal opioids prescribed or advised by chemists for sleep, anxiety and stress.By 2000, the Drug De-addiction Centre Srinagar run by IMHANS-Kashmir started seeing increasing misuse of drugs like Spasmoproxyvon, codeine and pentazocine, which were abused for their sedative effects. Then cannabis use became widespread but after 2018 a large number of users shifted to heroin. In 2020, the centre recorded 7,403 patients. In 2021, the number of new and follow-up patients rose to 23,403, and in 2022 it reached 41,110.According to the survey, “Prevalence and Pattern of Substance Use Disorders in Ten Districts of Kashmir” carried out by the IMHANS Kashmir in 2023, the Valley has estimated 67468 substance-dependent individuals. The survey said heroin is the most widely used opioid.",The imams were assembled for a workshop at the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in Srinagar.

From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: India’s installed energy capacity has risen by nearly 36% overpast five years, increasing from 375 GW in Dec 2020 to almost 510 GW in the corresponding month of 2025.The growth has been driven largely by new and renewable energy — wind, solar, bioenergy and small hydro — which expanded by 122% during the period, from 91.1 GW to 203.6 GW, an addition of 112 GW. Including hydro and nuclear power, non-fossil sources now account for 263 GW, or 51.6%, of the country’s total installed capacity. In comparison, the share of fossil fuelbased capacity — coal, lignite, gas and diesel — has increased by 5.6% since Dec 2020.The new and renewable energy ministry said India recorded its highest-ever annual green capacity addition in 2025, with 44.5 GW added till Nov 30, largely due to a surge in solar installations. Solar capacity alone rose by 35 GW during the year to 132.9 GW, while wind power added 5.8 GW, taking total capacity to 54 GW.Large hydro capacity increased from 45.8 GW to 50.4 GW over five years, while nuclear power capacity saw a marginal rise from 6.8 GW in 2020 to 8.8 GW in 2025. Officials said all installed capacity was grid-connected and generation-ready, with transmission systems planned and implemented in line with phased capacity additions.The passage of the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill, 2025, which allows the entry of private players into the previously restricted nuclear sector, is expected to boost nuclear capacity.","India’s installed energy capacity has risen by nearly 36% overpast five years.

EU carbon tax to hurt developing countries with extra costs: CSE,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eu-carbon-tax-to-hurt-developing-countries-with-extra-costs-cse/articleshow/126330313.cms,"From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: As the European Union’s carbon border tax comes into effect from January 1, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a New Delhi-based think tank, Saturday warned that the move would shift the decarbonisation costs on to developing countries including India. It said decarbonisation is critically important, but should not be pushed through unilateral measures like Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) which is expected to generate 1.5 billion euros annually for EU nations by 2028 at the cost of the Global South.CBAM — carbon border tax — is a tool to put a price through imposing border tax on greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive goods (emission generated during production), like iron & steel, aluminium, cement and fertilisers, that are entering the 27 EU nations. It will put a tariff burden on such products of developing countries and impact their trade.Noting its implication for India, the CSE’s analysis shows that CBAM could impose substantial cost pressures on steel and aluminium exports to the EU and it could face a price burden of around 25% — a shock that exporters are likely to absorb through price compression in order to remain competitive. This is the reason India and many other countries, including China and South Africa, have been resisting it for long.“By putting a carbon price at the border, CBAM changes how competitiveness is defined in global trade. But what it also does is shift the decarbonisation costs to developing countries, thus extending a familiar dynamic where developing countries adapt to rules set elsewhere, under conditions that structurally disadvantage them,” said Sunita Narain, director general, CSE.“Decarbonisation in industry is both necessary and unavoidable. Developing countries will need to pursue decarbonisation to remain competitive. However, this transition can’t be driven through unilateral steps alone,” she said.Since the entire amount collected as carbon border tax would go to the EU nations (75% to EU budget and 25% to national budget) without actually helping out other countries’ decarbonisation efforts, the CSE has recommended that developed countries like India should collect a carbon tax domestically at point of exports, so that the funds can be directed towards decarbonisation of domestic industry, whilst also meeting the CBAM’s carbon pricing criteria.“This can help reduce the carbon intensity of manufacturing. It will also ensure a level playing field and also provide funds for countries of the Global South to invest in low carbon growth,” said Avantika Goswami, programme manager (climate change), CSE.A CSE’s product-wise analysis of CBAM-covered sectors and their corresponding exports from India shows that the country’s CBAM-covered goods’ exports to the EU comprised nearly 10% of its total goods exports to the EU in the year 2022-23. By value, this was about 0.2% of India’s GDP in that financial year.These exports comprise about one-fourth (25.7%) of India’s total goods exports to the world for the CBAM-covered sectors, which is not insignificant for the industries operating in these sectors. These are iron and steel, aluminium,fertilizers and cement. Currently, hydrogen and electricity are not exported from India to the EU.Flagging adverse impact of the carbon border tax, developing countries, including India, China and South Africa, have highlighted at several multilateral fora that the climate-linked trade measures such as CBAM risk increasing the overall cost of climate action, fragmenting multilateral cooperation, and shifting mitigation burdens onto countries with lower historical emissions and weaker capacities. The developing countries have also questioned the compatibility of CBAM with WTO rules. The issue was also flagged big time at the UN climate conference (COP30) in Belem, Brazil in Nov last year.",Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is expected to generate 1.5 billion euros annually for EU nations by 2028.

Where Bahrain fits in the Gulf landscape





For years, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have dominated conversations around long-term residency in the Gulf. But Bahrain has been moving steadily in the same direction, aligning itself with a wider regional push to attract capital, skills and long-term residents as Gulf economies look beyond oil dependence.Across the region, governments are reworking visa systems that were once built around short-term labour. The aim now is retention, of investors, professionals, entrepreneurs, families and retirees who can contribute over decades, not just contracts. Residency has become an economic tool, not just an immigration one.Bahrain’s Golden Residency Visa, introduced in 2022 and updated in 2025, fits squarely into this shift. Linked to Bahrain Vision 2030, the programme is designed to strengthen the kingdom’s competitiveness and widen its appeal beyond energy, positioning Bahrain as an affordable, stable and expat-friendly Gulf hub for investors, professionals and families looking to base themselves in the region long term.At its core, Bahrain’s Golden Residency is a 10-year renewable residency permit that grants long-term security and operational freedom.Unlike traditional Gulf visas, it is not tied to a single employer and does not impose rigid stay requirements.Key features include:This framework is designed to support long-term settlement rather than short-term labour rotation, aligning with Bahrain’s broader economic strategy.Bahrain’s Golden Residency is deliberately multi-track. Eligibility is assessed through investment, income, or contribution, rather than a single capital test.The property pathway remains the most clearly defined route.The lowered threshold places Bahrain among the more accessible long-term residency options in the GCC, particularly for investors priced out of higher-cost markets.Beyond capital, Bahrain’s model reflects the GCC-wide move toward recognising non-financial contribution.This route applies to:Approval under this route is contribution-based rather than investment-based, but carries the same 10-year renewable residency and work freedoms.Bahrain is one of the few Gulf states with clearly defined residency options for retirees.This clarity has made Bahrain particularly attractive to retirees seeking long-term Gulf residence without employment dependency.All applicants must meet standard Golden Residency conditions:Golden Residency holders may sponsor spouses, parents, and dependent family members. Importantly, there is no minimum stay requirement to preserve residency.Bahrain does not operate a citizenship-by-investment programme. Citizenship remains subject to strict naturalisation rules, requiring prolonged residence, language proficiency, cultural integration, and government approval.While long-term residency offers stability and permanence, investors seeking passport mobility typically look to alternative citizenship programmes elsewhere.The Bahraini passport itself provides visa-free access to 95 destinations, including all GCC states, but remains more limited globally than European or Caribbean passports.Also read: UAE Golden Visa or Saudi Premium Residency; which Gulf nation offers the best long-term future? Bahrain’s appeal as a long-term base rests on a combination of practical advantages. The Golden Residency offers work freedom, family sponsorship and long-term security within a country that remains affordable by Gulf standards. Living costs, particularly housing, are lower than in neighbouring markets, while tax policy favours individuals through zero personal income tax. A large expatriate population, strong international schooling options, high safety rankings and a diversified, business-friendly economy make Bahrain a realistic option for professionals, investors and families seeking stability in the region.Bahrain’s tax environment remains one of its strongest attractions for long-term residents. The kingdom imposes zero personal income tax, meaning individuals do not pay tax on salaries, wages, capital gains or inheritance, a structure that significantly improves net earnings for professionals and retirees alike.That said, Bahrain is not entirely tax-free. A standard 10 per cent value-added tax currently applies to most goods and services, alongside excise taxes on specific items, including a 100 per cent levy on tobacco and energy drinks and 50 per cent on carbonated beverages. For most residents, however, the absence of personal income-based taxation remains the defining advantage.Affordability is where Bahrain quietly outperforms many of its neighbours. According to Numbeo’s 2025 Cost of Living Index, Bahrain ranks as the second most affordable country in the GCC after Oman.Monthly living costs for a family of four are estimated at BHD 1,076.1 (approximately USD 2,855), while a single person’s monthly expenses average BHD 304.3 (around USD 808). Bahrain is 25.3% cheaper than the UAE, with rental costs nearly 65% lower, and remains marginally cheaper than Saudi Arabia for both families and individuals. This affordability, particularly in housing, is a key reason Bahrain appeals to long-term residents rather than short-term workers.Bahrain is a majority-expatriate country by population today. Official figures for 2024 officially place the total population overall at 1,588,670, of which 739,736 are Bahraini nationals, accounting for 46.6 per cent, while 848,934 residents, or 53.4 per cent, are non-Bahrainis. Large expatriate communities include Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Egyptians and Europeans, shaping a distinctly diverse international vibrant social fabric.For families, Bahrain offers a strong education ecosystem. The country hosts over 70 private international schools, offering British, American, IB and Indian curricula. Costs vary widely, allowing families to choose between affordable and premium options within a relatively compact geography.Bahrain performs strongly across global development, safety and livability benchmarks. It ranks 38th worldwide on the UN Human Development Index 2025, with an HDI score of 0.899, placing it in the “very high” category and third in the Arab region. Safety indicators are similarly robust: Numbeo’s 2025 data ranks Bahrain as the 16th safest country globally, citing low crime levels and a strong perception of personal safety, including when walking at night. In expatriate sentiment surveys, Bahrain has also retained the top global ranking in InterNations’ Expat Insider report for the second consecutive year, reflecting high satisfaction with ease of settling in, social life and overall quality of living.Bahrain continues to actively market itself as a practical and cost-effective business base within the Gulf, particularly for companies that highly value regulatory clarity and regional access over scale alone. The country’s business framework offers several structural advantages:Taken together, these factors make the Golden Residency especially attractive for founders, consultants and small-to-medium enterprises seeking a Gulf presence without the high overheads associated with larger regional hubs.Also read: Saudi Arabia Premium Residency (Green Card); benefits, eligibility, fees, all you need to know Bahrain does not match the scale, capital depth or global profile of the UAE or Saudi Arabia, and it does not attempt to. Instead, it is deliberately moving in the same strategic direction, opening long-term residency beyond investment alone while lowering barriers to entry and focusing on affordability, work freedom and livability. With expatriates making up more than half its population, including large South Asian communities, Bahrain has long functioned as a migrant and expat society. Tax-free income, reasonable living costs, employment across finance, construction and technology, and a comparatively relaxed, family-friendly culture explain why its residency model works in practice rather than just on paper.","Bahrain offers long-term residency with lower investment thresholds and fewer financial barriers to entry.

NEW DELHI: In a first, India will get a twin-tube underwater tunnel that will have provision for movement of both vehicle and trains, boosting faster movement of forces and ammunition in case of any exigency, reports Dipak Dash.An inter-ministerial panel, headed by the expenditure secretary has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track.As per design, there will be no vehicular movement when trains run through this tube. It will have ballistic track and the trains will run on electricity. The total project of 33.7km, including the tunnel, approach roads and railway track will cost around Rs 18,600 crore. Once the project is complete, travel time between Gohpur and Numaligarh will reduce from current six-and-half hours to just 30 minutes, shortening the distance from 240km to 34km. This will enhance connectivity to Arunachal, Manipur, and other northeastern states.The project cost will be borne by road transport, railways and defence ministry.Designed as two unidirectional tunnels with two lanes each, these will be built 32m below Brahmaputra's deepest bed level. The project is expected to be completed in five years after the award of work.Officials said the projects will be placed before Union cabinet for approval and this may happen before Assam assembly polls. Last year, finance ministry had green signalled a road tunnel costing around Rs 14,900 crore with provision of 80:20 funding by road transport ministry and defence ministry. But following a decision to build road-cum-railway tunnels where it's feasible, govt had identified three such tunnels for North-East chicken neck corridor, across Brahmaputra in Assam and on Maranahally-Addahole (Shiradi Ghat) stretch in Karnataka, which TOI first reported on Oct 6, 2025.Officials said because of provision of railway track in one tunnel the cost has gone up.","An inter-ministerial panel has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam.

NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio continued its subscriber growth in November 2025, leading the industry in overall wireless additions and active user gains as per the latest monthly subscription data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).The TRAI data showed that Jio added 1.2 million subscribers, extending its lead over Bharti Airtel for the ninth consecutive month.The performance came during a period when the industry's total active (Visitor Location Register) subscribers fell by 3.4 million to 1,091 million. While other major operators reported net losses in active users, Jio was the only player to post positive gains.Specifically, Vodafone Idea (VIL) saw a drop of 2.2 million active users, while Bharti Airtel recorded a decline of 1.7 million.The momentum for Jio was reflected in its market share, with the operator gaining VLR share in 17 out of 22 telecom circles. The most significant gains were observed in the Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab regions.Morgan Stanley noted that ""RJio's market share rose to 43.7% (+25bps MoM), while all other operators lost market share MoM."" This trend further reduced the active subscriber share gap between Jio and Bharti Airtel to an all-time low.In the broadband segment, Jio maintained its dominance by capturing approximately 68 per cent of the total additions across mobile broadband, fixed wireless access (FWA), and unlicensed band radio (UBR). Jio remained ahead of Bharti Airtel in overall broadband rollouts primarily due to its UBR expansion, which added 0.35 million users during the month.The data also highlighted Jio's strength in the fixed wireless segment. Morgan Stanley reported that ""on FWA, Jio added almost 2.5x FWA subs (FWA 5G+ FWA UBR) vs Airtel."" Both Jio and Bharti Airtel added 0.25 million 5G FWA subscribers each, but Jio's additional UBR gains solidified its lead in the home broadband category.Despite the pullback in active subscribers during November, the sector's active additions for the 2025 calendar year to date remain at a nine-year high. Industry observers expect that the current subscriber additions and rising data penetration will support future growth in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) as the market construct remains favourable.","Reliance Jio continued its subscriber growth in November 2025, leading the industry in overall wireless additions and active user gains.

'No change in policy'

Removing hurdles

NEW DELHI: While land acquisition, and forest and wildlife clearances are the main hurdles for delay in infrastructure projects that have been addressed by Pragati, the platform for large projects led by PM Modi, Cabinet secretary TV Somanathan made it clear Friday that development won't be at the cost of democracy.Asked about amendments to the current policy, Somanathan said: ""In a democracy we need to strike a balance... We want to implement projects with the consent of people and after public consultation.""The comment comes amid demands from a section of the business community to review the land acquisition policy to speed up the implementation of projects, with the corporate sector often citing the Chinese model of infrastructure creation.While BJP govt did seek to amend land acquisition law in its first term, it left it to the states to offer a simpler regime. Responding to a question, cabinet secretary TV Somanathan said govt has no plans to change its land acquisition policy.The data shared by Somananthan at a press conference showed 35% of 7,735 issues raised under multi-layer Pragati were related to land acquisition, followed by 20% dealing with wildlife and forest clearances.Manoj Govil, secretary coordination in the cabinet secretariat, said the average time taken for forest and wildlife clearance has come down from over 600 days to around 75 days as learnings from Pragati have been part of the administrative process.Of 382 projects reviewed by the PM in 50 meetings, almost two-thirds related to land and forest. Among the sectors, roads was on top (114 projects), followed by railways (109) and power (54). For railways and roads, at least half the issues are related to land acquisition.In a rare press conference, Somananthan said so far projects of Rs 85 lakh crore have been cleared by the PM-led panel as states and Centre have worked together to resolve the issues. Citing the example of Jammu-Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla rail link, the country's highest-ranking civil servant said the project was approved in 1994 and by the time it reached Pragati in 2015, only 40% of the work had been done. It was finally commissioned last June after being monitored at the highest level. He said had the project not been taken up under Pragati, it would have been completed only by Jan 2038.He said by removing bottlenecks, Pragati had created a platform for higher capital expenditure by govt. ""All states, irrespective of political dispensations, want to complete their projects and all chief secretaries have been very responsive in resolving issues,"" he said.On impact of review of projects by PM under this initiative, Somanathan said on average, one issue was resolved every working day after review under Pragati.Besides projects, the platform is used to review 61 govt schemes such as One Nation, One Ration Card, PM Jan Aarogya Yojna, PM Awas Yojna, PM Swanidhi Yojna, Swachh Bharat Mission, Rera, and grievances across 36 sectors were taken up for review.",Cabinet secretary TV Somanathan says development won't be at the cost of democracy.

NEW DELHI: Flagging a “lack of equal and inclusive representation of the Buddhist community” in ongoing talks between Ladakhi outfits and the Centre on constitutional safeguards, a new Buddhist body — Voice of Buddhist Community of Ladakh (VBL) — has sought inclusion in the dialogue to articulate the community’s concerns and aspirations.VBL was formally floated on January 1, 2026, with the backing of senior Buddhist leaders, prominent citizens, youth and women representing all regions of Ladakh. The outfit said its objective is to ensure broader and more effective representation of Buddhists in discussions with the MHA.A source said the move is aimed at ensuring that “any decision emerging from the dialogue between the Leh Apex Body and Kargil Democratic Alliance on one hand and MHA on the other keeps in mind the voice of Buddhist community of Ladakh”.While welcoming the Centre’s initiative to engage Ladakhi leaders, VBL, in a letter to Amit Shah, expressed concern over the composition of high-powered committee, which currently comprises LAB and KDA leaders. Though LAB includes representation from Ladakh Buddhist Association, VBL said Buddhists remain under-represented in HPC, undermining community’s interests in draft proposal prepared by LAB and KDA.As per sources, the draft proposal seeks statehood and 6th Schedule status for Ladakh but is silent on the demand for special status under Article 371. VBL, which opposes the demand for statehood, fears the proposal may be skewed in favour of the Kargil region.VBL said it would submit a separate draft proposal to Centre after consultations. Its convenor Skarma Namtak recently called on Ladakh LG to present the group’s demands, stressing any dialogue on Ladakh’s future must adequately reflect Buddhist concerns.","VBL was formally floated on January 1, 2026, with the backing of senior Buddhist leaders, prominent citizens, youth and women.

Your Money Vanished? The Truth About Online Scams & How To Fight Back!

HYDERABAD: After noticing TOI articles on digital arrest cases in Hyderabad, an 81-year-old retired businessman reported being scammed of over Rs 7 crore using the same modus operandi. Posing as Mumbai Police officers, the cyber fraudsters threatened to arrest him in a bogus drug-trafficking and fake passports case and extorted the money.According to a complaint filed by the octagenarian with Telangana Cyber Security Bureau (TGCSB) on January 2, his ordeal began on October 27 last year when he received a WhatsApp call from a person claiming to be Sunil Sharma from Blue Dart customer care. Sharma told the victim that a parcel sent in his name from Mumbai to Bangkok contained a laptop, five passports and 200 gram MDMA, a narcotic drug. Minutes later, another caller, posing as a Mumbai crime branch officer, said that based on the evidence, the victim faced charges of extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering and terrorism.Placing the victim under 'digital arrest', the impostors warned him against revealing case details to his family or contacting bankers or lawyers, and ordered him to provide full disclosure of his investments. Under sustained intimidation, the businessman transferred Rs 19.8 lakh on October 29 to a City Union Bank account. Further, he installed the Signal app to communicate with them. Between November 6 and December 5, he executed five more RTGS transfers to different bank accounts, bringing the total loss to over Rs 7.12 crore.On December 29, the fraudsters sought an additional Rs 1.2 cr to close the case file against him. Growing suspicious, the victim lodged a complaint on December 31.","An 81-year-old retired businessman reported being scammed of over Rs 7 crore using the same modus operandi.

One hand bag rule vital amid power bank fire fears: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-hand-bag-rule-vital-amid-power-bank-fire-fears-experts/articleshow/126329997.cms,"DGCA Plans New Rules For Power Banks On Flights After Fire Scare On IndiGo Plane

NEW DELHI: India has barred the use of power banks to charge portable electronic devices inflight. Charging power banks by plugging them to in-seat power supply systems that airlines provide is also no longer allowed.Permitted only in hand bags, flyers are no longer supposed to keep power banks and batteries in overhead bins. This comes after instances of lithium batteries catching fire mid-flight.DGCA recently issued a ‘dangerous goods advisory circular’ to minimise risks from lithium battery-powered devices carried by passengers and crew members.The regulator has directed airlines to make inflight announcements regarding the new rules. Passengers need to “immediately inform cabin crew if any device emits heat, smoke or an unusual odour”, the rules say, adding that airlines must “promptly report all safety issues and occurrences related to lithium battery incidents to DGCA”. Some other countries and airlines, including Emirates and Singapore Airlines, had issued similar restrictions for the same reason last year.Aviation experts warn that airlines should strictly implement the one-hand-bag-per-passenger rule in wake of this new fear.The reason: While batteries and power banks are not allowed in check-in bags, airlines very often take hand bags — which have portable electronic devices (PEDs) and power banks — at boarding gates or aerobridgesfrom passengers and keep them in the belly of aircraft, as overhead bins are full.“This defeats the purpose of not allowing batteries in check-in bags. A battery catching fire in baggage hold, remaining undetected and then spreading can have serious consequences. The issue of how much cabin bags flyers carry onboard needs to be tackled either by airlines on their own. And if they can’t do so, rules need to be in place to ensure lithium batteries do not make it to baggage hold,” said a senior pilot.The new DGCA circular says: “The widespread usage of lithium batteries in various rechargeable devices has led to an increase in carriage of lithium batteries by air. Power banks, portable chargers, and similar devices containing lithium batteries can act as ignition sources and potentially initiate on-board fires. Lithium batteries placed in overhead stowage bins or within carry-on baggage may be obscured, difficult to access, or not readily monitored by passengers or crew members. This may result in delayed detection of smoke or fire and response actions, increasing the potential hazard to flight safety.”Lithium battery fires are very “energetic” and can cause PEDs to explode. “A lithium battery fire can be started by uncontrolled heating, overcharging, crushing or internal short circuit triggered by poor manufacturing quality, aged batteries or damage due to mishandling. Unlike other fires, lithium battery fires may be self-sustaining and require special methods to handle. The general preventive measures to minimise risks of lithium battery fire may include minimising possibilities of heating of devices; early detection in case of fire; and reinforcement of effectiveness of firefighting procedures,” it adds.",India has barred the use of power banks to charge portable electronic devices inflight.

180 Kmph While You Sleep! India's Latest Vande Bharat Sleeper Marks New Era. Check Fares, Features

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi will flag off the country's first Vande Bharat Sleeper train between Guwahati and Howrah later this month, barely months before the assembly polls in Assam and West Bengal. The train, marking a major upgrade in overnight train travel running at 120-130 kmph, will also reduce the travel time between two eastern capitals by more than three hours.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced the first route of the indigenously built modern train that has a design speed of 180 kmph. PM is likely to visit Assam and West Bengal in the third week of this month. Responding to a question on the reason for choosing the route connecting two poll-bound states, Vaishnaw said the decision is part of PM's thrust on development in east and northeast India under the ""purvodaya"" scheme.The minister said that in the next six months eight more such trains catering to 1,200-1,500 km routes will be rolled out and by December this number will reach 12. ""From next year onwards, production will be ramped up rapidly as the entire supply chain will be in place by then,"" he added.Giving details of the first service, he said it will run six days a week and the one-way fare will be Rs 2,300 for 3AC, Rs 3,000 for 2AC and Rs 3,600 for 1AC travel.He added for the first time, the national transporter has decided to have a fixed rate of fare for each class of travel in these trains - Rs 2.4, Rs 3.1 and Rs 3.8 per km for third, second and first AC, meaning there will be no dynamic pricing. ""You will see several reforms in railways in 2026. This is one of them,"" Vaishnaw said. While passengers originating from Guwahati will be served Asamese cuisine, those starting from Kolkata will get Bengali food.On the special features of the train, Vaishnaw said the riding comfort can be compared with best trains across the globe and the AC system ensures there is adequate oxygen content in air to ensure passengers face no discomfort.Vaishnaw also gave details of progress made in fencing of tracks, upgradation of around 79% network and upgradation in the Over Head Equipment (OHE), the system of overhead cables, masts, and insulators that supplies high-voltage electricity to power electric trains, enabling trains to run at a higher speed. He added that with the expansion of railway infrastructure, they are hopeful of running more trains and they are hopeful of ending waitlisted tickets in some sectors in the next 2-3 years.","PM Narendra Modi will flag off the country's first Vande Bharat Sleeper train between Guwahati and Howrah later this month.

Kolkata wakes up to season’s worst air as New Year fireworks push AQI into ‘very poor’ zone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-wakes-up-to-seasons-worst-air-as-new-year-fireworks-push-aqi-into-very-poor-zone/articleshow/126297528.cms,"Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness







Kolkata woke up to the foulest air of the season on the first day of the year as midnight firecracker revelry pushed pollution levels deep into ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ zones at a time when cold air tends to hold pollutants closer to breathing height. The only silver lining was the presence of a breeze that dispersed some of the pollutants and prevented the air from turning worse.While the scale of fireworks was lower than Diwali, experts said the impact was far more severe due to prevailing winter conditions. Chill causes thermal inversion, a meteorological phenomenon that traps pollutants close to the ground by restricting vertical air movement and preventing their dispersal.At noon, readings at two air-quality monitoring stations were in ‘very poor’ category (AQI 301–400) and just one level below the ‘severe’ category. The remaining five stations recorded ‘poor’ AQI ( 201–300). Jadavpur, in particular, touched AQI 314, matching pollution levels seen in Delhi at the peak of its recent smog crisis, even as the national capital showed signs of recovery. Salt Lake was not far behind with AQI of 308 while Victoria Memorial came close to breach-ing the ‘very poor’ threshold, recording an AQI of 292.Barely 24 hours ago, AQI at Jadavpur was 159 and Salt Lake 154, both in the moderate range (AQI 101-200).A scientist from West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) warned that fireworks during winter are especially dangerous. “During winter, firecracker revelry is suicidal as far as air pollution is concerned. Low ground temperature causes thermal inversion, suppressing vertical wind movement. Wind speed often drops below 2 metres per second, allowing pollutants to accumulate near the surface,” the scientist said. Experts also cautioned that recovery would be slow. With cold conditions expected to persist, pollution from successive days is likely to pile up in the lower atmosphere, worsening air quality.Environmentalists warned that repeated violations pose serious risks to public health, particularly for children, senior citizens and people with respiratory ailments, and stressed the need for stricter enforcement and greater public awareness in future celebrations.The night also witnessed rampant violations of noise pollution norms, particularly during the first hour of the New Year. Monitoring data showed noise levels breaching 80 decibels in several residential and silence zones—nearly double the permissible night-time limits.Jadavpur University, a designated silence zone, recorded noise levels as high as 84.1 dB, while Flora Fountain in a residential area touched 81.5 dB shortly after midnight. Several colleges and educational institutions, classified as silence zones, reported noise levels ranging between 70 and 80 dB. Under existing rules, the permissible night-time noise limit is 45 dB for residential areas and 40 dB for silence zones.Besides the high-decibel firecrackers, there was rampant use of loudspeakers without sound limiters and DJ music. At Madhyamram’s Deshbandhunagar, Suman Roy’s plea against the use of loudspeakers that was affecting his elderly parents, fell on deaf ears.",Kolkata woke up to the foulest air of the year as midnight firecracker revelry pushed pollution levels deep into ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ zones.

NEW DELHI: Getting into the Yuletide spirit could prove expensive for an Air India pilot who was to operate a Vancouver-Delhi (via Vienna) flight on Dec 23, 2025. A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle. She reported this Boeing 777 pilot to the Canadian authorities who conducted a breath analyser test on him which he flunked and then he was detained.Luckily for passengers, Air India managed to quickly find a replacement. The ultra long haul, to be operated by four pilots or two sets (one captain and a co-pilot in each set) in turns, supposed to leave at 3 pm local time did so with just a two-hour delay. The aircraft then landed in Vienna from where another set of crew operated it to Delhi.“AI has taken a very stern view of this matter. The pilot was flown to Delhi a couple of days later and is being probed. The issue has been reported to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which is also examining the same,” said people in the know.While some sources say the pilot had inadvertently sipped an alcoholic drink at the airport and a staffer at duty free saw him doing so, others said he smelled of alcohol when buying a bottle.It is not yet known which of the two really happened, staffer reported the matter to Canadian authorities who then used CCTV footage to find out the pilot in question was to operate with flight. They managed to trace him to the AI aircraft.In a statement, AI said: “AI 186 from Vancouver to Delhi on Dec 23, 2025, experienced a last-minute delay after one of the cockpit crew members was offloaded prior to departure. Canadian authorities raised concerns regarding the pilot’s fitness for duty, following which the crew member was taken for further inquiry. In accordance with safety protocols, an alternate pilot was rostered to operate the flight, resulting in the delay. ”""Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers and is fully cooperating with the local authorities. The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations. Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy. Safety remains Air India’s highest priority at all times,” the airline statement added.Pilots operating international sectors usually do not have pre-flight breath analyser (BA) tests and the same is conducted on arrival as liquor is available on board these flights. This is to ensure they have not taken a sip or two during the flight. On domestic flights, pre-flights BA tests are conducted as alcohol is not served/sold on flights within India.While rules don’t mandate this, AI on its own has enforced a policy of conducting random pre-flight BA at international stations. The airline frequently keeps sending its doctors on international flights who then conduct these checks on pilots who are to operate the return flight to India.Pilots are surprised at this case. ""Forget drinking, we don’t even use after shaves, perfumes, mouth wash or homeopathic medicines some hours before operating a flight. There have been multiple instances of teetotallers failing BA tests because of the alcohol in their breath because of using toiletries with alcoholic content. We look for these items without any alcohol, except homeopathic medicines where possibly there’s no option,” said a captain. The reason: Failing BA test thrice means losing flying license.","A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle. She reported this Boeing 777 pilot to the Canadian authorities who conducted a breath analyser test on him which he flunked and then he was detained.Luckily for passengers, Air India managed to quickly find a replacement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126281235,imgsize-360839,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Almost all of that is made up of his Premier League salary alone, which is said to be worth several million pounds per season, plus signing bonuses and performance-related bonuses linked to appearances and results.

Manus, a versatile AI agent, achieved rapid growth and significant revenue, prompting Meta to integrate its technology across its platforms. The deal, however, carries geopolitical undertones due to Manus's Chinese origins and subsequent move to Singapore.

Meta's $2.5 billion bet on AI agents signals new era

Chinese roots raise geopolitical concerns despite Singapore move





The co-founder of Manus, the AI startup recently acquired by Meta for $2.5 billion, has drawn parallels between himself and Mark Zuckerberg , highlighting their shared journey as college dropouts who built successful tech companies. Ji Yichao, the 32-year-old chief scientist and co-founder of Manus, shared two photographs on X showing younger versions of himself and Zuckerberg working on laptops in the same room at the ""Facebook House"" in Palo Alto, California. ""21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge,"" Ji wrote following acquisition announcement.According to Chinese media reports, Ji started a computer science degree at Beijing Information Science and Technology University in 2010 but dropped out to pursue entrepreneurship. He later returned to complete his degree in 2018. Zuckerberg famously left Harvard University in 2004 to focus on building Facebook, which eventually became Meta.The deal includes a $500 million retention pool for Manus employees, as Meta ramps up its foray into AI. Manus will be retained as a stand-alone subscription service while weaving in the startup's technology into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.Manus, which debuted in March 2024 as a ""general-purpose"" AI agent capable of independently conducting deep research and vacation planning, and even coding and stock analysis, reached more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than a year and gained millions of users.That deal is also not without geopolitical nuances, given that Manus was founded by Butterfly Effect in Beijing and Wuhan in 2022. Still, it moved to Singapore in mid-2025, apparently to hedge against geopolitical risk as part of the U.S.–China tech rivalry.Meta says there will be “no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI” after the acquisition, adding it would wind down services in China. Manus reportedly laid off most of its Chinese staff and now operates with 105 employees across Singapore, Tokyo, and San Francisco.Earlier, Senator John Cornyn had criticised Silicon Valley venture firm Benchmark for its support of Manus, citing fears of American capital underpinning Chinese technology interests.","Ji Yichao, the 32-year-old chief scientist and co-founder of Manus, shared two photographs on X showing younger versions of himself and Zuckerberg working on laptops in Palo Alto, California.

The company faces lawsuits over alleged harm caused by ChatGPT, while its safety teams have been disbanded. This new role aims to balance rapid AI advancement with crucial safeguards, a challenging task given the technology's unprecedented capabilities and potential dangers.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Safety teams keep vanishing as products multiply

Lawsuits paint darker picture of AI's mental health toll





The man who unleashed ChatGPT on the world is now sounding the alarm about his own creation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is hunting for a Head of Preparedness to tackle what he calls ""real challenges"" emerging from AI systems that have grown so sophisticated they're finding critical security vulnerabilities and impacting users' mental health. The $555,000 role comes as the company that revolutionised generative AI in late 2022 grapples with lawsuits, safety team departures, and the uncomfortable reality that its technology may be causing genuine harm.""Models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges,"" Altman wrote on X. He didn't sugarcoat the position's demands, warning applicants: ""This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.""The new hire will lead OpenAI's preparedness framework, evaluating frontier AI capabilities and coordinating safeguards across cybersecurity, biosecurity, and the prospect of AI systems that can improve themselves—challenges that Altman admits have ""little precedent."" The company specifically needs help figuring out ""how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm.The job opening arrives amid a disturbing pattern at OpenAI: safety teams appear, then disappear. The company's Superalignment team, launched in 2023 with the mission of preventing AI systems ""much smarter than us"" from going rogue, lasted less than a year before being disbanded in May 2024. Co-leader Jan Leike quit with a blistering exit statement, declaring that ""safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products. ""The AGI Readiness team met a similar fate in October 2024, dissolved after advising on the company's preparedness for artificial general intelligence. Meanwhile, Aleksander Madry, OpenAI's previous Head of Preparedness, was reassigned in July 2024 to work on AI reasoning instead—leaving the crucial safety position vacant for months even as the technology advanced.The urgency behind the new position becomes clearer when examining the lawsuits piling up against OpenAI. Multiple families allege ChatGPT reinforced delusions, deepened isolation, and even encouraged suicide. One case involves a 16-year-old California boy; another centers on a 56-year-old Connecticut man who allegedly murdered his mother and killed himself after interactions with the chatbot that fueled his paranoid delusions.OpenAI says it's working to improve ChatGPT's ability to ""recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress,"" but the company hasn't slowed its product velocity. Despite Altman's 2023 signing of a letter warning that AI extinction risks deserve priority alongside ""pandemics and nuclear war,"" OpenAI keeps accelerating. The company, now valued at $157 billion after October's $6.6 billion funding round, is reportedly negotiating with Amazon for another investment exceeding $10 billion.That contradiction—tech leaders prophesying catastrophe while racing to build the very technology they fear—hasn't gone unnoticed. ""If they honestly believe this could bring about human extinction, then why not just stop?"" asked one critic after Altman's Congressional testimony. The new Head of Preparedness will inherit that impossible balancing act: making AI safer while the company that employs them pushes relentlessly forward.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is seeking a Head of Preparedness to address AI's growing security risks and mental health impacts.

The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon.

RUDRAPUR: The New Year is likely to begin on a promising note for sportspersons in Udham Singh Nagar, with Manoj Sarkar Sports Stadium in Rudrapur set to acquire international-standard sporting infrastructure. A 400-m synthetic athletic track and a modern football turf, now in the final stage of construction, are expected to be handed over to the sports department by mid-Jan, pending certification from the World Athletics Council.The project, developed at an estimated cost of Rs 20 crore, aims to upgrade the stadium to global standards. The facilities include a high-quality synthetic running track, football turf, an advanced drainage system, and a reinforced boundary wall to enhance safety. Officials said expert agencies have been conducting continuous inspections to assess track quality, lane markings, surface grip and other safety parameters as part of the certification process.Once certified, the stadium will be able to host national and international athletic competitions, besides serving as a major training hub for local athletes. The project was initially sanctioned at Rs 15 crore, but an additional Rs 5 crore was approved after changes were made to the original layout, officials said.Under the revised plan, the football turf was shifted to a nearby location instead of being developed inside the athletic track to avoid interference with other disciplines. Officials said this modification, coupled with the hosting of sporting events during the construction phase, led to delays.The project was earlier scheduled for completion by March 2024.Assistant engineer S S Bhandari of the Irrigation Department said, “The construction of the synthetic track and football turf will be completed within a day or two. The certification process is underway, and all technical standards have been strictly adhered to. Once clearance is received, the facility will be formally handed over to the sports department. ”District sports officer Janki Karki said, “With its completion, the stadium is set to emerge as an international sports centre, giving fresh momentum to the aspirations of young athletes in the region.”","The project, developed at an estimated cost of Rs 20 crore, aims to upgrade the stadium to global standards.

This innovation, featuring the Universal Balance Engine and NeuroPause framework, aims to prevent failures by ensuring stability before action. The technology promises enhanced safety and accountability across industries, infrastructure, and even human diagnostics.

An Indian deep-tech company has announced a technology platform that it says addresses a critical gap present across most modern systems, from industrial machines and infrastructure to robotics and human diagnostics.NeuroPause Lab Pvt Ltd said that while global technology has advanced rapidly in speed, automation, and intelligence, one essential element has been largely ignored -- a structured and verifiable pause between sensing a situation and acting on it.This missing step is where many failures, accidents, and system breakdowns originate, the firm argued.""Most systems today are designed to sense and respond instantly. But when actions are taken without checking balance, timing, and readiness, small instabilities grow into major failures,"" the company said in a release.NeuroPause Lab's work focuses on inserting this missing control loop into technology in a measurable and engineering-driven way.At the core of the platform is the Universal Balance Engine (UBE), which continuously evaluates stability-related factors such as balance, movement control, external disturbances, and the effectiveness of corrective responses, the release said.Rather than reacting after a failure, UBE is designed to detect early signs of instability while corrective action is still possible, it stated.On top of this foundation sits NeuroPause, a stability assurance framework that converts technical measurements into clear, auditable records. These records can show whether safety and responsibility obligations were followed before an incident occurred in an area of growing importance for regulators, insurers, and governments.A key component of the system is the NeuroPause Rhythmic Repair Protocol, which enforces a fixed pause between sensing and action, the statement said.This pause allows systems to stabilise before applying force or making adjustments, reducing impulsive responses that often cause damage or cascading failures.The technology has applications across sectors. In industry, it can improve machine safety, reduce wear, and clarify responsibility during failures, the company statement said.For governments and infrastructure operators, it supports better risk management in energy systems, transport networks, and automated public spaces, it statedFor individuals, the same principles are used in non-invasive diagnostic tools that assess posture, timing, and physical stability, helping identify problems before they become chronic.","An Indian firm, NeuroPause Lab, unveiled a groundbreaking platform addressing a critical gap in modern systems.

""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public. Musk has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-96413764,imgsize-26192,width-400,resizemode-4/96413764.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Repeal of previous rules and broader implications









Saudi Arabia has unveiled a detailed framework governing how public facilities across the Kingdom are named. The regulations, recently approved by the Saudi Cabinet and published in the Umm Al-Qura Gazette, aim to unify naming practices, strengthen administrative oversight, and ensure compliance with Islamic principles. They are set to come into force 120 days after publication and will apply to all publicly owned facilities nationwide.According to Saudi Gazette, the new rules define public facilities broadly, covering municipal buildings, educational institutions, cultural centres, sports venues, religious sites, healthcare establishments, transport infrastructure, and other government-owned assets. Each government entity will be responsible for naming facilities under its jurisdiction, following the unified framework and relevant laws.To implement the system, entities must issue their own executive bylaws. These internal regulations will outline organisational, technical, procedural, and operational requirements, while also setting governance mechanisms to oversee naming decisions.The regulations introduce strict prohibitions on certain naming practices. Public facilities cannot be named after Kings of Saudi Arabia, Crown Princes, or leaders of allied nations without explicit approval from the King.Names that contradict Islamic Sharia are also strictly forbidden. Additionally, the rules set limits on the use of the Names of God. Only seven names are permitted for public facilities: Al-Salam, Al-Adl, Al-Awwal, Al-Nur, Al-Haqq, Al-Shahid, and Al-Malik.When naming a facility after an individual, authorities must verify the person’s integrity. This includes reviewing their intellectual orientation, criminal history, and security record, in coordination with relevant bodies. The chosen name must reflect the individual’s status and public standing appropriately.The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing will issue official naming categories after consulting relevant authorities. All government entities are required to comply with these classifications. The final approval of any facility name rests with the head of the respective entity, who may delegate this authority if needed.The regulations also permit the use of numerical designations, either on their own or alongside names, offering flexibility in naming conventions. To ensure coordination and consistency, each entity must maintain a comprehensive database of all public facility names under its jurisdiction. These records must be updated regularly and shared annually with the General Authority for Survey and Geospatial Information.The new framework replaces earlier provisions regarding the naming of streets and squares and overrides any regulations that conflict with the updated rules. This initiative forms part of wider efforts to modernise administrative practices, standardise public naming, and reinforce alignment with religious principles, governance requirements, and national identity.By establishing these clear and detailed guidelines, Saudi Arabia aims to create a unified, transparent, and culturally consistent approach to naming public facilities, ensuring that every decision carefully reflects the Kingdom’s values and administrative standards","The regulations aim to unify naming practices, strengthen administrative oversight, and ensure compliance with Islamic principles.

Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump





ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

Should claimants pay for their own translators?



Tommy Robinson's on immigration





A row erupted over the rising cost of translators in the UK benefits system after far-right, anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson accused the government of wasting millions of pounds of public money on people who ""can't speak English. ""In a post on X, Robinson criticised the use of taxpayer-funded interpreters for migrants and pushed for their deportation: “If they can't speak English, then they shouldn't be here anyway. Absolute p***take. Deport.”His comments came as a new report called for migrants to be banned from using free translation services when claiming benefits. The study was published by the Policy Exchange think tank, according to the Daily Mail. It argues that the ability to speak English should be a basic requirement or bare minimum for accessing the welfare system.The report follows a surge in benefit claims and says the government should stop offering free translators in most civil cases. It describes the benefits system as part of a “social contract” with society and its people, adding: “Part of this is the ability to converse in the official, national language.”According to official figures cited in the study, spending on translation services in civil cases rose by 80 per cent in the three years after the Covid-19 pandemic, reaching £12.8 million last year.Claimants are currently entitled to free translation to help them appeal decisions denying benefits such as Personal Independence Payment and Employment and Support Allowance.The report also says that in future, claimants who cannot speak English should be expected to pay for their own interpreters. It recommends that free translation should remain only for deaf people and for criminal cases, where “freedom and liberty are on the line”.The proposal is to curb the growing welfare bill and reduce the influence of courts over benefit rules. The report argues that courts have gradually expanded the rules on who qualifies for benefits, driving up overall costs. It says Parliament has failed to assert control, with MPs unwilling to reverse decisions made by judges.Spending on sickness and disability benefits alone is forecast to exceed £100 billion by the end of the decade. More than 300,000 young people are now receiving sickness benefits that do not require them to look for work, double the figure from five years ago.Tribunals hear thousands of benefit appeals each year, and the study found that the majority succeed, with up to 75 per cent of decisions overturned in some courts.The report estimates that £750 million a year could be saved by tightening rules around mental health claims linked to travel difficulties.Tommy Robinson is known for his strong opposition to immigration, especially from Muslim-majority countries. He argues that mass migration compromises British identity, security, and social cohesion. In September, Robinson led major anti-immigration rallies in London that included tens of thousands of supporters and sometimes turned violent.","Tommy Robinson criticises use of taxpayer-funded interpreters for migrants.
