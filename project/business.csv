BAREILLY: A 25-day blackout in Soraha village, Budaun district, ended on Wednesday night after a new transformer was installed, bringing relief to 5,000-odd villagers, who had endured freezing winter nights without electricity since the old one was stolen on December 14. The installation of the new transformer comes a day after TOI reported villagers' plight Tuesday.Junior engineer Ashok Kumar told TOI that the replacement transformer had been approved on a fast-track basis and that lineman Naresh Pal and his team installed it Wednesday night.The theft of the 250 kVA transformer left the village struggling with disrupted routines. Villagers discovered the stolen transformer's stripped remains under straw in nearby fields and lodged a complaint at Ughaiti police station. However, no replacement was provided for weeks, leaving residents frustrated.The prolonged blackout hit students and farmers particularly hard. ""Vijendra Pal Singh, a resident, told TOI, ""The entire village is relieved, especially the children preparing for board exams and the farmers who can now irrigate their fields without incurring extra costs on generators.""Sobran Singh, another villager, added, ""We couldn't leave for another village or stay with relatives in the city because we feared thieves. If they can steal a transformer, they could easily break into our homes and take valuables in our absence.

NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a fresh FIR against Congress MP Karti Chidambaram, son of former finance minister P Chidambaram. The case revolves around allegations that Karti helped Diageo Scotland, a UK-based alcoholic beverage company, circumvent a ban on duty-free sale of its Johnnie Walker whisky in India.Vasan Health Care, Diageo Scotland and Sequoia Capital too have been named as accused in the fresh case.A preliminary enquiry in the case was initiated in 2018, which probed the processing and approval of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearances.The new FIR alleges corruption in lifting the ban imposed on Diageo Scotland for sale of duty-free liquor in India in 2008 besides FIPB clearance to Sequoia Capital. It alleges that Karti received bribes through Vasan Health Care to grant FIPB clearance to Sequoia Capital.According to CBI, Diageo Scotland had been importing duty-free Johnnie Walker whisky into India until April 2005, when India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) imposed an embargo on the sale of Diageo's duty-free products. This move resulted in significant losses for Diageo Scotland, as 70% of its Indian business relied on Johnnie Walker whisky sales.CBI alleges that Diageo Scotland approached Karti to get the embargo lifted and made suspicious payment of $15,000 to Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt Ltd (ASCPL), a company purportedly controlled by Karti and his aide S Bhaskararaman. The payment was disguised as a ""consultancy fee"".ASCPL has been under the scanner in the INX Media case and another case involving alleged illegal gratification for granting Indian visas to Chinese workers.In 2018, Karti was arrested by CBI in the INX Media case, and his father P Chidambaram was later arrested by both CBI and ED.","CBI has registered a fresh FIR against Congress MP Karti Chidambaram.

NEW DELHI: Four individuals charged with the murder of NIA-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar have been released from custody, according to documents filed by Canada’s department of justice on Thursday.The accused—Karan Brar, Karan Singh, Amandeep Singh, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karanpreet Singh—were charged with murder and conspiracy in connection with Nijjar’s killing on June 18, 2023.Court documents show the status of the accused as “not in custody,” marked with an ""N."" The news of their release comes days after former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s resignation.The incident took place in the parking lot of a Gurdwara in British Columbia's Surrey, where Nijjar, who led the Khalistan Tiger Force , was fatally shot in what has been described as a ""contract killing.""A video of the incident, which reportedly surfaced in March 2024, showed armed men attacking Nijjar as he exited the Gurdwara.Nijjar’s killing has been at the center of strained diplomatic relations between India and Canada. Trudeau had alleged a possible involvement of Indian government agents in the murder, a claim India has consistently denied, calling it “absurd” and “motivated.”India has accused Canada of harbouring extremist and anti-India elements, including supporters of the Khalistan movement.Earlier, the ministry of external affairs stated that Canada had not provided any specific evidence or formal communication regarding the case, despite the arrests of Indian nationals in connection with Nijjar’s murder.The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) in British Columbia, which is handling the case, has accused the individuals of murder and conspiracy. However, Canadian authorities have not presented any evidence linking the accused to India, despite speculation in Canadian media.","Four individuals charged with the murder of NIA-designated terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar have been released from custody.

Poll What’s More Important in Diplomacy? Pursuing Neutrality Maintaining Alliances

NEW DELHI: While the Indian government has invited Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto to participate in the Republic Day celebrations as the chief guest, and an official announcement about his visit is expected any moment now, it would not like him to club his visit to India with a proposed visit by the president to Pakistan.Official sources have maintained for the past several weeks that Subianto will be the chief guest for the January 26 parade, but no official announcement has been made so far about the visit. Normally, the same announcement is made months in advance.Amid this delay in announcement, reports emerged in Pakistan media earlier this week that the president is likely to arrive in Islamabad on January 26 for a 3-day visit. India has encouraged foreign leaders in the recent past to not include Pakistan in their itinerary while travelling to India, and to dehyphenate their ties with the 2 countries.It is learnt that India has raised the issue diplomatically with Indonesia, hoping to dissuade Subianto from flying directly to Islamabad after the R-Day celebrations. The president hopping on a direct flight to Islamabad hours after the Indian military parade will be bad optics for India, given its troubled relationship with Pakistan over a range of issues, not least cross-border terrorism. Subianto had met the Pakistan PM, Shehbaz Sharif, in Egypt on the margins of a multilateral event in December and pledged to enhance economic cooperation between the two countries.With their common focus on political sovereignty, economic self- sufficiency and independent foreign policy, India and Indonesia have traditionally enjoyed strong ties. Indonesia has also emerged as India’s largest trading partner in the Asean region. During the state visit of then Indonesian President Joko Widodo in 2016, the two countries agreed to establish a Security Dialogue in order to develop a comprehensive action plan on security cooperation.Widodo was in India again in 2018 as one of the chief guests for the Republic Day parade, along with the leaders of 9 other Asean member-states. He too had travelled to Pakistan soon after his visit to India.

NEW DELHI: The government has extended invitations to officials from countries that were part of undivided India at the time to mark 150 years of the India Meteorological Department , established in 1875. This includes officials from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Bhutan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.Representatives from the Middle East and Southwest Asia have also been invited to join the celebrations.Pakistan has confirmed its participation, while the IMD awaits confirmation from Bangladesh.A senior IMD official said, “We wanted officials from all countries that were part of undivided India during IMD’s establishment to be part of the celebrations.”The celebrations will include a variety of events such as marathons, exhibitions, workshops, and olympiads. To commemorate the occasion, the finance ministry has also approved a special Rs 150 commemorative coin.Adding to the festivities, the IMD will showcase its first-ever tableau during the Republic Day parade, highlighting its legacy and contributions to meteorology.Born out of necessity during the British era after the devastating Calcutta cyclone of 1864 and multiple monsoon failures, the IMD began as modest weather forecasting entity. Over 150 years, it has grown into a global leader in meteorological research , weather communication, and forecasting.In its early years, the IMD used telegrams to send weather warnings. Over time, it embraced cutting-edge technology, pioneering the use of electronic computers for meteorological research and introducing India's first message-switching computer for global data exchange.India also made history as the first developing country to launch its geostationary satellite, INSAT, enabling round-the-clock weather monitoring and cyclone alerts.","Officials from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Bhutan, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Nepal have been invited to join the celebrations.

Congress vs regional parties: Can INDIA bloc survive internal contradictions?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-vs-regional-parties-can-india-bloc-survive-internal-contradictions/articleshow/117093169.cms,"NEW DELHI: Has INDIA bloc become a burden for the opposition parties? The anti-BJP alliance which was launched with much fanfare and anticipation in the run up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections seems to be gasping for breath. Every assembly election since the formation of the INDIA bloc has brought to fore the internal contradictions within the alliance - with several allies at the national level being rivals in the states.The Congress , which leads the alliance at present, has increasingly faced resistance from some of the regional parties, especially after its dismal electoral performance in Haryana and Maharashtra.The latest round of tussle within the coalition in Delhi has taken an ugly turn with the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal 's AAP engaging in an open war of words, accusing and targeting each other - much to the discomfort of other alliance partners.On Thursday, Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah expressed dismay over the lack of clarity regarding the leadership and agenda of the INDIA bloc and said the alliance should be wound up if it was meant only for parliamentary elections.""After the assembly elections in Delhi, they should call all the alliance members for a meeting. If this alliance was only for the parliamentary elections, it should be wound up, and we will work separately. But if it is meant for assembly elections as well, we will have to sit together and work collectively,"" Abdullah said.His remarks come amid assertions by the Congress and RJD, another key partner of the alliance in Bihar, that INDIA bloc was formed only for coordination during the Lok Sabha elections.Congress leader Pawan Khera on Thursday reiterated that INDIA bloc was formed exclusively for Lok Sabha elections and asserted that the party is gaining significant momentum ahead of the Delhi assembly elections ""The INDIA bloc was formed for the Lok Sabha elections at the national level. Based on the situation in different states, whether it is the Congress or regional parties, they decide independently, whether to fight together or separately,"" Khera said.According to reports, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav had recently told reporters that there was nothing unusual about the Congress and AAP fighting separately in Delhi, where they had come together ""only for the Lok Sabha polls"".His remarks assume significance as assembly elections are due in Bihar towards the end of this year and the RJD and the Congress are in alliance in the state. The relationship between the two parties was strained recently when RJD supremo Lalu Prasad backed Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee's claim for leadership of the INDIA bloc and made light of any objections that Congress could have over this.The two parties have already started posturing over seat sharing with some Congress leaders citing the party's strike rate in Lok Sabha elections to seek parity in seat sharing in the assembly elections. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the RJD had contested 26 seats and won 4 while the Congress fought on 9 seats and won 3.In West Bengal, the Congress and the Trinamool Congress could never work together as Mamata Banerjee refused to agree to the seat-sharing demands of the grand-old-party.In Kerala, the Congress and the Left parties as rivals engage in bitter politics even as they remain together at the national level and even in West Bengal.However, it's not just the regional parties that have snubbed the Congress. In Madhya Pradesh and Haryana, where the Congress was the dominant political player, the party refused to accommodate the demands of INDIA bloc allies leading to a bitter parting of ways in assembly elections.The Congress, which has ceded its political space to regional parties in several states since 2014, is now desperately trying to reclaim the lost ground. That explains the acrimony that surfaces within the INDIA bloc before every assembly elections. Clearly, the stakeholders need to decide if they want to disband the INDIA bloc till the next Lok Sabha elections.",The anti-BJP alliance which was launched with much fanfare and anticipation in the run up to the 2024 Lok Sabha elections seems to be gasping for breath.

BENGALURU: A day after a drift between satellites caused Isro to postpone its Space Docking Experiment ( SpaDeX ) for the second time, the space agency has managed to put the spacecraft in a slow drift course.“...The drift has been arrested and spacecrafts put in a slow drift course to move closer to each other. By tomorrow (Jan 10), it is expected to reach initialisation conditions,” Isro said Thursday.The space agency, however, did not confirm if it will attempt the docking on Friday or on a later date.Earlier in the day, Union minister Jitendra Singh , Minister of State for Space, met with senior Isro officials — including chairman S Somanath and chairman-designate V Narayanan — to discuss the space agency's ambitious upcoming missions for early 2025.Isro has outlined an aggressive launch schedule for the first half of 2025, including two GSLV missions, a commercial LVM3 launch, and the crucial first uncrewed test of the Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme.Leading the calendar is the GSLV-F15 mission, scheduled for late Jan.

Same-sex marriage: LGBTQs still have option to file curative plea

NEW DELHI: For the second time in two years, Supreme Court has junked pleas for legalising same-sex marriages, with a five-judge bench on Thursday unanimously rejecting a bunch of petitions by LGBTQ+ community members seeking review of the court's October 2023 judgment that had emphatically dismissed PILs seeking the relief.The petitioners had sought a review of SC's order on October 17, 2023, where a bench of then CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices S K Kaul, S R Bhat, Hima Kohli and P S Narasimha unanimously rejected pleas to legalise same-sex marriages, and by a three to two majority, refused to confer adoption rights on queer couples.On Thursday, a bench led by Justice B R Gavai and comprising Justices Surya Kant, B V Nagarathna, P S Narasimha and Dipankar Datta unanimously ruled that the review petitions were ""devoid of merit"" and rejected the pleas for open-court hearing on the contentious social issue, which now stands more or less settled - same-sex marriage will remain illegal unless a law is enacted to make it legit.The bench also held that the majority opinion of Justices Bhat and Kohli, with which Justice Narasimha had concurred, in the 2023 judgment required no interference as the review petitions failed to point out any error in the judgment.This means the majority view of three judges in the Oct 2023 judgment now stands ratified by a five-judge bench through a well-considered order.We have carefully gone through the judgments delivered by Justice Bhat (former judge), speaking for himself and for Justice Kohli (former judge) as well as the concurring opinion expressed by one of us, Justice Narasimha, constituting majority view. We do not find any error apparent on the face of the record. We further find the view expressed in both judgments is in accordance with law and, as such, no interference is warranted. Accordingly, the review petitions are dismissed,” the bench said.However, LGBTQ community members still have an option in the form of curative petition which, like review petitions, and if filed, would be taken up by a five-judge bench in chambers without the assistance of lawyers.In the Oct 2023 verdict, Justices Chandrachud and Kaul had favoured social rights for queer couples while the other three had said it was for Parliament to decide the nature of social rights that could be conferred on couples in same-sex relationships. Several petitions seeking review of the 2023 judgement were filed, leading CJI Chandrachud to constitute a five-judge bench to hear these petitions in chambers.However, after the retirement of CJI Chandrachud and Justices Kaul, Bhat and Kohli, CJI Sanjiv Khanna constituted a new bench to take up the review petitions and consider whether these required to be entertained and whether these should be posted for hearing in open court.The 2023 judgment, despite asserting that queerness was neither urban nor elite, had unanimously ruled that the right to marry was not a fundamental right and the legislature had the power to regulate it in accordance with societal conditions.Unequivocally stating that the legislature alone could effect changes in marriage laws and other consequential legislations to allow same-sex couples the right to legally tie the knot, SC had said it was not for the court to read down or insert words into Section 4 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954, to erase the statutorily essential man-woman component of a valid marriage.Differing with Justices Chandrachud and Kaul on adoption rights to queer couples, Justices Bhat, Kohli and Narasimha had said how queer couples could achieve legal status for their relationships was an issue to be addressed by the legislature.“The modalities of how it should play out, what it will entail etc are facets that the state — here the legislature and the executive — needs to exercise its power in furtherance of. Now, whether this will happen through proactive action of the state itself, or as a result of sustained public mobilisation, is a reality that will play out on India’s democratic stage, and something only time can tell,” the majority opinion had said.Justice Chandrachud had decided to take up the petitions seeking review of the Oct 2023 judgment on July 10 last year by a bench led by him and comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Hima Kohli, B V Nagarathna and P S Narasimha. However, Justice Khanna had recused from the case warranting the constitution of a new bench.","For the second time in two years, Supreme Court has junked pleas for legalising same-sex marriages.

Convict released after 25 years in jail; he was 14 at time of crime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/convict-released-after-25-years-in-jail-he-was-14-at-time-of-crime/articleshow/117064666.cms,"Supreme Court.

Injustice inflicted by courts at every stage: SC

NEW DELHI: Admitting that ""injustice has been inflicted"" by all courts, including itself, in rejecting the juvenility plea of a death convict who had to spent 25 years in jail, Supreme Court on Wednesday directed his release from prison forthwith by holding that he was just 14 years old at the time of committing the crime, a fact which was not accepted earlier by it in four rounds of litigations, manifesting that even SC is not infallible.In this case, the accused was convicted and awarded the death sentence in 2001 in a murder case. He had raised the defence of juvenility by claiming to be just 14 year old and also placed bank account details, but his plea was rejected by the lower court. But his defence of juvenility was also not accepted by high court and Supreme Court.High court and Supreme Court upheld his conviction and sentence despite placing before them fresh evidence of school certificate for his age proof. SC not only rejected his appeal but also his review and curative petitions.Staring at death, the convict was left with no option and he filed a mercy petition with Uttrakhand governor, which was rejected. He thereafter sought mercy from the President, who commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment in 2012 with a condition that he shall not be released until the attainment of 60 years of age.The convict’s mother, with the help of a social worker, thereafter started a fresh round of litigation by challenging the presidential order in high court, which dismissed her plea and she approached Supreme Court, which examined the evidence relating to his age afresh and confessed the mistake done by the courts. During the pendency of the mercy plea, an ossification test was also done by a medical board constituted by Meerut jail on a request made by the convict and it also indicated that he was aged around 14 years at the time of the occurrence.Noting all the judicial proceedings from trial court to SC in its order, a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and Aravind Kumar said, “The facts as narrated above speak for themselves. At every stage, injustice has been inflicted by the courts, either by ignoring the documents or by casting a furtive glance. The appellant, despite being illiterate, raised this plea one way or another, right from the trial court up to the conclusion of the curative petition before this court... The approach of courts in the earlier round of litigation cannot be sustained in the eye of law,” the bench said.Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Sundresh said that in case of a juvenile, the court is expected to play the role of parens patriae by treating a child not as a delinquent, but as a victim, viewed through the lens of reformation, rehabilitation and reintegration into the society.“Thus, a juvenile court is a species of a parent. A delinquent who appears before the court is to be protected and re-educated, rather than be judged and punished. It is for this purpose that the court will have to press into service the benevolent provisions for rehabilitation introduced by the legislature. A juvenile court assumes the role of an institution rendering psychological services. It must forget that it is acting as a court, and must don the robes of a correction home for a deviant child,” the bench said.“We would only state that this is a case where the appellant has been suffering due to the error committed by the courts. We have been informed that his conduct in prison is normal, with no adverse report. He lost an opportunity to reintegrate into society. The time which he has lost, for no fault of his, can never be restored,” the court said, directing Uttarakhand State Legal Services Authority to play a proactive role in facilitating his rehabilitation and smooth reintegration into the society upon his release.Emphasising that it is the primary duty of a court to make a single-minded endeavour to unearth the truth hidden beneath the facts, the bench said “the court is a search engine of truth, with procedural and substantive laws as its tools. When procedural law stands in the way of the truth, the court must find a way to circumvent it. Similarly, when substantive law, as it appears, does not facilitate the emergence of the truth, it is the paramount duty of the court to interpret the law in light of its teleos. Such an exercise is warranted in a higher degree, particularly while considering social welfare legislation.”",Supreme Court on Wednesday directed his release from prison forthwith by holding that he was just 14 years old at the time of committing the crime.

"Up to legislature, executive to decide on barring creamy layer from SC/ST quota: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/up-to-legislature-executive-to-decide-on-barring-creamy-layer-from-sc/st-quota-sc/articleshow/117096653.cms,"Supreme Court

Time now for legislature & executive to take a call: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday expressed its reservation about directing governments to implement its Aug 2024 landmark ruling to bar those belonging to creamy layer within SC and ST categories from taking quota benefits, and also to sub-classify SC/STs to extend the benefit of reservation to the more needy among the two categories. The court said it was for legislature and executive to take a call, reportsAmit Anand Choudhary.But govts have been reluctant to act on the prickly issue, with dominant sections among Dalits opposing the sub-categorisation ruling. Aggrieved by this, an MP resident moved SC, seeking direction to the state to implement the order in recruitments done by it.Advocate Siddharth Gupta, appearing for the petitioner, told a bench of Justices B R Gavai and Augustine George Masih that all govt departments/PSUs must be directed to stop reservation benefits being extended to the creamy layer within SCs/STs.The SC bench, however, said it had passed the order but it was now for legislature and executive to take a decision. “We have given our view that taking into consideration the experience of the past 75 years, such persons who have already availed benefits and are in a position to compete with others, should be excluded from reservation. But it is a call to be taken by executive and legislature,” the bench said. Indicating the court’s limitation, the bench said that the attorney general had a day earlier argued that the court should not interfere in policy decisions.As the petitioner pleaded that govt would not frame policy as family members of policymakers would also be deprived of reservation due to the creamy lawyer criterion, the bench said, “Legislators are there and legislators can enact a law.”Gavai, who was part of the seven-judge bench — and its lone Dalit judge — that passed the landmark order last Aug that permitted sub-categorisation of castes within the SC community, had asked states to devise a framework to identify and exclude creamy layer among SCs/STs from availing reservation benefits. He had said that a mechanism especially suited for SCs/STs was needed, as the OBC creamy layer principle could not be applied to them. “ The state must evolve a policy for identifying the creamy layer even from SCs and STs so as exclude them from the benefit of affirmative action. Only this and this alone can achieve the real equality enshrined under the Constitution,” he had said. The then CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices Vikram Nath, Pankaj Mithal, Manoj Misra and S C Sharma concurred with Gavai.“If a person from such a category, by bagging the benefit of reservation, achieved a position of a peon or maybe a sweeper, he would continue to belong to a socially, economically and educationally backward class. At the same time, people from this category, who after having availed the benefits of reservation, have reached high echelons in life cannot be considered to be socially, economically and educationally backward so as to continue availing the benefit of affirmative action. They have already reached a stage where on their own accord they should walk out of the special provisions and give way to the deserving and needy,” Gavai had said.","The court said it was for legislature and executive to take a call. dominant sections among Dalits opposing the sub-categorisation ruling.

Poll Will Genome Sequencing Data Impact Healthcare in India? No, It Will Take Time to Make a Difference Yes, It Offers Great Potential

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday released the genome sequencing data of 10,000 Indian nationals and said it will be a milestone in the field of biotechnology research .The Genome India Data , which represents the genetic diversity in the country, will be available to researchers at the Indian Biological Data Centre (IBDC) through managed access. ""I am confident this will be a milestone in the field of biotechnology research,"" Modi said in a video-recorded statement played out at the Genomics Data Conclave organised by the Department of Biotechnology.Modi said this national database will facilitate advancements in the treatment of genetic and infectious diseases, foster the development of new medications and precision medical techniques, and enable research into the lifestyles and habits of diverse communities.A genome is the complete set of DNA sequences in an organism and contains all the instructions required for that organism to function, including embryogenesis, growth, responding to the environment, and healing from disease. The primary aim of Genome India is to construct a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variations for India's population that will better capture our unique diversity. Launched in January 2020, its goal is to sequence 10,000 genomes from healthy Indian individuals spanning the length and breadth of the country.The Human Genome - the complete map of all 23 large DNA sequences (chromosomes) that encodes our species - comprises a total of around three billion base pairs contained within the nuclei of each of our cells.According to Martin Carkett and Alexander Honkala, experts in the field, while this sequence of base pairs is virtually identical in every human, differentiating us from, say, a chimpanzee or a mouse, there are nonetheless subtle differences in each of our individual genomes that make us unique. Whole-genome sequencing enables us to read a person's individual genome and, among other things, identify differences from the average human genome that are often associated with disorders and disease but can also be associated with other factors like disease resistance.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi released the genome sequencing data of 10,000 Indian nationals.

As India approaches its centenary of Independence in 2047, our youth stand at the forefront of our mission to build a Viksit Bharat. Guided by the Prime Minister's clarion call to engage one lakh youth in politics with no political background, we have reimagined the National Youth Festival into something extraordinary - 'The Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue 2025 '. This dialogue is not just an event, it's a movement, a vibrant celebration of youth empowerment, leadership, and actionable ideas that align with India's vision for 'Viksit Bharat'.For over two decades, the National Youth Festival has been a symbol of cultural exchange and youthful energy. This year, however, we dared to think differently. On Nov 18, 2024, we announced a ground-breaking transformation of the festival, placing leadership, innovation and nation-building at its core.Central to this reimagining is the Viksit Bharat Challenge , a three-stage competition designed to identify and nurture India's brightest minds. The challenge is rooted in merit, inclusivity and transparency, ensuring every young Indian, regardless of geography or background, has an equal opportunity to contribute.The first stage, the Viksit Bharat Quiz, saw participation from around three million youths across the nation. Conducted in 12 languages, it tested their knowledge of India's progress over the past decades.The second stage, the Viksit Bharat Essay Competition, encouraged participants to delve deeper into pressing issues. Over two lakh essays were submitted, exploring 10 thematic areas, such as leveraging technology for development, embracing sustainability, preserving cultural heritage, and making India a global sporting powerhouse.The final stage, the Viksit Bharat Vision Deck Competition, brought top participants to state-level championships. Here, young leaders presented innovative ideas to panels of domain experts and leadership moderators. This stage emphasised grassroots perspectives and regional diversity, showcasing the ability of young Indians to think globally while acting locally.The journey through these stages has been marked by inspiring stories of resilience & determination. From the hills of the north-east to the villages of Rajasthan and Gujarat to the coastal towns of Tamil Nadu, we witnessed young leaders overcoming societal barriers, logistical challenges and personal hardships to present their visions for Viksit Bharat.On Jan 10, the Viksit Bharat Young Leaders Dialogue will begin at Bharat Mandapam, bringing together 3,000 participants. The event comprises 1,500 participants from the Viksit Bharat challenge track, representing the top 500 teams from state championships, 1,000 participants from the traditional track, showcasing India's cultural diversity through performances selected from state-level youth festivals and 500 Pathbreakers, trailblazers chosen for their ground-breaking contributions across thematic tracks.Participants will engage in cultural and thematic presentations, competitions and excursions to iconic sites like the Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya and the National War Memorial. An exclusive dinner with various Union ministers and MPs will provide a rare platform for informal dialogue.On Jan 11, a grand inaugural session featuring national icons, thought leaders and innovators will take place. This discussion will set the stage for deliberations across 10 critical tracks, led by mentors and domain experts. The evening will see conferring of National Youth Awards and 'Colours of Viksit Bharat' cultural show.The final day, Jan 12, celebrated as National Youth Day to honour the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, will be a defining moment for every participant. The top 10 ideas from thematic tracks will be presented to PM Narendra Modi, providing an inspiring platform for innovative minds to shine.This interaction emphasises India's commitment to involving youth in governance and decision-making. Following this, participants will also have the opportunity to interact with the PM and other eminent leaders, over lunch, fostering meaningful conversations and leaving them with lasting memories.The day will also feature a grand plenary session led by the PM. This session will reinforce the transformative potential of India's youth in shaping a developed India.","Mansukh Mandaviya is minister of youth affairs & sports and labour & employment.

This is India’s decade, chairman’s remarks reflect this ambition: L&T

How much should Indians be working? The simmering debate ignited months ago by Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy backing a 70-hour work week erupted afresh on Thursday, with Larsen & Toubro chairman S N Subrahmanyan evoking online outrage with his comments advocating a 90-hour week and suggesting that employees should report to work on Sundays.""How long can you stare at your wife,"" he is heard saying in a purported video address to employees where he urged them to spend less time at home and more in the office.To back his stand, Subrahmanyan cited an anecdote, referring to a conversation with a Chinese professional. “Chinese people work 90 hours a week, while Americans work only 50 hours a week. If you have got to be on top of the world, you have to work 90 hours a week,” he said in the undated video.The remarks reignited the ongoing debate about leadership expectations, productivity, employee well-being, and even compensation, coming at a time when most CEOs are emphasising the importance of work-life balance. They have again drawn attention to the intense work culture advocated by prominent billionaires and tech honchos, including Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who, despite their different approaches, have all been associated with demanding work environments. While advocating a 70-hour work week, Narayana Murthy had said he does not believe in the concept of ‘work-life balance’.Apart from netizens, some business leaders also questioned the L&T chief’s stand. “Ninety hours a week? Why not rename Sunday to ‘Sun-duty’ and make ‘day off’ a mythical concept! Working hard and smart is what I believe in, but turning life into a perpetual office shift? That’s a recipe for burnout, not success...,” RPG Enterprises chairman Harsh Goenka posted on X.The company defended its chairman’s views. “At L&T, nation-building is at the core of our mandate. For over eight decades, we have been shaping India’s infrastructure, industries, and technological capabilities. We believe this is India’s decade, a time demanding collective dedication and effort to drive progress...,” a spokesperson said.","Larsen & Toubro chairman S N Subrahmanyan evoked online outrage with his comments advocating a 90-hour week.

BHUBANESWAR: PM Modi Thursday delivered a powerful message to the global community, emphasising the importance of peace over conflict and India's historical commitment to non-violence . ""Bhavishya yuddh mein nehin, Buddha mein hai (The future lies not in war, but in Buddha),"" he said during his inaugural address at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas convention in Bhubaneswar.The PM referenced emperor Ashoka renouncing war and embracing Buddhism at Dhauli, near the venue of the convention commemorating Mahatma Gandhi's return to India in 1915.""When the world was expanding empires by the sword, our emperor Ashoka chose the path of peace here. This is the same strength of our heritage that inspires India to tell the world today that the future lies not in war, but in Buddha (non-violence preached by him),” he said.PM Narendra Modi praised the contributions of the diaspora, noting their role in upholding Indian social values abroad. “World representatives praise the Indian diaspora in their country. A reason for this is the social values the diaspora brings to societies there,” he said. “We are not just the mother of democracy; democracy is a part of our life. It’s our way of living. We don’t need to be taught diversity; our life thrives on diversity. That’s why wherever Indians go, they integrate with local society,” the PM said.He urged for the documentation and preservation of the history of the diaspora, particularly Girmitiyas — indentured labourers from British India who were transported to colonies like Fiji, South Africa, Mauritius, and the Caribbean.The PM proposed organising regular world Girmitiya conventions and commissioning academic research, films, and documentaries on their history. “Why not create a database of our Girmitiya friends, identifying the villages and cities in India they came from, and where they settled? What challenges did they face, and how did they overcome them?” he suggested, adding that he would task his team with exploring these possibilities.Modi also underscored India’s rising international influence: “The world listens carefully to India’s voice today.” He cited India’s successful push for African Union to become a permanent G20 member as evidence of its diplomatic strength.","PM Narendra Modi praised the contributions of the diaspora, noting their role in upholding Indian social values abroad. ‘We are not just the mother of democracy; democracy is a part of our life.

NEW DELHI: Amid growing resentment among INDIA bloc members, Jammu & Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah on Thursday questioned the relevance of the opposition combine and said the bloc should be dissolved in case it was just for the Lok Sabha elections . He also lamented the lack of clarity on the group's future.""Unfortunately, no INDIA meeting is being organised, so there is no clarity about leadership, agenda for future strategy or our (INDIA bloc's) existence.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s massive Hollywood appeal and Dave Bautista ’s stunning performance, comes to our mind when we think about the wrestlers who made their presence known massively outside the squared circle.

While Bautista’s box office number might not be on the same mark as The Rock, his role in the franchise Avengers: Infinity Wars and Avengers: Endgame did gross a hefty billion dollars.We have witnessed The People’s Champion grace the roles which are more action-oriented rather than critically perplexed. To note his versatility, he aced his performances in different genres, The Game Plan being a blend of Comedy and drama, and The Scorpion King being a blend of fantasy and action.Bautista has been more recognized for taking on more varied and serious roles. His on-screen performances have been highly praised by critics for opting for more character-driven roles in movies like Blade Runner 2049 and Dune.The Rock is a brand in himself, he is not only a successful wrestler but also a favorite across multiple generations. His own tequila brand Teremana made him stand out as a businessman too.

He holds a dedicated fanbase majorly consisting of sci-fi enthusiasts and movie buffs.The Rock’s net worth is a massive $840 million dollars. The reasons behind this massive net worth are many, from his booming wrestling career to his well distinguished Hollywood career to having his own brand of tequila.Dave Bautista’s net worth is approximately an impressive $16 million dollars.

Over the years, we've tried in many ways to support Annie and help her find stability, following professional advice on how to be supportive without enabling harmful behaviors. To give a sense of our efforts, we have given her monthly financial support, directly paid her bills, covered her rent, helped her find employment opportunities, attempted to get her medical help, and have offered to buy her a house through a trust (so that she would have a secure place to live, but not be able to sell it immediately). Via our late father's estate, Annie receives monthly financial support, which we expect to continue for the rest of her life.

Despite this, Annie continues to demand more money from us. In this vein, Annie has made deeply hurtful and entirely untrue claims about our family, and especially Sam. We've chosen not to respond publicly, out of respect for her privacy and our own. However, she has now taken legal action against Sam, and we feel we have no choice but to address this.

Over the years, she has accused members of our family of improperly withholding our father's 401k funds, hacking her wife, and ""shadowbanning"" her from various websites including ChatGPT, Twitter, and more. The worst allegation she has made is that she was sexually abused by Sam as a child (she has also claimed instances of sexual abuse from others). Her claims have evolved drastically over time. Newly for this lawsuit, they now include allegations of incidents where Sam was over 18.

All of these claims are utterly untrue. This situation causes immense pain to our entire family. It is especially gut-wrenching when she refuses conventional treatment and lashes out at family members who are genuinely trying to help.

We ask for understanding and compassion from everyone as we continue to support Annie in the best way we can. We sincerely hope she finds the stability and peace she's been searching for.

Yogi Adityanath: Prayagraj led India’s spiritual growth but was neglected since Independence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/prayagraj-led-indias-spiritual-growth-but-was-neglected-since-independence-up-cm-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/117103555.cms,"LUCKNOW: Anticipating earnings of around Rs 2 lakh crore from the 2025 Maha Kumbh , chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday questioned the intention of people who are raising objections to the govt expenditure on the event.Speaking as chief guest at the ‘Divine Uttar Pradesh – The Must Visit Sacred Journey’, a conclave organised by The Times of India to celebrate the immense potential of the Kumbh to drive growth and development in the state and to mark the first anniversary of the consecration of the idol of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya , The CM justified the govt’s investment of Rs 5,000 crore on Maha Kumbh.“The arrival of crores of devotees in the state would ensure that much more comes back to the govt,” he said.Drawing a comparison between the condition of religious cities like Ayodhya and Varanasi before 2017 and in the last few years, the CM said, “Before 2017, barely 50 lakh devotees visited Varanasi in a year. In 2024, the city attracted 16 crore visitors. In 2016, 2.83 lakh domestic devotees and 1,200 foreign tourists visited Ayodhya. However, from Jan to Sep in 2024, 13.55 crore visitors came to Ayodhya.”“When a devotee visits UP, he uses transport, eats in a restaurant, lives in a hotel, shops. If he spends an average of Rs 5,000 per visit, by that calculation, only Varanasi earns Rs 80,000 crore,” he said.Yogi said that 40 crore people were expected to visit Prayagraj for Maha Kumbh and the govt was anticipating earnings of Rs 2 lakh crore.“With expected revenue of such a magnitude, what is wrong in spending Rs 5,000 crore in bringing modernity and technology to a cultural and spiritual event. The people who are questioning us are those who feel proud over their association with foreign invaders and not India. They don’t like the development of Ayodhya, Prayagraj, Mathura-Vrindavan or Varanasi. They divide people on caste, religious and regional lines. We should have no expectations from them. As govt, it is our moral duty to organise such an event,” Yogi said.“This (Maha Kumbh Nagar) will be the world’s largest temporary city. At any given point of time, there will be 1.5 crore seers and devotees there. The floating population will be in crores. On Mauni Amavasya, my estimate is that 8-10 crore people will take the holy dip in the Ganga,” he said.“Preparations to handle such crowds started well in time with the agenda of making this Maha Kumbh a clean and safe event. In the past, toilets would be affixed to the sand and the waste would flow directly into the river. Since 2019, our govt planned for zero discharge toilets and waste is being treated through bioremediation and STPs. This year, 1.5 lakh toilets will be available which can be located through smartphones and digital tourist maps,” he added.The CM said that Artificial Intelligence was being used for security and an additional 5,000 acres of land had been earmarked for parking. To provide easy accessibility, shuttle buses, e-rickshaws, battery-operated vehicles and over 8,000 buses of Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) had been pressed into service. “The Sangam Nose has been expanded to deal with congestion,” he said.“Some people might not like how much work has been done. We will make sure that those who are unable to see the work are made to see it,” he said.Terming Prayagraj as an ancient city which led India’s spiritual growth, he said that the city, which propelled some people to the height of power, was left ignored since Independence. “It was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who planned sustainable growth for the city,” the CM said.“More than 200 roads were developed just last year itself. Underpasses were expanded, 14 flyovers were made in just one year and 30 pontoon bridges were constructed in the Mela area,” he said.“Maha Kumbh is a testament to India’s rich spiritual and cultural legacy. The event offers people from across the nation and the world a chance to reconnect with their ancient traditions and cultural roots. Its purpose goes beyond fostering religious devotion, aiming to inspire and guide future generations,” he said.“The upcoming Maha Kumbh will be a grand, divine, and digitally advanced event. Spanning across 10,000 acres, it will set an exemplary standard for cleanliness, security, and modernity. To enhance the convenience of devotees, a digital tourist map will facilitate monitoring the cleanliness of toilets, while an AI-powered security system integrated with smartphones will ensure safety,” the CM said.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath remarked that those unfamiliar with the science of river management might fail to understand that channeling a river enhances its vitality rather than diminishing its natural essence.Lamenting that people did not listen to Rishi Ved Vyas when he said that the path to development would be highlighted through dharma, the CM said had his words been taken seriously, India would not have faced foreign invasion and had its spiritual and religious traditions insulted.“It was finally under PM Modi that one started taking pride in India’s history and their ancestors, "" he remarked.The CM said that when one visited Kashi Vishwanath before 2014, one found it in a pathetic state. “If one visited Ayodhya, one would not want to go there again. Similar was the case with Kumbh in Prayagraj. If someone left for Uttarakhand Char Dham in the past, there was no guarantee of his return,” he said.“This situation was created by those who now question the arrangements and tradition of Kumbh. In 2013, the Mauritius PM visited the Kumbh and went to the Sangam to take a dip. However, when he reached there and saw the filth, he could not believe it was Ganga and went back to his country with tears in his eyes. In 1916, Mahatma Gandhi visited Kashi Vishwanath and when he saw the mess, he said that if someone from another planet reached there, he would think he was in hell,” the CM said.","Chief minister Yogi Adityanath justified the govt’s investment of Rs 5,000 crore on Maha Kumbh. “The arrival of crores of devotees in the state would ensure that much more comes back to the state,” he said. Yogi said that 40 crore people were expected to visit Prayagraj.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117103720,imgsize-30508,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/117103720.jpg"

Risks include heatwaves & agricultural disruption: Report

DEHRADUN: The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), part of the European Union's Earth observation programme, has officially confirmed 2024 as the hottest year globally since records began in 1850. Global temperatures averaged 1.6°C above pre-industrial levels, making it the first calendar year to surpass the critical 1.5°C threshold . Surface air temperatures reached an average of 15.10°C, exceeding the 2023 record by 0.12°C, intensifying concerns about the worsening climate crisis .Scientists attributed the record-breaking heat to human-induced climate change, amplified by the El Nino phenomenon that continued into the first four months of 2024. Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), said, ""All of the internationally produced global temperature datasets show that 2024 was the hottest year since records began in 1850. The future is in our hands - swift and decisive action can still alter this trajectory.""The findings from C3S revealed that the past decade, from 2015 to 2024, was the warmest on record. Every month from Jan to June 2024, temperatures were recorded higher than in previous months.Additionally, all months since July 2023 - except July 2024 - exceeded the 1.5°C threshold. A new daily global average temperature record of 17.16°C was set on July 22, 2024, further underscoring the rapid pace of climate change. Extreme weather events defined the year, with record atmospheric water vapour levels driving catastrophic heatwaves, floods and wildfires across the globe.Canada recorded its second-highest wildfire carbon emissions, while Bolivia and Venezuela reported their highest-ever emissions. Global sea surface temperatures reached an unprecedented high of 20.87°C, further contributing to heat stress and ecological disruptions.The report also highlighted the continued decline in sea ice levels. Antarctic sea ice extents approached record lows, while Arctic Sea ice levels fell well below average later in the year. Greenhouse gas concentrations surged, with carbon dioxide levels reaching 422 parts per million and methane concentrations rising to 1,897 parts per billion. Samantha Burgess, ECMWF's climate strategic lead, warned, ""Humanity is teetering on the edge of the Paris Agreement's goals. These numbers are a stark reminder of the need for urgent, collaborative action.""Reacting to the findings, Anjal Prakash, director of Bharti Institute of Public Policy at Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, said, ""As south Asia grapples with unprecedented temperature rise documented in the 2024 Global Climate Highlights, it is imperative to recognise the profound impact of this crisis on our region. With 2024 marking a critical threshold, we face heightened risks, including intensified heatwaves, flooding and agricultural disruption.""","Global temperatures averaged 1.6°C above pre-industrial levels.

"‘Maha Kumbh is an occasion for peace, soul searching & spiritual enhancement’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/maha-kumbh-is-an-occasion-for-peace-soul-searching-spiritual-enhancement/articleshow/117103673.cms,"Yatindra Mishra highlights Maha Kumbh as a profound event for spiritual cleansing and self-discovery. Experts discuss its impact on UP's religious tourism, stressing the need for sustainable development in Prayagraj, Varanasi, and Ayodhya.

Maha Kumbh is an occasion to cleanse one’s soul, said author and culturist Yatindra Mishra, setting off an insightful discussion on the essence of the grandest religious congregation on the planet.“Prayagraj and Kumbh help one experience self-forgetfulness, ecstasy, truthfulness and the state of absolute bliss or inner freedom. Kumbh is a place to search for one’s own self,” said Mishra.Delving into the topic of discussion — ‘Maha Kumbh 2025: A Maha push to UP’s religious tourism economy’ — he said, “Just as we clean our shoes, mirror, spectacles, we should wash off the filth from our souls at Kumbh. And the Kumbh journey is incomplete without visiting Ayodhya.”“Kumbh’s journey is meant for soul searching and not making reels or posts for social media. What is Kumbh if you merely end up posting pics of holy dips on Instagram. Kumbh’s purpose, metaphorically, is also to discover the lost knowledge, just as Saraswati is lost between the Ganga and the Yamuna in Triveni but still remains significant.”Sharing that the Indian Institute of Management Lucknow is undertaking a study on Kumbh mela, Priyanka Sharma, associate professor at the institute, said, “Places of religious tourism like Prayagraj , Ayodhya and Varanasi hold significance among the people due to their diverse dimensions. Tourism for people now is not limited to holidays in hotels or restaurants, rather it is for peace and spiritual enhancement .”Prof Pravin Singh Rana, who teaches tourism management at the Banaras Hindu University, defined religious tourism thus: “Kashi kabhau naa chodiye Vishwanath darbar; marne par Shankar milne, jiyate langda aam (There are no desires here. Eventually, it’s Lord Shiv everywhere. Only fruits and flowers are needed for sustenance).”Rana emphasised on overall development of religious destinations such as Prayagraj, Varanasi and Ayodhya. “Event specific development needs to change; for instance, Prayagraj will go to sleep post-Kumbh. That should not happen,” he said.Speaking on the need for geological and eco-tourism, Rana shared that UP govt has submitted a dossier on Salakhan Fossils Park in Sonbhadra. “If it is accepted, it will be a major attraction for tourists visiting Kashi. Similarly, outer development of Ayodhya should also be done,” he said.Stressing on staying healthy during Kumbh visit, Dr Lokendra Gupta, head of the emergency department at Medanta hospital and founder president of Society of Acute Care Trauma & Emergency Medicine (SACTEM), said, “Emergency medicine is a life saving subject and we have collaborated with govt and imparted training to paramedics, nurses on saving life during the golden hour.”A team of over 650 experts including doctors, nursing, paramedics all are posted in Kumbh Mela, besides a 100-bed central hospital and six 20 beds hospitals with a separate ICU facility have been set up. “The 2019 Kumbh surveillance showed enhanced cases of lower respiratory tract infections, trauma post animal bites. Time and trained staff are the key to handling such cases and that’s what we are focussing on this time,” Gupta said.","Maha Kumbh is an occasion to cleanse one’s soul, said author and culturist Yatindra Mishra.

OYO , one of India’s most prominent hotel booking platforms, has introduced a controversial new check-in policy specifically targeting unmarried couples. This revised policy requires couples to present proof of their relationship during check-in, a move that has ignited significant debate and widespread reactions on social media. Currently implemented in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, the policy reflects OYO’s attempt to balance local societal norms with its business operations. As the company evaluates feedback, there is speculation about whether the policy will extend to other cities.The revised check-in policy prohibits unmarried couples from staying at OYO partner hotels unless they can provide valid proof of their relationship. According to reports, the new guidelines apply to both online and offline bookings.Discretionary power for partner hotels: OYO has granted its partner hotels the authority to accept or deny bookings based on their judgment. This flexibility allows hotels to align with local cultural and social norms, a critical factor in regions like Meerut, where traditional values often influence public perception.Current rollout in Meerut: The policy is currently being trialed in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh. OYO stated that the decision to expand these guidelines to other cities will depend on the feedback and responses gathered during this initial phase.OYO explained that the updated guidelines are part of its broader strategy to enhance its brand image and cater to a wider audience. The company aims to foster a safe and comfortable environment for its diverse clientele, including families, students, solo travelers, and business visitors.The company also hopes this move will encourage longer stays and repeat bookings by improving customer trust and satisfaction. By aligning with local norms, OYO seeks to strengthen its relationship with its partner hotels while addressing societal expectations.The announcement of OYO’s revised policy has sparked significant debate online, with reactions ranging from criticism to humor. Many social media users expressed disappointment, viewing the policy as regressive and discriminatory. Critics argued that it infringes on personal freedoms and undermines the company’s reputation as a modern and inclusive brand.The policy has also become a subject of jokes and memes, with users mocking OYO’s decision. A popular tweet summarized the sentiment humorously, stating, “OYO is digging its own grave.” These reactions highlight the broader societal divide over issues of personal relationships and privacy.","OYO has introduced a controversial new check-in policy specifically targeting unmarried couples.

Russell Wilson’s Wife Ciara Calls on Fans to Contribute to LA County Wildfire Relief Efforts



Los Angeles is grappling with a nightmarish scenario – multiple wildfires raging across the county, displacing residents and causing widespread devastation. While firefighters bravely battle the blazes, the community has rallied together to support those affected. Grammy award-winning singer Ciara, wife of star quarterback Russell Wilson , has leveraged her platform to advocate for wildfire relief efforts. A champion for positive change, Ciara is a strong supporter of Baby2Baby , a non-profit organization with a history of aiding communities in crisis.The devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County have left a trail of destruction, burning tens of thousands of acres, damaging homes, and displacing thousands of residents. The fires, including the Palisades, Eaton, Hurst, Woodley, Lidia, and Sunset blazes, have been fueled by fierce winds, creating a situation of immense devastation. As of now, over 2,000 structures have been destroyed, particularly between Malibu and Santa Monica, and the loss is still rising.In the face of such tragedy, Grammy Award-winning artist Ciara has stepped forward with a powerful plea for public support to help the victims of the fires. Known for her philanthropic work, Ciara took to Instagram to call for donations through Baby2Baby, a nonprofit organization that provides essentials to children in need. The charity has long been at the forefront of aiding communities in crisis, and Ciara's leadership has been crucial in expanding its reach. During Baby2Baby's November 2024 gala, the organization raised a record-breaking $17.1 million, surpassing the previous year’s total by $5 million.""Every little bit will make a difference!! We are in this together. Donate whatever you can here,"" Ciara shared alongside a link to the Baby2Baby donation page.Beyond her recent appeal, Ciara has a long history of philanthropic work. Alongside her husband, NFL quarterback Russell Wilson, she co-founded the Why Not You Foundation, which focuses on youth empowerment and education. Their foundation has been active in numerous charitable efforts, including a recent initiative in Pittsburgh that distributed 400 coats, books, and winter essentials to children in need. In 2023, the Wilsons donated $1 million to Colorado-based organizations, demonstrating their commitment to giving back. Russell Wilson was honored with the Walter Payton Man of the Year award in 2020 for his extensive community service, including his significant contributions during the pandemic.As the fires continue to ravage the Los Angeles area, the NFL has made adjustments to ensure public safety. In response to the wildfires, the league announced the relocation of the Los Angeles Rams’ wild-card playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings. Originally scheduled for SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, the game will now take place at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The NFL explained the decision as being made ""in the interest of public safety,"" citing air quality concerns, the impact on community resources, and the strain on emergency services. This decision followed a nearby wildfire that erupted close to the Rams' training complex, further emphasizing the ongoing risks.The fire crisis continues to unfold, with over 3.5 million Californians without power and a growing number of casualties. In response, President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration, activating federal resources to aid in the recovery efforts. Organizations across the state are providing vital assistance, and those affected by the disaster are urged to seek help through FEMA’s DisasterAssistance.gov portal.Also Read: Matthew Stafford Speaks on Rams’ Playoff Focus as Los Angeles Wildfires Force Game Relocation to Arizona As communities face the aftermath of these devastating wildfires, the collective effort to rebuild and support those affected continues.
