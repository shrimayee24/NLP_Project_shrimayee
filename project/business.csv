Rainmakers at work: Decoding the hope and hype of cloud seeding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rainmakers-at-work-decoding-the-hope-and-hype-of-cloud-seeding/articleshow/125211967.cms,".

Delhi’s ₹3.2 Crore Cloud Seeding Mission Falls Flat, Experts Cite Low Moisture and Weak Clouds

In Hindu mythology, mortals prayed and performed elaborate rituals to please Indra, the god of rain. Legend has it that musician Tansen's melodious voice could summon showers from cloudless skies. Ordinary mortals, however, have neither the Ashvamedha yagna nor Tansen's tenor. In modern India, a new kind of rainmaker relies on science, not song to coax moisture from the sky. While Dilliwalas' hopes of a downpour may have dried up after this week's failed experiment, this handful of rainmakers remain convinced that the science of cloud seeding works - when used the right way.Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old technique of weather modification that involves dispersing particles like silver iodide or calcium chloride into moisture-bearing clouds to stimulate rainfall. Research has shown that it can enhance rain by 18-46% and help prevent drought, water scarcity and related problems. It has been used with varying degrees of success across the world, particularly in China and the US. In India, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, has conducted cloud seeding experiments and research since the 1970s, but it was only in 2003 that states began on-ground experiments in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for rain enhancement.This is the first time cloud seeding has been used to tackle pollution.Bengaluru-based Agni Aero Sports Adventure Academy has worked with Maharashtra, Andhra and Rajasthan for rain enhancement since 2003. Its founder Arvind Sharma, a trained microlight aviator, says the Delhi experiment may have done more harm than good. ""Cloud seeding cannot create rain. It can enhance rain under specific weather conditions including cloud formation and moisture. It is no surprise that the project has failed,"" he says.Helmed by Sharma, the company has run projects in rain-shadow areas of Andhra and Maharashtra that come with their own set of challenges. ""Pilots are trained to stay away from turbulence to protect passengers and the craft. In cloud seeding, we not only go seeking turbulence but also go right into the clouds,"" Sharma says, explaining how the plane needs to be at close range to inject the clouds with the chemical.Prakash Koliwad, founder of Kyathi Climate, which has run projects with IITM Pune and worked on several missions in Maharashtra and Karnataka between 2015 and 2019, says there has been 30 years of research in the field, establishing it as sound science. He argues that if used well, it is not as exorbitant as it is being made out to be. ""The Maharashtra govt spends Rs 4,000-5,000 crore in drought relief every year and must combat problems like farmer distress and suicide. If they spend 0.1-0.2% of that amount at the beginning of the monsoon season to enhance rainfall, they will no longer have to face angry farmers or distress,"" he says.So why has this technique not become more popular? Suman Akkaraju, CEO of Siri Aviations, attributes it to lack of awareness. ""Cloud seeding is still viewed as an experimental approach by many. Awareness, regulatory clearances, and public understanding take time. But with more proven outcomes and better data, adoption is slowly increasing.""The Delhi govt is reported to have spent Rs 65 lakh a day, while projects that run for several months can cost Rs 30-40 crore. A more cost-effective method was recently deployed by Rajasthan, billed as India's first drone-based cloud seeding. However, that too, has a patchy track record. In Aug-Sept this year, the govt used drones to create artificial rain to revive Ramgarh lake with no success.Though a bit of a damp (or dry) squib in India, the technology has found favour abroad. The first pioneering attempt was documented by Vincent Schaefer in 1946, who used dry ice to increase snowfall. The US has used cloud seeding in mountainous areas since the 1950s to increase snowfall and even deployed it in Operation Popeye, a secret five-year US military programme during the Vietnam War, meant to lengthen the monsoon season and disrupt enemy movement. Cloud seeding was also used at the 1980 Moscow and 2008 Beijing Olympics, though it wasn't to make it rain but to prevent it. It was reportedly used even at the 2012 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. China and UAE have invested heavily to tackle drought.Back home, environmental experts have dismissed the cloud seeding exercise as ""theatrics"" that fail to address the root causes of air pollution. Gufran Beig, of the National Institute of Advanced Studies and founder-director of SAFAR, says cloud seeding is a highly specialised scientific project that must be executed with care. ""Even in the most favourable conditions, the probability of success is 50-60%, which is before and post-monsoon season. The probability at this time of year goes down to 10%,"" he says.","Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old technique of weather modification.

Experts: Deaths due to chronic diseases can be prevented,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-deaths-due-to-chronic-diseases-can-be-prevented/articleshow/125211894.cms,".

Chronic diseases account for nearly three-fourths of all global deaths. Experts say many of these deaths can be prevented, with lifestyle changes, timely diagnosis and management, and in many cases, preventive vaccination.While childhood vaccination has increased significantly, experts say, there are still few takers for adult vaccination.According to Lauriane Harrington, medical director, global medical affairs of GSK - one of the world's leading biopharma companies - vaccines are available to prevent diseases like influenza, RSV, shingles and pneumococcal pneumonia but their uptake is low.RSV or Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a common respiratory virus that typically causes mild, cold-like symptoms. However, Harrington said, it can lead to serious lung infections, especially in infants and older adults, whereas shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a painful condition caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus - the same virus that causes chickenpox.""Prevention is the best investment - for people, health systems, societies, and economies,"" Kristina Ostertag, head of global communications and govt affairs, commercial vaccines at GSK, added.She was speaking at GSK's Global Media Days at Wavre site in Belgium.""Vaccination is one of the most effective tools we have to protect older adults, yet adult immunisation remains under-prioritised,"" Otavio Cintra, regional medical affairs Lead at GSK, said.He added that govts and health systems needed to integrate adult vaccination into broader public health strategies. GSK, he said, is also investing in next-generation vaccine technologies, including mRNA and MAPS platforms, to address evolving health threats.","Vaccines are available to prevent diseases like influenza, RSV, shingles and pneumococcal pneumonia but uptake is low.

Hundreds of cops resign ahead of Zohran Mamdani’s term in NYC: ‘How do you work for a mayor who wants to defund police?’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hundreds-of-cops-resign-ahead-of-zohran-mamdanis-term-in-nyc-how-do-you-work-for-a-mayor-who-wants-to-defund-police/articleshow/125193007.cms,"‘CITY THAT DEVOURS MAYORS’: Zohran Mamdani Faces BRUTAL Reality Of Running NYC | EXPLAINED

Workforce in numbers







New York City police officers are leaving the force in growing numbers, with morale sinking ahead of socialist Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral inauguration, according to the New York Post.NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year, according to Police Pension Fund data.“Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro. “You have a person who is supposed to be running New York City that does not believe in law enforcement. What’s coming out of everyone’s mouth is, ‘We’re in trouble.’”The Police Benevolent Association warned that attrition could worsen. “Every single month, we’re losing enough cops to staff an entire precinct,” PBA President Patrick Hendry said. “It will certainly get worse if our city leaders don’t work with us to fix our unsustainable workload, our expired contract and the constant second-guessing that is driving good cops away from the job.”New hires have helped cover up some losses. The NYPD has recruited 2,911 new officers this year, the highest in a single year since 2006, with the next class scheduled for December. The department currently has 33,745 uniformed officers, down slightly from 33,812 in 2024. Peak staffing was 40,285 in 2000, according to Independent Budget Office data.Concerns are mounting that Mamdani’s proposed reforms could further strain the force. The mayor-elect wants to create a Department of Community Safety to dispatch mental health professionals to crisis calls and shift disciplinary power to the Civilian Complaint Review Board.“How’s that going to work when the person pulls out a gun or a knife?” a Bronx cop asked.Former and current officers voiced frustration at Mamdani’s past comments calling cops racist and homophobic. “How do you work for somebody who considers you racist and anti-queer and wants to defund the police? Things are hard enough already. If you’re eligible to leave, why would you want to stay in that situation?” said a retired officer.A police union consultant warned recruitment could become increasingly difficult. “Nobody wants to be a New York City cop. It’s not worth the money, the stress, the danger, especially working for a mayor who wants to take the department apart,” the source told the New York Post.","NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year. “Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125193072,imgsize-1148308,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

: Foreign nationals seeking to immigrate to the United States could now be denied visas and green cards based on pre-existing chronic health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, under new guidance issued by the Trump administration.The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.A cable sent by the State Department to visa officers instructs them to flag applicants whose medical conditions could require ""hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care."" The list of conditions cited includes, but is not limited to cardiovascular diseases; respiratory diseases; cancers; diabetes; metabolic diseases; neurological diseases; and mental health conditions.The guidance also specifically advises officers to consider conditions like obesity, noting that it can lead to costly complications such as asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure. All these chronic illnesses are now being assessed as potential indicators that an individual might become a future financial burden on the United States.The policy shift, revealed on Thursday, is one of the most aggressive moves in the administration’s broader immigration crackdown, effectively linking an applicant’s health status to their eligibility for entry.It was not immediately clear if the directive applies to tourist and student visas. While it technically applies to all visa applicants, including those seeking non-immigrant visas for tourism (B-1/B-2) and studies (F1), it is expected to be primarily used for those seeking to permanently reside in the US.As things stand, tourist visa applicants are required to demonstrate they have sufficient financial means for their trip; they intend to leave the US at the end of their authorized stay; and they will not become a ""public charge"" during their temporary visit.At the heart of the new guidance is a stricter interpretation of the ""public charge"" rule—a century-old immigration provision designed to exclude those likely to become primarily dependent on government assistance. While health screenings have always been part of the visa process, traditionally focusing on communicable diseases like tuberculosis, the new directive vastly expands the list of conditions to be considered.Immigration advocates warn that the new rules grant consular officers, who lack medical expertise, sweeping authority to make subjective judgments about an applicant's long-term health since no one is expected to disclose their ailments in visa applications.Also read: Getting US visa could soon be harder for many – Who's affected? Under the new framework, visa officers are explicitly instructed to determine whether applicants have the financial resources to cover the costs of such long-term medical care ""over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.""Immigration experts contend that this policy will dramatically reduce legal immigration for older applicants and those with common chronic illnesses. Effectively, the policy will favor the wealthiest and healthiest applicants.","The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.

Chennai: At least 136 MBBS seats in the state, including 22 in govt medical colleges and nine seats in AIIMS-Madurai, were vacant after three rounds of counselling by Centre's medical counselling committee, as students who were allotted seats did not join the respective institutions.

The city woke up to a chilly Saturday covered in a blanket of smog on Saturday as the air quality deteriorated to 'very poor' levels, with several areas slipping into the 'severe' category and many others on the verge. It was also Delhi's lowest minimum temperature for the month so far at 11C, three notches below normal. The capital's overall AQI stood at 337 at 9am, rising to 343 by noon. By 4pm, it settled at 361 - among the worst readings this season - and was 380 by 8pm. So far this season, the worst average AQI the city recorded was 371 on October 31.Residents grappled with burning eyes, sore throats, and itchy noses amid a thick, choking haze. By late afternoon, more areas had entered the severe category, including Nehru Nagar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Bawana and Burari. The air quality is very likely to stay in the very poor category till November 11.However, Delhi Pollution Control Committee said the city's air quality this Nov has, so far, remained better than the corresponding period last year. Officials said that for six out of seven days, the AQI was lower than last year's readings, adding that unlike last year, when emergency restrictions under Grap 3 were invoked on Nov 13, this year the govt has initiated mitigation steps much earlier.Grap 3 is yet to be implemented this year as CAQM officials state it will only kick in once the AQI turns 400 or worse.Residents have been urged to avoid burning biomass, waste, or wood, especially as temperatures fall and such practices become common for heating. Large housing societies have been advised to replace coal or wood-fired heaters for security guards with electric ones. Construction sites have been asked to ensure anti-smog guns are installed and operational, particularly at projects above five floors, till at least Nov 29. DPCC also said that staggered office timings should continue. CM Rekha Gupta announced that the govt will soon extend Ujjwala benefits to slums, enabling them to switch to clean cooking fuel. The govt has also instructed departments to step up road cleaning, dust suppression and pavement repair.Itchy eyes, sore throat, choked lungs: Air quality takes a toll on residents | page 4Noida: Smog continued to choke Noida on Saturday, with several neighbourhoods waking up to a burning sensation in the eyes, sore throats, and increasing breathing discomfort. As the Air Quality Index (AQI) remained in 'very poor' category, residents said they have stopped early-morning walks, jogging, cycling, and other outdoor activities because of the thick layer of haze that blankets the skyline.CPCB data showed Noida's overall AQI rose to 354, up from 306 a day earlier.""It's impossible to step out for walks anymore. Even five minutes outdoors leaves the eyes and throat burning,"" said Pramila Dhar of Sector 78. ""Parks across high-rise clusters that are usually crowded on weekend mornings remained near-empty today.""Ghaziabad fared no better, with air quality sliding further to 339 from Friday's 314, while Greater Noida slipped from 'poor' to 'very poor', reaching 336 compared to 284.Station-level readings presented a grim picture for Noida. Sector 116 - which covers the 7x sectors - recorded the highest AQI at 357, followed by Sector 125 at 347, Sector 62 at 345, and Sector 1 at 341, all in the very poor range.Nisha Rai, a resident of Prateek Wisteria in Noida's Sector 77, said people in the area have been facing respiratory problems. ""People in the area are suffering from sore throats and breathing difficulties. We don't see water sprinkling being done, and the sky remains grey. We have also stopped outdoor activities,"" she said.Shreya Sharma, a resident of Panchsheel Pratishtha in Sector 75, said the AOA has started sprinkling water on its own. ""There is rampant construction in the neighbourhood, and trucks and dumpers carrying materials create dust. However, there is no official check on such activities. We have advised children to stay indoors during morning and evening hours when pollution levels are high,"" she said.In Greater Noida, Knowledge Park V recorded an AQI of 322 and Knowledge Park III 328, both in the same category.Manish Kumar, a resident of Supertech Eco Village 1, said most roads in the area are covered in dust. ""There is no mechanical sweeping in Greater Noida West, and construction materials are transported and stored uncovered. We submitted a letter to the environment minister on Friday, seeking his intervention,"" he said.In Ghaziabad, Vasundhara was at 388 and Loni 364, in the very poor category, while Sanjay Nagar and Indirapuram were in the poor range at 298 and 278.Meanwhile, Delhi's overall AQI stood at 361 - among the worst readings this season. By 10pm, the hourly AQI was 385 and 20 out of the 36 monitoring stations have turned severe. However, the stricter restrictive measures under Graded Response Action Plan stage-III are yet to be implemented, and only preventive and advisory measures continue under GRAP-II. Officials at Commission for Air Quality Management, however, said stage-III would kick in only after AQI turned 400 or worse.Meanwhile, the city recorded the lowest minimum temperature for Nov on Saturday at 11 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal against Friday's 12.7 degrees.","Saturday was Delhi's lowest minimum temperature for the month so far at 11C, three notches below normal. By late afternoon, more areas had entered the severe category, including Nehru Nagar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Bawana and Burari.

From Sidhu Moose Wala To Canada: Lawrence Bishnoi Gang Expands Threat To Global Punjabi Scene

'Bringing two gangsters back to India a challenge'

NEW DELHI: Indian security agencies have achieved a big breakthrough in their operations against criminals, with the detention of two of most-wanted gangsters -Venkatesh Garg and Bhanu Rana - operating from foreign soil.The detentions were made in Georgia and the US, marking a major success in the effort to dismantle international criminal networks.The first criminal, Venkatesh Garg, was apprehended in Tbilisi. Garg, associated with the gang led by UK-based Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu, is wanted in more than 10 criminal cases, including the high-profile murder of a BSP neta in Gurgaon. Garg, a resident of Haryana's Narayangarh, was living in Georgia and recruiting youth from Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi and other states for carrying out contract killings.Garg's chief Sangwan belongs to Najafgarh in southwest Delhi and is known for running an organised crime syndicate from London, coordinating extortion, murder and arms-related offences. A team of cops from Delhi and Haryana is learnt to have reached Georgia to expedite Garg's extradition. Cops anticipate that Garg will be brought back to India at the earliest to face trial in over a dozen criminal cases registered against him in Haryana and Punjab.The second detention is that of Bhanu Rana, who was taken into custody in the US. Rana is linked to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang. Bishnoi, who hails from Punjab and began his criminal career during student politics, now runs a vast network of hundreds of associates across India and abroad who are involved including heinous crimes, including murder and extortion.The Lawrence Bishnoi gang has been implicated in numerous violent crimes, including murder and extortion, and has recently gained notoriety for operating its syndicate from behind bars.Police investigations have revealed that Bhanu Rana's criminal network is deeply entrenched across Haryana, Punjab and Delhi. His name had also previously surfaced during the investigation into a grenade attack in Punjab.Intelligence suggests that some of Rana's associates based in the US are actively connected to Bishnoi's criminal operations. Indian agencies are now working to secure Rana's swift deportation from the US. Multiple accomplices of Rana have already been arrested in India, and he faces numerous chargesheets in several criminal cases.Sources said these detentions abroad exposed a wider network, as over two dozen Indian gangsters are believed to be operating from abroad, running extortion and smuggling rackets by hiring operatives from India.""The detention of both Garg and Rana is a blow to their respective gangs and underscores the commitment of Indian law enforcement to pursue high-value targets across international borders,"" a senior officer said.Sources, however, pointed out that bringing the gangster duo back will be a challenge given the complex extradition procedure, which requires them to submit a range of documents to probe charges prima facie and establish their wanted status.",Venkatesh Garg and Bhanu Rana are two of India's most-wanted gangsters. The detentions were made in Georgia and the US. Garg is associated with the gang led by UK-based Kapil Sangwan alias Nandu.

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

'Improving Trend':

CAQM

says

GRAP-III

not needed as of now

NEW DELHI: The capital's air quality continued to deteriorate for the fourth day running, with the city's average AQI inching closer to 'severe' levels on Sunday. The day's average air quality index was recorded at 370, in the upper range of 'very poor', the second worst of the season so far after October 30, when the index was at 373.Delhi woke up to another morning of toxic smog but, just as on the previous day, winds picked up towards late afternoon, providing some relief. The average AQI at 8 am Sunday was 391, close to the 'severe' range that starts from 401. By 11 am, the air remained just as bad, with the AQI at 389. The day's official 24-hour average is taken at 4 pm, when the air had improved a bit.The share of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana on Delhi's PM2.5 levels continues to be low, with the figure dipping to nearly 5% from 8% on Saturday.""The wind speed reached 14-15 kmph in the afternoon. While yesterday the wind was northwesterly, coming from Punjab and Haryana, today it changed to westerly and south-westerly. Thus, the fire farm impact,"" said Mahesh Palawat of Skymet.According to the Centre's Decision Support System (DSS), the share of farm fires was 5.3% on Sunday. The share has been less than 10% so far this season while in the past years it has peaked at over 40%.The DSS did not issue any forecast on the impact of stubble burning for Monday. The air quality early warning system expects the air quality to remain within the very poor category.""The air quality is very likely to be in the very poor category from November 10 to 12,"" it stated. The AQI is expected to stay 'very poor' for the subsequent six days as well, the note added.Meanwhile, the Commissioner for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) said that they are not imposing strict pollution preventive measures under Grap-III.The CAQM issued a statement asserting that in the wake of Delhi's daily average AQI hovering around the higher end of the very poor category in the morning, a review meeting was held on GRAP.""However, the sub-committee, while reviewing the current air quality scenario of Delhi-NCR and forecasts for weather/meteorological conditions made available by IMD/IITM, noted that at 10am the hourly average AQI of Delhi was 391... Given that Delhi's daily average AQI has since shown a consistent declining trend, with AQI improving to 370 at 4 pm and further improving to 365 at 5 pm today, with the dynamic model and forecasts for weather/meteorological conditions and AQI by IMD/IITM also indicating the overall AQI of Delhi to stay in the 'very poor' category in the coming days, the sub-committee opined that invocation of stage-III of GRAP is not required at the moment,"" CAQM stated.Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa pointed to a slew of measure being taken by the city govt, including installing sprinklers, fixing pollution norms for industries etc, while attacking the previous AAP govt, stating that while they let Delhi's pollution worsen for 10 years and expect it to be cleaned in 7 months.""The inaction of pollution of 10 years cannot be fixed in 7 months... AAP commented on the location of the Bawana monitoring station, which was installed by them. They spent money on advertisements and not on fixing pollution. We are working to make the situation better,"" said Sirsa.Delhi, meanwhile, continued to feel the chill, recording a minimum temperature of 11.6 degress Celsius on Sunday, which was three degrees below normal. This was marginally higher than Saturday's season low of 11 degress Celsius. The maximum was 28.1 degrees Celsius, which was a degree above normal. IMD has forecast shallow fog on Monday morning, with both maximum and minimum temperatures expected to stay in a similar range.","Delhi woke up to another morning of toxic smog but, just as on the previous day, winds picked up towards late afternoon.

Every Indian Shares Ancestral Roots, No ‘Ahindu’ Exists: Mohan Bhagwat

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Sunday said the Sangh welcomes people from all faiths, including Muslims and Christians, as long as they see themselves as sons of Bharat Mata and part of the broader Hindu society.Speaking at a two-day lecture series titled ""100 Years of Sangh Journey: New Horizons"" in Bengaluru, Bhagwat clarified that the RSS does not divide its members by caste or religion and that its approach is rooted in unity and a shared national identity.Asked whether Muslims are allowed to join the RSS, Bhagwat said, ""No Brahmin is allowed in Sangh. No other caste is allowed in the Sangh. No Muslim is allowed, no Christian is allowed in the Sangha. Only Hindus are allowed. So people with different denominations, Muslims, Christians, any denomination, can come to the Sangha but keep your separateness out.""He explained that the Sangh works on the principle of inclusivity, saying, ""Muslims come to Shakha, Christians come to Shakha, as all other castes from the routinely called Hindu society, they also come to Shakha. But we don't take their count, and we don't ask who they are.We are all sons of Bharat Mata. That is how Sangha works.""Bhagwat also defended the organisation’s legal standing, saying, ""Sangha started in 1925. Do you expect us to register with the British government? Against whom?... We were banned thrice. So, the government has recognised. If we were not there, who would they ban? And each time courts resolved the ban, they dismissed the ban and made RSS a legal organisation."" He added, ""Legally, factually, we are an organisation. We are not unconstitutional. We are within that constitution. So we need not register. Many things are there which are not registered. Even Hindu Dharma is not registered.""Outlining the Sangh’s broader vision, Bhagwat said its mission is to unite and empower Hindu society to build a strong and prosperous India capable of guiding the world through the principles of Dharma. ""We want to unite, organise, impart qualities to the entire Hindu society so that they will create a prosperous and strong Bharat which will impart the Dharma knowledge to the world. Our mission, our vision is an organised, strong Hindu society,"" he said.He also reaffirmed the Sangh’s respect for the national flag, saying, “Since its creation, Sangha has always stood by, respected, offered tributes and protected this Tiranga Dhwaj... There is no question of Bhagwa vis-a-vis Bhagwa and Tiranga.”","Mohan Bhagwat: Sangh welcomes people from all faiths, including Muslims and Christians.

NEW DELHI: India has seen its highest foreign tourist arrival (FTA) growth in percentage terms from Somalia between pre-Covid 2019 and 2024. At over 144%, the poor east African country is the only one to register a triple digit growth rate, surging from 5,044 in 2019 to 12,320 in 2024, according to Union tourism ministry data.Besides this surprise entry, the other countries in the top five by growth rate are Cambodia (81%), Kazakhstan (72%), Vietnam (61%) and Bhutan (47%). Somalia's growth rate would have been higher had it not seen its tourists dip from 16,607 in 2023 to 12,320 in 2024.India had 99.5 lakh FTAs in CY (calendar year) 2024, less than the pre-Covid all-time high of almost 1.1 crore. The travel industry expects to breach pre-Covid numbers either this year or latest by early next year with ""continued focus on visas, infrastructure, and global promotion"", according to Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO) president Ravi Gosain.""India's inbound tourism is witnessing a better rebound this season. Most of our member operators are reporting 10%-15% higher arrivals than last year, driven by renewed interest from North America, Europe, West Asia and Southeast Asia. The encouraging part is the quality of travel with longer stays, higher per-capita spending, and growing preference for experiential and sustainable tourism products,"" Gosain said.Preliminary data and trade feedback indicate that CY 2025 could see 1-1.05 crore FTS compared to 1.09 crore in 2019. With ""continued policy support, especially easier e-visas and India's global positioning, we are on track to surpass 2019 inbound volume by 2026,"" Gosain added.While India is slowly inching up to pre-pandemic levels, the ministry data show FTA recovery is different across regions. Only the Americas (US and Canada) have surpassed 2019 levels.""Asia and the Pacific remained the largest source region, accounting for 43% of total FTAs in 2024 (42.8 lakh arrivals), according to the data. However, this represents a 22.6% decline from 2019, mainly due to continued decline from South Asia (minus 28.6%) and North-East Asia (minus 49.4%). Oceania surpassed its 2019 level by 38.2%, reflecting strong recovery led by countries like Australia and New Zealand, the ministry said.Europe contributed 26.7% to FTAs in 2024 (26.6 lakh) and was just 3.2% lower than 2019 levels. The Americas showed impressive recovery and growth with 23.7 lakh arrivals in 2024. The region recorded a 20.8% growth over 2019 and constituted 23.8% of total FTAs, the ministry said.Africa accounted for 3.4% of FTAs in 2024, with near-complete recovery to 2019 levels. West Asia, contributing 2.97% to India's FTAs in 2024, witnessed a decline of 14.1% over 2019, the ministry said.","India has seen its highest foreign tourist arrival (FTA) growth in percentage terms from Somalia.

Chirag Paswan Accuses Owaisi of Dividing Muslims Through Fear Politics

NEW DELHI: NDA and Mahagathbandhan face the challenge of retaining their bastions and making fresh headways in the last phase of Bihar polls, and much will depend on whether their smaller allies, which will be fighting a majority of their seats on November 11, can deliver after having driven a good bargain from their principal partners.For NDA, Union minister Chirag Paswan-led LJP (RV) is contesting 15 of its total 28 seats - the nomination of one of its candidates was rejected - and Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM (Secular) all six of its constituencies in the second phase of elections.While both Paswan and Manjhi are Dalit mascots of the governing alliance, its Kushwaha face Upendra Kushwaha, too, has a lot at stake as his candidates, including his wife Snehlata Kushwaha, are in the fray in four of the six seats his party, RLM, was allotted.If BJP-JDU alliance has to change its fortunes in Magadh region, where RJD-led MGB had won 20 of 26 seats in 2020, its two key Dalit constituents have to make it count on the 11 constituencies they are contesting in its five districts.A share of 29 seats for Chirag had triggered some heartburn within NDA, and he has often harped on his 100% strike rate in Lok Sabha elections to raise his bargaining power within the alliance.For MGB, Congress is contesting 37 of its 61 seats and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) seven of its 12 seats, of the total 122 constituencies going to the polls on Tuesday.The opposition alliance is banking on Mukesh Sahani-led VIP to swing the Nishad votes, who account for 2.6% of the total population, according to the state's caste survey.Sahani was a part of NDA in 2020, and MGB has walked the extra mile to keep the 'son of Mallah' in good humour, agreeing to his demand for naming him as its deputy chief ministerial choice if elected to power.The Tirhut region has been a traditional stronghold of NDA, and MGB is hoping to push the ruling alliance back there. NDA currently holds 23 of the 30 seats that go to the polls on Tuesday and eight of the 10 in Madhubani district, a part of Mithilanchal region, another bastion of the ruling alliance.Among the various forces at work in these polls, in no region have they drawn more attention than Seemanchal, which has the highest concentration of Muslims in Bihar. Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM is again in the fray there, having stumped MGB in 2020 with victories in five of 24 seats in its four districts.Congress is fighting on 12 seats in this region, as against RJD's nine. NDA had won 12 seats in Seemanchal in 2020, and alliance members believe that if AIMIM manages to draw a section of Muslim votes, then they can do well on the back of Hindu consolidation. However, the calculation guiding MGB is that Muslims will solidly back it this time, and it can significantly boost its numbers by also cornering a section of Hindu votes.Jan Suraaj Party founder Prashant Kishor, too, has run an energised campaign to create a third pole in the state's binodal politics, and a record turnout of over 65% in the first phase of polls on November 6 has made him as well as the two main alliances claim popular support. Which means that a similarly high turnout on Tuesday will only further the puzzlement over who actually is gaining from the enthusiasm of the electorate.JDU was the lead NDA player in the first phase of polling as it contested 57 seats, as against BJP's 48.In the second phase, BJP will contest 53 compared to JDU's 44. For MGB, RJD is contesting 71 seats and CPI(ML) six in this phase amid ""friendly fights"" among its constituents on several seats.","NDA and Mahagathbandhan face the challenge of retaining their bastions and making fresh headways in the last phase of Bihar polls.

"India, China look to restart cultural, people exchanges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-china-look-to-restart-cultural-people-exchanges/articleshow/125211664.cms,".

How it works

NEW DELHI: With the resumption of direct flights between India and China, both countries are looking to resume the high-level mechanism for cultural and people-to-people exchanges early next year.The mechanism chaired by the foreign ministers has met twice so far - in 2018 and 2019 - and its resumption is key to advancing cooperation in a range of areas like tourism, culture, media and academic exchanges.The next, or third, meeting is expected to take place in Delhi. The decision to restart direct air services saw China Eastern launching on Sunday its first Shanghai-Delhi flight, which witnessed 95% occupancy.Since they resolved the military standoff in eastern Ladakh, India and China have taken a series of steps to normalise the relationship.In Hindu mythology, mortals prayed and performed elaborate rituals to please Indra, the god of rain. Legend has it that musician Tansen's melodious voice could summon showers from cloudless skies. Ordinary mortals, however, have neither the Ashvamedha yagna nor Tansen's tenor.In modern India, a new kind of rainmaker relies on science, not song to coax moisture from the sky. While Dilliwalas' hopes of a downpour may have dried up after this week's failed experiment, this handful of rainmakers remain convinced that the science of cloud seeding works - when used the right way.Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old technique of weather modification that involves dispersing particles like silver iodide or calcium chloride into moisture-bearing clouds to stimulate rainfall. Research has shown that it can enhance rain by 18-46% and help prevent drought, water scarcity and related problems. It has been used with varying degrees of success across the world, particularly in China and the US. In India, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, has conducted cloud seeding experiments and research since the 1970s, but it was only in 2003 that states began on-ground experiments in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu for rain enhancement. This is the first time cloud seeding has been used to tackle pollution.Bengaluru-based Agni Aero Sports Adventure Academy has worked with Maharashtra, Andhra and Rajasthan for rain enhancement since 2003. Its founder Arvind Sharma, a trained microlight aviator, says the Delhi experiment may have done more harm than good. ""Cloud seeding cannot create rain. It can enhance rain under specific weather conditions including cloud formation and moisture. It is no surprise that the project has failed,"" he says.Helmed by Sharma, the company has run projects in rain-shadow areas of Andhra and Maharashtra that come with their own set of challenges. ""Pilots are trained to stay away from turbulence to protect passengers and the craft. In cloud seeding, we not only go seeking turbulence but also go right into the clouds,"" Sharma says, explaining how the plane needs to be at close range to inject the clouds with the chemical.Prakash Koliwad, founder of Kyathi Climate, which has run projects with IITM Pune and worked on several missions in Maharashtra and Karnataka between 2015 and 2019, says there has been 30 years of research in the field, establishing it as sound science. He argues that if used well, it is not as exorbitant as it is being made out to be. ""The Maharashtra govt spends Rs 4,000-5,000 crore in drought relief every year and must combat problems like farmer distress and suicide. If they spend 0.1-0.2% of that amount at the beginning of the monsoon season to enhance rainfall, they will no longer have to face angry farmers or distress,"" he says.So why has this technique not become more popular? Suman Akkaraju, CEO of Siri Aviations, attributes it to lack of awareness. ""Cloud seeding is still viewed as an experimental approach by many. Awareness, regulatory clearances, and public understanding take time. But with more proven outcomes and better data, adoption is slowly increasing.""The Delhi govt is reported to have spent Rs 65 lakh a day, while projects that run for several months can cost Rs 30-40 crore. A more cost-effective method was recently deployed by Rajasthan, billed as India's first drone-based cloud seeding. However, that too, has a patchy track record. In Aug-Sept this year, the govt used drones to create artificial rain to revive Ramgarh lake with no success.Though a bit of a damp (or dry) squib in India, the technology has found favour abroad. The first pioneering attempt was documented by Vincent Schaefer in 1946, who used dry ice to increase snowfall. The US has used cloud seeding in mountainous areas since the 1950s to increase snowfall and even deployed it in Operation Popeye, a secret five-year US military programme during the Vietnam War, meant to lengthen the monsoon season and disrupt enemy movement. Cloud seeding was also used at the 1980 Moscow and 2008 Beijing Olympics, though it wasn't to make it rain but to prevent it. It was reportedly used even at the 2012 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. China and UAE have invested heavily to tackle drought.Back home, environmental experts have dismissed the cloud seeding exercise as ""theatrics"" that fail to address the root causes of air pollution. Gufran Beig, of the National Institute of Advanced Studies and founder-director of SAFAR, says cloud seeding is a highly specialised scientific project that must be executed with care. ""Even in the most favourable conditions, the probability of success is 50-60%, which is before and post-monsoon season. The probability at this time of year goes down to 10%,"" he says.","Cloud seeding is an 80-year-old technique of weather modification that involves dispersing particles like silver iodide or calcium chloride into moisture- bearing clouds.

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

NEW DELHI: As air quality in the national capital continues to plunge, several Delhi residents gathered at India Gate on Sunday, demanding that the government take concrete policy measures to curb the city’s persistent air pollution crisis. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Priyanka Kakkar also joined the protest, accusing the government of being in “denial” about the problem.Following the same, several protesters were detained for demanding stronger government action against rising pollution levels. The event, described as a “clean air protest,” called on authorities to implement stricter measures to tackle what participants referred to as an ongoing ""air emergency"" which has pushed the air quality index (AQI) close to 600 in some parts of Delhi - a level classified as ""severe."" Participants said their demonstration was peaceful and aimed at drawing attention to what they described as government inaction on the worsening situation.Speaking to reporters at the protest, Kakkar accused the BJP-led Delhi government of manipulating the data and demanding them to be on ground with the public.“People of Delhi are angry because the government of the national capital is in denial. They are not accepting that there is pollution.Rekha Gupta is sitting in her office-home after ordering 13 air purifiers - she should have been here. This is public anger. Because the BJP government didn’t take even a single step to address pollution and everyone knows it this time. The BJP government should have been with the people on the ground and not manipulating the data” she said.One protester said, “We want policies from the government to take action on the worsening situation of air quality. The AQI is touching heights, it’s around 600. In European countries everyone has the right to protest - here when we are protesting peacefully, no one wants to listen. We are being evacuated and not allowed to protest peacefully here. This is very wrong, we are not hurting anyone.”The resident further added, “All we’re saying is no matter whose government it is, common people are dying. Yet the government is not designing any policies and hiding the data. They are sprinkling water at the data centres. No one is working, the entire work force is in Bihar. What about our lives? Have we taken birth here to die?”Also read: What are you smoking? Delhi wakes up to thick smog as air quality sinks to ‘very poor' Expressing frustration over failed experiments like cloud seeding, the protester said, “It’s been 11 years since they have been in government but they haven't done anything to bring about change. Even the cloud seeding didn't work. That is, anyway, not a solution. We want a permanent solution.”The demonstrator also lamented the lack of public participation in such protests, saying, “Even the public is fast asleep. Many people are here to watch the show, but they are not raising their voices in protests. We demand from the government to take action on the issue and make policies.”The protest comes amid alarming levels of pollution across Delhi-NCR, as authorities grapple with deteriorating air quality ahead of winter.","Several Delhi residents gathered at India Gate on Sunday, demanding that the government take concrete policy measures to curb the city’s persistent air pollution crisis. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Priyanka Kakkar also joined the protest, accusing the government of being in “denial” about the problem.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125202742,imgsize-752453,width-400,resizemode-4/delhi-residents-portesting-against-air-quaility-in-national-capital-ani.jpg"

"Many still sitting on old note stashes, hoping for exchange",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gang-cheats-traders-sitting-on-old-notes/articleshow/125195600.cms,".

GHAZIABAD: Nine years after demonetisation, crores of invalidated Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes remain stashed with people, sustaining a grey market large enough for organised fraud. This became evident from the arrest of eight members of a gang over the last two weeks.The men were allegedly behind a multi-level racket that trapped clients, mainly traders and middlemen still hoarding invalid notes, via social media sites by promising discreet conversion of demonetised currency in exchange for hefty commissions.Investigation revealed that no currency was ever exchanged, and the gang simply collected bundles of demonetised currency and their advance fees before vanishing. Police have so far recovered demonetised notes worth Rs 3.9 crore from their stash.""Most victims never approached police because their own transaction was illegal,"" Trans-Hindon DCP Nimish Patil said. ""The fraud operated through a structured, three-tier chain. The first tier, which included the recently arrested SK alias Sharik and Abhinav alias Rahul Buddhi Raja, handled negotiations with victims and offered assurances of converting the notes at 25% of face value.The second comprised collectors who sourced demonetised currency directly from clients, and the third consisted of couriers who transported the notes to designated handover points. ""Police said the gang used WhatsApp, Telegram and encrypted calling apps to connect with potential clients. Conversations were coded, identities were masked, and SIM cards were changed frequently to avoid tracking. Abhinav, identified as the mastermind, coordinated activities across the chain and handled communications between collectors and couriers.In two rounds of arrests-first on Oct 31 and then on Nov 6 night-cops also nabbed Fakhruddin, Nasruddin, Shubham Chaudhary, Arun Kashyap, Mahesh Prasad and Jitendra Kumar.An FIR has been registered under BNS sections 318(2) (cheating), 62 (punishment for attempting to commit offences), 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) and 3/5 (common intention) and 5/7 of the Specified Bank Notes (Cessation of Liabilities) Act, 2017.Police are now examining the digital trails and financial links between the accused and their clients. Investigators say two to three other suspects named in the FIR are yet to be traced. For now, officers are expanding their focus to traders and middlemen who approached the gang, the very people who kept this underground market alive.""Victims rarely report these cases because they fear legal consequences. That secrecy is what the gang exploited for years,"" the DCP said.","Eight members of a gang were arrested over the last two weeks.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has finally granted permission for Phool Walon ki Sair following the intervention of lieutenant governor VK Saxena, Raj Niwas officials said on Sunday. Last week, the organising body, Anjuman Sair-e-Gul Faroshan, announced that it had decided to cancel the event as DDA did not give permission for the annual festival in Mehrauli's Aam Bagh.The approval has been conveyed to the organisers, an official said. Following reports about the cancellation, Saxena had ordered an investigation. It revealed that the permission was delayed due to a forest and environment department direction on Nov 28, 2023, that prohibits the organisation of such a festival in the area, the official claimed.For a week every year, the centuries-old festival transforms Mehrauli with floral offerings at the dargah of Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki and the Yogmaya temple. Kites fly, qawwalis are sung and wrestling matches are held. Each day, a particular activity takes place. DDA permitted the festival regularly till 2023 and had even facilitated its organisation in 2024, the official said.However, the organisers this time insisted on a written permission, which was issued after LG's intervention.The permission has been given on the condition that no harm will be caused to the environment during the festival, said officials.The organisers said the event would be held in Feb-March next year. ""We have not yet received any written or verbal communication from DDA regarding therequired permission,"" said Usha Kumar, general secretary of Phool Walon KiSair, Anjuman Sair-e-Gul Faroshan. Another organiser noted that while the department earlier gave verbal assurances, there wasn't enough time left for the extensive preparations. LG has urged action against the erring officials. ""He has reiterated that any official found acting in deterrence to public interest will be punished,"" an official said.","DDA has granted permission for Phool Walon ki Sair following the intervention of lieutenant governor VK Saxena.

'Thrust also on

turning waste into wealth

'

NEW DELHI: The government has earned little over Rs 800 crore from the sale of scrap during the month-long cleanliness drive conducted in October, which is enough to buy seven Vande Bharat trains, and also freed around 233 lakh sq ft of space.The past five rounds of the special campaign for cleanliness across central govt offices has generated around Rs 4,100 crore revenue by selling scrap, which personnel minister Jitendra Singh said was similar to the total budget of one mega space mission or multiple Chandrayaan missions.In these drives, govt entities and subsidiaries have cleared 923 lakh sq ft of space. The minister on X said total space freed in the past five special campaigns was enough to bring up a big mall or some other massive infrastructure.In 2021, govt had decided to run a special swachhta campaign from Oct 2 to Oct 31. The department of administrative reforms and public grievances coordinates this drive through collaboration across 84 central ministries and departments.For the intensive drive and success of the campaign, central ministers briefed officers, held interactions with staff and chaired review meetings on reducing pendency. Similarly, tasks were spelt out for secretaries and director generals, which included review of the campaign on weekly basis and for reducing pendencies.Central Public Works Department (CPWD) had to mobilise personnel for cleanliness of outdoor spaces across government offices.Officials said that while every ministry and department must take cleanliness, reducing the number of physical files and pending references as priority, these get special focus during the monthlong campaign and there is a lot of thrust also on how to convert waste to wealth.","The government has earned little over Rs 800 crore from the sale of scrap during the month-long cleanliness drive conducted in October.

'AP probably revisited scheme due to Centre's reluctance to fund it'

VIJAYAWADA: The Chandrababu Naidu-led Andhra Pradesh government has scrapped the contentious Polavaram-Banakacherla irrigation project, which neighbouring Telangana has been opposing, and is planning a new one by utilising Godavari's surplus water to make Rayalaseema region drought-free, reports Samdani MN.The Revanth Reddy-led Congress govt in Telangana has claimed the Banakacherla project would deprive it of its rightful share in Krishna and Godavari river waters. It has also said the Polavaram backwaters pose a serious inundation threat for its villages and infrastructure.The new project plans to take water from Polavaram to Nallamala Sagar, which is part of the Veligonda project in Prakasam district. The scheme is estimated to cost Rs 58,000 crore as against Rs 90,000 crore required for the Banakacherla project.The water resources department has officially revoked all tenders called for the detailed project report. Sources said Centre's reluctance to fund the ambitious Banakacherla scheme seemed to have prompted state govt to revisit it.As per the revised plan, the latest draft proposal has suggested pumping of water from the Polavaram project to the Prakasam barrage and from there, a separate canal would be built to link it with the Nagarjuna Sagar's right canal.Then, water will be taken to Bollapalli reservoir near Vinukonda and from there channelled directly into the Nallamala Sagar reservoir, a key component of the ongoing Veligonda Project.Surplus flows will be diverted to the Somasila reservoir as needed. Banakacherla phase will be considered at a later stage, depending on the completion of the initial phase. The shift reflects a recalibration aimed at accelerating water security for Rayalaseema while avoiding protracted delays and inflated expenses, officials said.","Andhra Pradesh has scrapped the contentious Polavaram-Banakacherla irrigation project, which neighbouring Telangana has been opposing.

PATNA: A child sits cross-legged on the mud floor of a dark hut. His tiny, dirty hands dip into a bowl of rice and watery lentils. Grains stick to his face as he focuses on his meal, oblivious to the harsh conditions that shape his world. Outside, the fields stretch towards the horizon, dotted with thatched huts. When the rains come, snakes from the waterlogged land slither into these homes. Some have died from snakebite here in the past.Next door, a family of seven shares a room the size of a small shop, nine-by-nine-foot. The cracked concrete roof - miraculously held together by rusted iron rods - droops in the middle. Parts of it have come loose, injuring occupants as they fell. Yet, with nowhere else to go, the family continues to live, cook and sleep under it - living in constant fear that the next collapse could prove fatal.These are pictures from a colony of Musahars, a community that makes up 3.1% of Bihar's population. They have long lived on the edges of survival, socially and economically. One of the most marginalised among the Dalit communities, the Musahars (mus means rat) - who commonly use surnames such as Rishidev, Sada, and Manjhi - have historically faced stigma owing to their traditional occupation as catchers and eaters of rats.According to the Bihar Caste Survey 2022-23, nearly 40 lakh Musahars live in the state. Barely 0.3% of them have govt jobs. Nearly 45% live in huts, 29% in khapda or tin sheds, and 18% in one-room pucca houses. Fewer than one in a hundred own a computer or laptop - with or without internet - and 99.6% do not own any vehicle.Vivek Kumar Rai, a PhD scholar studying the Musahars of Bihar at the TERI School of Advanced Studies in New Delhi, said, ""The overall condition of the Musahar community in the state has improved compared to what it was in the 1960s or 1970s, when a majority of them survived on food that was ignored by the dominant communities. In many parts of Bihar, the community remained in bondage for generations.""The Musahars now largely depend on agricultural labour and whatever work they can find. But widespread inequality persists within the Scheduled Caste category.""Many members of the Musahar community in Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, and Samastipur told TOI that the practice of rat-eating has now become ""extinct"", largely because of govt-supplied free rations that are available to most families.But in Fatehpur Bala village in Samastipur district, many Musahar families said they had to bribe officials to obtain ration cards. Rekha Devi, a young mother of four, said, ""My mother-in-law receives ration, but I do not. The amount she gets is not enough for all of us.""Life, as the Musahars have known it - theirs is a community that has long suffered the scourge of untouchability and discrimination - may have changed, but mostly in form. ""It's better than it used to be,"" said Hari Chandra Sada, 42, a resident of the Musahar settlement in the village, ""but people still don't want Musahars to enter their house for repair work.""Community members said they mainly earn their livelihood now as daily-wagers, with most forced to migrate to Punjab, Haryana, Tamil Nadu , and West Bengal for work.A decade ago, and for a brief period, the community found its most visible face in Jitan Ram Manjhi, a Musahar who became the chief minister of Bihar in 2014 and is now a Union minister in the NDA govt. His ascent was celebrated as a rare moment of representation for one of India's most marginalised castes.Manjhi's party, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM), joined hands with the NDA, giving the alliance a dependable base among the Mahadalit groups. Yet, many Musahars say representation has not necessarily brought change.""Where the Musahar community is concerned, Manjhi's rise, along with a handful of other political representatives, has been mainly symbolic,"" said Tanvir Aeijaz, associate professor of political science at Delhi University's Ramjas College . ""Their leadership has not created a broader network of empowered Musahar leaders. The community's visibility in politics has not translated into substantive policy action,"" Aeijaz said.As Bihar heads into the second phase of polling, both the NDA and the opposition INDIA bloc are vying for the Musahar vote. Promises abound: jobs, housing, education, dignity. INDIA bloc leader Tejashwi Yadav has pledged ""one govt job per family"" and vowed to build permanent homes for those living in slums. The governing NDA, on the other hand, has promised one crore jobs, skill centres in every district, and financial assistance for marginalised groups. Both alliances have also pledged better access to education, housing, and welfare subsidies.On the outskirts of Darbhanga, in Dhoi village, about 300 Musahars live in shanties with tarpaulin roofs. Ram Narain Sadai, who lives with 10 relatives in a single room, said, ""We don't have a toilet and have to go to the fields."" Many women here still give birth at home. A handful of families received govt-built pucca houses two decades ago; most are now cracked, their roofs leaking. ""The walls are giving way,"" said Budhan Sadai, a labourer. ""But we can't leave them. Where will we go?""In Muzaffarpur, Vinod Manjhi, a construction worker, said a few hand pumps is all that the 400 people in his settlement have by way of water supply. ""We have not received piped water connections yet,"" he said. Only a few have managed to escape poverty. Bappy Rishi, a block development officer in Kishanganj district, says he's one of the fortunate few. He said reports and surveys show that literacy among the Musahars in Bihar is only around 35%.In 2016, Bihar banned alcohol. In Musahar settlements though, the ban is mostly on paper. In Samastipur, a woman said her husband drinks every night. ""After getting drunk, the men beat their wives over petty disputes. Liquor is available in the village, there is no prohibition here.""Liquor is cheap, often brewed at home, and sometimes deadly. ""They drink what they can afford,"" said Anil Kumar, who lives near a Musahar cluster in Darbhanga. ""It kills slowly, but they keep drinking. It's the only escape they know.""","Musahars are one of the most marginalised among the Dalit communities. They are known for their traditional occupation as catchers and eaters of rats.

BENGALURU: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat Sunday said the organisation is not unconstitutional and that it is a recognised body of individuals which need not be registered with the state.At the conclusion of a two-day lecture series here to mark 100 years of the RSS, BJP's ideological mentor, Bhagwat was responding to accusations that it's an unregistered organisation and to calls for a ban on the organisation and its activities in public places. ""The laws of Swatantra Bharat (Independent India) do not make registration (of RSS) compulsory. We are categorised as a body of individuals... Legally and factually, we are an organisation,"" he said.On questions about the RSS status and Karnataka govt demanding a ban, Bhagwat said. ""We're answering many questions, yet they are asked again and again. We've realised that criticism makes Sangh more famous.""He said successive govts had banned Sangh thrice since Independence.""Courts restored our status all three times. Effectively, the govt recognised RSS and that is why it banned us,"" he said as the audience erupted in laughter.The income tax department, too, had issued notices to RSS to pay taxes, but it was finally exempted by the state as it receives only gurudakshina (contributions) from sevaks, the RSS chief said.Dwelling into the RSS history, Bhagwat dismissed critics' demand for not registering the RSS, saying it was launched in 1925 in British-ruled India. ""Did you expect us to register with the British govt, whom our then Sarasanghchalak was fighting?"" he said.Responding to Bhagwat's remarks, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah said his govt hasn't banned RSS.

How Trump reacted?

Thune says 'the deal is coming together'



What is in the deal?



What would be next step if vote succeeds





US senators on Sunday reached an agreement to reopen the government after 40 days, signaling an end to the lengthy shutdown.A group of at least eight Senate Democrats, in consultation with Senate GOP leaders and the White House, reportedly reached a deal on Sunday to end the 40-day US government shutdown in exchange for a future vote on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.The Senate is expected to vote on the proposal between 8:30 and 9 pm ET (7:30 am IST Monday).President Donald Trump, who arrived at the White House from the Commander’s game, told reporters that the shutdown will end soon.""Looks like we're getting very close to the shutdown. We'll never agree to give any substantial money or any money to really prisoners, illegals that come into our country,"" Trump said."" And I think the Democrats understand that. And it looks like we're getting close to the shutdown ending. You'll know very soon,"" he added.Senate Republican Leader John Thune said a test vote was “coming together” as he prepared to put forward a narrow spending package. He cautioned, “We’ll see kind of where the votes are. This kind of stuff can drag on indefinitely if you allow it to.” He told reporters earlier that the chamber planned to vote on the House-passed funding measure to reopen the govt, along with a handful of year-long funding bills.The procedural motion has fallen short of the 60-vote threshold 14 times.According to CNN and CBS News, the deal was led by Sens Angus King of Maine, and Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, in coordination with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House.Under its terms, the Senate would vote on a Democrats’ bill concerning the Affordable Care Act by the end of the second week of December. The agreement also calls for the reversal of all shutdown-related layoff notices and extends the stopgap funding measure through January, among other provisions.Meanwhile, NBC news reported that the agreement contains a package of bills, known as a “minibus” — three full-year appropriations bills that will fund certain departments like Agriculture through the end of the fiscal year next fall — and a continuing resolution to fund the rest of the govt at existing spending levels through January 30.It also fully funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, once known as food stamps, through next September, a major flashpoint in the shutdown, according to sources. The sources said the deal also reverses Trump’s attempted layoffs of federal workers during the shutdown through RIFs, or “reduction in force” notifications.As per NBC, in a major concession from Democrats, it does not include an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Allowing the funds to lapse would raise insurance premiums for millions of Americans unless they are extended. Instead, the Democrats settled for a promise that the Senate will vote on a bill to extend the subsidies by the end of the second week of December, with the outcome uncertain, two of the sources said.Even if Sunday’s vote succeeds, the shutdown may not end immediately. House Democrats would need to approve the package, and their support was not assured. The Associated Press reported that necessary Democratic backing remained uncertain, in part because many Democrats continue to demand a one-year extension of the ‘Obamacare’ subsidies for low-income Americans in return for reopening the govt.Republicans need only five Democratic votes to clear the Senate threshold, and around 10 to 12 Democrats have been involved in the talks. Critics within their ranks have said the emerging deal falls short. If the Senate passes the amended package, it must still clear the House of Representatives and be signed by President Trump, a process that could take several days.","US senators on Sunday reached an agreement to reopen the government after 40 days, signaling an end to the lengthy shutdown.

'You Dispute, But...': Justice Alito Grills Dem Attorney On Trump Emergency Powers In Tariffs Case

How to get the tariff dividend? Who will get it?







President Donald Trump Sunday again promised tariff dividend to Americans which will possibly be a payout to every American straight from the money America will be raising from its tariffs. This is not the first time that Trump floated the idea but this time he specified the amount and also spelt out the condition that high-income people will not get it. “A dividend of at $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” the president said on his Truth Social platform. He added that those against the tariffs are “FOOLS!”Such a proposal would likely need to be passed by Congress. This summer, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) introduced legislation to give $600 tariff rebates to nearly all Americans and their dependent children.""We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 Trillion. Record Investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place,"" Trump posted.The doubling down on tariffs from the President came as the Supreme Court, earlier this week, heard arguments on tariffs, whether they were legally imposed.Judges were concerned that tariffs acted as a revenue-raising tax as opposed to a mechanism to solve any emergency caused by a trade imbalance. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the tariff case.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, in an interview with ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday, said the tariffs were not about ""taking in the revenue,"" but rather were intended to re-balance trade.This is the first time that Trump specified the amount of $2000 as a tariff dividend. Earlier, he suggested that Americans may get an amount between $1000 and $2000 as the dividend. It is not yet clear how the administration will give it.The proposal sounds like stimulus checks, which are direct payments from the government to taxpayers during an economic slowdown to encourage taxpayers to spend money.Though most of the details are unclear, one clarity that Trump's Truth Social post offered was that high-income people would not receive it.","Trump said every American, excluding high-income people, will get $2K as tariff dividend.

Supporting a flexible economy





The freelance visa explained





Maintaining market integrity









The United Arab Emirates is tightening the review and auditing procedures for freelance visas, also known as the “Green Residency,” to safeguard the labour market and uphold the integrity of a rapidly evolving talent economy. Authorities emphasise that despite circulating social media rumours, the issuance of these visas continues uninterrupted, reflecting the country’s commitment to supporting independent professionals while preventing misuse, according to Emarat Al YoumAs reported by Emarat Al Youm, Lieutenant General Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of Dubai's General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs (GDRFA), addressed concerns over recent rumours suggesting a suspension of freelance visas. Speaking to the media, he categorically dismissed such claims, confirming that freelance permits are being issued normally through official channels.Al Marri explained that the tightening of auditing procedures follows the detection of a few isolated cases of misuse, including attempts to trade visas illegally. These measures, he said, are necessary to protect the labour market and ensure the integrity of the system.He also noted that the recent surge in rumours coincided with heightened demand for freelance visas.The UAE continues to emphasise its transition towards a flexible and independent economy, according to Al Marri. The government’s objective is not to restrict opportunities but to regulate the market in a way that serves the interests of all stakeholders.He underscored that the UAE remains a highly attractive environment for investors and skilled professionals. Rumours surrounding freelance visa suspension, he stressed, should not undermine societal or investor confidence in the country’s business and talent ecosystem.The “Green Residency” or Freelance Visa is a key initiative aimed at nurturing the talent economy and enabling self-employment. The scheme allows applicants, both local and international, to carry out professional activities legally without the need for a traditional employer or guarantor.Eligible professionals – including journalists, designers, translators, and technology experts, can apply for freelance licences through approved platforms, allowing them to manage projects independently. Visa holders receive legal residency and the permits necessary to conduct business. However, the visa does not confer the right to sponsor other individuals or employ workers under one’s name.Al Marri highlighted that recent enforcement actions were limited but essential. “A few cases of misuse or illegal trading of visas were detected, and appropriate measures were implemented to safeguard the labour market,” he said. This approach reflects the UAE’s dual commitment to flexibility and discipline, ensuring that opportunities for independent professionals remain robust while preventing abuse of the system.The government continues to monitor the freelance sector closely, signalling a proactive approach to balancing economic innovation with regulatory oversight. This vigilance is particularly crucial as demand for freelance visas grows, reflecting both the rising prominence of the talent economy and the UAE’s growing appeal as a global hub for entrepreneurial activity.","The United Arab Emirates is tightening the review and auditing procedures for freelance visas, also known as the “Green Residency,” to safeguard the labour market and uphold the integrity of a rapidly evolving talent economy.

Lenskart Solutions entered the Dalal Street on Monday, making a muted debut. After listing, the eyewear giant will be available for trading on both benchmark indices, NSE and BSE.The Lenskart Solutions share listed at Rs 390 on the BSE, offering a discount of 3% on its IPO price, after closing one of the year’s most keenly watched public issues.The stock was trading at Rs 390 or down 2.8% on the NSE and at Rs 389, or down 3% on the BSE at 10:07 AM IST.The share made its debut at Rs 390 on the BSE, while it opened slightly higher at Rs 395 on the NSE.Pre-listing sentiment around Lenskart Solutions cooled, as the grey market premium shrank to 2%.The eyewear retailer’s Rs 7,278 crore IPO saw overwhelming investor participation, but excitement appeared to have cooled in the run-up to its listing. In early morning indications, the grey market premium (GMP) slipped to roughly 2%, suggesting that the stock may list only slightly above its issue price.The IPO, priced between Rs 382 and Rs 402 per share, was subscribed 28 times overall. Investors bid for 281.88 crore shares against the 9.97 crore shares on offer, according to data from the exchanges.The Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIB) segment led the demand, with subscription at 40.35 times, while the non-institutional investors (NIIs) category saw bids 18.23 times the allocation. Retail participation was also strong, despite the higher price range.The offer consisted of fresh issue of shares worth Rs 2,150.74 crore and an offer for sale totalling Rs 5,128.02 crore. The lot size was fixed at 37 shares. Post-issue, Lenskart’s total share count increased from 1,68,10,15,590 shares to 1,73,45,16,686 shares.Despite the strong subscription numbers, analysts have expressed concerns over valuations. Earlier this week, Ambit Capital initiated coverage on Lenskart with a “Sell” rating and a target price of Rs 337, signalling a potential 16% downside from the issue price. The brokerage, as cited by ET, noted that although the company’s topline could grow around 20% CAGR between FY25 and FY28, the “capex-heavy model, thin free cash flows, and low returns on capital (RoCE of ~9%) make its valuation difficult to justify. ”SBI Securities also urged caution saying, “Valuation of Lenskart seems stretched and hence listing gain is likely to be muted. However, looking at the robust business model, the company is well placed to encash on the fast-growing domestic organized eyeglasses market.”Meanwhile, Nirmal Bang hailed Lenskart’s “resilient business model,” highlighting that it is supported by its centralised manufacturing and rising international presence.“Lenskart enjoys strong competitiveness in the Indian eyewear market by leveraging innovation, technology, and an omnichannel strategy that keeps it cost-efficient in a fragmented industry,” the brokerage noted.At the upper end of the price band, the company is valued at 10.1 times FY25 EV/Sales and 68.7 times EV/EBITDA. However, profitability trends have been improving as the company’s EBITDA margin rose from 7% in FY23 to 14.7% in FY25.The company operates over 2,700 stores globally, including 2,000 in India, and has scaled its footprint across Singapore, the UAE and the United States. Over the past two years, revenue rose at a 32% CAGR to reach Rs 6,653 crore in FY25. EBITDA increased 3.7 times to Rs 971 crore during the same period, and the company posted a profit of Rs 297 crore in FY25, a sharp turnaround from a loss of Rs 64 crore two years ago.","Lenskart Solutions share listed at Rs 390 on the BSE, offering a discount of 3% on its IPO price.

Davante Adams’ contracts, earnings and real-world value fuel his $45 million net worth

More coverage on NFL:

Davante Adams’ financial story isn’t just about being paid like a star wide receiver. It’s about how he built a portfolio, reputation, and demand in a league where value can disappear overnight. The NFL has always rewarded playmakers, but it rarely rewards them this consistently. From Palo Alto High to Fresno State to becoming one of the faces of the modern passing era, Adams has never been a storyline guy, he’s been a production guy.That consistency has turned into something far larger than highlight catches. As per Celebrity Net Worth, his 2025 net worth, widely estimated around $45 million, shows how timing, elite execution, brand awareness, and smart career positioning can collide into real wealth.Across every stop; Packers, Raiders, Jets, and now Los Angeles, Davante Adams has shown one consistent thread: he produces on Sundays, and the market always pays for that. A seven-figure rookie deal was simply the beginning. The $58 million Packers extension in 2017 confirmed he wasn’t just Aaron Rodgers’ beneficiary, he was a standalone force.Then came Las Vegas, and the deal that shifted the WR market: a five-year, $140 million megacontract that briefly made him the highest-paid wideout in league history.That number still gets referenced anytime a new WR1 deal shakes the league.He also crossed into mainstream pop-sports culture with Netflix’s “Receiver,” giving fans a look beyond the stat lines. And while Adams is not the splashy brand-publicity type, he’s built a quieter, sturdier financial identity. Real estate was a major signal of that, his reported $11.4 million Las Vegas home is not the impulsive purchase of a reckless star, it’s the move of a man who has already started thinking beyond football.And that’s why his wealth matters in conversation: it isn’t hype-inflated, it’s earned production and disciplined leverage, the kind future WRs will use as precedent.","Davante Adams' $45 million net worth reflects his consistent on-field production and smart career moves.

This move underscores her commitment to vulnerable children and signals a new chapter built on internal values and purpose, rather than public validation or past relationships.

Gisele Bündchen’s compassionate focus is why her new chapter feels more authentic than anything that came before

More coverage on NFL:

Gisele Bündchen’s latest public move wasn’t about glam, wasn’t about fashion press, and wasn’t even about the personal celebrations everyone was expecting. Instead, the supermodel turned attention toward the one thing that still seems to ground her, even years after the global divorce headlines, vulnerable children.In a week where fans assumed she would post a long, emotional birthday declaration for partner Joaquim Valente, Bündchen intentionally paused the romantic narrative and prioritized something more permanent. She spotlighted the opening of the Children’s Village at Lotus House and in doing so, she showed again that her post-Tom Brady era foundation isn’t just built on love, but purpose. It wasn’t performative philanthropy, it was an identity reset being lived in real time.“Yesterday was such a beautiful and emotional day at the opening of the Children’s Village at Lotus House, a place created with so much love to help children in need learn, grow, and dream freely in an environment where they can feel safe, loved, and inspired,” Bündchen wrote. “It’s truly an honor to serve as a Board Member of Lotus House, the nation’s largest women’s homeless shelter. My heart is full of gratitude for being part of this journey.💛”This shift signals that Gisele is building her next era on internal values rather than public validation, and followers say it makes her feel more human than “celebrity branded.”Supporters are also connecting the timing, Lotus House first, birthday tribute later, as symbolic of the emotional stability she claims she had to rebuild after her Tom Brady divorce. And now, with Joaquim Valente set for his own milestone moment, fans believe Gisele is finally operating from her own center, instead of orbiting the spotlight.In the end, Gisele Bündchen’s latest move proves her new priorities aren’t about shock value or headlines. She’s choosing impact, love, and authenticity and fans believe this grounded version of her is the most powerful one yet.","Supermodel Gisele Bündchen recently shifted focus from personal celebrations to a significant philanthropic endeavor.

Maharashtra Deputy CM Ajit Pawar’s 'How Dare You' Retort At IPS Officer Triggers Political Firestorm

.

.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said that a land deal involving his son Parth Pawar has been cancelled amid allegations of irregularities in the transaction.Addressing reporters after meeting chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Pawar said his son and his business partner were unaware that the land in Pune, which their company had agreed to purchase, belonged to the government.“The concerned land is a government land which cannot be sold. Parth and his partner Digvijay Patil were not aware of this fact. How the registration (of its sale) was done and who is responsible will come out in the probe being headed by ACS Vikas Kharge, who will submit his report in a month,” he said.Pawar maintained that transparency and adherence to the law remain his top priorities.“I have never flouted any rules in my 35-year political career. If anyone from my family or anyone close to me does something wrong, I will never support it. I have gathered all information about the case and spoken to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. I told him he can order a probe.”He confirmed that the sale documents and related transactions “have been cancelled,” and that affidavits to this effect have been submitted to the registering authorities.“Not a rupee has changed hands in the deal,” he said.He added: "" I want to make it clear that neither I nor my office made any phone calls, gave any help, or had any role or knowledge about this transaction at any stage.""Pawar further said that he has directed all officials under him not to succumb to any pressure, even if someone uses his name to influence a decision.""There is no transaction in the related case as yet. FIR has also been registered in the said case. Who had put pressure on officers, who were involved, who had carried out the transaction, everything will be investigated,” he added.In a formal statement issued, Pawar clarified that the deal was only an agreement to purchase land and no payment had been made by Parth or his firm, Amadea Enterprises LLP.""My son Parth says that the proposed deal was within the ambit of the law and was completely above board. However, in public life, we must not allow even the suspicion of wrongdoing. Since allegations of wrongdoing have been made, he has agreed to cancel the deal. The required document for cancellation of the sale deed has already been submitted to the registering authority,” the statement read.He reiterated that neither he nor his office made any calls or provided assistance at any stage.“I have always worked within the limits of law and rules. Every decision I take is based on fairness and legality. These principles apply equally to everyone, including my family members,” Pawar added. He further emphasised that the NCP and its members hold themselves to “the highest standards of probity and accountability.”The controversy erupted after reports surfaced that a company linked to Parth Pawar had agreed to buy 40 acres of government land in Pune’s Mundhwa area, valued around Rs 1,800 crore for Rs 300 crore, allegedly bypassing due procedures and stamp duty.Following preliminary findings, the state government suspended a sub-registrar and registered an FIR against three individuals, including a company partner and a government official.CM Fadnavis said that the inquiry will determine whether any irregularities occurred. He further added that “strict action will be taken if wrongdoing is established.”Meanwhile, political reactions have intensified. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that government land reserved for Dalits had been sold “at a throwaway price” to a minister’s family member, calling it “land theft.” He also questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s silence on the issue.Pawar further said that an inquiry committee has been appointed to investigate the matter and urged anyone with relevant information or evidence to come forward and present it before the panel.“The government has appointed an inquiry committee to look into the matter. Anyone who has information or evidence should present it before the committee. The truth will emerge through this process, and if anyone is found responsible for any wrongdoing, action will be taken,” he said.","Ajit Pawar cancels a land deal involving his son Parth Pawar amid allegations of irregularities in the transaction.

What history tells about high voter turnout

What analysts feel

Is SIR responsible for high voter turnout?

NEW DELHI: High voter turnout in the first phase of polling in Bihar assembly elections on Thursday has raised many eyebrows, curiously wondering whether it will favour the Nitish Kumar-led incumbent government or is it a sign of aggressive anti-incumbency voting.For 121 assembly seats, Bihar recorded 64.66 per cent voter turnout, which was an 8.5 per cent jump from the 2020 assembly elections. The enthusiastic voting has led both alliances - NDA and the Mahagathbandhan - interpreting the surge to their advantage.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday asserted that the record turnout in the first phase of Bihar assembly polls was proof that people have reposed their trust in the ""track record of Narendra and Nitish"".""Yesterday, the voters of Bihar broke all records. Never before in the history of the state has there been such a high poll percentage. Much of the credit goes to mothers and sisters, the Maatri Shakti (mother power), who turned up in large numbers to raise the turnout to nearly 65 per cent. It is evident that they all have trust in the track record of Narendra-Nitish,"" PM Modi said. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, the INDIA bloc's chief ministerial candidate, said, ""I salute the people of Bihar for the bumper voting.I can now confidently say you have affirmed the victory of 'Mahagathbandhan'.""Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor also hailed voter turnout and claimed it to be a sign of the people's yearning for a change. ""After November 14, when votes will be counted, Bihar will have a new regime.""Rashtriya Janata Dal feels that the high voter turnout is a confirmation to Tejashwi Yadav's bet to the chief ministerial post.Riding on the anti-incumbency wave, RJD scion's 's campaign revolving around the promise of Ek Parivar, Ek Naukri; MAA Yojana; free electricity up to 200 units; farm loan waivers; expanded scholarships; and a return to the old pension system. His last moment effort to roll out Rs 30,000 to women on Makar Sankranti is also seen as a counter to NDA.After the first phase of the elections, Tejashwi claimed that the people of Bihar have voted for change.“Today, Bihar has voted for change in the first phase. Every citizen has stepped out to end the 20 years of darkness and lit the flame of transformation, bringing a wave of happiness, prosperity, and peace across the state,"" Tejashwi said.RJD supremo patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav drew a parallel between politics and roti while advocating for a regime change in Bihar.""We must keep flipping the roti when it is on the hot tawa, otherwise it will get burnt. Twenty years is enough. A Tejashwi (Yadav) led government is important for a new Bihar,"" he said, sharing a photo with son Tejashwi and wife and former Chief Minister Rabri Devi. The veteran leader and his family cast their votes at a polling booth in Patna.Historically, high voter turnout is a sign of regime change in Bihar. People have traditionally lined up in polling booths when they desire for change.In 1980, the voter turnout surged almost 7 per cent in favour of Congress after a three-year rule of Karpoori Thakur-led Janata Party government and a president's rule.In 1990, voter turnout rose from 56.3 per cent to 62 per cent — a 5.8 per cent increase that saw the ousting of Jagannath Mishra-led Congress government and Lalu Prasad Yadav from Janata Dal took oath as chief minister.However, in 2005, turnout dropped by 16%, yet it again brought a change of guard, with JD(U)’s Nitish Kumar taking office for the first time.In 2010, voter turnout rose from 46.5 per cent to 52.7 per cent, giving Nitish Kumar another chance as chief minister due to his promising work earning him the name of ""Sushashan Babu.""Political analyst Kumar Vijay feels that the cash rollouts and social security schemes announced by Nitish, just ahead of the elections, might have worked in favour of NDA in the first phase of polls. He, however, said that votes ""will translate more in favour for JD(U) within the NDA"" -- which seemed to lag behind ahead of the elections.""Women voter turnout in the first phase of the elections was very encouraging. It seems that Mukhya Mantri Mahila Rojgaar Yojana, which gave Rs 10,000 to the bank accounts of 75 lakh women, free electricity upto 125 units and increased pension to Rs 1,100 may have worked out for the incumbent government,"" Kumar Vijay said while talking to The Times of India.""Even after 20 years of Nitish Kumar's rule, surprisingly, anti-incumbency was not visible,"" he added.He further said that Mahagathbandhan's rozgaar promise may not have worked in the first phase of the elections.""Employment pitch by Tejashwi does not seem to impress voters. RJD's promise to transfer Rs 30,000 under Mai Bhain Yojana till January 14 also did not work as it was only a promise, while NDA government had already transferred Rs 10,000,"" he said.Meanwhile, Kumar Vijay said that migrants labpureres in north Bihar, who returned home for Chhath festivities and have not yet gone back to their places of work, are the ""X factor"" in the assembly polls and may incline more towards Prashant Kishore's Jan Suraaj.""Jan Suraaj made migration a huge issue in the run up to the elections. Migrant laboureres in north Bihar, who returned home for Chhath festivities and have not yet gone back to their places of work, are the 'X factor' in the assembly polls and may incline more towards Prashant Kishore's Jan Suraaj.""Months before the assembly elections, the Election Commission conducted a voter list purification drive - Special Intensive Revision - which led to a significant correction in the state’s electoral roll.Following SIR, the final list included 7.42 crore eligible voters — 18 lakh more than the 7.24 crore names in the draft roll, but 47 lakh fewer than the 7.89 crore names recorded before the revision exercise.In the Magadh region, the voter base grew by an average of 2.6 per cent, with Patna district registering the highest increase at 3.4 per cent, adding around 1.6 lakh new voters to the rolls. This might be the responsible for the higher voter turnout.In the 2020 Bihar assembly elections, the battle across these 121 seats turned out to be one of the most tightly contested phases. The Mahagathbandhan — comprising the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress, and Left parties — managed to secure a slender edge by winning 61 constituencies. The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the BJP and JD(U), was close behind with 59 seats.Now, the second phase of assembly polls will be held on November 11, and the votes will be counted on November 14.While the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), comprising of BJP, JD(U), HAMS, LJP (RV), and others, is looking to retain power for a second term, the Mahagathbandhan, comprising Congress, RJD, left parties, and VIP, is looking to get back to power. Jan Suraaj party has also made a debut in the electoral fray, contesting in more than 200 seats on its own.In the 2020 assembly election, NDA won 125 seats, while the Mahagathbandhan secured 110 seats. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) emerged as the single largest party with 75 seats, followed closely by BJP with 74 and JD(U) with 43.","For 121 assembly seats, Bihar recorded 64.66 per cent voter turnout, which was an 8.5 per cent jump from the 2020 assembly elections.

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

Delhi AQI today





NEW DELHI: Several people were detained on Sunday afternoon after they gathered at India Gate as part of a ""clean air protest"", demanding urgent govt action and strict policies to mitigate what they called an ""air emergency"".Some women even brought their children, holding nebulisers and medical prescriptions, to the site — symbolic reminders of the pollution crisis that has choked the city.Some took to social media, sharing visuals of people being herded into police buses. A post on X read: ""India Gate clean-air protest. We are being taken away, shoved into a bus"". A few protesters alleged that they were manhandled and some children also detained, but police denied both claims.According to the cops, the agitators were repeatedly advised to shift their demonstration to Jantar Mantar, the designated site for public protests in the city.""When they did not comply and continued blocking Man Singh Road, we intervened and detained them before reopening the road for the public,"" said DCP (New Delhi) Devesh Kumar Mahla, adding that only those obstructing traffic were detained. They were later released.In a press statement, the protesters demanded ""urgent, accountable and transparent action"" from Delhi govt to tackle the crisis. They called for the creation of an independent air regulator, real-time air quality data transparency, clear health advisories during pollution spikes and public accountability for funds to tackle pollution.Saying that clean air is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution — Right to Life — they urged both Delhi and central govts to act beyond short-term measures in order to safeguard public health.Environmental activist Bhavreen Kandhari, who was part of the stir, said, ""It is unfortunate that about a hundred citizens were detained. Ironically, many woman police personnel identified with the protesters as they, too, struggle to breathe the same toxic air. However, we saw many people without masks. That's the real tragedy.""Delhi woke up to a dense blanket of smog on Monday as temperatures dropped to 11.6°C and air quality remained in the “very poor” category.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at 6.05am showed the city’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) at 346.Pollution levels were alarming across most monitoring stations, with Bawana recording the highest AQI of 412, followed by Wazirpur (397), Jahangirpuri (394), and Nehru Nagar (386), according to CPCB’s Sameer app.The capital’s air quality has been worsening for four straight days, nearing the “severe” mark.On Sunday, the city’s average AQI stood at 370 — the season’s second-worst reading after October 30, when it touched 373.Though the morning air was heavily polluted, wind activity later in the day brought marginal improvement.On Sunday, Delhi’s AQI was 391 at 8am and 389 at 11am but slightly improved by 4pm, when the 24-hour average is officially recorded.The contribution of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana to Delhi’s PM2.5 levels has remained low, dropping from 8% on Saturday to around 5% on Sunday.","Several people were detained on Sunday afternoon after they gathered at India Gate as part of a ""clean air protest"" The protesters demanded ""urgent, accountable and transparent action"" from Delhi govt to tackle the crisis.
