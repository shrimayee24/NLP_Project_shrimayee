"India losing its sunshine to cloud cover, bad air: Study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-losing-its-sunshine-to-cloud-cover-bad-air-study/articleshow/124402640.cms,"Representative image

PUNE: If this year's prolonged monsoon and endless overcast skies have made it feel like the Sun has gone missing, there is data to back up the impression.In a new study by Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) and India Meteorological Department (IMD), among others, scientists have found that sunshine hours across most parts of India have been steadily declining over the past three decades - a trend linked to thicker cloud cover and rising aerosol pollution.The research, published in ""Nature's Scientific Reports"" this month, examined sunshine-hour data from 20 met stations across nine regions between 1988 and 2018. It found the annual sunshine hours - the duration when sunlight is strong enough to be recorded as a sunshine hour - have declined in all regions, except northeast where a marginal seasonal ""levelling off"" was seen.BHU scientist Manoj K Srivastava told TOI: ""On average, the west coast saw sunshine hours fall by 8.6 hours per year, while the north Indian plains recorded the steepest drop at 13.1 hours a year.""""The east coast and Deccan plateau also showed declining trends of 4.9 and 3.1 hours per year, respectively. Even the central inland region showed a loss of about 4.7 hours per year.""The study said sunshine increased between Oct and May - the drier months - but declined sharply from June to Sept, coinciding with the monsoon. The scientists associated with the study attributed the long-term ""solar dimming"" to higher aerosol concentrations - tiny particles released from industrial emissions, biomass burning and vehicular pollution.""These aerosols act as condensation nuclei, creating smaller and longer-lived cloud droplets that keep skies overcast for extended periods. This year's monsoon, too, has been marked by persistently cloudy skies across much of India, especially over the west coast, central India and Deccan plateau, which saw frequent overcast conditions even on days without rain. Though the study period spans till 2018, trends remain just as relevant today, as the same haze, humidity and cloud patterns persist - if anything, more strongly than before,"" one scientist said.""Higher aerosol numbers increase the residence time of clouds in the atmosphere, reducing the hours of sunlight reaching the ground,"" Srivastava said. The scientists said the decline in sunshine hours has major implications for solar energy generation, agriculture and climate modelling. While India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing solar markets, reduced solar incidence could affect power output and long-term planning for renewable infrastructure.",Sunshine hours across most parts of India have been steadily declining over the past three decades.

Serious issues with IHFL's financial transactions: ED to Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/serious-issues-with-ihfls-financial-transactions-ed-to-supreme-court/articleshow/124402436.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: The ED on Wednesday flagged serious irregularities in the financial transactions of Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IHFL), now known as Sammaan Capital Ltd, even as an NGO told the Supreme Court that the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) had condoned a litany of corporate governance irregularities by IHFL, brushing aside market regulator Sebi's adverse reports.Notwithstanding sneering objections to the allegations made by the NGO, Citizens' Whistleblowers Forum, from senior advocate Harish Salve, who was appearing for Indiabulls, a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Ujjal Bhuyan and N K Singh asked a 'responsible officer' from MCA to remain present with the original files of IHFL in court on Nov 19. ""We would like to see the original records of the ministry of corporate affairs relating to compounding of irregularities referred to by SEBI in its report. We would also like to know in which all cases you (MCA) have been so magnanimous in condoning corporate governance violations,"" the bench said.Additional solicitor general S V Raju, along with advocate A Venkatesh Rao, told SC ""there is something seriously wrong in this case."" The bench directed ED to clarify the stand taken by CBI in an affidavit that there was prima facie evidence of money laundering activities by IHFL.It also asked the ED to explain the steps taken by it pursuant to the CBI affidavit.For the NGO, Prashant Bhushan attempted to detail the allegedly surreptitious activities of IHFL in conspiracy with various realtors and banks. Salve termed the case as 'blackmail litigation' and said the petition was ""nothing but a cut-paste of another similar petition which was dismissed by the Delhi HC."" Salve said the entire loan amount advanced has been recovered, while A M Singhvi said seven agencies had investigated the cases against IHFL and given it a clean chit.Bhushan recalled that a Justice Kant-led bench had recently permitted CBI to register FIRs against seven realtors for abusing the subvention scheme to defraud homebuyers, and said Indiabulls, in criminal conspiracy with the Vatika group, has similarly defrauded flat buyers, with Sebi giving a detailed report on these and other irregularities by IHFL to MCA, which instead compounded 200 acts of misdeeds.The ED, in its probe status report, detailed the allegedly dubious deals of IHFL with Yes Bank and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation involving proceeds of crime (POC) worth Rs 5,333 crore; with Gautam Thapar-led Avantha group involving POC of Rs 307 cr; and with Americorp group that took loans worth Rs 9,480 cr from IHFL to invest in shares of Indiabulls to hike its price and earn profits worth Rs 532 crore.","The ED flagged serious irregularities in the financial transactions of Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IHFL), now known as Sammaan Capital Ltd.

'Lack Of Trust' Opposition Slams EC Over Voter List Irregularities in Bihar

NEW DELHI: Raising questions about SIR in Bihar Congress has asked who the 30 lakh people who didn’t make it to the electoral rolls are and how many of them voted in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Congress said that as CEC had allowed applications for inclusion up to ten days before the last date of nomination, the final electoral roll must be frozen on that date, and elections be held on the basis of that list.The AICC expert group on elections and voters’ list, EAGLE, said the identity of the 30 lakh people removed was important as there were 7.7 crore registered voters in the parliamentary polls, but after SIR the number had come down to 7.42 crore.EAGLE, which comprises Ajay Maken, Digvijaya Singh, Abhishek Singhvi, Praveen Chakravarty, Pawan Khera, Gurdeep Sappal and Nitin Raut, said EC had claimed that 21.5 lakh voters were added in Bihar but Form 6 was available for only 16.9 lakh, which raises the question of “where the remaining 4.6 lakh forms are, and if these voters were added without due process”.","Congress has asked who the 30 lakh people who didn’t make it to the electoral rolls are and how many of them voted in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.

The case: Rolex seizure at IGI Airport



Customs order and penalties



₹1.8 lakh as redemption fine

A penalty equivalent to AED 6,250

Warehousing charges accumulated since the seizure

Poll Should customs authorities provide clearer guidelines for classifying personal vs. commercial items? Yes, clearer guidelines are needed No, current rules are sufficient

What the court said



The outcome



Why the judgment matters



The broader context



The takeaway



A single high-value product does not automatically mean commercial intent.

Declaration rules must still be followed — non-declaration can attract penalties.

Customs authorities must base decisions on context and evidence, not assumptions.





On March 7, 2024, Mahesh Malkani, an Indian citizen living in Dubai, arrived at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport wearing a Rolex Submariner worth around AED 56,000 (approximately ₹12.7 lakh). Believing he had nothing dutiable to declare, Malkani passed through the Green Channel — reserved for passengers without goods requiring customs declaration.Customs officers, however, intercepted him, seized the watch, and issued a detention receipt. Officials claimed that Malkani had used the wrong channel and violated baggage rules. They further classified the single watch as a “commercial quantity,” implying it was intended for trade rather than personal use.Following the seizure, the Commissioner of Customs at IGI Airport issued an Order-in-Original on January 30, 2025. The order allowed Malkani to redeem the Rolex watch for re-export upon payment of the following:The order required Malkani to complete the redemption within 120 days. Instead of paying, he moved the Delhi High Court , challenging both the classification of the watch as “commercial” and the penalty terms.A Division Bench of Justices Pratibha M. Singh and Sahil Jain heard the case and delivered judgment on September 17, 2025.The High Court upheld the customs department’s right to impose a redemption fine and penalty but disagreed with the classification of the Rolex as a commercial consignment. The judges observed: “Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use.”The bench noted that wearing a high-value watch during international travel does not, by itself, justify treating it as a commercial import. It emphasised that customs officials must take a practical view when distinguishing between personal and commercial use.While the court did not waive the fines or penalties, it extended the redemption deadline to October 31, 2025, thereby allowing Malkani additional time to reclaim his watch. The judgment effectively clears him to retrieve the Rolex after payment, while also reaffirming that the mere possession of an expensive personal item cannot automatically be equated with commercial intent.The High Court also strongly urged customs authorities to avoid arbitrary classifications in future cases, warning that such broad, blanket assumptions may not stand up to thorough judicial scrutiny.The decision clarifies an important grey area in customs enforcement: value alone cannot determine intent. A single high-end item, such as a luxury watch or jewellery, may still qualify as a personal belonging if it is clearly meant for personal use.Legal experts have welcomed the ruling as a sensible interpretation of customs law. Supreme Court advocate Dr. Sujay Kantawala said the judgment “underscores that customs must take a practical view of what counts as personal use versus commercial quantity.”The case also reflects broader judicial concern over how customs officers apply baggage rules, especially to international passengers carrying high-value personal goods.Under Indian customs regulations, travellers arriving from abroad are allowed to carry personal items and gifts up to a certain value without paying duty — currently around ₹45,000 (approximately AED 2,000). Anything beyond that must be declared at the Red Channel.Failure to do so can lead to detention, fines, or confiscation, even if the items are personal. Over the past year, courts have repeatedly reminded customs officials to exercise discretion, particularly when dealing with worn items such as watches or jewellery that are clearly for personal use.The Delhi High Court’s ruling sets a precedent for future customs disputes involving luxury items. It makes clear that:For travellers, the message is equally clear: when in doubt, declare. For customs, the case is a reminder that practicality and fairness must guide enforcement — not just the price tag on someone’s wrist.","Delhi High Court rules single Rolex watch worn by Dubai resident is for personal use, not commercial import.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed the central government's plea seeking victim- and society-centric guidelines for award of sentences, particularly death sentences, in place of the present system which is accused-centric and takes into consideration various mitigating factors relating to convicts.The central government also sought a directive for the introduction of a timeframe for death row convicts to file a curative petition after the dismissal of a review petition, and the filing of a mercy petition within seven days of the issuance of the death warrant. It further sought that the death sentence be executed within seven days of rejection of the mercy petition.Opposing the central government's plea, senior advocate Yug Mohit Chaudhry and Puja Sharma said that courts had passed a series of judgments on the matter and it was wrong on the part of Centre to seek additional victim-centric guidelines.The application, filed by the Union ministry of home affairs, highlighted that the directives of the court in the Shatrughan Chauhan case in 2014 were issued keeping in mind the rights of the convict and said it is high time the court redresses the grievances of victims, their families and the concerns of society at large, whose collective conscience gets shaken as a result of such horrific offences.""It is submitted that while taking care of the rights of the convicts, it is more important and the need of the hour to lay down guidelines in the interest of the victims, their families and in larger public interest, lest the convicts found to be guilty of such horrible, dreadful, cruel, abominable, ghastly, gruesome and heinous offences are permitted to play with the majesty of law and prolong the execution of the sentence awarded to them in accordance with the law,"" the application stated.Though no one appeared for the Centre to argue the case, the SC dismissed the plea, saying it was without merit.In 2014, the Supreme Court had laid down guidelines for the protection of the rights of the death row convicts and declared that long pendency in the disposal of a mercy petition is a ground to commute the death penalty to life sentence.It also said there should be a 14-day interval between intimating the rejection of the convict's mercy petition and their execution, so that the death row convict can not just seek a remedy but also mentally prepare themselves for the execution.",The Supreme Court dismissed the central government's plea seeking victim- and society-centric guidelines for award of sentences.

'Can't be held prosecution discharged burden of proof'

NEW DELHI: Thirty-five years after 21 people were sentenced to life imprisonment in a double murder case in Bihar, Supreme Court on Wednesday acquitted the accused and closed the case, cautioning courts to be careful while dealing with the offence of unlawful assembly so that innocent spectators or passive onlookers do not get convicted.SC said the prosecution had failed to prove its case and the accused were entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It said the testimonies of witnesses in the case neither corroborated one another nor were aligned with the medical records.The bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said ""The various contradictions in the form of material omissions go to the root of the matter, and in such circumstances, it cannot be held that the prosecution has discharged its burden of proof"".The incident, a clash between two groups over a land dispute, took place in Katihar district in 1988, and the accused were convicted and sentenced by the trial court in 1990. Two convicts died during the pendency of the case.The court said mere presence at the scene of crime does not ipso facto render a person a member of an unlawful assembly, unless it is established that the person shared its common object. ""A mere bystander, to whom no specific role is attributed, would not fall within the ambit of section 149 of the IPC,"" it said.""This court, as a matter of caution, has enunciated parameters to safeguard innocent spectators or passive onlookers from being convicted merely on account of their presence. This cautionary rule, however, does not dilute the doctrine of constructive liability, under which proof of an overt act by each individual is not indispensable. Where the presence of a large number of persons is established and many are implicated, prudence mandates strict adherence to this rule of caution,"" the bench said.","SC said the prosecution had failed to prove its case and the accused were entitled to the benefit of the doubt.

NEW DELHI: Balancing ecological conservation with advancements in the defence and space sectors, Supreme Court on Wednesday gave the Jharkhand govt seven days to notify 314 sq kms of Saranda forest as a sanctuary but permitted extraction of high-grade iron ore and manganese from mines within the forests for use in Chandrayaan and anti-submarine warfare vessels.As a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice K V Chandran proceeded to hear senior advocate Kapil Sibal pleading against contempt of court proceedings against the Jharkhand chief secretary for state govt's flip-flops over notifying the Sal tree forest as a sanctuary, the Steel Authority of India ( SAIL ) through solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the court the steel major has been operating the mines for the last 70 years and the high-grade iron ore is used in Chandrayaan and defence projects.The SG sought exemption of these mines as the rules governing a sanctuary render mining activities impermissible. SAIL said these mines have been the mainstay of its production and supply to ""various national important projects like Chandrayaan and steel for anti-submarine warfare shallow watercraft INS Arnala"".Amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar said the Jharkhand govt has been repeatedly doing U-turns in SC over notifying Saranda as a sanctuary and said the excuse dished out now - demarcation of the forest area - is to buy times as the state's earlier affidavit had informed the court about the specific blocks that constitute the contiguous forest.The bench said it would take no time to issue a direction to the state to notify Saranda forest as sanctuary but is giving the last opportunity for issuance of notification within a week. It ordered that existing mines would be permitted to continue their mineral extraction activities. It also said that the mining leases already granted would remain unaffected by the notification of sanctuary.",Supreme Court gives Jharkhand govt seven days to notify 314 sq kms of Saranda forest as a sanctuary.

Finland, regularly recognised as the world’s happiest country in the World Happiness Report, attracts global talent thanks to its outstanding quality of life, robust social welfare system, and stunning natural landscapes. For Indian citizens, obtaining permanent residency (PR) in this Nordic nation provides full rights to live and work, options for family reunification, and a route to citizenship. Recent 2025 immigration updates have simplified the process for non-EU skilled professionals, positioning Finland as an appealing destination amid labour shortages in sectors like IT, healthcare, and engineering.Finland’s permanent residency grants non-EU nationals, including Indians, the right to live and work in the country indefinitely while accessing vital public services like healthcare and education. It also allows free movement across the Schengen Area. Unlike temporary residence permits, a permanent residence status never expires, although the residence card must be renewed every five years within the stipulated period. However, it’s important to distinguish permanent residency from citizenship — acquiring Finnish citizenship requires meeting additional conditions, such as proving language proficiency and maintaining continuous residence for a longer duration, usually eight years.Recent updates in 2025 have targeted work visas and family reunification rather than permanent residency directly. For example, family sponsors are now required to have resided in the country for at least two years, and spouses must be a minimum of 21 years old. Meanwhile, work permits have been streamlined for specialists, with fast-track processing available for high-salary roles, requiring a monthly gross income of at least EUR 1,600 (approximately INR 1.65 lakh).To be eligible, you need to have lived in Finland continuously for four years under a Type A (continuous) residence permit, starting either from your entry into the country or from the date the permit was granted. Periods spent on Type B (temporary) permits for short-term work are not counted toward this requirement. Moreover, you must have physically resided in Finland for at least two out of these four years, with any time spent abroad for holidays or work properly documented.The basis for your temporary permit, like employment, family ties, must still hold, for you to apply for a PR. Permanent Residence is not available to students or those on job-seeker permits. Before submitting a PR application, you must first transition to a Type A work or family-based permit.Although permanent residency doesn’t directly mandate these, obtaining the initial Type A permit typically requires financial and professional stability. For employment-based applications, candidates must either earn at least EUR 40,000 annually (around INR 41.3 lakh) or hold a recognised master’s/postgraduate degree with a minimum of two years of relevant experience. Alternatively, demonstrating C1-level proficiency in Finnish or Swedish along with three years of work experience can also strengthen eligibility.Applicants must provide a clean criminal record (police clearance from India), valid health insurance, and proof of accommodation. They should have no outstanding debts or dependence on social welfare. Any criminal history may negatively impact the approval process.Indians typically start with a temporary residence permit application from India, then apply for PR after four years while in Finland. Processing can take a long time so be flexible with your plans.Secure a job offer, university admission, or family tie. Apply online via Enter Finland or at VFS Global centres in India. Submit biometrics and documents like passport, job contract, salary proof, apostilled certificates, and police clearance.Live in Finland on your Type A permit, extending as required.Gather passport, photos, proof of residence, income/salary slips, educational certificates, trip logs (absences), and family details if applicable.Apply in Finland before your current permit expires. Use Enter Finland with Finnish ID for faster processing.Prove identity at a Migri service point Check status via Migri's Processing Time Checker. If approved, collect your biometric PR card.Rejections (e.g., due to incomplete docs) can be appealed within 30 days for a fee of approximately EUR 260. .For unemployed permit holders, a three-month grace period applies to find new work.Here are some benefits and considerations for Indians: Indians have the perks of indefinite stay, family sponsorship, Schengen travel, free education/healthcare, and a path to citizenship after eight years (with language tests). However there are some challenges that come with this. Some of the challenges are cold climate, language barriers (Finnish/Swedish), high living costs overall, which require proper preparation and adaptability for a smooth transition to life in Finland, ensuring long-term comfort and success.Also See: Sweden becomes the first country to be prescribed by doctors: Inside “The Swedish Prescription” campaign","Finland’s permanent residency grants non-EU nationals, including Indians, the right to live and work in the country indefinitely.

The Delhi High court , in its verdict dated September 17, 2025 allowed a man to retrieve his Rolex watch seized by the customs department at the Indira Gandhi International airport after paying a fine. The case sets a new precedent, clarifying an important grey area in customs rules: Value of the imported product alone can not determine the intent.The Rolex case also has an important ‘tip/reminder’ for Indians planning to get iPhones (including the recently-launched iPhone 17 series) or laptops (Apple MacBooks and other brands) from the US, Dubai and other countries. As court said customs authorities can not automatically treat high-value items carried by passengers as commercial imports. Officials, the court underlined, must look at the circumstances of each case, including personal use. But yes, there is a certain value till which Indian nationals are allowed to bring in electronics from abroad, and the same needs to be followed. Else, these devices are liable for import duty. If not disclosed, travellers may have to pay a fine too.Mahesh, an Indian citizen and a current resident of Dubai landed at the airport on March 7, 2024, wearing his Rolex watch. He was intercepted by the Customs Officers for passing through a wrong channel for importing goods.Found in violation of the relevant provisions, the Customs department concluded that the seized Rolex watch (1 unit) is in commercial quantity and cannot possibly be for personal use. The department ordered him to redeem the Rolex watch within 120 days by paying a fine of Rs 1.8 lakh for re-export purposes.Mahesh appealed against the order in the Delhi High court. A division of Justice Prathiba M. Singh and Sahil Jain allowed Mahesh to retrieve his detained Rolex watch. But, the court also upheld the customs department’s right to impose the redemption fine.“Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity and there is no reason as to why the same cannot be kept for personal use. However, considering the fact that the option of redemption was given to the Petitioner, the Petitioner (Mahesh) shall now pay the redemption fine by October 31, 2025, and redeem the detained article in accordance with the impugned order,” the court said.For the purpose of Customs clearance of arriving passengers, a two channel system has been adopted:Passengers are advised to report at the appropriate channel for Customs Clearance. However, passengers walking through the Green Channel (mistake that Mahesh did with his Rolex watch) with dutiable / prohibited goods are liable to prosecution/ penalty and confiscation of goods.If a user is planning to buy an Apple Macbook or any other laptop from abroad, the Customs rules allow one laptop computer (note book computer) under Customs Duty Free Allowances. In addition, passengers who are 18 years or older can bring one extra laptop duty-free, even beyond the normal allowance.As for iPhones, the device bought has to be for personal consumption, and cannot be more than one unit.If you are taking expensive items like a camera or projector out of India and plan to bring them back, you don’t have to pay duty again. But make sure that at the time of departure, the Customs Officer will note the details of the item (like serial number or unique marks) and give you an Export Certificate.When you return, you just need to show this certificate to Customs. They will check the item and let you carry it without charging duty.","Delhi High court allowed a man to retrieve his Rolex watch seized by the customs department at the Indira Gandhi International airport after paying a fine.

Stanford football has received a massive financial boost from one of its most loyal alum and former player. Bradford M. Freeman — a Stanford alumnus, former Cardinal football player, and longtime university donor — has pledged a whopping $50 million to the program, marking the largest individual donation in team history not tied to facilities. The school announced the gift on Wednesday, calling it a transformative moment for a program that’s been working to rebuild both on and off the field. Freeman’s donation will directly fund five new football scholarships and expand the university’s NIL infrastructure to better support current and future student-athletes.According to financial disclosures reported by GuruFocus.com, Freeman’s net worth is estimated at $13 million as of 2025, based on SEC filings. He also holds a range of stock positions that likely increase his overall net worth significantly. Freeman’s relationship with Stanford spans decades. A 1964 graduate with a degree in economics, he played football for the Cardinal and has remained one of the school’s most consistent philanthropic supporters. In 1988, he made national headlines by endowing the first head coaching position in college football history.That role is now officially titled the Bradford M. Freeman Director of Football.""I remain grateful for the opportunities that my Stanford football scholarship gave me, and for all the ways that the university impacted the trajectory of my life,"" Freeman said in a statement, adding, ""I hope my gift will herald a new era of excellence for Stanford football and help the university address the new financial demands of competitive college athletics.”Stanford football general manager Andrew Luck — the former NFL quarterback who returned to his alma mater in 2024 to oversee football operations — praised Freeman’s gift as a turning point for the program. “With Brad’s incredible gift, we are positioned to win on the field and build a bridge to a sustainable future for Stanford football,” Luck said. He added that the donation will be a difference-maker in attracting and supporting elite student-athletes in today’s college football landscape.“The ability to support our players through new scholarships and institutional NIL will reinforce Stanford as the preeminent place in the country to be a football scholar-athlete,” Luck said. “I believe that Stanford has the opportunity to be a leading program in college football, and we are entirely motivated to field championship-caliber teams.”Freeman’s gift isn’t just a boost to the budget — it’s a signal that Stanford football still has believers, and that its next chapter may already be underway","Bradford M.

Hi everyone,

Immigration is at the heart of the American dream — an enduring symbol of opportunity that reminds us that anyone, regardless of where they come from, can achieve success and build a better life through hard work, talent, and determination.

As one of many immigrants at NVIDIA, I know that the opportunities we've found in America have profoundly shaped our lives. And the miracle of NVIDIA — built by all of you, and by brilliant colleagues around the world — would not be possible without immigration.

H-1 B visas provide a vital pathway for exceptional talent to contribute to America's growth and innovation. Legal immigration remains essential to ensuring the U.S.

continues to lead in technology and ideas.

The administration's recent changes reaffirm this — helping America attract and retain the most exceptional talent. At NVIDIA, we built our company with extraordinary people from around the world, and we will continue to sponsor H-1B applicants and cover all associated fees.

If you have any questions about H-1B visas, please reach out to NVIDIA-Immigration.

Best regards,

Jensen

US Government Shutdown Enters Second Week: Why It Happened & Who It Impacts

“The sustainability of OpenAI’s infrastructure spending will increasingly depend on equity & debt financing. We believe it will increasingly need to rely on equity/debt raises — with up to ~$75bn in 2026 alone,”





Goldman Sachs have a warning against Nvidia's multibillion-dollar investments in companies like OpenAI and Intel. An analyst from the investment banking company has suggested that some of this revenue surge may not be entirely organic. Nvidia has committed major investments, including up to $100 billion for OpenAI and an additional $5 billion for Intel. These investments are contributing to a massive demand for Nvidia's chips. However, in a recent note Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider (seen by Benzinga) stated that Nvidia's equity financing to customers is starting to resemble “circular revenue.” The analyst believes that investments flow out as funding, and the returns are realized via GPU sales, effectively inflating reported growth.Referring to Nvidia’s deal with OpenAI, the report explained the trend, where the US chip maker expects to earn about $13 billion in revenue from the AI startup in 2026, and around $10 billion of that profit will be put back into the business.reinvested back into the company. It’s like a food supplier giving money to the same restaurants that buy its ingredients.Schneider said, especially when the same money is circulated back through business deals between the companies.Goldman Sachs sees Nvidia’s investments as more than just financial decisions. The company sees these investments as strategic actions that tie developers more closely to Nvidia's CUDA software, increase sales of its hardware, and influence how the AI market develops.Schneider added.The company also expects Nvidia's datacenter revenue to come from a wider range of customers beyond Big Tech companies like Google-parent Alphabet, Meta and Amazon. More income will come from AI startups and government buyers, groups that are less stable and rely heavily on outside funding, the analysis claimed. While traditional Big Tech companies remain Nvidia's most reliable customers, government-backed national AI programs are increasingly driving demand from countries.Meanwhile, Goldman estimates OpenAI will need $35 billion in 2026 just for the computer hardware needed to run and train its AI systems. This funding is expected to come from three places: $17 billion from OpenAI's own earnings, $10 billion from Nvidia investments, and about $9 billion from other investors or loans.However, the financial pressure increases significantly when considering longer-term obligations, including $60 billion for Nvidia-backed data centers and $19 billion for Stargate infrastructure. In total, OpenAI could need $114 billion in cash for 2026 alone.This means a funding shortage of $62 billion, even after using $17 billion in available cash which is raising serious questions about whether Nvidia's customers can sustain their current spending levels.Morever, startups like OpenAI have smaller profit margins. The analysis predicted that they're much more affected by changes in investment markets which will make it harder for them to keep spending consistently.Schneider explained.","Goldman Sachs has a warning against Nvidia's multibillion-dollar investments in companies like OpenAI and Intel.

BHOPAL: Ranganathan Govindan, the arrested owner of Tamil Nadu-based Srisun Pharmaceuticals — the company behind the toxic cough syrup Coldrif that killed 21 children in Madhya Pradesh — will be produced before the district court in Chhindwara on Thursday afternoon.Govindan, who was arrested from Chennai on Wednesday, was carrying a bounty of Rs 20,000. He had been on the run with his wife since the tragedy came to light. His arrest followed days of intensive search by the Madhya Pradesh Special Investigation Team (SIT), which had been camping in Chennai.In anticipation of potential protests or unrest, additional police forces have been deployed in and around the Chhindwara court premises to maintain law and order during his appearance.Senior officials have confirmed that after his court production, Govindan will be taken into SIT custody for detailed interrogation regarding the manufacturing, quality control, and distribution of the adulterated Coldrif syrup.The Tamil Nadu government has already sealed the Srisun Pharmaceuticals facility, and investigations have revealed dangerously high levels of diethylene glycol (DEG) — a toxic industrial solvent — in the syrup.Laboratory analysis showed DEG content of 48.6% in samples tested in Tamil Nadu and 46.2% in those examined in Madhya Pradesh.Earlier on Wednesday, the Chhindwara district court rejected the bail plea of Dr. Praveen Soni, the pediatrician accused of prescribing the poisonous syrup. In a separate administrative move, the state government removed Dr. Naresh Gonnade, the civil surgeon of Chhindwara District Hospital, appointing Dr. Sushil Dubey in his place.Sources in the SIT said the investigation is now focused on identifying intermediaries, supply chain links, and regulatory lapses that may have allowed the distribution of the toxic syrup. Further arrests are expected in the coming days.","Ranganathan Govindan, owner of Tamil Nadu-based Srisun Pharmaceuticals, will be produced before the district court in Chhindwara on Thursday afternoon.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

A missed opportunity







Ubisoft has reportedly canceled the planned instalment of its flagship franchise, Assassin’s Creed, the game which was set during the US civil war and reconstruction era over political backlash in today’s climate. As reported by Game File, the game was in early concept stages and would have featured a formerly enslaved Black protagonist who joins the Assassin Brotherhood and confronts the Ku Klux Klan in the post-war South. The storyline is designed to explore themes of racial violence, citizenship rights and the reintegration of Confederate states — topics that developers believed could make a powerful social impact.As per the report by Game File, Ubisoft insiders said that while the project initially had green light it was later shelved due to fears of the subject matters which depicts supremacist white groups. The company feels that this subject may start a controversy in the current rising political tensions in the US. Talking on the matter, one source told Game File, “Too political in a country too unstable.” The cancellation of Assassin’s Creed also faced backlash over the inclusion of Yasuke, a Black samurai, in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which drew criticism from some gamers despite Yasuke being a real historical figure.According to the report, the game never went beyond the concept but the developers were enthusiastic about its potential. Some see this cancellation as Ubisoft backing away from meaningful storytelling in favour of safer narratives. “It’s a shame,” one developer said anonymously. “We had a chance to tell a story that mattered.”However, Ubisoft has not yet officially commented on the report, but this decision has started the debate over the role of politics in gaming.","The game was in early concept stages and would have featured a formerly enslaved Black protagonist who joins the Assassin Brotherhood.

A California wine country county is strengthening its vaccine recommendations and implementing a mask mandate, citing a “greater risk” of Covid-19 as the annual flu season begins.Karen Smith, interim health officer for the Sonoma County Department of Public Health, issued an order on Monday mandating masks for anyone entering specified healthcare facilities in the county.The mask mandate, effective from November 1 to March 31, 2026, allows Smith to expand the facilities covered as needed and will be implemented annually unless officially lifted.""The rationale behind this order is to protect the most vulnerable populations (such as the elderly and cancer patients) and to try to prevent medical staff from getting sick and creating staffing problems for facilities,"" a spokesperson for the Sonoma County department of health was quoted as saying by Fox News.The order includes several exemptions, covering anyone ""with a diagnosed medical condition, mental health condition, or disability that prevents the individual from wearing a face mask.""It also exempts hearing-impaired individuals who need to see the mouth to communicate, as well as anyone else whom local, state, or federal regulators determine could be harmed by wearing a mask.The order specifies the types of masks that are acceptable, including surgical masks, KN95, KF94, or N95 respirators.Informal coverings such as scarves, ski masks, balaclavas, bandanas, turtlenecks, collars, cloth masks, or any mask with an unfiltered one-way exhaust valve do not meet the requirements.Alongside the mask mandate, Smith issued stronger guidance on Covid-19 and flu vaccinations, strongly recommending shots for everyone aged six months and older. She also advised that both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals wear masks in indoor public spaces when Covid-19 or influenza risk is high.Smith’s vaccine and mask recommendations, particularly those aimed at protecting older populations, conflict with guidance from Robert F Kennedy Jr’s department of health and human services (HHS).California enforced a strict mask mandate during the Covid-19 pandemic, requiring face coverings in most public settings statewide from June 2020 to June 2021, as cited by the Daily Mail.Between December 2021 and February 2022, the state reinstated indoor mask mandates in response to a surge in Covid cases and hospitalizations, while several counties implemented even stricter masking policies.","Sonoma County issued an order on Monday mandating masks for anyone entering specified healthcare facilities in the county.

Other Arab leaders and past UNESCO candidacies

Farouk Hosny (Egypt): A former Egyptian Minister of Culture. He was Egypt’s candidate for UNESCO Director-General in 2009. Although he was considered a strong contender, his candidacy ran into controversy when he made statements about allegedly “burning Israeli books,” which raised objections internationally.

Moushira Khattab (Egypt): In 2017, she was nominated by Egypt for the UNESCO chief job. She’s a seasoned diplomat and human rights advocate. Her candidacy didn’t succeed, but it showed increasing ambition from Arab states to secure this leadership role.

Samira bint Mohamed Al-Moosa (Oman): A long-standing figure in UNESCO’s governance framework. She has served as Oman’s ambassador and permanent delegate to UNESCO and was elected representative of Oman to the Executive Board, chairing several committees. While she did not run for Director-General, her work shows Arab women have held influential UNECO positions.

Big challenges ahead — budgets, politics and priorities





Egypt’s former Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, Dr. Khaled El-Enany, is set to make history. On October 6, 2025, the UNESCO Executive Board nominated him to become the organization’s next Director-General, marking the first time an Arab candidate has reached this stage. His nomination now awaits approval from UNESCO ’s General Conference in November 2025, where all 194 member states will cast their votes.Born in 1971, Dr. Khaled El-Enany is an Egyptologist, academic, and heritage preservation expert with decades of experience in archaeology and cultural diplomacy. Before entering public office, he taught Egyptology at Helwan University and later became the founding director of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo’s Tahrir Square.El-Enany served as Egypt’s Minister of Antiquities (2016–2019) and then as Minister of Tourism and Antiquities (2019–2022), a merger that allowed him to oversee both heritage protection and tourism development. During his tenure, he led major projects including:His blend of scholarship and administrative skill helped him gain the trust of Arab and African nations, securing their votes during the UNESCO Executive Board’s election.The UNESCO Executive Board held its election on October 6, 2025, where El-Enany won by a wide margin — 55 votes to 2 — against Firmin Edouard Matoko of the Republic of Congo. This strong backing positions him as the clear favourite for the final vote at the UNESCO General Conference in November, where all 194 member states will confirm or reject the nomination. If confirmed, El-Enany will officially take office in early 2026 for a four-year term as UNESCO’s Director-General, succeeding Audrey Azoulay of France.El-Enany’s potential appointment is being celebrated across the Arab region as a symbolic and diplomatic milestone — a first in UNESCO’s history.His leadership could bring a renewed focus on:Experts say his background in archaeology and tourism gives him a unique, hands-on perspective to lead UNESCO’s cultural agenda, bridging global heritage with sustainable development.Here are some Arab figures who either ran for the UNESCO Director-General position in past years or have played significant roles related to UNESCO:UNESCO is facing a tight financial period after recent withdrawals by major contributors, leaving a sizable budget gap that the new leader will urgently need to address. El-Enany has flagged funding, depoliticizing programmatic work, and strengthening UNESCO’s technical and advisory role as top priorities. He and supporters have also suggested increasing private-sector partnerships and exploring innovative new funding streams to stabilise UNESCO’s vital programmes. Restoring or improving ties with key member states is also firmly on the agenda.","Khaled El-Enany, Egypt’s former Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, is set to make history.

After suffering major losses at home -- Muridke terror camp - during Operation Sindoor , Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has reportedly formed a covert alliance with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), the South Asian wing of ISIS, allegedly engineered and funded by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Reports indicate the alliance aims to target Baloch people, with possible expansion to Jammu and Kashmir.A circulated video on social media shows LeT commander Rana Muhammad Ishfaq training with ISKP’s Shafiq Mengal at an undisclosed location in Balochistan.A recently surfaced photograph shows ISKP’s coordinator in Balochistan, Mir Shafiq Mengal, handing a pistol to Rana Muhammad Ashfaq, a senior LeT commander -- a symbolic gesture signalling formal coordination between the two groups under ISI patronage.Mir Shafiq Mengal has helped establish ISKP bases in Mastung and Khuzdar and reportedly led death squads against separatists. LeT’s longstanding presence in Quetta has facilitated the growing closeness between the groups.Meanwhile, this covert alliance between the two terror groups could raise serious concerns for India, as it is reportedly aimed at expanding operations in the Kashmir region, raising major security concerns.Intelligence sources say the goal is evident: to crush the Baloch insurgency, strengthen Pakistan’s control over Afghanistan’s unstable border regions, and restart terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir while maintaining plausible deniability.Observers note a worrying shift in ISKP’s propaganda magazine 'Yalgaar', which signals an expressed intent to extend operations into the Kashmir Valley, apparently coordinated and supported by Pakistan’s deep state.Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has a long history of terror attacks on Indian soil, including 26/11 Mumbai attacks.Arun Gupta, director of VIF and former deputy NSA, said, “Pakistan is a master in proxy wars, using terrorist groups to fight insurgencies, but unintended consequences are inevitable. India must remain vigilant.”This alliance comes after India’s strong counterterror actions under Operation Sindoor, which the PM Modi-led government says is ongoing but currently paused. India had destroyed LeT’s den and headquarters in Muridke in mainland Pakistan.After the Muridke camp was destroyed by the IAF, reports have emerged that LeT is shifting to a safer location near the Afghanistan border, with Pakistan aiding its reconstruction.","Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has reportedly formed a covert alliance with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) ISKP is the South Asian wing of ISIS, allegedly engineered and funded by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) The alliance aims to target Baloch people, with possible expansion to Jammu and Kashmir.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124380304,imgsize-946149,width-400,resizemode-4/ians-photo.jpg"

Bangladesh's interim government on Wednesday described foreign secretary Vikram Misri's comments on the general election as ""completely unwarranted"", saying it is entirely an internal affair of the country.""I see that statement as not their matter; it is entirely an internal issue for Bangladesh, and such comments are completely unwarranted,” Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain told reporters.Hossain made the remarks when asked to comment on Misri's statement that India is firmly in favour of holding free, fair and inclusive elections in Bangladesh at the earliest, and it is ready to work with any government chosen by the people in the polls.Dhaka-New Delhi ties were strained after the interim government assumed power following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League regime in a violent student-led movement dubbed the “July Uprising” in August 2024, when she left for India.The interim government in May disbanded Awami League’s activities until the trial of Hasina and leaders of her government were completed on charges of brutal attempts to tame the July protestors and other alleged misdeeds carried out during her protracted regime from 2009.Analysts said Misri’s call for “inclusive and participatory” elections in Bangladesh carried a political significance, while most of the Awami League leaders were imprisoned or on the run at home and abroad.The interim government earlier sent a diplomatic note to New Delhi seeking Hasina’s extradition to stand trial, as she is being tried in absentia.","Bangladesh's interim government described foreign secretary Vikram Misri's comments on the general election as ""completely unwarranted"" India is firmly in favour of holding free, fair and inclusive elections in Bangladesh at the earliest, foreign secretary Misri said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124389646,imgsize-57596,width-400,resizemode-4/vikram-misri-on-bangladesh-election.jpg"
"2,000-year-old secrets unearthed under UK marketplace, including medieval prison",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/2000-year-old-secrets-unearthed-under-uk-marketplace-including-medieval-prison/articleshow/124334040.cms,"Unearthing 2,000-year-old history beneath a busy marketplace

Layers of Roman life

Anglo-Saxon and medieval insights



A marketplace built over history





Beneath the bustling heart of Leicester, England, archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s historic Market Place. What began as a routine excavation for urban redevelopment has turned into one of the most significant discoveries in recent UK archaeology. The dig, led by the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS), is part of a £7.5 million project by Leicester City Council to create a new market square. The team uncovered the long-lost Gainsborough Chamber—a medieval civic building first recorded in 1533, infamous for its “vile prison.” They also discovered layers of Roman and Anglo-Saxon life, artifacts, and even a Roman infant burial, offering an extraordinary window into centuries of human history lying silently beneath the modern marketplace.At the centre of the discovery is the Gainsborough Chamber, demolished around 1748 but now partially restored in the archaeological record. Historical texts describe it as a “most vile prison,” where harsh conditions likely made it infamous in medieval Leicester. Archaeologists uncovered its thick stone walls, a stone-lined well, and remnants of the dungeon, confirming the building’s architectural and civic importance.According to historian Charles Billson, a prisoner in 1533 described being chained, lying on hard planks, and receiving no comfort or company, highlighting the dungeon’s grim reputation. Gavin Speed, the lead archaeologist, emphasized that this area of Leicester had remained largely untouched until the current excavation, making the discovery even more remarkable.The excavation revealed a wealth of Roman-era remains, including a timber building later replaced by a stone structure. Artifacts such as Roman tesserae, pottery, coins, and jewellery help reconstruct daily life in ancient Leicester. A particularly poignant find was the burial of a Roman infant beneath the timber structure, likely around 1,900 years ago, providing a glimpse into family life and customs from nearly two millennia ago. The later stone building was constructed directly over the earlier timber house, showing how the city evolved over time. These findings underscore Leicester’s long-standing significance as a Roman settlement and trade hub.Beneath the medieval layers, archaeologists uncovered a thick Anglo-Saxon soil layer, shedding light on a little-understood period in Leicester’s history. Compacted pebbles, overlain by silts and successive resurfacing layers, revealed nearly 800 years of continuous market activity. Post-holes from medieval market stalls offer rare physical evidence of the city’s commercial past. Dr. Speed described the site as “like a slice through an archaeological cake,” showing how each layer represents a different generation of market activity and urban life. These discoveries reveal how Leicester’s central square continuously adapted to social and economic changes, blending Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and medieval influences across centuries.The dig confirms Leicester’s role as a historic trade centre, with layers of activity preserved beneath the modern square. The city council plans to repave the market in porphyry by the end of 2026 but hopes to display some of the archaeological finds to the public. Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby highlighted that the expertise of ULAS has revealed how the site has been used for thousands of years, from Roman settlers to Victorian traders. While shoppers walk above, centuries of human history remain hidden just below their feet, from infant burials to bustling medieval markets. This remarkable find reminds us that every step through Leicester’s marketplace is a step across two millennia of living history.","Archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s Market Place.

We share an ambition for a modern defence and security partnership, a fundamental pillar of UK-India Vision 2035, agreed by our PMs this year,” said British high commissioner to India, Lindy Cameron.“The engagements between the CSGs of our two navies demonstrate our commitment to maintaining the rules-based international order in the region and lay the groundwork for future cooperation,” she added.The biennial naval exercise will include complex maritime operational drills focusing on anti-air, anti-surface and anti-submarine exercises as well as flying operations and other seamanship evolutions.The UK CSG is also scheduled to participate in a one-day aerial defence exercise with the IAF, which will deploy Sukhoi-30MKI and Jaguar fighters, off the west coast on Oct 14.“Exercise Konkan will serve as a platform to consolidate strategic ties, enhance interoperability and contribute to regional maritime stability. It is a reaffirmation of the shared commitment to ensuring secure, open and free seas,” Indian Navy spokesperson Captain Vivek Madhwal said.The Konkan series of exercises has grown significantly in scale and complexity over the last two decades, fostering enhanced interoperability and mutual understanding in maritime operations between the two navies, he added.The UK CSG is currently on an eight-month multinational deployment called ""Operation Highmast"", which includes complex exercises with partners and allies in the region. The CSG warships will also visit the ports in Mumbai and Goa after the conclusion of the Konkan exercise.","Indian warships are being led by aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, with MiG-29K fighters on board.
