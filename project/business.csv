"Install advanced safety system, govt tells dam owners amid forecast of above normal rainfall",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/install-advanced-safety-system-govt-tells-dam-owners-amid-forecast-of-above-normal-rainfall/articleshow/110650016.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the country expecting 'above normal' rainfall during the four-month (June-September) monsoon season, the Centre has notified new regulations asking every owner of the specified dams to install a well-designed hydro-meteorological instrumentation network for inflow forecasting and flood warning.The move comes at a time when the forecast of 'above normal' rainfall indicates the possibility of a situation where filling up the dams to their full capacity may lead to flooding of low-lying areas in case of discharge of excess water for dam safety. The specified dams are those which fall under the National Register of Large Dams. There are 5,745 large dams in the country.As per the register, there are 234 large dams in India, which are more than 100-year-old whose safety is a major concern when their catchment areas get fairly good rainfall during monsoon. Madhya Pradesh has the highest number (63) of more than 100-year-old dams followed by Maharashtra (44), Gujarat (30), Rajasthan (25) and Telangana (21).Seeking to achieve the satisfactory level of dam safety assurance, the regulations notified by the National Dam Safety Authority on May 20, also asked every state dam safety organisation to keep ""perpetual surveillance of all specified dams under their jurisdiction, to observe various anomalies including cracks in the body of the dam or abutment, unusual seepage, deflection in the dam body and any other problem related to dam or hydro-mechanical equipment"" for the safety of the dams.Responsibility for safety of dams, including its operation and maintenance, rests primarily with dam owners which are mostly the state governments and central/state Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs). At present dam owners generally carry out the safety audit in terms of periodical pre-monsoon and post-monsoon inspection of their dams.According to the notification, hydro-meteorological stations of specified dams will now have to constantly measure rainfall (precipitation), water level, discharge, temperature, humidity, evaporation, wind velocity and direction, and snowfall, if any, for monitoring the safety of dams.","The Centre has notified new regulations asking every owner of the specified dams to install a well-designed hydro-meteorological instrumentation network for inflow forecasting and flood warning.

Rewilding in tiger reserves helps near-extinct vultures soar again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rewilding-in-tiger-reserves-helps-near-extinct-vultures-soar-again/articleshow/110646083.cms,"In Jan, when a bronze statue of ‘Jatayu’—the mythical vulture who fought valiantly to save Sita from Ravana—was unveiled at the Ram Temple consecration in Ayodhya, twenty real-life Jatayus or vultures—in desperate need of their own heroic rescue—were soft-released into the lush Tadoba and Pench tiger reserves in Maharashtra . This move was part of a vulture reintroduction program by the Bombay Natural History Society ( BNHS ) and a significant step forward in helping these unsung heroes — who do the dirty work of cleaning up after death and keeping the environment healthy — make a comeback from the brink of extinction .Over the next one year, 30 more vultures, out of 750 white-rumped, slender-billed, and long-billed vultures bred at various BNHS centres, will be rewilded in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan.“BNHS undertook the strategy of reintroducing vultures in tiger habitats with a large prey base to restore vultures in their predestined role as nature’s sanitation crew,” says Praveen Pardeshi, president, BNHS. “We intend to do the same in sanctuaries like Melghat and Koyna in Maharashtra that don’t have vultures as well as in other states.”Helping vultures reclaim their place in the ecosystem was crucial, according to Pardeshi, and the “next big challenge” following their 2003 discovery of ‘Diclofenac’, a veterinary drug used to treat cattle that was causing mass kidney failure in vultures after they scavenged treated livestock.This revelation explained the mystery behind the massive crash in vulture population in the '80s and '90s that had baffled scientists and prompted the International Union for Conservation of Nature to declare that the Indian vulture was “only one step away from total extinction.” By 2007, 99% of vultures in India—once numbering 40 million— had disappeared, with serious consequences for the environment. Following the findings, the Indian government banned the drug’s veterinary use in 2006.Despite this, India’s vultures continued to face threats—rapid habitat loss and starvation due to diminished forage. “Almost no farmer leaves their dead cattle outside anymore but buries them because of which no food is available for vultures, as it formerly was, in farmland areas,” notes Pardeshi. He hopes that ample food in Tadoba and Pench National Parks will sustain the vultures, allowing them to recycle the remains of prey hunted by tigers, leopards, and wild dogs and complete vital carbon and nitrogen cycles.India’s vulture conservation story — that began when BNHS joined forces with the Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, and Haryana forest departments about a decade ago to breed these vital but vulnerable scavengers that often get a bad rap for their ungainly look and scavenging habits— gained international attention at the first ever World Species Congress last month.Hosted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the virtual 24-hour gathering brought together government and environmental agencies to conservationists, wildlife groups and students to chart a “coordinated map of key actions” aimed at species recovery. It’s taken years of work to artificially hatch new fledglings of the three most endangered vulture species every year, research the safety of veterinary drugs, and identify regions in need of protection, “But the fight to revive vulture populations in the wild has not yet been won,” says Kishor Rithe, director of BNHS. “Sensitization of pharmacists and identifying vulture safe zones are some of the challenges before us,” he adds, given pharmacy surveys in 2017–18 that revealed yet again that diclofenac was still easily available.While BNHS teams are currently out in the field conducting pharmacy surveys, carcass sampling, educating cattle owners and sensitising villagers about vulture nesting colonies, they’re also raising funds to create ‘Vulture Safe Zones’ in UP, MP, and Assam, within a 100 km radius of the release sites, to keep vultures safe beyond the tiger reserves.“Also, the birds set to take off into the wild will be GPS or satellite tagged to track their movements. With support from the central and state governments, along with international funding agencies, India will definitely be able to revive its Jatayu population to earlier times, and large congregations of vultures will finally soar in the skies freely after nearly two decades,” says an optimistic Rithe.","In Jan, a bronze statue of ‘Jatayu’ was unveiled at the Ram Temple consecration in Ayodhya. 20 real-life Jatayus or vultures were soft-released into the lush Tadoba and Pench tiger reserves in Maharashtra.

New Sankalps from the Sadhana in Kanyakumari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-sankalps-from-the-sadhana-in-kanyakumari/articleshow/110645712.cms,"These thoughts were penned by PM

Narendra Modi

on June 1 between 4.15pm and 7pm during his return flight from

to Delhi

My fellow Indians,The biggest festival of democracy, the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections, is concluding today in our nation, the Mother of Democracy . After a three-day spiritual journey in Kanyakumari, I have just boarded the plane for Delhi. Through the day, Kashi and numerous other seats have been in the midst of voting.My mind is filled with so many experiences and emotions... I feel a boundless flow of energy within myself. The 2024 Lok Sabha elections are the first in the Amrit Kaal. I began my campaign a few months ago from Meerut, the land of the First War of Independence of 1857. Since then, I have traversed ac-ross the length and breadth of our great nation. The final rally of these elections took me to Hoshiarpur in Punjab, the land of the great Gurus and a land associated with Sant Ravidas Ji. After that, I came to Kanyakumari, at the feet of Maa Bharti.It is natural that the fervour of the elections was echoing in my heart and mind. The multitude of faces seen in rallies and road shows came in front of my eyes. The blessings from our Nari Shakti... the trust, the affection, all of this was a very humbling experience. My eyes were getting moist... I entered into a 'sadhana' (meditative state). And then, the heated political debates, the attacks and counter-attacks, the voices and words of accusations which are so characteristic of an election... they all vanished into a void. A sense of detachment came to grow within me... my mind became completely detached from the external world.Meditation becomes challenging amidst such huge responsibilities, but the land of Kanyakumari and the inspiration of Swami Vivekananda made it effortless. As a candidate myself, I left my campaign in the hands of my beloved people of Kashi and came here.I am also grateful to God for instilling in me these values from birth, which I have cherished and tried to live up to. I was also thinking about what Swami Vivekananda must have experienced during his meditation at this very place in Kanyakumari! A part of my meditation was spent in a similar stream of thoughts.Amidst this detachment, amidst the peace and silence, my mind was constantly thinking about the bright future of Bharat , the goals of Bharat. The rising sun at Kanyakumari gave new heights to my thoughts, the vastness of the ocean expanded my ideas, and the expanse of the horizon continuously made me realise the unity, the Oneness, embedded in the depths of the universe. It seemed as if the observations and experiences undertaken in the lap of the Himalayas decades ago were being revived.Friends,Kanyakumari has always been very close to my heart. The Vivekananda Rock Memorial in Kanyakumari was built under the leadership of Shri Eknath Ranade ji. I had the opportunity to travel extensively with Eknath ji. During the construction of this memorial, I had the opportunity to spend some time in Kanyakumari as well.From Kashmir to Kanyakumari... this is a common identity that is deeply ingrained in the heart of every citizen of the country. This is the 'Shakti Peeth' (seat of Shakti) where Maa Shakti incarnated as Kanya Kumari. At this southern tip, Maa Shakti performed penance and waited for Bhagwan Shiva, who was residing in the Himalayas at the northernmost parts of Bharat.Kanyakumari is the land of confluences. The sacred rivers of our country flow into different seas, and here, those very seas converge. And here, we witness another great confluence - the ideological confluence of Bharat! Here, we find the Vivekananda Rock Memorial, a grand statue of Saint Thiruvalluvar, Gandhi Mandapam, and Kamarajar Mani Mandapam. These streams of thought from these stalwarts converge here to form a confluence of national thought. This gives rise to great inspirations for nation-building. This land of Kanyakumari gives an indelible message of unity, especially to any person who doubts Bharat's nationhood and the sense of unity.The grand statue of Saint Thiruvalluvar in Kanyakumari seems to be looking at the expanse of Maa Bharti from the sea. His work Thirukkural is one of the crown jewels of the beautiful Tamil language. It covers every aspect of life, inspiring us to give our best for ourselves and for the nation. It was my great fortune to pay my respects to such a great figure.Friends,Swami Vivekananda once said, ""Every nation has a message to deliver, a mission to fulfil, a destiny to reach.""For thousands of years, Bharat has been moving forward with this sense of meaningful purpose. Bharat has been a cradle of ideas for thousands of years. We have never considered what we have acquired as our personal wealth or measured it purely by economic or material parameters. Therefore, 'Idam-na-mama' (this is not mine) has become an inherent and natural part of the character of Bharat.Bharat's welfare benefits our planet's journey to progress as well. Take the freedom movement as an example. Bharat gained independence on Aug 15, 1947. At that time, many countries around the world were under colonial rule. Bharat's independence journey inspired and empowered many of those countries to achieve their own freedom. That same spirit was seen decades later when the world came face to face with the once in a century Covid-19 pandemic. When concerns were raised about the poor and developing countries, Bharat's successful efforts provided courage and assistance to many nations.Today, Bharat's governance model has become an example for many countries around the world. Empowering 25 crore people to rise above poverty in just 10 years is unprecedented. Innovative practices such as Pro-People Good Governance, aspirational districts, and aspirational blocks are being discussed globally today. Our efforts, from empowering the poor to last-mile delivery, have inspired the world by prioritising individuals standing at the last rung of society. Bharat's Digital India campaign is now an example for the entire world, showing how we can use technology to empower the poor, bring transparency, and ensure their rights. Inexpensive data in Bharat is becoming a means of social equality by ensuring the reach of information and services to the poor. The whole world is witnessing and studying the democratisation of technology, and major global institutions are advising many countries to adopt elements from our model.Today, Bharat's progress and rise are not just a significant opportunity for Bharat alone, but also a historic opportunity for all our partner countries around the world. Since the success of the G20, the world has been increasingly envisioning a bigger role for Bharat. Today, Bharat is being acknowledged as a strong and important voice of the Global South. The African Union has become a part of the G20 group at the initiative of Bharat. This is going to be a crucial turning point for the future of African countries.Friends,The development trajectory of Bharat fills us with pride and glory, but at the same time, it also reminds the 140 crore citizens of their responsibilities. Now, without wasting a single moment, we must step forward towards greater duties and larger goals. We need to dream new dreams, convert them into reality and begin living those dreams.We must see Bharat's development in a global context, and for this, it is essential that we understand Bharat's internal capabilities. We must acknowledge Bharat's strengths, nurture them, and utilise them for the benefit of the world. In today's global scenario, Bharat's strength as a youthful nation is an opportunity from which we must not look back.The world of the 21st century is looking towards Bharat with many hopes. And we will need to make several changes to move forward in the global scenario. We also need to change our traditional thinking regarding reform. Bharat cannot limit reform to just economic reforms. We must move forward in every aspect of life towards the direction of reform. Our reforms should also align with the aspirations of a 'Viksit Bharat' (developed India) by 2047.We must also understand that reform can never be a unidimensional process for any country. Therefore, I have laid out the vision of reform, perform, and transform for the country. The responsibility of reform lies with leadership. Based on that, our bureaucracy performs, and when the people join in with the spirit of Jan Bhagidari, we witness a transformation taking place.We must make excellence the fundamental principle to make our country a 'Viksit Bharat'. We need to work quickly in all four directions: Speed, Scale, Scope, and Standards. Alongside manufacturing, we must also focus on quality and adhere to the mantra of 'zero defect-zero effect'.Friends,We should take pride in every moment that God has blessed us with birth in the land of Bharat. God has chosen us to serve Bharat and fulfil our role in our country's journey towards excellence.We must redefine our heritage in a modern way while embracing ancient values in a modern context.As a nation, we also need to reassess outdated thinking and beliefs. We need to free our society from the pressure of professional pessimists. We must remember that freedom from negativity is the first step towards achieving success. Success blossoms in the lap of positivity.My faith, devotion, and belief in the infinite and eternal power of Bharat are growing day by day. Over the past 10 years, I have seen this capability of Bharat grow even more and have experienced it firsthand.Just as we utilised the fourth and fifth decades of the 20th century to impart a new momentum to the freedom movement, we must lay the foundation for a 'Viksit Bharat' in these 25 years of the 21st century. The freedom struggle was a time that called for great sacrifices. The present times call for great and sustained contributions from everyone.Swami Vivekananda had said in 1897 that we must dedicate the next 50 years solely for the nation. Exactly 50 years after this call, Bharat gained independence in 1947.Today, we have the same golden opportunity. Let's dedicate the next 25 years solely for the nation. Our efforts will create a strong foundation for the coming generations and the coming centuries, taking Bharat to new heights. Looking at the energy and enthusiasm of the country, I can say that the goal is not far away now. Let us take swift steps... let us come together and create a Viksit Bharat.",PM Narendra Modi penned the letter during his return flight from Kanyakumari to Delhi.

Results delayed due to agricultural practicals: KEA ED,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/results-delayed-due-to-agricultural-practicals-kea-ed/articleshow/110644274.cms,"BENGALURU: Dismissing accusations that the Karnataka Examination Authority (KEA) delayed the CET results by 42 days to aid private colleges with their management seat intakes , KEA Executive Director Prasanna H stated the delay was due to agriculture practical exams. These practical examinations are held for students availing agriculture quota for entry to BSc agriculture.Addressing media persons on Sunday, a day after the KEA results, Prasanna said the Karnataka CET agricultural quota exams were held on May 25, and the results were declared on May 31 -- this caused the delay. The KEA declared the CET results a day later, on June 1.According to data available with TOI , of the CET conducted in the past five years — 2019 to 2023 — there was a difference of anywhere between 21 to 43 days between the examination and results, impacting up to 2.4 lakh candidates.This year, about 3.1 lakh students wrote the CET, setting a record high compared to the past five years. Prasanna told TOI, “The greater number of students who attempted the examination this year, compounded with the delay in the OMR sheet for marking the students because of the agitation over out-of-syllabus questions, also impacted the announcement date of the results.”He was certain that meritorious students applying for seats under KEA would not be disadvantaged because 45 percent of seats are to be filled in private and autonomous institutes through KEA ranking. As for aided institutes, 95 percent of seats are filled by KEA ranking. “Some sections are trying to create confusion by saying that private institution managements have been filling seats for donations. But they are all far from the truth,” he said.According to statistics from KEA, however, 9,955 engineering seats for the academic year 2023-24 were remaining. A source from KEA added that they were eventually handed over by the KEA to the private institutes because there were no takers.Students’ Ranks Not Announced Can Check KEA PortalAbout 3,000 students who wrote the CET did not receive their ranks and were in a state of panic. Prasanna said students’ ranks were withheld because they might have mistakenly entered a wrong unique ID from PUC while submitting their CET applications. Now, since the two did not match, the error occurred. These students, he said, will be given a chance to check their ranks on the CET portal on Monday by entering their marks.The counselling dates, fee structure, and seat matrix are yet to be announced. Prasanna said the counselling dates for engineering, medical, dental, and other professional courses will be announced after UG-NEET-2024 ranking is out. Similarly the architecture students will get their ranks after taking NATA scores into consideration. As for the seat matrix, engineering colleges are seeking course extension from AICTE, and it will be announced after that. The fees, meanwhile, he said, may be in the range of 10 percent around the current structure and is yet to be decided.","The Karnataka CET agricultural quota exams were held on May 25, and the results were declared on May 31 -- this caused the delay.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Feeling flush: Japan's high-tech toilets go global,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/feeling-flush-japans-high-tech-toilets-go-global/articleshow/110649653.cms,"'Smartest toilet'

'Does it hurt?'

KITAKYUSHU: As Japan plays host to a record influx of tourists, one of the country's more private attractions -- the high-tech toilet -- is becoming a must-have in luxury bathrooms worldwide.With their warm seats and precision spray technology, bidet toilets are the norm in Japan, where more than 80 percent of homes have one, according to a government survey.Now sales are surging abroad and especially in the United States, led by A-list bidet fans such as Drake, the Kardashians and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Japanese company TOTO , which pioneered the electric bidets it claims have sparked ""a global revolution from wiping to washing"", says overseas revenue for toilets has roughly doubled from 100 billion yen ($673 million) in 2012.The pandemic was a key driver, bringing a home-renovation boom but also germ-conscious consumers desperate for an alternative to toilet paper after shelves were cleared by panic-buyers.Senior TOTO executive Shinya Tamura, who oversees international business, told AFP the brand's growth has been a word-of-mouth success.When people first learn how the toilets' water jets work, with pressure and temperature controls, ""there's an image that it's not pleasant"".But ""we can't explain how good it is with words. You need to experience it"", Tamura said.""After a while, most users can't live without it.""The company's international net sales for housing equipment are currently less than a third of those in Japan.It wants to boost sales in the Americas by 19 percent over two years to ""establish a solid position"" there and offset less urgent demand in China.But with more people in the market for a squeaky clean bum, US competitors are challenging TOTO and its Japanese rivals such as Panasonic and LIXIL for their throne.At a major tech fair in Las Vegas this year, the marketing manager of US brand Kohler called its Numi 2.0 -- which takes spoken instructions via an in-built Amazon Alexa -- ""the smartest toilet that exists"".Just like top-end Japanese models, the Numi 2.0 has an automatic deodoriser and a motion-activated lid that opens when you enter the bathroom and closes when you leave.Its spray wand has pulsating and oscillating functions, and users can adjust the warm-air dryer in minute detail.But such pampering comes at a price: around $8,500 to $10,000, compared to around $500 for more basic bidet seats.Americans who travel to Japan are often inspired to upgrade their toilet, a salesman at Ardy's Bath Collection in Beverly Hills told AFP.""They see it in the airport, and they see it in public restrooms, and they use it, and they're like, 'wow, this is great,'"" he said.Bidets are ""popular everywhere"" but it's still a ""private experience"" and ""weird to talk about"" for some customers.Although fancy Japanese-style toilets are fast becoming a status symbol, TOTO's executives have long fought prudishness when trying to expand abroad.After the US launch of its Washlet bidet in 1986, the firm struggled to place advertisements, and its pop-up event was kicked out of a high-end mall because other stores complained.","Japanese company TOTO says overseas revenue for toilets has roughly doubled from 100 billion yen ($673 million) in 2012.

What was the ""911 S5"" botnet?

The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. According to FBI Director Christopher Wray, it was ""likely the world's largest"" and facilitated numerous cybercrimes, including identity theft, financial fraud, and access to child exploitation materials.

Who was behind the botnet?

Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang was arrested in Singapore on May 24. He allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers.

How did the botnet operate?

The botnet operated by infecting residential Windows computers with malware, transforming them into ""zombie"" machines that could be controlled remotely. Cybercriminals purchased access to these compromised computers, using them to carry out various illegal activities.

What kind of crimes were committed using the botnet?

Criminals used the botnet for a staggering array of crimes. These included identity theft, financial fraud, child exploitation, bomb threats, and cyberattacks. The botnet was also involved in defrauding financial institutions and federal lending programs, including pandemic relief scams. US Attorney General Merrick Garland stated that the criminals were responsible for over $5.9 billion in estimated losses from relief program fraud.

What assets were seized during the operation?

Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods valued at $4 million, and about $30 million in real estate. These assets were located in various countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, and others. Additionally, 22 domains associated with the botnet were also seized.

How did the law enforcement operation unfold?

The operation, named Operation Tunnel Rat, involved executing multiple search warrants and conducting interviews in Singapore and Thailand. The FBI, along with international partners, dismantled the botnet's infrastructure and arrested Wang. Authorities are also looking into the possibility of additional arrests.

How did the public get involved in this operation?

The FBI has set up a web page where individuals can check if their IP address was among those compromised by the botnet. This helps potential victims identify and mitigate any security issues stemming from the infection.

What happens next for Yunhe Wang?

The US is currently awaiting Wang's extradition from Singapore. Brett Leatherman, deputy assistant director with the FBI’s Cyber Division, emphasized the urgency of the extradition, stating, “We want him, you know, as soon as possible.”

An international law enforcement team has made a significant breakthrough in the fight against cybercrime, arresting a Chinese national and dismantling a massive botnet that has been operational for nearly a decade. This botnet, known as "" 911 S5 ,"" was responsible for various illegal activities, including identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud . The takedown involved cooperation between authorities in multiple countries, highlighting the global nature of cybercrime and the necessity of international collaboration to combat it.The botnet, managed by Yunhe Wang , infected millions of computers across nearly 200 countries. This network of compromised machines, often referred to as ""zombie"" computers, was used by criminals to carry out a wide array of illicit activities. The US Department of Justice and the FBI have been instrumental in this operation, which has led to significant financial and operational seizures, including millions in cryptocurrency and luxury assets.Here is all you need to know:(With inputs from agencies)","The ""911 S5"" botnet was a vast network of malware-infected computers spanning nearly 200 countries. Yunhe Wang, a 35-year-old Chinese national, was identified as the administrator of the botnet. Wang allegedly managed the network through 150 dedicated servers, half of which were leased from US-based service providers. Law enforcement seized approximately $29 million in cryptocurrency, luxury goods, and about $30 million in real estate.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110548747,imgsize-1251069,width-400,resizemode-4/110548747.jpg"
Stunning archaeological find: Prehistoric discovery in US lake leaves experts in shock and awe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stunning-archaeological-find-prehistoric-discovery-in-us-lake-leaves-experts-in-shock-and-awe/articleshow/110569138.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Wisconsin historians have announced a groundbreaking discovery of at least 11 ancient canoes in Lake Mendota , near Madison. This significant find includes a canoe dating back to 2500 BC. The Wisconsin Historical Society revealed the discovery on May 23, noting that the initial two canoes were found in 2021 and 2022.Dr Amy Rosebrough, State Archaeologist for the Wisconsin Historical Society, explained the importance of this find, saying, ""The Indigenous peoples of Wisconsin and the wider United States fished, traveled, and traded extensively on inland lakes and streams, and until now we have not had a clear look at the canoes used in the Great Lakes region."" She likened the discovery to understanding life in the Midwest without ever seeing a real pickup truck, emphasizing the crucial role canoes played in transportation and trade.Radiocarbon dating revealed that the oldest canoe dates back to 2500 BC, contemporary with the construction of Stonehenge, and much earlier than the founding of Ancient Rome or the birth of Jesus Christ. The youngest canoe dates to 1250 AD.Not all canoes will be removed from the lake due to their fragility. Rosebrough mentioned that divers also found stone tools in the water, suggesting the presence of an ancient village site, which has yet to be located. ""Even without finding the village, the discovery of these canoes and the tools found within the first canoe reminds us that people have lived and worked alongside the lake for thousands of years,"" she added.Efforts are ongoing to explore the lake further, using non-destructive remote sensing techniques to uncover more about this prehistoric site. Rosebrough highlighted the unique archaeological potential of smaller bodies of water like Lake Mendota, which often receive less funding than the Great Lakes but hold distinct historical significance.The Wisconsin Historical Society, in partnership with Native Nations in Wisconsin, aims to uncover and share the rich history of these discoveries at the new Wisconsin History Center, set to open in early 2027.","Wisconsin historians have announced a groundbreaking discovery of at least 11 ancient canoes in Lake Mendota.

Hush money trial: Donald Trump is convicted on all 34 charges. Now what?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hush-money-trial-donald-trump-is-convicted-on-all-34-charges-now-what/articleshow/110577474.cms,"What happens now

The next step is for Judge Juan Merchan to approve the verdict and enter a final judgment. This is usually a formality. Sentencing typically follows within several weeks, but legal arguments can delay this process. Lawyers on both sides will recommend sentences, which will be debated at the sentencing hearing where Merchan will make a final decision.

Will Trump go to prison?

That is unlikely. While the maximum sentence for falsifying business records is four years in prison, it is rare for first-time offenders of this crime in New York to receive prison time. ""Punishments like fines or probation are more common,"" and alternatives like home confinement or curfews could be considered, given the logistical challenges of imprisoning a former president with a lifetime Secret Service detail.

Can Trump appeal the conviction?

Yes, Trump is expected to appeal. He may argue that the indictment was legally flawed and politically motivated. His defense will likely focus on several legal points, including that state election laws do not apply to federal elections and that the charges themselves were legally improper.

Could Trump still become president?

Yes, the US Constitution only requires that presidents be at least 35 years old and natural-born US citizens who have lived in the country for 14 years. Even if he were in jail, Trump could theoretically be sworn in as president on January 20, 2025.

Can Trump vote for himself?

Yes, as long as Trump is not imprisoned in New York, he can vote for himself. Florida defers to other states' rules on felony disenfranchisement, and in New York, felons regain their voting rights once they are out of prison, even if on parole.

Will Trump's conviction affect his campaign?

The conviction does not legally prevent Trump from running for or becoming president. The Republican National Convention, which will take place shortly after his sentencing, has no rules disqualifying a convicted nominee. Trump remains popular among the GOP base, and the party's leadership is aligned with him.

What are the broader implications of this conviction?

The conviction marks unprecedented territory in US politics, especially as Trump faces three other criminal cases. The Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 counts after deliberating for two days. The trial included explicit testimony and evidence that implicated Trump in approving a $130,000 payment to silence Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign.

What are the next steps for Trump legally and politically?

Following his sentencing, Trump can appeal to higher courts. His defense team has already laid groundwork for appeals, citing potential judicial bias and procedural issues. Politically, Trump continues to rally support, painting the conviction as a politically motivated attack. Despite the legal challenges, leading strategists believe Trump remains a formidable candidate for the 2024 election.

"Boeing’s long-awaited space mission, carrying Sunita Williams, aborted just before liftoff",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nasa-boeing-starliner-sunita-suni-williams-space-mission/articleshow/110631968.cms,"Boeing Co and Nasa postponed the first crewed flight of the company’s already long-delayed space taxi on Saturday, halting the countdown less than four minutes before takeoff due to a launchpad computer system issue.The CST-100 Starliner ’s flight from Florida to the International Space Station is a critical test to prove the craft can safely carry people to and from the orbiting research laboratory for Nasa.A launchpad sequencer that controls vital systems during the final countdown triggered the abort, the latest setback for a launch effort years in the making. Nasa said it’s forgoing a possible launch on Sunday to allow the agency, United Launch Alliance and Boeing time to determine what went wrong.The next launch opportunities are June 5 and June 6, Nasa said in a blog post. ULA builds the Atlas V rocket that will loft the Starliner capsule to space.Earlier Sunday, ULA Chief Executive Officer Tory Bruno said the remedy might be an easy hardware fix as simple as swapping out a part — or it could be more involved.The launch sequencer is made up of three redundant computers; two of the computers reported normal conditions, while the third one moved more slowly than it was supposed to. That automatically triggered the abort. ULA still doesn’t know what caused the third computer to behave that way.In 2014, Nasa awarded Boeing $4.2 billion and Elon Musk’s SpaceX $2.6 billion in contracts to create vehicles to ferry the agency’s astronauts to space, the centerpieces of its Commercial Crew Program.While Starliner has fallen seven years behind schedule because of to a long line of technical glitches and failures, rival SpaceX has launched nine separate crews to the space station for Nasa since 2020.The repeated delays have added mounting pressure for Boeing, which has racked up roughly $1.5 billion in cost overruns on the program. The company’s defense and space division is expected to lose money during the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Brian West told a conference in May, citing “cost pressure” on fixed-price contracts.Boeing faces questions about the long-term vision for its space business. It’s unclear whether Starliner will be used beyond a half-dozen more missions to the ISS for Nasa. Late last year, West told a small gathering of investors that the company has a decision to make about future investment in the program, Bloomberg has reported.The Saturday launch attempt, meant to carry veteran Nasa astronauts Sunita “Suni” Williams and Barry “Butch” Wilmore, came after weeks of uncertainty about when the mission would get off the ground.Nasa and Boeing tried to launch on May 6, but mission controllers stopped the countdown after noticing some weird behavior with a valve inside the rocket, forcing Williams and Wilmore to exit the spacecraft and wait for another launch day.Engineers replaced the valve, but the launch was delayed again after Boeing discovered a helium leak on one of Starliner’s many thrusters. After weeks of analysis and meetings, Boeing and Nasa ultimately decided to move forward with the launch without fixing the leak, saying it did not pose a safety issue and that engineers would monitor it throughout the flight.It’s possible that recent launch delays will force Boeing to take another incremental charge on Starliner, JPMorgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a May 27 research note.For this mission, Williams and Wilmore are slated to stay aboard the space station for about a week. Once their mission is complete, they will undock from the ISS in Starliner and land in the southwestern US under parachutes.","The launchpad sequencer that controls vital systems during the final countdown triggered the abort.

Oil producers led by Saudis extended supply cuts amid slack prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/oil-producers-led-by-saudis-extended-supply-cuts-amid-slack-prices/articleshow/110644871.cms,"FRANKFURT: Saudi Arabia and allied oil producing countries on Sunday extended output cuts through next year, a move aimed at supporting slack prices that haven't risen even amid turmoil in the middle east and the start of the summer travel season.The Opec+ alliance, made up of members of the producers cartel and allied countries including Russia, extended three different sets of cuts totaling 5.8 million barrels a day.International benchmark Brent has loitered in the $81-$83 per barrel range for the past month. Even the war in Gaza and attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels in Yemen have not pushed prices up toward the $100 per barrel level last seen in September 2022. Reasons include higher interest rates, concerns about demand due to slower than desired economic growth in Europe and China, and rising non-Opec supply including from US shale producers,Yet the Saudis need higher oil prices to fund ambitious plans by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the country's economy away from fossil fuel exports. Higher oil prices would also help Russia maintain economic growth and stability as it spends heavily on its war against Ukraine.Analysts say the cuts could push oil prices higher in coming months, but much depends on demand for oil going forward. The summer usually sees a spike in demand through the July-September quarter, but uncertainty about demand grows after that.US motorists have benefitted from weaker oil prices. Gasoline prices have been quiescent recently, averaging $3.56 per gallon last week, a penny less than a year ago. That is down from a record national average high of $5 per gallon in June 2022. US prices can vary by region and Western states have been paying more, with gas hitting an average $5.05 per gallon in California.US gas prices rise along with crude because the price of oil makes up half the cost of a gallon of gasoline. The price swings are much smaller in Europe because there taxes make up a bigger proportion of the price of fuel.The cuts that are being extended break down as follows: 2 billion barrels a day agreed among all 23 Opec+ members were extended through the end of 2025, according to an Opec statement.Then, voluntary reductions of 1.65 million barrels a day by a smaller group of members was extended until end 2025 as well, according to a report on the official Saudi Press Agency.And another 2.2 million barrels a day in voluntary cuts, due to expire at the end of this month, were extended until September but would then be gradually reduced month by month until they are eliminated by September 2025.","International benchmark Brent has loitered in the $81-$83 per barrel range for the past month.

Boeing Starliner launch scrubbed in final minutes of countdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boeing-starliner-launch-scrubbed-in-final-minutes-of-countdown/articleshow/110631198.cms,"Vital test

CAPE CANAVERAL: The first crewed flight of Boeing 's Starliner spaceship was dramatically called off Saturday with just under four minutes left on the launch countdown clock, for reasons that aren't yet clear.It was the second time the test mission to the International Space Station was scrubbed with the astronauts strapped in and ready to lift off, and yet another setback for the troubled program, which has already faced years of delays and safety scares.Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are waiting to be safely removed from the capsule. Mission commander Wilmore had earlier given a short but rousing speech telling tens of thousands of people tuning into the live feed that ""It's a great day to be proud of your nation.""The former US Navy test pilots, who each have two spaceflights under their belts, were previously called back to quarantine after an aborted launch attempt on May 6 due to a faulty valve on the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.A backup date is available for Sunday, but it's not yet known whether the Starship will be ready to launch.Starliner is poised to become just the sixth type of US-built spaceship to fly NASA astronauts, following the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960s and 1970s, the Space Shuttle from 1981 to 2011, and SpaceX 's Crew Dragon from 2020.NASA is looking to certify Boeing as a second commercial operator to ferry crews to theISS -- something Elon Musk's SpaceX has already been doing for the US space agency for four years.Both companies received multibillion-dollar contracts in 2014 to develop their gumdrop-shaped, autonomously piloted crew capsules, following the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 that left the US temporarily reliant on Russian rockets for rides.Boeing, with its 100-year history, was heavily favored over its then-upstart competitor, but its program fell badly behind amid embarrassing setbacks that mirrored the myriad problems afflicting its commercial airline division.These ranged from a software bug that put the spaceship on a bad trajectory on its first uncrewed test, to the discovery that the cabin was filled with flammable electrical tape after the second.While teams were working to replace the faulty valve that postponed the previous launch attempt, a small helium leak located in one of the spacecraft's thrusters came to light.But rather than replace the seal, which would require taking Starliner apart in its factory, NASA and Boeing officials declared it safe enough to fly as is.- Manual flying -Earlier Saturday, Wilmore and Williams emerged from the historic Neil A. Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building, exchanging thumbs-up signs and waves with their families before boarding a van that took them to their launch pad.When they do fly, they will be tasked with putting Starliner through the wringer, including taking manual control of the spacecraft.Starliner is set to dock with the ISS for eight days as the crew carry out tests, including simulating whether the ship can be used as a safe haven in the event there is a problem on the orbital outpost.After undocking, it will re-enter the atmosphere and carry out a parachute and airbag-assisted landing in the western United States.A successful mission would offer Boeing a much-needed reprieve from the intense safety concerns surrounding its 737 MAX passenger jets.It's also important for more immediate reasons: the Urine Processor Assembly on the ISS, which recycles water from astronauts' urine, suffered a failure this week and its pump needs to be replaced, Dana Weigel, NASA's ISS program manager, told reporters.This mission is thus tasked with carrying spare equipment, which weighs around 150 pounds (70 kilograms). To make way for it, two astronauts' suitcases containing clothes and toiletries had to be pulled off, meaning they'll need to rely on backup supplies kept on the station.","The first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner spaceship was dramatically called off Saturday.

Authorities are urging people to stay indoors, hydrate and avoid unnecessary travel. Demand for power has surged because of the high temperatures, putting a strain on existing electricity sources.UNICEF said resilient energy refers to reliable, flexible, accessible and quality power supplies that can withstand and recover quickly from unanticipated shocks, such as power outages and floods.It said more resilient energy supplies for schools would reduce dropout rates and improve children’s learning so they can earn more in the future.“Children depend on schools, health centers and safe drinking water for their survival, yet these facilities often don’t have the electricity supply to function optimally. As the current heatwave grips the country, electricity needs have skyrocketed, leading to shortfalls that can endanger children’s health,” said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan.UNICEF said 3.5 billion people live without reliable power worldwide.It said climate change is contributing to the disruption of generation and distribution of energy in Pakistan, where floods triggered by climate-induced monsoon rains in 2022 killed 1,739 people. It said almost half of the water infrastructure, such as storage tanks, wells and supply lines, was damaged by the floods.This year, Pakistan recorded its wettest April since 1961 with more than double the usual rainfall for the month. Heavy rains last month killed scores of people and destroyed property and farmland.Daytime temperatures in May have soared as much as 8 C (14 F) above average temperatures for the month over the last 20 years, raising fears of flooding in the northwest because of glacial melting.UNICEF said it helped restore water systems for 350,000 people in 375 locations after the 2022 floods and has also implemented several solar electrification initiatives in Pakistan.“Pakistan has an abundance of renewable resources and by investing in them we are tapping into a goldmine to help children,” Fadil said.

We only had some gold jewellery with us. We tried to pawn that but it wasn't easy. The interest was too high.""The fate of Pauktaw's residents reflects a nationwide tragedy. Across Myanmar, around 2.7 million have been forced to flee by the civil war.- Looting -The AA has not allowed residents to live back in Pauktaw, citing the danger of more air or artillery strikes on the town, although it does allow them to come and go to pick up items.The man who spoke to AFP said he had returned to check on his house and found it partly in ruins, with the family statue of the Buddha fallen onto the floor.His savings box -- containing money for a Buddhist ritual for his children and for timber to repair a roof damaged by a cyclone last year -- was gone, he said.""I have lost all of that money,"" he said.""Everything in our house got stolen... my father's fishing nets were stolen,"" another woman said, also requesting anonymity.""I am a tailor, and luckily, I managed to save my sewing machines.""During the fighting, both sides looted houses and damaged buildings, according to local reports.In March, the AA said it would ""investigate"" any reports of looting by its members during the fighting.- 'Decisive battle' -The AA's offensive has seized swathes of territory in Rakhine state and along the border with India and Bangladesh.It has said it will capture state capital Sittwe, 25 kilometres from Pauktaw and the last major town in northern Rakhine in the military's hands.In April, the AA warned residents of the town, which is home to an India-backed deep sea port, to leave ahead of a ""decisive"" battle.Sittwe residents contacted by AFP said the military was restricting travel out of the town by road and river and the prices of basic foods such as rice and eggs had doubled.Those already displaced from Pauktaw fear further fighting nearby.""I am sad that we have fled our own house and we can't live in it,"" one resident told AFP.""I have pawned my necklace for 18 lakhs ($850) so we have money to live. I still hope I can claim it back.""Others said they wanted payback.""I haven't joined the Arakan Army because I am worried about who will look after my child,"" one woman said.""If I wasn't...

The tobacco industry 's targeting of youth is rampant across our member states. As a result, we have a very worrying 11 million adolescents using various tobacco products. Coupled with the approximate 411 million adult tobacco users, our region, unfortunately, has the highest number of adolescent and adult users globally,"" Wazed said in a statement.The tobacco industry lures youths by aggressively introducing new nicotine and tobacco products such as electronic cigarettes and heated tobacco products, which are becoming increasingly popular among the youths in the region, she said.This multibillion-dollar industry recruits new tobacco users to reward their investors with even more profits. To achieve this, it preys on children and adolescents through marketing tactics, targeting them with new products, Wazed stated.""It is worrying that children and adolescents are regularly exposed to the digital marketing of tobacco products. This is despite having policies and regulations in place to prevent this,"" she said.""This situation is likely to get worse, as youngsters spend more time on social media and other similar platforms,"" Wazed said, highlighting that personalised and targeted advertising by the industry appears to dominate here, exposing them to harm.This year's theme for World No Tobacco Day is 'Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference'.The tobacco industry is fast to launch new products, using every means to expand market share before the regulations can catch up, she said.It continues to oppose evidence-based measures, such as increases in excise taxes, and comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorships. The companies even threaten legal action against governments that try to protect the health of their citizens, the WHO regional director added.Wazed pointed out that the response from governments and institutions lags in the matter.""Our efforts are complicated by the rapid changes in the marketing strategies of the tobacco industry,"" she said, emphasising that the relevant provisions of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) '? including Article 5.3 '? should be implemented in letter and spirit.Also, necessary tools and support are urgently needed to facilitate monitoring and implementation of the WHO FCTC recommendations in 'online' settings, she added.""Our goal for our youth is clear. We want to prevent and reduce tobacco consumption, nicotine addiction, and exposure to new tobacco products. To do this, we need a multi-stakeholder approach to frame and implement legislation, policies, regulations and administrative measures,"" the WHO's South-East Asia director said.""This approach needs to cast a wide net.

'Rishi Sunak's new policies help Tories narrow gap with Labour',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/rishi-sunaks-new-policies-help-tories-narrow-gap-with-labour/articleshow/110541235.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: In a sudden turn of events, the Conservative Party , led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak , has significantly narrowed the gap with the Labour Party ahead of the upcoming General Election . According to a new poll conducted by JL Partners, Labour's lead over the Conservatives has decreased from 18 points in April to just 12 points. This shift in public opinion marks a critical moment for both parties as they gear up for what promises to be a closely contested election.Prime Minister Sunak's recent policy initiatives appear to be resonating with voters, contributing to the narrowing of the gap. The new policies, aimed at addressing key issues such as the cost of living, healthcare, and national security, have bolstered the Conservative Party's standing in the polls. Sunak's focus on economic stability and pragmatic governance has been a central theme of his campaign, a Daily Mail report said.One of the key factors in this shift has been the public's response to the government's handling of economic challenges. Sunak has emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility while promising targeted support for those most affected by rising living costs. His policies have included measures to reduce inflation, support small businesses, and ensure that public services are adequately funded.Labour leader Keir Starmer, who had been enjoying a comfortable lead for several months, now faces increased pressure to maintain his party's advantage. Starmer's campaign has focused on issues such as social justice, public health, and education reform. However, the recent poll suggests that some voters may be reconsidering their support in light of the Conservative Party's renewed efforts.The tightening race reflects the dynamic and unpredictable nature of British politics. As both parties ramp up their campaigns, they are likely to intensify their efforts to sway undecided voters and solidify their bases. The Labour Party will need to reinforce its message and address any vulnerabilities that may have contributed to the narrowing gap.Political analysts suggest that the upcoming weeks will be crucial for both parties. The Conservatives will aim to continue their momentum by highlighting their recent policy successes and outlining their vision for the future. Meanwhile, Labour will need to counteract this by emphasizing their commitment to addressing inequality and improving public services.The public's perception of the leaders' performances will also play a significant role in the election outcome. Sunak's leadership style, characterized by his economic expertise and calm demeanor, contrasts with Starmer's focus on social issues and reform. Voters' evaluations of these contrasting approaches will be critical in determining the final result, the Daily Mail report said.As the election date approaches, both parties will be keenly aware of the importance of maintaining voter engagement and addressing the key concerns of the electorate. The race is expected to be highly competitive, with each party striving to gain the upper hand.The poll results have injected a new sense of urgency into the campaigns, underscoring the high stakes of the upcoming election. With the gap between the parties narrowing, the outcome remains uncertain, and both Sunak and Starmer will need to navigate the complexities of the political landscape to secure a victory.",The Conservative Party has significantly narrowed the gap with the Labour Party ahead of the upcoming General Election.

This revelation has ignited a debate about potential biases within the car insurance industry and the fairness of its pricing strategies .The study, conducted by the Daily Mail, involved requesting car insurance quotes from leading insurance companies for drivers with identical profiles but different names. The findings were striking: drivers named Mohammed were consistently quoted higher premiums than their counterparts named John. This difference in pricing has raised concerns about possible discrimination based on names, which often serve as indicators of ethnicity.One example highlighted by the study showed that a driver named Mohammed was quoted £1,333 for a year's coverage, while a driver named John with the same profile was quoted only £1,268. This pattern was repeated across multiple insurance providers, suggesting that the disparity is not an isolated incident, the Daily Mail report said.The insurance industry has defended its pricing practices. A spokesperson said, ""Insurance premiums are calculated based on a wide range of factors, including risk assessment data and historical claims information. We do not discriminate based on names."" However, the results of the investigation suggest that there may be an implicit bias in the risk assessment algorithms or historical data used to determine premiums.Consumer rights advocates are calling for greater transparency in how insurance premiums are determined. They argue that the current system may unfairly penalize individuals based on their name or perceived ethnicity. One advocate emphasized, ""It's crucial that the insurance industry addresses these disparities to build trust and provide fair treatment for all customers.""The implications of these findings are significant. If names can influence insurance premiums, it suggests that other forms of implicit bias may also be affecting the financial services industry. This calls into question the fairness and equity of other pricing and risk assessment practices.Calls for regulatory oversight and investigation into the insurance industry's pricing practices are growing louder. Lawmakers and consumer protection agencies are being urged to examine whether these disparities constitute a violation of anti-discrimination laws. An industry-wide review could lead to reforms designed to ensure that all customers are treated equitably, regardless of their name or ethnic background, the Daily Mail report added.This report contributes to the broader conversation about systemic biases in various sectors and underscores the importance of addressing these issues to ensure equitable treatment for all individuals. The insurance industry, like many others, faces the challenge of ensuring that its practices do not inadvertently perpetuate discrimination.",An investigation has uncovered a significant discrepancy in car insurance premiums between drivers named Mohammed and those with traditionally British names like John.

The offer, valued at £3.6 billion ($4.6 billion), was deemed ""fair and reasonable"" by IDS chairman Keith Williams. EP Group already holds a 27.6 percent stake in IDS, and the takeover is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals.Royal Mail, a former state monopoly privatised in 2013, has seen its core letters business suffer as consumers increasingly communicate online. However, this shift has benefited its international parcels business, GLS.Britain's communications regulator, Ofcom, has proposed reducing Royal Mail's delivery frequency to five or even three days per week, potentially saving the company hundreds of millions of pounds. IDS has long advocated for a reform of the universal service obligation (USO), which requires Royal Mail to deliver letters six days a week to all 32 million addresses in the UK for the price of a stamp.EP Group sees IDS as ""a strong business with solid foundations and the potential to become one of the leading postal logistics groups in Europe"", subject to modernisation that includes USO reform.Kretinsky expressed his group's ""utmost respect for Royal Mail's history and tradition"", acknowledging the responsibility that comes with owning a business with more than 500 years of history. The accepted offer was priced at 370 pence per IDS share, and following the announcement, IDS stock rose 2.9 percent to 330.5 pence in early London trading.Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, noted that GLS has long been considered the ""jewel in the company's crown"", enjoying a level of success that Royal Mail has struggled to achieve, and EP Group will have been eyeing the long-term opportunities in this area. EP has committed to honouring IDS management's promise not to impose compulsory redundancies at Royal Mail until April next year.Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, plans to meet with EP next week to call for further commitments on the company's future. IDS employs approximately 153,000 staff, with the vast majority representing Royal Mail.","International Distribution Services (IDS) has accepted a takeover proposal from Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky's conglomerate, EP Group.
