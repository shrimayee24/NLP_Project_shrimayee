'Offensive': Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma's sharp retort to Bangladesh's Muhammad Yunus' Northeast ‘landlocked’ remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/offensive-assam-cm-himanta-biswa-sarmas-sharp-retort-to-bangladeshs-muhammad-yunus-northeast-landlocked-remark/articleshow/119840858.cms,"Muhammad Yunus (left) and Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday strongly condemned the statement made by Bangladesh government's chief advisor, Muhammad Yunus, claiming that Bangladesh is the ""only guardian"" of the Indian Ocean for the region, as the seven northeastern Indian states are ""landlocked."" Sarma called Yunus' comments ""offensive"".""The statement made by Md Younis of Bangladesh's so called interim government referring to the seven sister states of Northeast India as landlocked and positioning Bangladesh as their guardian of ocean access, is offensive and strongly condemnable,"" Sarma said in a post on X.Chief advisor to Bangladesh's interim government, Muhammad Yunus, during his four-day visit to China, invited Beijing to expand its presence in the region. He highlighted that India's seven northeastern states are landlocked and suggested that Bangladesh could serve as a key gateway to the ocean for the region.In a widely shared video on social media, Yunus encouraged China to establish an economic base in Bangladesh, saying that Dhaka holds strategic access to the sea. He said, ""Seven states of India, eastern part of India, called seven sisters ... they are landlocked country, landlocked region of India. They have no way to reach out to the ocean.""Yunus further said, ""We are the only guardian of the ocean for all this region. So this opens up a huge possibility. So this could be an extension of the Chinese economy. Build things, produce things, market things, bring things to China, bring it out to the whole rest of the world.""Responding to Yunus's statement, Assam CM said, ""This remark underscores the persistent vulnerability narrative associated with India’s strategic “Chicken’s Neck” corridor. Historically, even internal elements within India have dangerously suggested severing this critical passageway to isolate the Northeast from the mainland physically.""Sarma also called for building alternative road routes to Northeast India. ""Therefore, it is imperative to develop more robust railway and road networks both underneath and around the Chicken’s Neck corridor . Additionally, exploring alternative road routes connecting the Northeast to mainland India, effectively bypassing the Chicken’s Neck, should be prioritized. Though this may pose significant engineering challenges, it is achievable with determination and innovation,"" he said.Earlier, on Monday, the Congress party called Yunus's statement ""very dangerous"" for the security of the Northeast region and alleged that the government is not taking care of the region including Manipur. ""Bangladesh is inviting China to encircle India. This attitude of the Bangladesh government is very dangerous for the security of our North East region. The government is not taking care of Manipur and China has already settled villages in Arunachal,"" Congress's head of media and publicity department Pawan Khera said in a post in Hindi on X.""Our foreign policy is in such a pathetic state that the country, in whose creation India had a major role, is also today engaged in rallying against us,"" Khera added.","Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma strongly condemned the statement made by Bangladesh government's chief advisor, Muhammad Yunus.

US Secret Service nixed Pannun plan to serve NSA Ajit Doval summons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-secret-service-nixed-pannun-plan-to-serve-ajit-doval-summons/articleshow/119822944.cms,"NEW DELHI: A US court has observed that the service of delivery of summons to NSA Ajit Doval , who accompanied PM Narendra Modi during his visit to the US on February 12-13, was not completed during his stay there, brushing aside Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun’s claim that he managed to get the notice delivered to the top Indian security official.The court was responding to a letter from Pannun’s lawyer which also revealed that US Secret Service agents guarding the Blair House, where the Indian delegation was put up, threatened to arrest his server when he tried to place the notice on the ground outside what is the president’s guest house. The server could only leave the summons with a nearby Starbucks store that didn’t prove to be enough for the court.After reviewing the letter, a judge of the Southern District of New York said that “the complaint was not delivered to a member of the hotel management or staff or any officers or agents providing security for Defendant (Doval), as required by the court's order”. The development confirms the Indian position that the NSA wasn’t served the summons, which foreign secretary Vikram Misri had described as based on unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations, during his stay in the US.The summons was issued last year in September by a US court in response to a civil lawsuit filed by Pannun about an alleged murder plot against him for which American authorities had blamed an Indian government agent named Vikash Yadav . The Indian government has conducted a probe into the issue and recommended legal action against Yadav. Indian national Nikhil Gupta remains in US custody for his alleged involvement in the plot and his case will go to trial on November 3, 2025.Pannun is said to have hired 2 process servers and one investigator to effect service on Doval in Washington DC during the latter’s 2-day trip to the US. According to the contents of the letter, the first server, identified as Ambiko Wallace, reached Blair House on February 12 at 7.22 pm and found it barricaded with a single checkpoint that was guarded by Secret Service agents. Wallace showed the legal document to an agent, but he would have none of it and forced the server to immediately leave the checkpoint.Another individual named Wayne Engram, apparently a more enterprising process server with 15 years of experience, approached the agents next day at 12.15 pm. As the Secret Service again refused to accept any document, he tried to place the envelope on the ground before them – a “standard method of service” apparently. However, one of the agents told him that he would be arrested if he left the summons on the ground. It was then that Engram decided to leave the documents at the nearest public location where he would not be arrested. This happened to be a Starbucks approximately 100 feet from the checkpoint. “Mr. Engram left the service documents in a sealed envelope in the public seating area outside the Starbucks. Then he went back to the checkpoint, told the agents where he had left the documents, and asked them to please retrieve them and give them to Defendant as soon as possible,’’ says the letter. This clearly proved to be insufficient for the court. While all this was going on, the investigator hired by Pannun also spoke to Blair House staff and Secret Service over phone but was told there was no way to serve the Defendant there. They also refused to share any email that could be used for sharing the summons.The Pannun murder plot threatened to snowball into a major diplomatic row last year, with the Biden administration not just seeking accountability but also backing similar charges by Canada over the murder of another Khalistan leader named Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Having recommended legal action against Yadav and pledging “functional improvements” in the system to deal with a matter like this, India will hope that the case will no longer act as an irritant in bilateral ties. Pannun, who was designated as a terrorist by India in 2020, is the spokesperson for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a Khalistan group India wants the US to ban.",A US court has observed that the service of delivery of summons to NSA Ajit Doval was not completed during his stay there. The court was responding to a letter from Pannun’s lawyer which also revealed that US Secret Service agents threatened to arrest his server.

Why Donald Trump's 'maximum pressure' tactic against Iran is a worry for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-donald-trumps-maximum-pressure-tactic-against-iran-is-a-worry-for-india/articleshow/119799417.cms,"Iran stands firm



Impact on India



India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor: The project faces significant challenges in the wake of Trump's threats against Iran. IMEC aims to enhance economic integration between India, the Middle East, and Europe by bypassing traditional routes like the Suez Canal. However, tensions between the US and Iran could disrupt this ambitious initiative. Trump's aggressive stance against Iran exacerbates regional tensions, threatening trade routes and infrastructure projects. This instability could divert investment away from IMEC, favoring more secure alternatives. As a result, India must navigate these complexities carefully to ensure the corridor's viability and maintain its strategic influence in the region. The project's future hinges on diplomatic efforts to stabilise the region and mitigate the impact of US-Iran tensions on IMEC's development and operations.

Oil imports : India, which was once the largest buyer of Iranian oil, had to seek alternative sources after the US withdrew sanction exemptions for oil imports. Continued sanctions would maintain this status quo, affecting India's energy security and forcing it to rely on more expensive alternatives. India has had to diversify its oil import basket, turning to other suppliers such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and even the United States to fill the gap.

Trade c hallenges: India and Iran have been negotiating a Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) to diversify trade beyond energy. However, US sanctions and tariffs could complicate these efforts by limiting financial transactions and discouraging investments in non-oil sectors. The overall trade between India and Iran has been severely affected by current US sanctions. The bilateral trade volume plummeted from $17 billion in 2018-2019 to a mere $2.3 billion in 2022-2023, representing a staggering decline of over 86%.

Chabahar Port development : The Chabahar Port project, a cornerstone of India-Iran economic engagement, faces potential setbacks due to increased US sanctions and regional tensions. Although the port is considered outside the purview of US sanctions, the overall geopolitical tension and financial restrictions have indirectly affected its development and utilisation. It offers India an alternative route for trade with Afghanistan and Central Asian countries, reducing dependence on Pakistan-controlled transit routes. However, US sanctions have made it difficult for international companies and financial institutions to participate in the project, slowing down its progress. Indian investments and operations at the port have continued, but at a reduced pace. The uncertainty surrounding the sanctions regime has also deterred potential partners and investors, limiting the port's growth potential.

Competition from China: China's increasing presence in the region, including a 25-year strategic partnership with Iran, poses a challenge to India's strategic interests. US sanctions could inadvertently strengthen China's position by limiting India's engagement with Iran. There are apprehensions that China might leverage its growing relationship with Iran to gain preferential access to Iranian resources and markets, potentially at the expense of Indian projects.

As part of his 'maximum pressure' approach, US president Donald Trump has threatened Iran with military action if Tehran does not agree to a new nuclear deal with Washington, a move that has hightened tensions in the region and will likely impact India's trade and security interests in the Middle East.The threat was made during a phone interview with NBC News, where Trump stated that if Iran fails to make a deal, there would be ""bombing the likes of which they have never seen before"". Additionally, Trump mentioned the possibility of imposing secondary tariffs on Iran if an agreement is not reached.Iran has responded strongly to these threats.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that if the US acts on Trump's threat, Iran will deliver a ""strong blow"" in retaliation. Iran has also prepared its missile arsenal, with many missiles positioned in underground facilities designed to withstand airstrikes, ready to strike US-linked positions worldwide.Trump's threat came after Iran rejected direct negotiations with the US but said it was open to indirect talks through intermediaries like Oman. The tensions between the US and Iran have escalated significantly since Trump withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, during his first term in office.If Trump's 'maximum pressure' approach against Iran continues, India's trade, ties, and strategic interests with Tehran could be affected.","IMEC aims to enhance economic integration between India, the Middle East, and Europe by bypassing traditional routes like the Suez Canal.

"Nearly 20 years after nuclear deal, DoE clears US firm to build & design reactors in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nearly-20-years-after-nuclear-deal-doe-clears-us-firm-to-build-design-reactors-in-india/articleshow/119826549.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough in the Indo-US nuclear deal that was signed nearly two decades ago, the US Department of Energy (DoE) has provided regulatory clearance to an American company to build and design nuclear reactors in India .On March 26, 2025, DoE granted Holtec International a critical regulatory approval, allowing the company to transfer small modular reactor (SMR) technology to India. Holtec specialises in the design and manufacture of parts for nuclear reactors and is the world leader in storage and transport casks used for spent nuclear fuel.The DoE approval to Holtec International has been given under conditions that it shares ‘unclassified small modular reactor (SMR) technology’ with three Indian firms: Holtec Asia (its regional subsidiary), Larsen &Toubro Ltd and Tata Consulting Engineers Ltd. The deal is under the restrictive regulation of the US, ‘10CFR810’, with the approval being valid for 10 years and will be re-evaluated every five years.But the US has set one condition — these jointly-designed and manufactured nuclear power plants “will not be re-transferred to any other entity or end user in India or to other countries except the US without the prior written consent of the Government of the United States”.Holtec had also sought approvals for two Indian govt-owned firms, Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), and also for Atomic Energy Review Board or AERB. However, the govt of India had not provided required clearances for these state-owned corporations since Holtec had not yet got DoE permission.The India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement, also known as the 123 Agreement, was signed in August 2007 by then PM Manmohan Singh and then US President George W Bush to enable full civil nuclear energy cooperation between the two nations. However, it took nearly 20 years for the deal to kick in due to multiple legal and regulatory challenges.Till now, under the civil nuclear deal, US firms could export nuclear reactors and equipment to India, but forbid them from any design work or manufacturing of nuclear equipment in the country.In mid-Feb, PM Narendra Modi met President Trump and agreed to a new initiative to drive “transformative change across key pillars of cooperation” between the two countries. The two leaders then announced plans to build US-designed nuclear reactors in India. During the talks, Modi and Trump had also committed to leaning into the 123 Agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation the nations signed in 2007.The two leaders then agreed that energy security was fundamental to economic growth, social well-being and technical innovation in both countries by ensuring energy affordability, reliability, and availability in stable energy markets. To help facilitate the joint work decided between Modi and Trump, the Indian govt is considering amendments to India’s Atomic Energy Act of 1962, which bars private investments in India's nuclear power plants.Currently, India has 22 operating reactors, with an installed capacity of 6780 MWe. Among these eighteen reactors are Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) and four are Light Water Reactors (LWRs). In Feb last year, Kakrapar Unit 4 became India’s newest nuclear power plant to become operational.","The India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement, also known as the 123 Agreement, was signed in August 2007 by then PM Manmohan Singh and then US President George W Bush.

States most affected

Rising temperatures and health risks

Electricity demand surge expected

NEW DELHI: India is set to experience an unusually hot summer from April to June, with heatwave days expected to double in several states, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned on Monday. Central and eastern India, along with the northwestern plains, are likely to see prolonged spells of extreme heat.IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra stated that most parts of the country will witness above-normal maximum temperatures, except for some regions in western and eastern India, where temperatures may remain near normal. Minimum temperatures, however, are predicted to be above average in most regions.""From April to June, north, east, and central India, as well as the plains of northwest India, are expected to see two to four additional heatwave days than usual,"" Mohapatra told PTI. Typically, India records four to seven heatwave days in this period.The states expected to witness more intense heatwaves include Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and the northern parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.Some states, such as eastern Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha, could see as many as 10 to 11 heatwave days, Mohapatra added.In April, maximum temperatures are forecasted to be higher than usual across most of India, while some extreme southern and northwestern regions may see near-normal temperatures. Minimum temperatures will remain elevated across most of the country, except for a few areas in the northwest and northeast.The central government has already urged states to ensure hospitals are equipped to handle heatstroke cases. Last year, India witnessed a record-breaking summer with 536 heatwave days—the highest in 14 years—leading to 41,789 suspected heatstroke cases and 143 confirmed deaths.However, experts warn that heat-related deaths could be underreported due to inadequate data collection.With rising temperatures, electricity demand is expected to grow by 9-10% this summer. Last year, peak electricity demand crossed 250 gigawatts on May 30, exceeding projections by 6.3%. The IMD cautioned that climate change-driven heat stress is a significant factor behind rising energy consumption.The IMD predicts normal rainfall in April, ranging between 88-112% of the long-term average of 39.2 mm. Some areas in northwest, northeast, west-central, and peninsular India could receive normal to above-normal rainfall. However, Mohapatra also warned of possible landslides in the Western Ghats region of Kerala and Karnataka, as well as potential flooding in northeastern states in April.As India gears up for a hotter-than-usual summer, authorities are urging preparedness to mitigate the effects of extreme heat on public health and infrastructure.","Central and eastern India, along with the northwestern plains, are likely to see prolonged spells of extreme heat.

"Land not available, Kashipur's historic horse market shuts down",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/land-not-available-kashipurs-historic-horse-market-shuts-down/articleshow/119825468.cms,"RUDRAPUR: The annual ' Nakhasa Bazaar ,' a 170-year-old tradition of the Chaiti fair in Udham Singh Nagar's Kashipur, which is held during the Navratras, has been cancelled this year due to unavailability of land. Known for rare horse breeds, the market once drew traders from across India. According to local lore, even bandits like Sultana Daku and Phoolan Devi ""blended into the crowd to buy horses"".The market's abrupt closure marks the end of an era, as per locals. The two-acre land that once hosted this bustling bazaar has been divided among the Panda family, custodians of the fair, who informed traders that it was no longer available for hosting the market.Believed to have been established by Hussain Baksh, a prominent horse trader from UP's Rampur in 1855, the Nakhasa market was once a thriving hub for traders from Afghanistan, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. In recent years, however, the number of participating regions dwindled, with traders primarily coming from Punjab, Gujarat, UP, and Haryana, selling horses in a price range of Rs 40,000 to Rs 40 lakh. Over 50 horses were sold every year.""Around 10 to 12 breeds of horses would arrive each year for sale,"" said local historian Rupesh Singh. Prized breeds like Marwari, Sindhi, Kathiawadi, Spiti and Manipuri, which are valued for their speed, were star attractions. ""The significance of the market went beyond commerce. This was a living relic of our past, where history and trade intertwined. It was a cultural institution that reflected the socio-economic dynamics of the region. Its closure is a loss not just for Kashipur but for the entire region,"" Singh said.In recent years, the dwindling number of buyers had cast a shadow over the market's existence. The news of the bazaar's closure came as a shock for many traders who had travelled long distances, expecting another successful season. On Sunday morning, around 100 horses arrived from cities across UP and Rajasthan, only to be turned away. ""We were ready to set up shop, but there was no space available,"" said a trader, his voice heavy with frustration.Chief priest of Ma Bal Sundari Devi temple, Krishna Gopal Agnihotri, told TOI: ""We had no choice but to ask the horse traders to return."" As traders packed up their horses and began the long journey home, the dust settled on an empty field that had once pulsed with life.","Nakhasa Bazaar is a 170-year-old tradition of the Chaiti fair in Udham Singh Nagar's Kashipur.

April-June likely to be hotter than usual across India: IMD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/april-june-likely-to-be-hotter-than-usual-across-india-imd/articleshow/119824913.cms,"NEW DELHI: The April-June summer season is likely to be hotter than normal over most parts of the country with both maximum (day) and minimum (night) temperatures, and number of heatwave days expected to be 'above-normal' during the three months, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday.During the period, the number of heatwave days is also expected to be higher than normal (2-4 additional heatwave days) over Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and northern parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.""Eastern region of India may experience up to 10-11 heatwave days during April-June,"" said IMD chief, M Mohapatra, while releasing temperature and rainfall outlook for the coming months.During heatwaves, elevated temperatures pose significant risks, especially for vulnerable populations like the elderly, children, and those with pre-existing health conditions, who are more susceptible to heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heatstroke.Additionally, prolonged periods of extreme heat can lead to dehydration and strain on infrastructure such as power grids and transportation systems, and therefore the IMD expects ""anticipatory actions"" by local authorities as per the existing guidelines and heat action plans.""During the 2025 hot weather season (April to June), above-normal maximum temperatures are most likely over most parts of the country, except some parts of west peninsular India and isolated regions of east-central and east India where normal maximum temperatures are most likely,"" said Mohapatra.Even in April, above-normal maximum temperatures are likely over most parts of the country except some parts of extreme south peninsular India and northwest India, where normal maximum temperatures are most likely.As far as rainfall is concerned, the Met department will come out with its first stage long-term forecast for the upcoming monsoon season (June-Sept) in mid-April when it will predict extent of quantitative rainfall for the period factoring in various climatic phenomena including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).Mohapatra said though the latest Monsoon Mission Climate Forecast System (MMCFS) model indicates that the neutral ENSO conditions are likely to continue in the upcoming season, it would be premature to say anything about the monsoon season at this juncture as there are other factors that guide the sea sonal rainfall. Normally, EL Nino adversely impacts monsoon rainfall whereas La Nina triggers good seasonal rainfall. So, neutral conditions mean no possibility of ENSO’s impact on rainfall during the monsoon season.",The April-June summer season is likely to be hotter than normal over most parts of the country. Both maximum (day) and minimum (night) temperatures are expected to be 'above-normal' during the three months. Eastern region of India may experience up to 10-11 heatwave days.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119824977,imgsize-1064932,width-400,resizemode-4/119824977.jpg"

Attached in 1994, the properties are with the court receiver, Bombay HC.""The court receiver, HC, Bombay, is hereby discharged in respect of... 14 immovable properties... and subject to the payment of costs, charges, and expenses to be paid by the competent authority upon disposal of the properties through sale proceeds or by any other legal mode deemed fit and proper by it,"" special judge VD Kedar said on March 26.While the alleged mastermind of the blasts, Tiger Memon, is absconding, his brother Yakub, who stood trial and was convicted, was hanged in 2015. Among the properties are Yakub's flat at Almeida Park, Bandra (West), a vacant plot and flat at Santacruz, two flats at Kurla, an office on Mohamed Ali Road, a shop, flat, and land at Dongri, an open plot at Mahim, three shops at Manish Market, a building and plot at Zaveri Bazaar, and a garage at Mahim. Property owners include Abdul Razak Memon, Essa Memon, Yakub Memon, and Rubina Memon.Notices for the release of the properties were sent to 13 members of the Memon family, including Tiger Memon, but they did not respond to the plea. The plea was moved by the central govt through the competent authority under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act (SAFEMA) on Jan 7, 2025. It was submitted that the function of the authority is to trace the illegally acquired properties of smugglers and drug traffickers and order their forfeiture to the central govt.It was further submitted that the forfeiture proceedings were initiated against Ibrahim Abdul Razak Memon, aka Tiger Memon, on the basis of a 1992 detention order by the Govt of Maharashtra, home department, under the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Act (COFEPSA). Thereafter, in 1993, under SAFEMA, the authorities ordered the forfeiture of various properties. However, the properties were attached by the Tada court in 1994, and a court receiver was appointed to take custody of them. Over the years, those affected by the forfeiture moved several courts seeking the properties' release. However, the pleas were denied.In Aug 2024, the court ordered the transfer of three flats in Mahim's Al Hussain building, once owned by the Memon family, to the central government. The flats were linked to Tiger, Yakub, and their relatives, including their mother Hanifa (acquitted), sister-in-law Rubina (serving life sentence), and wife Shabana (absconding). The housing society's plea for maintenance arrears and redevelopment was rejected, with the court directing them to approach the competent authority.","A special Tada court has directed that 14 immovable properties, including several flats, vacant plots, office premises, and shops belonging to Tiger Memon, Yakub Memon and his family be handed over to the central govt.

Rift or rumour?



NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has praised the BJP-led central government for its ""vaccine diplomacy"" during the Covid pandemic years calling it a ""powerful example of international leadership"".In a column titled ""Covid’s silver lining for India"" written for the English magazine The Week, Tharoor said, ""India’s vaccine diplomacy during the Covid pandemic stands out from amid the horrors of that time as a powerful example of international leadership rooted in responsibility and solidarity. By delivering made-in-India vaccines to over 100 nations, India demonstrated its capacity to extend a helping hand when it mattered most.""This has added another positive remark to the list of praises by the veteran Congress leader for the central government. He had recently appreciated PM Modi's anti-war stance on Russia-Ukraine conflict who had said that ""peace cannot be found on the battlefield.""The article comes amid reports of rift between the Congress and the veteran leader over Kerala leadership.Tharoor's article was centered around India's strength as a soft power during those years rooted in the field of technology and training.""Our efforts were not limited merely to the provision of vaccines but extended to the sending of Indian military doctors to Nepal, the Maldives, and Kuwait, and to organising online training for health care workers across South Asian nations. Additionally, through its engagement with global platforms like GAVI, the Quad, and the Pan Africa E-Network, India addressed immediate health concerns while laying the groundwork for long-term international cooperation,"" he wrote.""India’s vaccine diplomacy served as a counterbalance to China’s influence in South Asia and Africa, where both nations were vying for goodwill through vaccine supplies,"" he added.Tharoor lauded the Vaccine Maitri initiative launched by the central government in 2021 which exported vaccines to over 100 countries including nations across West Asia, Africa, Latin America, and our immediate neighbourhood.""Leveraging its position as the world’s vaccine manufacturing hub, India launched the Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship) initiative in January 2021. This programme aimed to supply Covid-19 vaccines to countries in need, particularly to developing nations. India’s exports of vaccines—both as aid and commercial shipments—reached nations across West Asia, Africa, Latin America, and our immediate neighbourhood,"" he wrote.He, however, did not shy away from calling the lockdown ""stringent"".""No one in India is commemorating the fifth anniversary of the stringent lockdown prompted by Covid-19, which the government imposed on March 24, 2020. We, the survivors, all think of Covid as a bad dream, one marked by suffering, tragedy and loss,"" he said.Tharoor recently made headlines after there were a series of events -- a podcast, selfie, and a cryptic post -- pointing towards his rift with Congress.Last month, in a Malayalam podcast interview, Tharoor had warned that Congress risked staying in opposition in Kerala for a third term if it failed to expand its appeal. He pointed to a leadership vacuum within the state party and suggested he had ""other options"" if Congress no longer needed his services.In an unrelated event, he had posted on X a quote by Thomas Gray-- ""Where ignorance is bliss, tis folly to be wise"" -- as the thought of the day.Adding to the buzz, he had shared a selfie with Union minister Piyush Goyal, praising the revival of India-UK FTA negotiations, further intensifying speculation about his political future.However, he later played down the reports of rift saying, ""You all heard the podcast, what was the controversy about?...I still haven't understood the controversy...now that you have heard the whole podcast, can you tell me what your question is, I am happy to respond...it is a podcast, a 45-minute conversation about life and pursuits of Happiness, nothing there much about any political controversy""","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has praised the BJP-led central government for its ""vaccine diplomacy"" during the Covid pandemic years.

'Three Cs haunt Indian education': Sonia Gandhi slams Centre over NEP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-cs-haunt-indian-education-sonia-gandhi-slams-centre-over-nep/articleshow/119787104.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress leader Sonia Gandhi On Monday strongly criticised the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, accusing the Union BJP government of using it as a tool for "" centralisation of power , commercialisation, and communalisation"" in the education sector.The former congress president said, ""The Union Government’s track record over the last decade has convincingly demonstrated that in education, it is concerned only with the successful implementation of three core agenda items — the centralisation of power with the Union Government; the commercialisation and outsourcing of investments in education to the private sector, and the communalisation of textbooks, curriculum, and institutions.""In an opinion piece published in The Hindu news paper, she claimed that the policy hides the government's ""profound indifference"" to the education of India's youth and children.""Unchecked centralisation has been the hallmark of this Government’s functioning over the last 11 years, but its most damaging consequences have been in the domain of education,"" she wrote, alleging that the government has sidelined state governments in key decision-making processes. She pointed out that the Central Advisory Board of Education, which includes ministers from both the Centre and states, has not been convened since September 2019.Sonia Gandhi also alleged that the government has ""coerced"" state governments into implementing the PM-SHRI scheme by withholding grants meant for the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA). ""These funds have been due to States for years as part of the financial support required to implement the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act,"" she wrote, adding that even the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education had called for the unconditional release of SSA funds.Criticising the NEP's impact on higher education, she pointed to the new draft guidelines for the University Grants Commission (UGC) in 2025, which she claimed aim to diminish the role of state governments in appointing vice-chancellors. ""The Union Government has given itself — through the Governors who are typically designated as the Chancellor of the University — near-monopoly power in the selection of the Vice-Chancellors in State universities,"" she stated, calling it a ""grave threat to federalism.""Gandhi further accused the government of pushing for ""unchecked privatisation"" of school education. She argued that the NEP undermines the concept of neighbourhood schools guaranteed under the RTE Act by promoting the idea of ""school complexes,"" which she said has led to the closure of nearly 90,000 public schools since 2014 while increasing the number of private schools.She also criticised the shift from block grants to the Higher Education Financing Agency (HEFA) for funding universities, arguing that it forces institutions to take loans that ultimately result in higher student fees. ""Between 78% to 100% of these loans are being repaid by universities through student fees. In other words, the price of the Government’s retreat from financing public education has been borne by students facing fee hikes,"" she wrote.On the issue of communalisation, she accused the government of ""indoctrinating and cultivating hatred through the education system."" She cited revisions in NCERT textbooks that removed references to Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination and Mughal history and criticised the hiring of faculty members based on ideological considerations rather than academic merit. ""Leadership positions in key institutions... have been reserved for pliant ideologues,"" she wrote, warning that the dilution of qualifications for professors and vice-chancellors is part of this agenda.Calling for an end to what she termed the ""carnage"" of India’s public education system, Gandhi wrote, ""Over the last decade, our education systems have been systematically cleansed of the spirit of public service, and education policy has been sanitised of any concerns about access to and the quality of education.""","Congress leader Sonia Gandhi strongly criticised the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.

Gabrielle Union Breaks Silence on Dwyane Wade’s Cancer Fight

Rocket Companies to acquire Mr Cooper in $9.4 billion all-stock deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rocket-companies-to-acquire-mr-cooper-in-9-4-billion-all-stock-deal/articleshow/119811298.cms,"Rocket companies (Photo-AP)

Rocket Mortgage is acquiring competitor Mr. Cooper in an all-stock deal valued at $9.4 billion, shortly after its acquisition of real estate listing company Redfin.The merger will create a combined entity handling one in every six mortgages in the US, adding nearly 7 million new clients to Rocket’s portfolio. This strategic move is expected to increase loan volumes and lower customer acquisition costs, news agency AP reported.Jay Bray, Chairman and CEO of Mr. Cooper, who will become President and CEO of Rocket Mortgage, stated, “By combining Mr. Cooper and Rocket, we will form the strongest mortgage company in the industry, offering an end-to-end homeownership experience backed by leading technology and grounded in customer care.”The US housing market has been in a slump, with soaring mortgage rates and high prices putting homeownership out of reach for many. Companies like Rocket are responding by building a more comprehensive, one-stop experience for potential homebuyers.Under the terms of the deal, Mr. Cooper shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 11 Rocket shares for each share of Mr. Cooper common stock. Upon completion, Rocket shareholders will own approximately 75% of the combined company, while Mr. Cooper stockholders will own 25%. The combined company’s board will consist of 11 members, with nine from Rocket and two from Mr. Cooper.Earlier this month, Rocket also announced its acquisition of Redfin in an all-stock deal valued at $1.75 billion. Redfin, founded in 2004, offers over 1 million for-sale and rental listings on its platform.The National Association of Realtors reported a 4.2% increase in existing home sales in February, partly driven by easing mortgage rates and more properties available on the market. However, home sales began to decline in 2022 when mortgage rates started rising from pandemic-era lows, and last year, sales of previously owned US homes fell to their lowest level in nearly 30 years",Rocket Mortgage is acquiring competitor Mr. Cooper in an all-stock deal valued at $9.4 billion.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
