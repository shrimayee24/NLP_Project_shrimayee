What is S-400 Sudarshan Chakra?

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army on Friday said that Pakistan’s armed forces launched multiple attacks using drones and other munitions along the entire western border on the intervening night of May 8-9.These attacks were ""effectively repulsed,"" the Army said.Pakistani troops also engaged in “numerous ceasefire violations” along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, the Army said in an early morning post on X.The post included a short video clip and reaffirming India's intent to respond firmly to any hostile actions.""OPERATION SINDOOR - Pakistan Armed Forces launched multiple attacks using drones and other munitions along entire Western Border on the intervening night of 08 and 09 May 2025. Pak troops also resorted to numerous ceasefire violations along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir,"" the post said.The Indian Army stated that the drone attacks were ""effectively repulsed"" and that a ""befitting reply"" was given in response to the ceasefire violations.""#IndianArmy remains committed to safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Nation. All nefarious designs will be responded with force,"" it added.In a large-scale counter-drone operation, Army's Air Defence units deployed a range of advanced weaponry including L-70 guns, Zu-23mm systems, Schilka systems, and specialised counter-unmanned aerial systems (UAS) equipment and S-400 ""Sudarshan Chakra"" .India’s counter-drone and air defence capabilities are supported by a combination of legacy and modern weapon systems designed to neutralise aerial threats, including drones, missiles, and low-flying aircraft. Among these, the L-70 guns are 40mm anti-aircraft artillery pieces originally developed by Bofors. They are known for their high rate of fire and are capable of engaging fast-moving aerial targets at low altitudes. India has upgraded these guns with modern electro-optical fire control systems to enhance accuracy and automation.The Zu-23mm systems are twin-barrel, Soviet-era anti-aircraft guns that remain in service due to their simplicity and effectiveness. Mounted on a towed platform, the Zu-23 is capable of delivering a high volume of fire and is often used to defend static installations against low-flying threats. These guns can also be paired with radar and optical targeting systems for improved response.The Schilka system, officially known as ZSU-23-4, is a self-propelled, radar-guided anti-aircraft weapon system mounted on a tracked chassis. It is equipped with four 23mm autocannons and an integrated radar system, giving it the capability to track and destroy multiple aerial targets in real-time. Despite its age, the Indian Army has modernised the Schilka with advanced fire control systems and thermal imaging sights.To address the evolving threat from drones and unmanned systems, India also deployed specialised counter-unmanned aerial systems (UAS) equipment. These systems include radar and electro-optical sensors for drone detection, as well as jammers and directed-energy weapons for neutralisation. The integration of kinetic systems like guns and non-kinetic tools such as jammers provides a layered defence mechanism, essential for protecting sensitive military and civilian infrastructure from modern aerial threats.On the intervening night of May 7 and 8, India used the S-400 Sudarshan Chakra defence missile systems to take down Pakistani drones and missiles fired towards 15 Indian cities, thwarting Islamabad's attempt to damage military installations. Indian Air Force S-400 Sudarshan Chakra air defence missile systems were fired last night against targets moving towards India.The targets were successfully neutralised in the operation.The S-400 ""Sudarshan Chakra"" is an Indian name given to the S-400 Triumf air defence missile system acquired from Russia. The term ""Sudarshan Chakra"" draws from the Epic Mahabharata, symbolising precision, speed, and lethal capability, qualities that closely reflect the S-400's operational strengths.Developed by Russia's Almaz-Antey, the S-400 is among the most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile systems in the world. India signed a $5.43 billion deal with Russia in 2018 to procure five S-400 units, with the first system deployed in Punjab in 2021 to bolster defences against threats from Pakistan and China.The S-400 can engage aerial targets at ranges of up to 400 km and detect threats as far as 600 km away. It supports four different types of missiles, enabling it to target everything from aircraft and drones to cruise and ballistic missiles.","Pakistani troops also engaged in “numerous ceasefire violations” along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir.

"India logged 19.7L excess deaths in 2021, 6x official Covid toll: Government data",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-logged-19-7l-excess-deaths-in-2021-6x-official-covid-toll-government-data/articleshow/121013243.cms,"India registered around 25.8 lakh more deaths in Covid year 2021 compared to 2019, the last pre-Covid year, as per official data based on the civil registration system (CRS) that was released on Wednesday. After accounting for a natural increase in population over the two-year period, the spike in deaths in 2021 is about 20 lakh, nearly six times the official Covid death tally of 3.3 lakh in that year.The highest undercounting of deaths was in Gujarat, which saw nearly 2 lakh excess fatalities, more than 33 times the state's official count of just over 5,800 Covid deaths in 2021, the data revealed.Excess deaths were 18 times higher than the official Covid toll in Madhya Pradesh and 15 times higher in West Bengal. In Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh too, excess deaths were more than 10 times higher than the official Covid toll.The lowest discrepancy between official Covid tolls and the calculated excess deaths for that year were in Kerala, Uttarakhand, Assam, Maharashtra and Delhi, the data reveals. The report on vital statistics of India based on the civil registration system (CRS) released on Wednesday shows that India registered around 25.8 lakh more deaths in the Covid year of 2021 compared to 2019, the last pre-Covid year. Not all of the excess deaths are attributable to Covid, but even accounting for a natural increase in population over the two-year period, the spike is about 20 lakh, nearly six times the official Covid death tally of 3.3 lakh in that year.Gujarat saw the highest undercounting of deaths with nearly 2 lakh excess deaths, more than 33 times the official count of just over 5,800 Covid deaths in 2021. Other states where the excess deaths were several times the official Covid toll were Madhya Pradesh (18x) and West Bengal (15x). In Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh too, the excess deaths were over ten times the official Covid toll.How do we get to these numbers? Even with the death rate remaining unchanged, the number of deaths would increase as the population does. Hence, we applied the 2019 death rates, as revealed in the sample registration system (SRS), to the 2021 population projected by the Census office to arrive at what the number of deaths should have been in 2021 in the normal course. In fact, death rates had been falling steadily till 2019, so these estimates actually somewhat overestimate what the numbers would have been. We then compared this estimate to the actual number for 2021 reported by the CRS. The difference is 'excess deaths'.In Madya Pradesh, the government's Covid death tally for 2021 was about 6,900 deaths. However, total deaths registered in 2021 exceeded the number projected using 2019 death rates by about 1.3 lakh. West Bengal reported a little over 10,000 Covid deaths in 2021, while excess deaths were over 1.5 lakh.Among larger states, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Assam, Maharashtra and Delhi showed the least discrepancy between the Covid death tally given by the respective governments for 2021 and the calculated excess deaths for that year. In these, excess deaths varied from 1.5 to 3.1 times the official Covid toll.Another report, on medical certification of cause of deaths in 2021, also released on Wednesday, shows that Covid was the second leading cause of death that year accounting for 17.3% of deaths, behind diseases of the circulatory system, which accounted for 29.8% of total medically certified deaths. This meant that despite medically certified deaths accounting for less than a quarter (23.4%) of total registered deaths, the number of certified Covid deaths in the report was 4.1 lakh, higher than India's official tally of 3.3 lakh Covid deaths.","India registered around 25.8 lakh more deaths in Covid year 2021 compared to 2019, the last pre-Covid year.

Modi’s message to govt depts: Keep eye on prices, fake news

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday directed 20-odd secretaries dealing with critical sectors to remain alert, “fool-proof functioning of essential systems , with special focus on readiness, emergency response, and internal communication protocol”.He also instructed the top officers to ensure any supply, particularly of essential items and to take proactive action rather than waiting for orders, and to ensure the security of critical infrastructure.“PM Modi stressed the need for seamless coordination among ministries and agencies to uphold operational continuity and institutional resilience,” said an official release from PMO. Secretaries have been directed to undertake a comprehensive review of their respective ministry and department’s operations to see that there is no glitch in functioning of essential systems and are shielded from any cyber attack.The secretaries were from atomic energy, space, electronics & IT, consumer affairs, infrastructure sectors such as road, rail, shipping, power and border management who attended the review meeting on national preparedness and inter-ministerial coordination a day after India successfully carried out air-strikes on terror base in Pakistan under Operation Sindoor , indicating the preparation for any escalation.TOI has learnt that departments concerned have been directed to keep a close eye on prices of essential commodities and panic buying and to negate any “fake news”.Sources said each secretary was given a couple of minutes to speak about the systems in place to deal with any crisis and the steps that can be taken in case of emergencies. The top officials detailed their planning with a “Whole of govt” approach in the current situation. “All ministries have identified their actionables in relation to the conflict and are strengthening processes. Ministries are ready to deal with all kinds of emerging situations,” the govt said.For example, infrastructure ministries and departments are focussing on safety of bridges and the overhead electrical system for uninterrupted movement of people and goods. Major ports, particularly on the western coast, have stepped up their security and they have a complete access-controlled system. With prices of pulses, cereals and edible oil are well under control, the govt is confident of dealing with the emerging situation.Sources said that soon after the PM’s interaction top officials had marathon meetings on preparing their plans. the Government of India to review national preparedness and inter-ministerial coordination in light of recent developments concerning national security.","PM Narendra Modi asks top officers to ensure ""fool-proof"" functioning of essential system.

In an interview with Fox News, Vance said, ""That's fundamentally none of our business.""When asked about the rising conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations, he said, ""We're concerned about any time nuclear powers collide and have a major conflict what we've said.""He continued, ""What Secretary Rubio said and certainly the President has said is we want this thing to de-escalate as quickly as possible.We can't control these countries though. Fundamentally India has its gripes with Pakistan.""Vance further added, ""What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit. But we're not going to get involved in the middle of war. That's fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America's ability to control it.""Currently, India continues its fight against Pakistan-backed terrorism , under 'Operation Sindoor'. On Thursday, India responded strongly to Pakistan's drone attack across Jammu and Kashmir.Vance recently visited India in April, marking his first trip to the country. He was accompanied by his family, including his Indian-origin wife, Usha Vance.

"Led by S-400, Indian air defence far better than Pak's",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/led-by-s-400-indian-air-defence-far-better-than-paks/articleshow/121011802.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's multi-layered air defence system, with a mix of Russian and Israeli surface-to-air missile systems and the indigenous Akash, is considered much better than Pakistan, which largely relies on Chinese systems.India's air defence weapons range from the formidable Russian-origin S-400 'Triumf' surface-to-air missile system, which can detect and destroy hostile strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, missiles and drones at a range of 380km, to the shoulder-fired Igla-S missiles that have an interception range of 6km.Chinese-supplied HQ-9 air defence missile batteries and radars, which have a range of 120km in the base variant that extends to 300km in the latest one, in turn, are the mainstay of Pakistan. It also has the French-origin Spada anti-aircraft system with a 20-25km range for defence of airbases and other important facilities, among other systems.""The S-400, which has four kinds of missiles to intercept targets at ranges of 120, 200, 250 and 380km, by far outclasses the HQ-9. It is crucial to our air defence coverage and is fully plugged into IAF's integrated air command and control system (IACCS),"" an officer said.Under the $5.4 billion(Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in 2018, IAF has deployed the first three S-400 squadrons in north-west and east India to cater to both China and Pakistan.The S-400 radars - the primary acquisition one has a 600km range - can track hundreds of targets simultaneously. Delivery of the remaining two S-400 squadrons, however, has been hugely delayed to 2026-27 due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.The fully-automated IACCS network , which combines a wide array of sensors and weapons, is now progressively also integrating military radars with civilian ones. ""With the new Akashteer system, data from IAF and Army radars are fused to provide a unified, real-time air picture, which is available to all IAF and Army air defence centres,"" another officer said.India is also developing its own long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system under the ambitious Project Kusha . With an interception range of around 350km, this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29,as reported by TOI earlier.Army, Navy and Air Force have all inducted the potent Barak-8 medium range surface-to-air missile (MR-SAM) systems, with an over 70km range, jointly developed with Israel. Army and IAF have also inducted in large numbers the indigenous Akash air defence missile systems, with an interception range of 25km, which is now also being exported to other countries.Armed forces also have a variety of shorter range air defence weapons. They include the older Russian Igla-1M (5km), OSA-AK-M (10km) and Pechora missiles and upgraded L-70 anti-aircraft guns (3.5km). The newer ones are Israeli low-level Spyder quick-reaction anti-aircraft missiles (15km range) and Russian man-portable Igla-S (6km) systems. DRDO is also testing the indigenous very short-range air defence system (VSHORADS) missiles, which have a range of up to 6km.","India's air defence weapons range from the formidable Russian-origin S-400 'Triumf' surface-to-air missile system to the shoulder-fired Igla-S missiles.

Rajkot was among the diversion/alternate airports for single aisle aircraft taking the longer route to and from the west after the closure of Pakistan airspace on April 24.""Now the diversion airports are more distant, like Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Goa.So, in case of diversion, aircraft will have to fly for a longer distance both while headed there and then when resuming their journey to north India,"" said a senior pilot.Airports that have been closed - till Saturday morning as of now - are Srinagar, Jammu, Leh, Chandigarh, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Patiala, Bhatinda, Halwara, Pathankot, Bhuntar, Shimla, Gaggal, Dharamsala, Kishangarh, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Mundra, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Porbandar, Kandla, Keshod, Bhuj, Gwalior and Hindon.With almost all airlines, and not just Indian, now bypassing Pakistan airspace, air traffic between the east and west has shifted to the Mumbai side, leading to congestion. ""Whenever Pakistan escalates the conflict, aircraft will get little farther away routes (from Pakistan airspace) in the Indian airspace. This will lead to slightly longer routes. But the big difference will be when an en route flight diverts to now further away airports in India,"" said a pilot.Meanwhile, Indian carriers have pulled out their aircraft from the 27 closed airports. ""The aircraft were flown out as ferry flights (without passengers). Crew stationed there has also been brought to Delhi or other places by trains. As of now, given the way Pakistan is brazenly acting, we don't know when normalcy will return and these airports will open. So, we couldn't have had our crew stuck there,"" said a senior official of an airline.

NEW DELHI: The central government on Thursday opened two gates at the Baglihar Hydroelectric Power Project in Ramban and three gates at the Salal Dam in Reasi.This reportedly aimed at managing rising water levels triggered by heavy rainfall in the region and also to manage dam pressure.The development comes just days after the Chenab's water levels had dropped sharply, following the government's decision to restrict the river’s flow, an unprecedented action that led to stretches of the riverbed becoming walkable for the first time in recent memory in some downstream areas.The regulation of the Chenab’s flow is being widely viewed as a strategic signal of India’s ability to control water releases, especially in the context of mounting tensions with Pakistan.The decision to restrict the river’s flow followed the Centre’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, announced in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians, including several tourists.Under the IWT, India is obligated to notify Pakistan before making any significant interventions in the flow of western rivers like the Chenab.However, with the treaty now suspended, India has acted unilaterally to manage the river's waters, both in terms of withholding and releasing them as per domestic needs.",Central government opens two gates at the Baglihar Hydroelectric Power Project in Ramban.

However, when the charade was found out, Pakistan 'arrested' Mir and put him in prison.Mir's case has come handy as India reminded the world of Pakistan's duplicity, with foreign secretary Vikram Misri bringing him up twice since launch of Operation Sindoor.Misri said, ""Pakistan has been known to wilfully mislead the world and international forums such as FATF. In the Sajid Mir case, this terrorist was declared dead, and then, in response to international pressure, brought back to life, found alive and arrested."" According to sources, acceptance of Mir's existence by Pakistan was a desperate attempt to get off the 'grey list' of FATF.When pressure mounted on Pakistan with the search for perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks , Islamabad denied Mir's existence declared him dead in 2021. Mir was, on paper, lodged in the central jail in Lahore after being 'sentenced' for eight years by a Pakistan 'anti-terrorism court' on charges of terror financing . He was detained in April 2022 in a hush-hush affair while the jail term was awarded in June, just before a FATF meeting.Mir has a $5 million bounty announced by FBI, which has described him as someone who once wore a beard and hair down to his shoulders. He, according to the US agency, altered his appearance through plastic surgery.The US has held Mir responsible for directing preparations and reconnaissance and being one of the Pakistan-based controllers during the 26/11 attacks . In addition, Mir conspired to commit a terrorist attack against a newspaper and its employees in Denmark between 2008 and 2009.Mir, who would now be in his early 50s, was LeT's foreign recruiter and the main handler for Pakistani-American terrorist David Coleman Headley . A US justice department document mentioned how the 26/11 attackers were in real-time telephonic contact with Mir and his associates during the attacks. On Mir's advice, Headley changed his name of 'Dawood Gilani' to 'David Coleman Headley' in order to facilitate his activities on behalf of the LeT by enabling him to present himself in India as an American who was neither Muslim nor Pakistani.",Sajid Mir had been loaned to LeT - a common practice used by the ISI to groom young jihadis.

NEW DELHI: Banking on the forecast of a good monsoon rainfall in most parts of the country this year, govt on Thursday set a target of record foodgrain output of 354 million tonne (MT) for the 2025-26 crop year (July-June), which is nearly 4% higher than the target of 2024-25 and over 6.5% more than the actual production of 2023-24.The foodgrains basket comprises of paddy, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses.The target, set after taking inputs from all states, was discussed during a national conference on Kharif campaign where policy makers and farm scientists brainstormed over preparedness and availability of adequate inputs (quality seeds, fertilisers, etc.) ahead of the sowing season.IMD had last month predicted 'above normal' rainfall for most parts of the country, including the 'monsoon core zone', where farmers depend on seasonal rainfall. Good monsoon rains (June-Sept) invariably help farmers in having bumper output.Addressing the conference, agriculture minister Shivraj Chouhan announced a pan-India 15-day campaign (May 29-June 12) to create awareness among 1-1.5 crore farmers, across 700 districts, about climate-resilient seed varieties, availability of fertilisers, monsoon forecast and benefits of govt programmes.""Farm scientists and officials will be among farmers during the campaign.

NEW DELHI: Observing the increasing prevalence of live-in relationships in recent years, Supreme Court has stated that if two able-minded adults reside together as live-in partners for more than a couple of years, a presumption would arise that they voluntarily chose that kind of relationship, fully aware of its consequences. Therefore, allegation that such a relationship was entered into based on a promise of marriage may be deemed unworthy of acceptance.While quashing criminal proceedings against a man who was accused of rape charges by his live-in partner, a bench of Justices Sanjay Karol and Manoj Misra said physical relationship continued for over two years without a complaint in between and a presumption would arise of there being a valid consent for initiating and maintaining the physical relationship.""A decade or two earlier, live-in relationships might not have been common. But now more and more women are financially independent and have the capacity to take conscious decision of charting their life on their own terms. This financial freedom, inter alia, has led to proliferation of such live-in relationships. Therefore, when a matter of this nature comes to a court, it must not adopt a pedantic approach rather the court may, based on the length of such relationship and conduct of the parties, presume implied consent of the parties to be in such a relationship regardless of their desire or a wish to convert it into a marital bond,"" the court said.In a similar verdict, SC in March had held a woman who was in a live-in relationship for a long period may not be able to accuse her live-in partner of compelling her to get into physical relation on the false promise of marriage in order to face rape charges as it could not be be said with certainty that physical relationship was purely because of the promise.The court had said in such cases even if it was assumed that a false promise of marriage was made to complainant initially by accused, the fact that relationship continued for such a long period would render the plea of the complainant, that her consent for all these years was under misconception of the fact that the accused would marry her, implausible.",Supreme Court quashes criminal proceedings against a man who was accused of rape by his live-in partner.

Fed holds rates, warns of uncertainty





President Donald Trump has said that he will reveal details of a major new trade deal at a press conference scheduled for 10.00am tomorrow (local time) in the Oval Office. In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the agreement as involving representatives of a “big, and highly respected, country,” and called it “the first of many. ”""Big News Conference tomorrow morning at 10:00 A.M., The Oval Office, concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY,"" Trump said in his post.The timing of the announcement also coincides with the start of US-China talks in Switzerland, the first formal dialogue since the trade war escalated. Yet Trump remains adamant that the US is not seeking talks from a position of weakness. “They said we initiated [the talks]? I think they ought to go back and study their files,” he said in response to Chinese claims.While Trump has not yet disclosed the name of the country involved, the announcement comes amid renewed tensions over trade, particularly with China. “We were losing a trillion dollars a year, now we’re not losing anything,” he said earlier this week, ruling out any reduction in tariffs for now.Uncertainty remains over how any new trade deal might be structured. Trump has suggested that his administration has been approached by nearly all major trading partners with potential agreements, but he insists any final deal must serve American interests first. “We could sign 25 deals tomorrow if we wanted,” he said, adding that tariffs remain a tool he’s willing to keep using to leverage better terms.The US Federal Reserve has held interest rates steady, keeping its benchmark rate between 4.25% and 4.50%, amid rising concerns over inflation and employment pressures. The pause, announced Wednesday, comes as the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs continues to unfold. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited “a great deal of uncertainty” around the administration’s trade policies, which have led to volatility in financial markets and warnings from analysts of higher inflation and unemployment.Trump’s tariffs, including steep levies on Chinese goods and 10% duties on imports from other nations, have shaken investor confidence and raised concerns over future economic growth. While hard data shows the economy has remained resilient, softer indicators point to declining consumer confidence and expectations of rising inflation.The Fed faces a delicate balancing act as it monitors these developments. Despite public criticism from Trump urging rate cuts, Powell insisted the Fed remains focused solely on economic data. Analysts now expect any rate cuts to be delayed, with some predicting the first adjustment in September.Adding to the economic uncertainty is Trump's proposal for 100% tariffs on foreign films. While unlikely to materialise, the idea underscores wider industry turmoil. Hollywood, long anchored in Los Angeles, is losing ground to international production hubs offering generous tax incentives. With filming in LA at historic lows, California officials are pushing to expand state tax credits to keep production local, though competition from abroad continues to grow.","Trump to announce details of major new trade deal tomorrow morning.

Following the Kansas City Chiefs ’ Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in February and the conclusion of Taylor’s monumental “The Eras Tour,” the couple took a step back from the spotlight to relax and reconnect in private.As Swift renovates her Rhode Island mansion into a potential family home, Kelce is back to training for what could be his final NFL season while also upgrading his lifestyle to match their evolving relationship.Taylor Swift is already focused on her next musical chapter, with a new album in development and plans reportedly underway for a 2026 tour, according to sources. Meanwhile, she’s also making moves in real estate, listing her former Cape Cod mansion owned briefly between 2012 and 2013 for sale.The most notable step is Taylor Swift’s decision to renovate her $17.75 million mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. This historic 12,000-square-foot estate, perched on a scenic coastal cliff, is undergoing a $1.7 million transformation to become a primary residence. The upgrades include expanding the bedroom suite and lounge by 400 square feet, redesigning the kitchen, and adding a new bedroom.The living room is also being remodeled, and the front portico will be reconstructed. Permits were quietly filed in late 2024, with construction expected to finish by the end of 2025. Sources suggest Taylor Swift envisions this property as a future family retreat with Kelce.Now, as the off-season winds down, Travis Kelce is back at the Chiefs’ training facility, gearing up for what many believe could be his final NFL season. With a decorated career behind him, this upcoming chapter is set to be both meaningful and emotional.Alongside his return to football, Travis Kelce is also continuing his popular podcast, New Heights, which he co-hosts with his older brother and former Philadelphia Eagle, Jason Kelce. The podcast has become a fan favorite, offering a candid and often humorous glimpse into their lives both on and off the field.Parallel to Taylor Swift’s efforts, Travis Kelce is also making big changes to accommodate their shared future. In response to safety concerns following a high-profile burglary at his Kansas City mansion where over $100,000 in valuables were stolen Kelce has significantly enhanced the security of his home. He installed a $40,000 alarm system, multiple CCTV cameras, motion detectors, and floodlights.Additionally, Travis Kelce built a fortified safe room and an underground man cave. Two guard dogs, costing $9,000, and 24/7 private security at $6,000 per month have also been added. These improvements are largely aimed at ensuring Taylor Swift feels safe during visits, especially given the intense public and media attention surrounding their relationship.Beyond these two main properties, Taylor Swift is reportedly eyeing new real estate in Nashville and Kansas City. Nashville, her long-time base, offers proximity to family and friends, while Kansas City would place her closer to Kelce during the NFL season. Sources indicate that the couple may even be considering purchasing a home together in Kansas City, a move that strongly suggests they are planning for a more settled, domestic life.Also Read: “External forces trying to unbalance them”: Living Nostradamus claims cosmic fate ties Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, warns of looming challenges ahead All these developments point to a serious turn in their relationship. With Swift reworking her iconic mansion for shared living and Travis Kelce upgrading security to protect their privacy, the two appear deeply invested in aligning their lives. These property moves go beyond luxury they’re deliberate steps toward building a stable future together.","Taylor Swift is renovating her $17.75 million mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island.

Apple plans to add AI Search in Safari browser; Senior VP Eddy Cue points to 3 Google rivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-plans-to-add-ai-search-in-safari-browser-senior-vp-eddy-cue-points-to-3-google-rivals/articleshow/120993178.cms,"Apple in discussions with OpenAI, Perplexity and others

Apple is planning to add AI-powered search options in the Safari browser . According to a Bloomberg report, Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue said during his testimony with the US Justice Department that the company is “actively looking at” reshaping Safari. During the testimony, he revealed that searches on Safari dipped for the first time last month.“That has never happened in 22 years,” he said, adding this is due to people using AI. Cue said he believes that AI tools like OpenAI , Perplexity AI and Anthropic’s Claude AI, will eventually replace search engines like Google Chrome, further adding that Apple will bring these options to Safari in the future.“We will add them to the list — they probably won’t be the default,” he said.Currently, Google is the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser for which the company pays around $20 billion a year to keep. Analysts estimate this accounts for about 36% of the search advertising revenue Google earns through Safari.Cue said that Apple is in discussions with AI search providers like OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic to add their AI tools as an option to Safari.“Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices,” he said. “I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.”Apple currently integrates OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its Siri digital assistant and plans to add Google’s AI tool Gemini later this year. Cue said the company also considered other AI options, including Anthropic, Perplexity, China-based DeepSeek, and Grok from Elon Musk’s xAI.He added that the deal with OpenAI gives Apple the flexibility to bring in other AI providers to its operating system, including Apple’s own AI models.Google-parent company Alphabet’s shares dipped about 8% on Wednesday (May 7), wiping out $160 billion from the company’s market capitalisation following Eddy Cue’s testimony.","Apple is planning to add AI-powered search options in the Safari browser.

Nvidia targets $50 billion in China's AI boom – why it can't afford to miss out

Impact of US export restrictions on Nvidia

Broader economic implications for the US

China’s rapid AI advancements and competitive threats

Financial performance and market outlook

The path forward: Balancing growth and national security

“The world is right now hungry, anxious to engage AI,”

“Let us get the American AI out in front of everybody right now.”

Nvidia , the world’s leading producer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and a dominant force in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, is facing a critical challenge as US-China trade tensions continue to escalate. CEO Jensen Huang recently emphasized the significance of the Chinese AI market , which he estimates could reach $50 billion in the next two to three years.Speaking at ServiceNow’s Knowledge 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Huang described the potential loss of access to this market as ahighlighting the broader economic impact on US jobs, revenue, and technological leadership. This concern comes amid tighter US export restrictions that have significantly affected Nvidia’s business prospects in China, one of its largest international markets.China has long been a vital market for Nvidia, not only as a major consumer of its advanced AI chips but also as a hub for cutting-edge AI research and development. Nvidia’s GPUs, known for their unmatched parallel processing capabilities, are essential for training and deploying sophisticated AI models, making them indispensable for industries ranging from autonomous vehicles to cloud computing.Huang noted in his interview that China’s AI market could grow to $50 billion within the next two to three years, presenting a massive revenue opportunity. Given that Nvidia’s GPUs have become the backbone of the global AI industry, securing a share of this rapidly expanding market is critical for the company’s long-term growth.However, Nvidia’s ability to access this lucrative market has been increasingly constrained by US export controls aimed at limiting China’s technological advancements. Last month, the Trump administration further tightened these restrictions, requiring special licenses for Nvidia to ship its H20 chips to China. These chips, part of the Hopper architecture, were specifically designed to comply with earlier export regulations but are now caught in the latest wave of trade restrictions.As a result, Nvidia announced a staggering $5.5 billion quarterly charge, reflecting the financial blow of losing a critical revenue stream. This move marks one of the most significant financial impacts on the company since it became a trillion-dollar tech giant, raising concerns about the sustainability of its rapid growth.Huang highlighted the broader economic consequences of these export restrictions, emphasizing the potential loss of US jobs and tax revenue. During the interview, he argued that maintaining access to the Chinese market is not just about Nvidia’s bottom line but also about the long-term competitiveness of the US tech sector.“We just have to stay agile,” Huang said, stressing the importance of balancing national security concerns with the need for economic growth and technological leadership. He added that the ongoing restrictions could force Chinese companies to develop domestic alternatives, potentially reducing US influence in the global AI industry over the long term.Huang’s comments come amid growing concerns about China’s rapid progress in AI technology. At a separate tech conference in Washington, D.C., in April, Huang warned that China is “not behind” in AI and described Huawei as “one of the most formidable technology companies in the world.”This assessment aligns with recent reports indicating that Chinese firms like Huawei and DeepSeek have made significant strides in developing their own AI chips, potentially challenging Nvidia’s dominance in this critical sector. Huang’s remarks underscore the competitive pressure Nvidia faces as it navigates a complex geopolitical landscape.Despite these challenges, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the global AI market. The company’s market capitalization has approached $3 trillion, making it one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. However, its stock has experienced significant volatility in recent months, with shares down about 15% so far this year after nearly tripling in 2023.Nvidia is set to report its next quarterly earnings on May 28, with analysts expecting a 65% year-over-year revenue increase to $43.1 billion, according to data from LSEG. This projected growth reflects the ongoing demand for AI hardware, even as the company grapples with geopolitical uncertainties and supply chain challenges.Huang’s recent comments highlight the delicate balance Nvidia must strike as it seeks to maintain its leadership in the AI industry while navigating complex geopolitical challenges. As US policymakers weigh the risks and benefits of restricting high-tech exports to China, companies like Nvidia face tough decisions about how to adapt to an increasingly fragmented global market.Huang said during his Las Vegas appearance.With AI becoming a critical driver of economic growth and technological innovation, the stakes for Nvidia and the broader US tech sector have never been higher.","N Nvidia is the world’s leading producer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and a dominant force in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.

Barry Diller’s marriage to Diane von Fürstenberg

Comparison with David Geffen and other closeted executives



The personal cost of secrecy

Public and industry reaction

A legacy beyond sexual identity

Barry Diller , the media mogul behind the creation of the Fox Broadcasting Company and former CEO of Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox, publicly came out as gay in a deeply personal essay published in New York magazine on May 6, 2025. The announcement arrives after decades of speculation surrounding his sexuality, especially in light of his decades-long relationship—and eventual marriage—with renowned fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg.Now 83 years old, Diller’s revelation marks a significant personal milestone, but also underscores broader historical contexts around sexuality, power, and visibility in the media and fashion industries.His coming out not only clarifies longstanding public curiosity but also contributes to an evolving dialogue about late-in-life LGBTQ+ disclosures among prominent figures who came of age in less accepting eras.Barry Diller was born on February 2, 1942, in San Francisco, California. He began his media career in the mailroom at the William Morris Agency but quickly ascended through the entertainment world. By the 1970s, he had made his mark as chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures, where he greenlit landmark films such as Saturday Night Fever, Grease, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. In the 1980s, he transitioned to 20th Century Fox, where he is credited with launching the Fox network, introducing hit shows like The Simpsons and Married... with Children, and reshaping primetime television.Diller’s visionary leadership earned him immense wealth and prestige. However, despite his public visibility and relationships with industry elites, his personal life remained largely private—fueling persistent speculation about his sexuality.Diller first encountered Diane von Fürstenberg in 1974 at a party at the historic Dakota building in New York City. At the time, Diane was married to Austrian Prince Egon von Fürstenberg, and Diller was already a rising executive at Paramount. Their initial interaction was unremarkable; Diller later recalled that Diane “looked through him like cellophane,” and he left the event expecting never to see her again.Nine months later, their paths crossed again during a dinner party hosted by Diane for a mutual friend, famed Hollywood agent Sue Mengers. By this time, Diane had separated from her husband, and her dynamic with Diller changed significantly. That night, they connected on a personal level, eventually beginning an on-again, off-again relationship that would span decades. Their bond, while unconventional, proved emotionally and romantically meaningful, culminating in their marriage in 2001.In his essay, Diller acknowledges that he has always been attracted to men and had relationships with them, including during his early years. As a teenager in West Hollywood, he experienced his first forays into gay culture, including visiting Fire Island Pines, a known LGBTQ+ haven. However, overwhelmed by the openness and freedom he saw there, he fled in fear—an action emblematic of the internal conflict he experienced for decades.Diller detailed how, during the 1960s and 70s, the fear of professional repercussions kept him from living openly. As his career flourished, he felt compelled to compartmentalize his personal life, stating that he would “dart in and out” of gay bars through side doors and hide his identity behind the protective facade of a public heterosexual relationship. His wealth and status, while granting access to elite spaces, also intensified the pressure to conform.The Diller–von Fürstenberg marriage has long been the subject of public speculation. Critics and gossip columnists have at times dismissed the union as a calculated move to quiet rumors about Diller’s sexuality. However, in his op-ed, Diller refutes this narrative, affirming that their relationship was both romantic and sexually intimate, particularly during its early years.He recalls gifting Diane 29 diamonds for her 29th birthday, delivered humorously in a Band-Aid box. He also recounts a moment of intimacy at music mogul David Geffen’s home, where the couple was inadvertently interrupted. Diller emphasized that while there were “a good many men” in his life, Diane was the only woman he ever truly loved. Their emotional connection, he said, has always been genuine and enduring.Diller’s revelation has drawn comparisons with David Geffen, another prominent entertainment executive who came out as gay in 1992. Like Diller, Geffen dated women in his early life—including Cher—before acknowledging his true orientation. The two men’s trajectories highlight the pressures faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in high-powered, conservative industries, particularly during the pre-AIDS and AIDS-era years when fear and stigma were widespread.Diller’s confession also follows a recent wave of older public figures coming out later in life, offering a lens into generational differences in acceptance and self-perception.Throughout his essay, Diller reflects on the emotional toll of living a double life. While his wealth and career accomplishments afforded him a luxurious lifestyle—with residences in New York, Los Angeles, Aspen, and Connecticut—his internal life, he admitted, often felt “arid.” The inability to fully express his identity left him feeling alienated, even as he enjoyed global acclaim and influence.He did not frame his choice to remain closeted as denial, but rather as a survival tactic in an era where being openly gay could jeopardize one’s professional future. “I wouldn’t do a single thing to make anyone believe I wasn’t living a heterosexual life,” he wrote. This strategic repression, though effective in protecting his career, exacted a significant emotional price.Diller’s announcement has generated widespread media coverage and a flurry of responses from both the entertainment and fashion worlds. While many have applauded his bravery and transparency, others have viewed the timing—coming so late in his life—with mixed curiosity. Nevertheless, the overarching response has been one of support and recognition of the complexities tied to coming out, especially for individuals who lived much of their lives in less accepting environments.Diane von Fürstenberg has not yet publicly commented on the essay, but throughout the years, she has remained by Diller’s side, both personally and professionally. The two have often appeared at galas and charity events together, and their enduring bond remains one of mutual respect and admiration.Though this revelation marks a turning point in Diller’s personal narrative, it does not define his legacy. His contributions to American media are vast—spanning television, film, and digital ventures. He played a key role in launching IAC (InterActiveCorp), an internet company that owns properties like Expedia, Match.com, and Vimeo, further cementing his reputation as a forward-thinking business leader.Diller’s ability to anticipate cultural trends and embrace technological shifts has made him one of the most influential figures in modern media history. His personal story now adds another layer of complexity to a legacy already rich with innovation and resilience.","Barry Diller came out as gay in a deeply personal essay published in New York magazine on May 6, 2025.

CHANDIGARH/MOHALI/ PANCHKULA: The air raid sirens were activated in the city, and a blackout was declared at around 9.30 pm. In a message circulated to different resident and market associations, the Chandigarh DC said, “Keeping in view the ongoing emergency situation, all the residents are requested to immediately respond to the sound of the siren and switch off all the lights. They are also advised not to venture outside or onto the rooftops.”While the residents switched off the lights, in several locations, there was a long delay in switching off the streetlights. Additionally, the solar lights remained switched on even as the sirens blared. Vehicles could be seen on the street with their lights on.Earlier in the day, the Chandigarh administration started strengthening the civil defence system in the city.“Satellite phones will be used in case of communication breakdown. Strengthening the Control Room of Civil Defence will be done. Air raid warning systems will be increased from 20 to 50. Uniforms will be given to civil defence personnel,” said a UT spokesperson.Power supply from the grid was restrored after midnight. However, the DC urged citizens to observe voluntary blackout.In view of a potential threat of attack from Pakistan, a two-hour blackout was enforced in Mohali around 9.30pm, Mohali DC Komal Mittal said.All residents were requested to turn off lights, including street and outdoor lighting; minimise movement outside unless absolutely necessary; and stay indoors and remain calm. This is a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of all citizens, so please cooperate fully with local authorities, the DC said.A brief period of confusion gripped Panchkula on Thursday night as a blackout was imposed across the city.The sudden shutdown led to uncertainty among residents, many of whom were unaware of the directive and had not turned off their lights. The confusion was partly attributed to the lack of a robust air siren system in the city. This led to a delayed response, with many homes remaining lit for several minutes after the blackout began.Streetlights too remained on for a considerable time before being eventually turned off. Later, as information spread through word of mouth and digital messages, more residents complied and switched off their lights.The blackout will remain in force throughout the night, added the Panchkula DC.","Chandigarh, Mohali, and Panchkula experienced a blackout following air raid sirens and potential threats from Pakistan.

Indian forces not only thwarted the strikes but also took out a Pakistani air defence system in Lahore.“All DCPs are actively monitoring law and order in their areas. They have already briefed their officers like ACPs and SHOs. DCPs are personally monitoring their area and Delhi Police is ready to deal with any kind of situation,” a senior official said.Enhanced security checks have been initiated at high-footfall zones such as malls, markets, metro stations, hotels, residential areas, airports, and other busy places.Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Abhishek Dhania said, ""As part of ongoing anti-terror measures, the police conducted a thorough security inspection at the Mayur Vihar Phase-1 Metro Station, a vital public installation. During the visit, CISF personnel were briefed, and a focused coordination meeting was held.""He added that the station is under surveillance by 41 functional CCTV cameras and is manned by a team of seven male and two female CISF personnel in each shift to ensure 24/7 security for commuters.Bomb Disposal Squads (BDS) have also been mobilised to carry out anti-sabotage checks at key sites. DCP (Southwest) Surendra Choudhary said, ""The district's BDS team conducted anti-sabotage checks at malls, markets, hotels and vital spots to ensure public safety throughout the district. The exercise strengthened vigilance and preparedness against potential threats.""Police checks have been intensified, particularly at Delhi's borders, with vehicles entering the city subjected to thorough screening.","Visitors at India Gate were asked to vacate the premises as police made announcements and regulated traffic. Officials downplayed the move, stating, ""This is a standard practice to keep the C Hexagon traffic jam-free. Anyone can come tomorrow and see it.""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121014295,imgsize-439044,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/121014295.jpg"

PwC layoffs: Impacted employees

Here’s what PwC said on the job cuts

Deloitte, KPMG among other Big Fours announcing job cuts

PwC, one of the Big Four accounting firms , has laid off nearly 1,500 employees in the US. According to a Financial Times report, the job cuts affect 2% of PwC’s 75,000 employees in the US. Quoting people familiar with the matter, the report states that most of the impacted staff worked in the audit and tax departments. The job cuts followed a months-long review of the business.Earlier, PwC had shifted hundreds of U.S. employees from less busy roles to faster-growing areas.Affected employees were notified on Monday and Tuesday this week. Hundreds of them received a Microsoft Teams meeting invite marked “time sensitive” in their email, the publication added.Many of the employees laid off had only recently joined PwC. One person who started in September told FT that they were ""devastated."" “Everyone was completely blindsided by the lay-offs today,” the person said.Another employee added, “Some of us were up for promotion, but instead of a promotion and a pay bump we’re now getting cut off.”The firm is also reducing campus hiring because of lower staff turnover but will honor the offers already made to last year’s interns who are scheduled to join later this year, the person said.“This was a difficult decision, and we made it with care, thoughtfulness and a deep awareness of its impact on our people, appreciating that historically low levels of attrition over consecutive years have made it necessary to take this step,” reads a statement from the company.Other Big Four firms have also announced similar job cuts. Earlier this year, Deloitte informed its employees that the group is laying off staff across its advisory business. In an internal call then, the firm said “Overall demand for Deloitte’s services remains strong”.“We are taking modest personnel actions based on moderating growth in certain areas, our government clients’ evolving needs, and low levels of voluntary attrition.”KPMG also laid off around 330 employees in the US in November 2024. The firm then said it was “addressing continued low levels of attrition”.","PwC, one of the Big Four accounting firms, has laid off nearly 1,500 employees in the US.

Relief for South Goa: Centre’s nod for medical college at Margao ESI hospital,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/relief-for-south-goa-centres-nod-for-medical-college-at-margao-esi-hospital/articleshow/121016751.cms,"



Panaji: The long-distance travel for patients from South Goa to GMC at Bambolim will be a thing of the past as Goa is set to get a new govt medical college and hospital in Margao with 50% of seats reserved for Goan students.The new Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) medical college in Margao is likely to commence operations from the new academic year of 2025-2026. This will be the second govt medical college in the state.Union govt on Thursday considered Goa’s request for the inclusion of ESI Margao Hospital in the list of locations under active consideration for setting up new medical colleges.Chief minister Pramod Sawant told TOI that “admission for the medical college will start from the current academic year.We will make all efforts to start the college this academic year.”Sawant said that the total management of the medical college will be looked after by the ESI.“The medical college will start with 100 beds, which will be increased to 250 beds,” he said.“We will provide all the required support to start the medical college from this academic year.”The CM said state govt is willing to give additional land to ESI to upgrade its existing hospital in Margao to a medical college.Sawant said he has already directed officers to start communicating with Union govt to put the project on the fast track. He said additional infrastructure for the hospital will be created. He said he is continually following up with Union govt to get the medical college to Goa.“I wanted to get the AIIMS and ESI. Union govt closed the AIIMS scheme,” Sawant said.“Deeply grateful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union minister for labour & employment Mansukh Mandaviya for positively considering Goa’s request for the inclusion of ESI Margao Hospital in the list of locations under active consideration for setting up new medical colleges,” Sawant said.He added, “This significant step will immensely strengthen healthcare infrastructure and expand opportunities for medical education in South Goa.” He said that at present, GMC has a 750-bed hospital.State govt has been eyeing the establishment of a private medical college in South Goa to provide better medical facilities to the people of the district and to cut travel time to the GMC. Currently, Goa has only one govt medical college.However, due to opposition to a private medical college by the people of South Goa, the proposal did not see the light of day.",The new Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) medical college in Margao is likely to commence operations from the new academic year of 2025-2026.

Supreme Court halts Madhya Pradesh HC order on Rs 350 crore Benami shares linked to Som Distilleries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/supreme-court-halts-madhya-pradesh-hc-order-on-rs-350-core-benami-shares-linked-to-som-distilleries/articleshow/121016658.cms,"Supreme Court





BHOPAL: In a significant intervention, the Supreme Court has stayed an interim order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court which had permitted the release and sale of equity shares worth Rs 350 crore linked to Som Distilleries Breweries & Wineries Ltd. The shares were earlier provisionally attached by the Income Tax Department’s Benami Prohibition Unit (BPU), Bhopal, under the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act (PBPT Act), 1988.The Supreme Court's stay came in response to Special Leave Petitions (SLPs) filed by the BPU challenging the High Court's interim relief granted in Bana Singh v. Union of India & Others (WP No. 9187 of 2025).At the core of the dispute are 1.2 crore publicly listed shares of SDBWL, held in the names of eight alleged benamidars—employees and associates of the Som Group. These shares, valued at over Rs 380 crore as of March 2025, were found to be benami assets with the real ownership attributed to Jagdish Kumar Arora, promoter-director of Som Distilleries.The provisional attachment was made under Section 24(4) of the PBPT Act by the Initiating Officer (IO), and later confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority (SAFEMA, Mumbai) under Section 26(3) in February 2025. Instead of appealing to the Appellate Tribunal under the Act, the alleged benamidars challenged the constitutional validity of the PBPT Act itself before the High Court.The Madhya Pradesh High Court, in its order dated 27 March 2025, allowed the release and sale of the attached benami shares, directing that an equal number of shares held by Arora and the company be attached instead—an action the Union government termed ultra vires and legally untenable.The SLP filed in the apex court described the High Court’s action as “beyond statutory powers,” emphasising that the PBPT Act does not allow substitution of attached benami property with other assets. According to the Act, the subject benami property must be specifically confiscated after due process—not swapped with other holdings.The Centre argued that the High Court’s relief effectively allowed the disposal of the very assets under scrutiny, risking irreversible financial loss to the exchequer. The shares, if sold, could render the entire legal process moot.The eight benamidars had previously attempted to pre-empt proceedings by filing writs even before the provisional attachment was issued—after mere show-cause notices under Section 24(1). These earlier petitions were dismissed by the High Court in March 2024, and subsequent SLPs were rejected by the Supreme Court in May 2024.The IT Department refused to comment on the matter. Notably, the constitutional validity of the PBPT Act is already under review by the Supreme Court, following the recall of its own 2022 judgment in Union of India vs. Ganpati Dealcom. The Centre pointed out that by allowing interim relief in the form of property sale, the High Court had essentially prejudged a matter sub judice before the top court, undermining its authority.With the next High Court hearing due on 9 May, the Supreme Court granted an urgent interim stay, preventing any further action under the High Court’s order. This, the Centre argued, was critical to prevent the benami shares from being sold off—a move that would not only violate the statute but could frustrate the entire benami prosecution mechanism.The final decision on the SLP and the fate of the contested shares will be decided in further proceedings. For now, the apex court’s stay protects the attached assets and preserves the integrity of the ongoing proceedings under the PBPT Act.","The Supreme Court has stayed an interim order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court which had permitted the release and sale of equity shares worth Rs 350 crore.

Trump administration may half 145% China tariff to 50% next week: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-may-half-145-china-tariff-to-50-next-week-report/articleshow/121016684.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

The Trump administration is considering cutting the steep 145% tariff on Chinese imports by more than half, possibly as early as next week, as US and Chinese officials gear up for high-level trade talks in Switzerland,reported, citing sources close to the negotiations.US officials are reportedly weighing a reduction of the levy to somewhere between 50% and 54%, a move aimed at easing tensions as trade negotiations unfold. The proposed cut, according to, would be accompanied by a separate plan to lower tariffs on imports from neighbouring South Asian countries to 25%.“They are going to be bringing it down to 50% while the negotiations are ongoing,” a source was quoted as saying byUS President Trump hinted at the potential tariff shift during a meeting with UK officials in the Oval Office, stating, “It’s at 145 so we know it’s coming down,” while expressing optimism over US-China ties. “I think we’re going to have a very good relationship,” he added. Retail industry leaders , including Walmart’s Doug McMillon, Target’s Brian Cornell, and Home Depot’s Ted Decker, reportedly urged Trump to consider easing the tariff burden during an April 21 meeting at the White House.Though the executives described the session as “productive” and “constructive,” no specific outcomes were disclosed.Retailers have since started preparing for a range of tariff outcomes. Jay Foreman, CEO of toy company Basic Fun, was quoted bythat many are now asking vendors to quote prices based on tariffs between 10% and 54% to ensure flexibility.He added that a 54% levy would still push prices up significantly, such as a Tonka truck jumping from $29.99 to $49.99 but that’s “workable.” A 145% tariff, however, would push the price to nearly $80, which he warned would “bring sales to a virtual standstill.”Nick Mowbray, CEO of toy brand Zuru, said “the speculation is 54%,” but noted that it has “definitely not been told explicitly to retail yet.”Meanwhile, White House dismissed the tariff rollback talk as speculation, reported the news agency. “When decisions on tariffs are made, they will come directly from the President. Anything else is just pure speculation,” said a White House spokesperson.Still, retail executives say treasury secretary Scott Bessent’s recent remarks at the Milken Institute Global Conference, that the current rate “isn’t sustainable”, gave them confidence that a shift is imminent.Lawrence Rosen, chairman of Cra-Z-Art, confirmed tothat retailers are hearing similar figures, “We are hearing China at 50% to 54% and other Asian countries at 25%.”Foreman revealed that Basic Fun has seven containers en route to the US under the 145% rate and plans to store them to avoid the costly levy. The rest remain in warehouses, awaiting green light.Noel Hacegaba, COO at the Port of Long Beach, said hopes are high the Switzerland talks will help “de-escalate growing trade tensions,” but stressed that shippers need “a strong signal” before adjusting supply routes.Retail expert Gerald Storch, former CEO of Toys R Us, toldthat since the White House meeting, retailers seem “less panicked” and have slightly “relaxed” their urgency for domestic sourcing.While the situation remains fluid, the toy industry, with 80% of US toy sales coming from China and broader retail sector are closely watching for any official word from Trump in the coming days.","US officials are reportedly weighing a reduction of the levy to somewhere between 50% and 54%.

"Kala Academy’s clumsy seating, AC take centre stage in report to CM",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/kala-academys-clumsy-seating-ac-take-centre-stage-in-report-to-cm/articleshow/121016693.cms,"



Panaji: The viewer-performer intimacy is lost with the removal of the front row at the Kala Academy auditorium, said the task force examining the facility’s deficiencies. The task force submitted its report to CM Pramod Sawant on Thursday.“For any drama, the ‘A’ row allows one to be close to the stage. If they decided to convert the auditorium into a cinema hall — where distance is very important — then the ‘Z’ row becomes important,” task force chairperson Vijay Kenkre told TOI.He added, “The A row needs to be restored because in a theatre show, the intimacy between the audience and performers is mandatory.”This was one of the many problems highlighted by the task force in its report.It also highlights issues such as the positioning of the AC duct, sound and lighting problems, and carpeted wings that hinder set movement, among others.“What is the use of the carpet in the wings when we cannot slide the set? Initially, the space was kept free on either side because that enabled us to slide the set. Now we cannot do that,” he said.He further said that a tender will be floated for the repairs of the open-air auditorium, which collapsed two years ago.“There are financial aspects that we will not interfere with. However, we will see to it that Kala Academy gets the status that it earlier had,” Kenkre said.Speaking at the secretariat on Thursday, Sawant confirmed the report’s submission. He said that a meeting will be held on Friday to discuss the details of the report.Formed in Oct 2024, the task force includes representatives from the PWD, Entertainment Society of Goa, Kala Academy, and Kala Rakhonn Mand. It was constituted by Sawant to assess Kala Academy’s infrastructure and recommend improvements.Prior to submitting the report, the task force conducted a detailed inspection of the Kala Academy premises.","Kala Academy auditorium needs to be restored to its former glory, says task force. CM Pramod Sawant will discuss details of the report on Friday. A tender will be floated for the repairs of the open-air auditorium, which collapsed two years ago.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121016701,imgsize-205332,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/121016701.jpg"

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
