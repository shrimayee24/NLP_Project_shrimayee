Power of Rs 10: Firms bet big on small packs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/power-of-rs-10-firms-bet-big-on-small-packs/articleshow/120268450.cms,"MUMBAI: This summer, consumer goods companies are turning up the heat on Rs 10 price packs-brands are pushing new products and variants within the price range into the market and also sharpening focus on distribution and marketing of smaller packs. Rasna for instance, has launched a fruit drink concentrate in Rs 10 sachet packs which can be used to make three glasses of beverage. The company's chairman Piruz Khambatta told TOI it will allow the lower middle-class an affordable alternative to other brands selling similar products at higher prices. Mother Dairy has widened its bouquet of Rs 10 packs by adding mango lassi and pudina chaach to the mix while PepsiCo has introduced a no-sugar beverage pack in Hyderabad at that price.While Rs 10 packs have always been key to companies' pricing strategy for India as it enables them to get more consumers within their fold in the value conscious market, the renewed bets on smaller packs also comes at a time when hit by high inflation over the past few quarters, middle class households have curtailed discretionary spending. Given that summers this time set in early in many parts of the country and projections indicating a scorching season ahead, companies want to tap into this opportunity to spur demand and the ploy here is pricing.""In terms of consumption, the environment remains mixed. Companies are trying to push smaller packs and drive more frequency. Also, after the launch of Campa, Rs 10 packs will somewhat make sure that companies remain competitive,"" said Karan Taurani, senior vice-president at Elara Capital.Dabur said that its portfolio of juices offered at Rs 10 will be a key distribution and market share driver for the company this summer. ""For beverages, the Rs 10 price point hits the sweet spot of affordability for Indian consumers, making it the preferred out-of-home consumption price point. This summer too, we will focus on offering more value for money to reduce the relative price differential with aerated beverages,"" said Monisha Prasher, marketing head, beverages at Dabur India. Mother Dairy has already seen a 30%-40% surge in demand for beverages, ice-creams and curd over last year, helped by an early onset of summer, said managing director Manish Bandlish. Rival Amul has stepped up competition in the market by launching Tru dairy-based fruit drink at Rs 10 for 150 ml.Coca-Cola's global CFO John Murphy who was on a visit to India earlier this year had said that the Rs 10 price point is very important in India and the company will focus on it. ""It's very important to understand the magic price points in a market like India and the Indian consumer is pretty elastic in what price point they are willing to buy or not,"" Murphy had said. Reliance's move to push Campa Cola in the market at a cheaper price of Rs 10 has nudged all brands to revisit their strategies.",Rasna has launched a fruit drink concentrate in Rs 10 sachet packs which can be used to make three glasses of beverage.

"Indian first and Indian last: Dr Ambedkar, a visionary reformer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-first-and-indian-last-dr-ambedkar-a-visionary-reformer/articleshow/120267396.cms,"Rajnath Singh (File photo)

Today marks the 135th birth anniversary of Dr B R Ambedkar , one of India's greatest visionaries. There have been deliberate and unjust attempts to downplay the legacy of Dr Ambedkar . After more than a century, the greatest injustice to his legacy is to reduce him to a Dalit leader. Today, he should be seen not merely as a symbol of resistance for Dalits and marginalised, which he undoubtedly is and always will be, but also as one of the foremost thinkers of modern India.It is recorded that when he was at school, he was not even permitted to drink water from the common tap that other children drank from. One day, in the scorching heat, when he decided to drink from the source closest to him, he was assaulted for daring to violate this oppressive taboo. After such an incident, many young boys would have been resigned to their fate. Others may have become reactionary, rebelling against an unjust system through violent action. But Ambedkar channelised his inner angst into a zeal for learning. He went on to get an MA, MSc, PhD, DSc, DLitt and Bar-at-Law, including degrees at Columbia and London School of Economics.Providence granted Dr Ambedkar unparalleled grit, intellect and integrity, which he put to use as a social reformer , jurist, economist, philosopher, human rights champion and nation-builder. His role as an institution builder also needs to be highlighted. Several institutions in modern India, such as RBI and Central Water Commission, find their genesis in Babasaheb's farsightedness.Being a staunch democrat, Dr Ambedkar also believed that a democratic form of govt presupposes a democratic form of society. He believed that without moral order in society, there cannot be democracy and rule of law. It can also be said that for him, democracy, politics and ethics formed a trinity just like liberty, equality and fraternity. Like his greatest interlocutor, Gandhiji, Dr Ambedkar was committed to fundamental social reform.This is because he was deeply worried about the future of India, its democracy, and hard-earned independence. His trepidations found expression in his last speech in the Constituent Assembly. Amid loud cheers, Dr Ambedkar held that we must be determined to defend our independence with the last drop of our blood. He forewarned that India would lose its democracy and independence a second time if Indians become complacent.It is his words of caution that set India on the path of a vibrant democracy for almost eight decades. However, today, we see attempts by some people to reduce the fraternity between Indians based on social cleavages such as caste, religion, ethnicity, language etc. We should be on guard to ensure that these divisive tendencies remain nothing but failed attempts. For instance, Ambedkar mocked the Aryan invasion theory at a time when he could have gained most from the Aryan-Dravidian divide. ""Whether a tribe or family was racially Aryan or Dravidian was a question which never troubled the people of India until foreign scholars came in and began to draw the line,"" Babasaheb wrote in a paper published in 1918.Furthermore, those who are attempting to use linguistic issues to further their narrow and sectarian interests would greatly benefit by reading Dr Ambedkar's views on the unity of the nation and the role of a language in this. On Sept 10, 1949, he moved an amendment in the Constituent Assembly supporting Sanskrit - one of the nine languages he had mastered - as the official language of the Union. In his 'Thoughts on Linguistic States', he also declared it the ""bounden duty of all Indians to own up Hindi as their language"". Dr Ambedkar believed that social and economic democracy goes hand in hand with political democracy. PM Narendra Modi ji has set a target of 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, which conforms to the vision of Babasaheb.Last month, when PM Modi visited Deekshabhoomi, he reaffirmed govt's commitment to work even harder to realise the India which Babasaheb envisioned. Babasaheb's birth anniversary presents all Indians with an opportunity to renew our pledge to the values and ideals given by him. Let us rise above our race, religion, region, caste and creed, and be 'Indian'.The writer is India's Raksha Mantri","Today marks the 135th birth anniversary of Dr B R Ambedkar, one of India's greatest visionaries.

No, stick with lasers for now Yes, diversify technologies

India has successfully demonstrated its capability to neutralise fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon system, marking a significant milestone in the nation's defense technology.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) developed this directed-energy weapon (DEW), which is now ready for production and deployment across various military platforms.With this achievement, India joins an elite group of countries, including the United States, China, and Russia, that possess advanced laser weapon capabilities.DRDO chairman Dr Samir V Kamat said: ""This is just the beginning of the journey. The synergy that this lab has achieved with other DRDO labs, industry and academia, I am sure we will reach our destination soon... We are also working on other high energy systems like high energy microwaves, electromagnetic pulse. So we are working on a number of technologies that will give us Star Wars capability. What you saw today was one of the components of Star Wars technologies.""""As far as I know, it is the United States, Russia and China that have demonstrated this capability. Israel is also working on similar capabilities, I would say we are the fourth or fifth country in the world to demonstrate this system,"" he added.The 30-kilowatt laser weapon system is designed to counter aerial threats such as drones and helicopters within a range of 5 kilometers.It features advanced electronic warfare capabilities, including jamming communication and satellite signals.Its versatility allows it to be adapted for both ground-based and shipborne applications, enhancing India's defense readiness across multiple domains. The system is equipped with a 360-degree Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor for precise targeting and can be rapidly deployed via air, rail, road, or sea.Dr BK Das, Director General (Electronics & Communication System) DRDO, said: ""For the first time, we are showing a technology in use and its devastation. This shows how far we are going in our technology maturity... What you saw is a completely indigenous product of many DRDO laboratories working in synergy with startups, academic institutions and industries. We are confident that we are going to reach high power very soon... We are planning to deploy similar systems with slight modifications on ships to prove the capability.""Dr Jagannath Nayak, director of the Centre for High Energy System, and Sciences (CHESS), DRDO said: ""Whatever we have achieved today is a great success, and we have seen that we have neutralised fixed-wing aircraft at long range and then we have also seen that we have neutralised swarm drone... with the laser weapon, we can neutralise multiple targets. So, this is one of the new and emerging weapon systems. It is a massless weapon and the concentration of laser light falls on the target and neutralises it. So this is an achievement for our country and DRDO.""India's efforts in directed-energy weapons extend beyond the 30-kilowatt system.The DRDO is also developing more powerful systems, such as the 300-kilowatt "" Surya "" laser weapon, which boasts an operational range of 20 kilometers.This system is designed to target high-speed aerial threats like missiles and unmanned aerial systems (UAS), further strengthening India's position in modern warfare. These advancements align with global trends emphasizing high-power lasers for missile defense and counter-drone operations.","India has successfully demonstrated its capability to neutralise fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon system.

Poll Should the Indian government pursue stricter laws against individuals involved in terror activities? No, current laws are sufficient Yes, absolutely

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA), in its ongoing probe into Tahawwur Rana's involvement in the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai, is focusing on the network of people who helped plan the conspiracy.Rana was questioned for the second day in a row as investigators try to understand how the large-scale attack was planned and who all were involved. NIA is also directing its effort to examine the possible links of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.As sources informed PTI news agency, the NIA is dissecting dozens of phone calls between Rana and Headley, using them to piece together the larger conspiracy that spanned continents. Investigators believe these conversations hold vital clues to the operational details of the attacks, and to those who worked behind the scenes.One of the leads includes a person based in Dubai, believed to have met Rana on Headley’s request. Investigators think this man knew about the attack plans. They are also checking if this ""mystery man"" was connected to Dawood Ibrahim or his criminal network known as D-Company, which is based in Dubai, as sources told IANS news agency.The agency is also looking into Rana’s possible ties with Pakistan’s spy agency ISI and terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which carried out the attacks. NIA officials believe the planning for the 26/11 attacks may have started as early as 2005.To support their investigation, Rana’s fresh voice samples have been sent for testing to match with calls made right after the attack. Investigators also suspect that Rana may have visited several parts of India before the attack, possibly to assist in planning.Rana was extradited from the US and brought to India on Thursday evening. A Delhi court gave the NIA 18 days of custody to question him. He is currently being held at the NIA headquarters in Delhi in a high-security cell.According to the NIA, Rana is being questioned not just for his role in the Mumbai attacks, but also to see if he was involved in planning similar terror attacks in other Indian cities. He faces several serious charges, including conspiracy, murder, and helping terrorists.The 2008 Mumbai attacks were among the deadliest in India’s history. Ten terrorists came to Mumbai by boat and attacked several places including the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, CST railway station, and Nariman House. The attacks lasted three days, killing 166 people and injuring over 230.With Rana now in India, the NIA is hoping to get a clearer picture of how the entire plot was put together and who all were involved behind the scenes.","Tahawwur Rana was extradited from the US and brought to India on Thursday evening.

Tahawwur Rana In India: Trump's Biggest Strike On Pak Terror, 26/11 Plotter To Face Justice Finally

Also read:

NEW DELHI: Worry seemed to flit across Tahawwur Rana’s face when he asked his legal counsels on Thursday night whether his trial would be over in a year or so and received “No” as a reply, sources said. They told him that just filing a chargesheet could consume a year, and that the entire trial, even a fast one, could take between five to 10 years.As he got a quick primer on the pace of the Indian legal system, Rana asked if he could plead the “Fifth”, to which his counsels said Indian laws also provide protection from “self-incrimination”, sources said. “Pleading the Fifth”, or invoking the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution, means refusing to answer questions or providing information that could incriminate oneself.Walking slowly in a brown jumpsuit with Crocs as footwear, wearing specta cles and a four-to-six-inch white beard, a fringe of white hair framing a balding scalp, Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security. His legal aid counsels (LACs) — advocates Piyush Sachdeva and Lakshya Dheer — were provided to him by Delhi State Legal Services Authority.Looking frail, tired, and jet-lagged, Rana displayed no other signs of anxiety during the court proceedings. However, the effects of age-related ailments were visible on the former Pakistan Army officer accused of a key role in the 26/ 11 Mumbai terror attacks. Rana suffers from various ailments, including abdominal, intestinal, and sinus cysts.According to sources, he came across as a “smart individual” who can strike up “casual conversations”. Rana was offered fruits by NIA personnel while waiting for court proceedings to begin, which he refused, but interacted “comfortably” with agency members. Sources said that Rana is being “taken good care of”. Govt and the agency want to make this case a “model one” so no one is going to take any chances, said sources.Rana’s major concern, apart from his claim that he is innocent and that extradition was not needed as he had already spent over a decade in jail and had been “acquitted” in the matter, was his medical care. On this, NIA assured the special judge that he would be provided all the medical care he needs. The question of “manhandling” also came up in the hearing, which was addressed by the court directing that Rana be medically examined every 48 hours.A US district court trial by jury had acquitted him on June 9, 2011 of conspiracy to provide material support to the Nov 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The LACs appearing for Rana urged the court to provide him with a “writing instrument” so that he can prepare his defence.The hearing for his remand was over within 10-15 minutes at around 11pm on Thursday. However, the order was pronounced at around 2am Friday.The prosecution, led by senior advocate Dayan Krishnan and advocate Narender Mann, submitted before the court that Rana is the first accused to be arrested and has links with named terrorists and other accused persons in this case. The counsels appearing for NIA told the court that a detailed investigation is required, Rana has to be confronted with a lot of evidence, and his statements would lead to additional discoveries.The court granted NIA 18 days’ custody of Rana. The agency requested 20 days, expressing concern that Rana might orchestrate terror plots like 26/11 targeting additional Indian cities. The court stipulated several conditions, including permission to consult with his legal representative on alternate days. The court also specified that Rana could only use a soft-tip pen and must conduct meetings with his lawyer under NIA supervision and within hearing range.","Tahawwur Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security.

"Caste census doesn't give population share of Vokkaligas, Lingayats",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/caste-census-doesnt-give-population-share-of-vokkaligas-lingayats/articleshow/120266817.cms,"BENGALURU: The special cabinet meeting called by Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah on April 17 to discuss the caste census report is set to be lively after some Congress politicians called for junking the report. The report was submitted to the cabinet on Friday. On Sunday, all cabinet ministers were delivered a copy to study and prepare for the April 17 meeting.Though the leaked report does not give the respective proportions in total population of the two dominant caste groups in Karnataka - Vokkaligas and Lingayats - it does propose quotas in different categories which the two rival caste groups are part of.The report says that under category III(A), which includes Vokkaligas and two other dominant communities, the population is placed at 73 lakh with a recommendation of a 7% reservation. Similarly, the population under category III (B), which comprises Veerashaiva-Lingayats and five other communities, is 81.3 lakh and the report recommends 8% quota. The total population of the state is pegged at 5.9 crore.As per the report's recommendations, the total reservation for all communities would increase to 73.5% (including 15% for SCs and 7.5% for STs) from the existing 50%, in line with SC capping guideline.Though the exact proportion of Lingayats and Vokkaligas in the population of modern-day Karnataka is not known, the two communities were estimated at 19% and 17%, respectively, on the basis of which the Chenappa Reddy commission for socio-economic survey had given its report in 1990. Based on that report, the then Deve Gowda govt in the state had recommended 4% reservations for Muslims.Even though the total Lingayat numbers are not known, industries minister and Lingayat politician M B Patil hinted at mismatch between ground realities and the survey findings, saying: ""It is nobody's fault that Lingayat numbers have fallen. Members of some Lingayat sub-castes have (in a fine slicing of sub-caste identity) declared themselves as Hindu Ganiga, Hindu Banajiga and Hindu Sadaras for the sake of (existing) 2A reservation benefits. If we take all of them into account and also Lingayats recorded under 3B, then their population crosses 1 crore. The cabinet meeting will discuss all these finer points.""Muslims are placed at 12.6% of the population in the survey conducted in 2015.The largest community in Karnataka, however, are the Scheduled Castes with a population of nearly 1.1 crore and 108 sub-castes within them.Responding to senior Congressman Shamanur Shivashankarappa's claim that the report was ""unscientific"", deputy CM D K Shivakumar was cryptic in his response: ""Everyone is trying to safeguard their communities. I will not stop them (as it's their democratic right to do so). On April 17, the cabinet will discuss the issue.""BJP targeted Congress govt for minority appeasement. ""This report reeks of CM dictating the numbers to census author H Kantharaju. If not, there is no way Muslims are declared the 'majority community',"" said LoP R Ashoka.","The report was submitted to the cabinet on Friday.

Kernel of calm for Goa's cashew business as Trump hits 90-day pause on higher tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kernel-of-calm-for-goas-cashew-business-as-trump-hits-90-day-pause-on-higher-tariffs/articleshow/120266725.cms,"PANAJI: US President Donald Trump's decision to hit pause on his trade war - except with China - has alleviated anxieties in the far corners of North Goa. While Trump's tariff tantrums did not result in any additional duties on Indian cashew nuts, his move to impose higher tariffs on Vietnam, which holds more than 80% market share of cashews in the US, would have seen nuts from Vietnam and African nations flooding India.Owners of cashew nut processing plants said that such an eventuality would have sent prices tumbling in Goa. Vietnam, which has the lion's share as a supplier of cashews - raw and processed - in the US market, was hit with a steep 46% tariff by Trump before the 90-day pause was announced.Vietnam imports raw cashews from West African nations and then exports them to the US. If the demand from the US and Vietnam had dropped, cashew nuts from West Africa would have swamped India, crashing cashew prices. ""If Vietnam is affected, it will default on the African crop and the price will drop. This is our worry,"" Goa Cashew Manufacturers Association president Rohit Zantye said. Vietnam imports raw cashew nuts from Cote d'Ivoire, Tanzania, Benin, Tonga, and Ghana. Goan companies also tap those markets. Many Goan cashew nut processing factories and packers have already placed import orders for the current year.As of now, the landed cost for African cashew nuts is Rs 155 per kg while for Goa cashew nuts, which are of a higher quality, it is Rs 175 per kg. ""We have already purchased 40% of our raw material. If the raw cashew prices collapse after we have purchased at a higher price, it would have been a challenge,"" Zantye said. ""Those who have bought local produce will be in the soup since the African cashew nuts will flood the Indian market,"" he added.The reciprocal tariffs imposed by Trump roiled the international markets last week and an impact analysis by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (Ficci) had said tariffs could be an opportunity for the cashew nut processing units. ""Vietnam is the dominant supplier of cashews (raw as well as processed) in the US market with more than 80% share,"" the Ficci report said. ""Since the reciprocal tariff imposed on Vietnam is considerably high at 46%, this gives an opportunity to other exporting countries like India to expand their market share in the US.""India currently has a 0.9% share in the export of fresh or dried cashew nuts to the US, the same as Nigeria, while Vietnam has an 88% share. Trump's reciprocal tariff on India is just 26%. In terms of preserved cashew nuts, India has a 6% share in exports to the US. However, the 15-odd cashew nut processing units in North Goa were worried last week. The state's cashew crop spanning 55,302 hectares yields estimated 27,070 tonnes annually.","US President Donald Trump's decision to hit pause on his trade war has alleviated anxieties in the far corners of North Goa.

"Proposals to bring relief from toll charge on NHs, e-expressways under finance minister’s consideration",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/proposals-to-bring-relief-from-toll-charge-on-nhs-e-expressways-under-finance-ministers-consideration/articleshow/120262135.cms,"NEW DELHI: The two proposals of road transport ministry to bring relief to lakhs of commuters from shelling out high toll on national highways and expressways — no user fee on narrower NHs that are two-and-half lanes and option of annual pass costing around Rs 3,000 for unlimited travel for cars — are now under the finance ministry’s consideration.Sources said the proposals have been approved by the road transport ministry and sent to the expenditure department of the finance ministry since it involves some revenue loss. While annual passes would cause some loss to toll revenue, stopping user fee collection on narrower highways won’t have any impact, they added.Though earlier road transport minister Nitin Gadkari had spoken about the plan to offer the option of annual and lifetime pass for private vehicles, the ministry zeroed down on the monthly pass, considering high probability of its acceptance among vehicle owners. The minister has been making statements of extending some “big relief” for highway commuters in the near future and has also claimed that with this they won’t have any complaints.Sources said the proposal of no tolls on two-and-half lanes or two-lane with paved shoulders was mooted by the minister as a review meeting and had asked officials to look into this. The user fee on such roads is 64% less than the toll payable on highways that are four-lane and more. TOI has learnt that there are less than 50 toll plazas on such stretches and barring a few all are public funded roads, meaning the toll is collected by govt’s own agencies.“In most cases, the toll generated is less than the expenses incurred. So, it isn’t a bad proposition to do away with tolling on these stretches. The only issue is highways with four lanes and more, and expressways. There are a significant number of private players collecting toll and govt has to compensate for the loss they may incur due to annual passes,” said a source.Data show that out of the total toll revenue of Rs 61,000 crore of 2024-25, private cars had a share of around 20-21%. and the large chunk of 79-80% fee comes from commercial and heavy vehicles.","No user fee on narrower NHs that are two-and-half lanes.

The project, part of Char Dham Road connectivity , made headlines after 40 workers were left stranded after the cave-in in leading to a nerve-wracking rescue operation lasting 17 days. In the end, all the workers were safely taken out.After the incident, the govt had decided to salvage the project considering the huge expenditure incurred and the importance of the 4.5 km tunnel.

Necessary changes have also been made taking into account all safety concerns,” said an official.Though the detailed probe report into the collapse had found negligence on part of NHIDCL, the entity that prepared the detailed project report (DPR), construction firm and supervision consultant or authority engineer (AE), the govt has not yet taken any significant action against any of these entities. The report had pointed out how the fixing of alignment did not meet basic principles of tunnelling, and there was negligence on part of the contractor to address the issue of 21 minor collapses, despite the AE flagging them.The report had flagged the lack of coordination and information flow among the stakeholders and how they overlooked responsibilities while recommending govt to initiate penal action against delinquent personnel and officers after carrying out an inquiry.",The project was stuck for months after a section of the Silkyara Bend–Barkot tunnel collapsed while under construction in November 2023. 40 workers were left stranded after the cave-in in leading to a nerve-wracking rescue operation lasting 17 days.

‘Calculated move to disinherit daughters’: SC tears into decades-old adoption claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/calculated-move-to-disinherit-daughters-sc-tears-into-decades-old-adoption-claim/articleshow/120257544.cms,"SC calls out social reality

What the courts found

NEW DELHI: In a case that echoes the persistent struggle of daughters claiming equal rights to ancestral property, the Supreme Court has put its weight behind the Allahabad High Court's decision to discard a decades-old adoption deed, calling it a “calculated move” to deny two sisters their inheritance.At the heart of the legal fight was Ashok Kumar, who claimed he was adopted in 1967 by Bhuneshwar Singh, a deceased resident of Uttar Pradesh, to stake claim over Singh’s estate. Singh had two biological daughters—Shiv Kumari Devi and Harmunia—who contested the claim, saying the adoption was fabricated to cut them off from their father’s property.While Ashok relied on an adoption deed and an old photograph to back his claim, both the Allahabad High Court and the Supreme Court found glaring gaps. Most damning was the absence of consent from Singh’s wife—a legal requirement for valid adoption under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act , 1956.Justice Surya Kant, presiding over the case with Justice N Kotiswar Singh, minced no words during the hearing:""We know this is a methodology adopted in rural areas to oust the daughters from rightful inheritance. We know how these adoption proceedings are carried out.""The bench noted that such fabricated adoptions are often used to divert property away from daughters in patriarchal family setups.The adoption deed dated August 9, 1967, was deemed invalid as it lacked the wife’s consent—a non-negotiable condition under the law.The woman’s presence at the ceremony was not proven. Her signature was absent from the deed, and witnesses failed to confirm her participation.The photograph produced didn’t establish her role in the ceremony either.The high court had earlier expressed regret over the 40-year delay in adjudicating the matter but ultimately concluded that the evidence and procedural lapses rendered the adoption invalid.""The mandatory requirement that a person who adopts a child must have the consent of his wife was absent,"" the HC had noted.","Ashok Kumar claimed he was adopted in 1967 by Bhuneshwar Singh, a deceased resident of Uttar Pradesh.

US spouse visa: Vetting knot: New spouses of US citizens face tough checks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vetting-knot-new-spouses-of-us-citizens-face-tough-checks/articleshow/120263648.cms,"Marrying a US citizen or green card holder once meant you had a smooth one-way ticket to the American Dream. But newlywed spouses can no longer expect to just hop on to a flight with a heart full of hope and a suitcase full of namkeen.The days of waived interviews and easy approvals under the Biden administration are over - one more casualty of the Trump regime's crackdown on suspected immigration fraud. Instead, each case will now be subjected to vetting.While there was always a waiting period involved, the first step is tackling the interview - which only got tougher. If the spouse (say wife) is in India, the interview will be conducted by US consulate officials.If the spouse is already in US, say on a non-immigrant H-1B work visa, after marriage, they can apply for a green card (known as adjustment of status ). In this case, the interview will be carried out by US Citizenship and Immigration Services officials.Spoiler alert: make sure all your paperwork is in order, and be prepared for some intense questioning. ""Officers will be looking deeper... leaning into their discretion more often than they did in the Biden years. They are already spending more time verifying marriages and we are seeing an increase in requests for evidence,"" says immigration attorney Ashwin Sharma.Based on past-history, it is likely that this pattern will become precedent and will soon be enshrined in a formal policy,” says immigration attorney Ashwin Sharma. “We’re seeing an increase in requests for evidence, and it’s likely this pattern will soon become official policy.”Translation? Your love story needs receipts — literally. Especially in consular interviews, where the American spouse doesn’t get a seat at the table. “Documents have to tell the full story: how the relationship began, genuine intent to live a married life together, how it’s been sustained, and why it is bona fide. That means clear evidence of communication, visits, shared plans, and/or family involvement,” explains Sharma.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law group, adds, “For consular processing cases, be prepared! You should have some documentary proof of your bona fide relationship. Examples include money transfer receipts and phone-call logs. If possible, consider purchasing a life insurance policy naming your spouse. Additionally, be prepared to answer questions about your marital relationship, including your spouse’s current employment, salary, education and any prior marriages.Married to a green card holder instead of a US citizen? Buckle up. There’s usually a 3-4 year wait, which could raise red flags in the interview. “The years spent apart raise obvious questions. How have you sustained a genuine marriage over such prolonged distance? The longer the wait, the more documentation you’ll need — pictures, financial records, continuous communication — to convincingly show that your marriage isn’t just alive but thriving despite the distance,” says Sharma.Consular officers, especially at posts like Mumbai, he adds, wield enormous discretion to issue 221(g) refusals — where the applicant’s visa application is deemed ineligible for approval at the time — or send petitions back to USCIS for fraud investigations, which can remain unresolved for years. “Under the current administration, we can expect this discretionary power to be used more liberally and aggressively. Absence may make the heart grow fonder, but for immigration officers, prolonged absence makes suspicion grow stronger,” quips Sharma.Now, if your spouse is already in the US and applying for adjustment of status, you’ll still face an interview. But if anything smells off to the officer, you could be headed for a ‘Stokes interview’ — where you and your spouse are questioned separately and your answers better line up. The questions tend to be more personal in nature. Examples include:Which side of the bed do you sleep on?Who woke up first today?How many windows are in your bathroom?Does your spouse have any food allergies?How many locks are there on the front door?While immigration attorneys have not yet seen an uptick in calls for ‘Stokes interviews’, they recommend not flying solo. Bring a lawyer. Basically, treat it like preparing for an exam — with your relationship as the subject. “Well-prepared, legitimate cases appear to be still holding up well under scrutiny. But it’s also true that even genuine couples with weak documentation are going to feel the pressure,” warns Sharma. “If a green card is denied due to an alleged marriage fraud, the spouse can be placed in removal proceedings (deportation),” adds Batra.To sum up, love may be beautiful, but immigration interviews aren’t. Do your homework — and bring receipts!","Married to a green card holder instead of a US citizen? Buckle up. There’s usually a 3-4 year wait, which could raise red flags in the interview.

NEW DELHI: Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi , a key accused in the Rs 14,000-crore Punjab National Bank fraud case, was arrested on Saturday by Belgian authorities on India's extradition request.Choksi’s arrest was based on two non-bailable warrants issued by a Mumbai court, dated May 23, 2018, and June 15, 2021, according to people familiar with the development.Choksi is now preparing for a legal fight as his defence team prepares to seek bail and challenge efforts to extradite him to India.His lawyers argue that there are valid grounds to oppose extradition, including his medical condition.The 65-year-old fugitive diamond trader is wanted by the CBI and ED for his alleged role in defrauding PNB of nearly Rs 1,400 crore, along with his nephew Nirav Modi.Reacting to the news of Choksi's arrest, the PNB scam whistle-blower Hariprasad SV said, ""It's really great news. We are very glad for all those people who were cheated by Mehul Chowksi in India. It's unbelievable how he got caught in Belgium. It's also important that we not only get him back to India but also get back the money he looted, that is what India needs.""""Extradition is not going to be an easy task. His wallet is full, and he will employ the best advocates in Europe, as Vijay Mallya has been doing. It is not easy for India to get him back...Even though he was caught in Antigua, he managed to get out of it as he had a fleet of lawyers. It's not going to be so easy for the government of India, but I hope the government succeeds this time,"" he added.Choksi left India on January 2, 2018, initially travelling to the United States before settling in Antigua. He had acquired Antiguan citizenship in 2017, prior to fleeing the country.In 2021, Choksi was arrested in Dominica under controversial circumstances. While authorities alleged he was trying to flee to Cuba, his legal team claimed he was kidnapped from Antigua. Despite India seeking his extradition, Dominica deported him back to Antigua.Choksi later travelled to Belgium, reportedly to receive cancer treatment, where he has now been detained.According to the agencies, Choksi, his company Gitanjali Gems, and others allegedly colluded with bank officials to fraudulently obtain Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) and enhance Foreign Letters of Credit (FLCs) without adhering to the required procedures.This led to substantial wrongful losses for the bank.","Mehul Choksi arrested on Saturday by Belgian authorities on India's extradition request.

These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs , and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’ The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it,” Trump wrote, referencing media reports suggesting exemptions for electronics like smartphones and semiconductors.The post came amid market jitters and criticism following the administration’s recent shifts on trade. Trump said the US would investigate semiconductors and “the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN” as part of upcoming national security tariff probes. He warned, “We will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China.”Trump’s comments follow a turbulent week in which the White House appeared to soften some tariff positions, rattling markets and prompting a full-throated defence from top officials. On Sunday, White House advisers and Cabinet members fanned out across major television networks in an effort to project calm and continuity in policy, even as Trump’s messaging suggested otherwise.Trump insisted that what some interpreted as exemptions were simply reclassifications. “Those days are over!” he said, referring to decades of perceived trade abuse by China . He pledged that the “Golden Age of America” would bring new tax and regulatory cuts, more jobs, and domestic manufacturing growth.“Our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before,” Trump wrote. “We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”While Trump's team last week defended a shift to a 10% universal tariff on most imports — and a steep 145% tariff on goods from China — their Sunday appearances aimed to reassure voters and businesses of long-term benefits, despite short-term volatility and rising costs.","US President Donald Trump on Sunday doubled down on his hardline trade stance, declaring that no country — especially China — would be spared from his sweeping tariff agenda.

The Kentucky Derby is only a few days away; the Derby is America's most prestigious annual horse race and is scheduled to be held on May 3. The Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce was present at the iconic race last year, held at Churchill Downs and wore a sharp suit and tophat. And now fans are speculating whether Travis will make an appearance at this year’s Derby along with his famous girlfriend Taylor Swift.An insider from celebrity news platform Deuxmoi has revealed that Travis Kelce wants to rent a private box for the Derby, which holds six guests. This revelation has sparked curiosity about who might join him.Taylor was not with Travis at the Derby last year, as she was focusing on her international Eras Tour that was set to launch in Paris shortly.This year Taylor and Travis have been keeping a low profile since Travis and his team lost out on the Super Bowl. This raises questions about whether Taylor might join Travis for the festivities. It’s possible that Travis will be accompanied by his brother Jason or his teammates or members from his entourage. However, fans believe Taylor may be with him at the Derbys this year since she does not seem to have a major commitment in early May.Travis had opened up about his Derby experience during one of the episodes of his New Heights podcast.""I'm a Derby guy now, man,"" he said on the podcast. ""It was so much fun."" While Jason Kelce had been to the famous race multiple times during his college days at the University of Cincinnati, this was Travis Kelce's first time at the Derbys.“It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I am definitely going to try and experience again,” he said on the podcast. “It was fun just being part of the entire environment.”",Fans believe Taylor Swift will join Travis Kelce at the Kentucky Derby this year in May.

When Steve Jobs explained to President Barack Obama why iPhones can’t be made in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-steve-jobs-explained-to-president-barack-obama-why-iphones-cant-be-made-in-the-us/articleshow/120246122.cms,"Poll Do you think shifting large-scale tech manufacturing to the US is practical? No, global supply chains make it difficult Yes, it's possible with the right support

Steve Jobs gives reasons why iPhones are made in other countries



US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his commitment to revitalising American manufacturing, proposing steep tariffs to push companies into producing goods domestically. This means challenges for tech giants like Apple, Dell and others who have huge manufacturing set-ups in China. Though over the past few years, Apple has moved some of its supply chain to countries like India and Vietnam; China still remains the biggest manufacturing base for the iPhone maker.The US President Trump sees tariffs as a way to drive manufacturing into the US, create jobs, and benefit the economy. And here getting the world's most valuable company, Apple, to manufacture its most popular product, the iPhone, in the US, is clearly part of Trump's vision. Last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Apple's commitment to invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years was supposedly a clear indicator that Apple believed it was feasible to build iPhones here. ""If Apple didn’t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn’t have put up that big chunk of change,"" Leavitt said.However, manufacturing iPhones in the US may not be as easy. A case in point is a report by The New York Times dating back to 2012 that highlighted conversation between the then-President Barack Obama and some of Silicon Valley’s most influential leaders, including Apple CEO Steve Jobs , during a private dinner in California held in February 2011. This was just months ahead of Apple founder Steve Jobs’ demise in October 2011.Each guest – which included Eric Schmidt, then Google CEO as well as Mark Zuckerberg , the founder of Facebook – was encouraged to pose a question to the president. But when Apple’s late CEO, Steve Jobs, began to speak, it was Obama who asked a question: “What would it take to make iPhones in the United States?”Jobs’s response was blunt and unwavering: “Those jobs aren’t coming back,” he said, the report cited another guest at the dinner as saying.Notably, a vast majority of iPhones, iPads and other devices that Apple sold that year were assembled in China. The reasoning, according to Apple executives, goes far beyond cost-cutting. It’s about scale, speed and skill.According to the report, Apple’s executives believed that the company's stance wasn't solely about labor costs. According to dinner attendees, Apple's executives emphasised the superior scale, flexibility, and specialised skills found in overseas factories.Apple airlifts 600 tons of iPhones from India and transported them to ChinaAs President Trump's tariff push for domestic manufacturing intensified, Apple strategically moved to mitigate potential financial impacts. Just ahead of the tariff implementation, Apple expedited the transport of approximately 600 tons of iPhones, or an estimated 1.5 million units, from India via six cargo planes to avoid the impending levies.","US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his commitment to revitalising American manufacturing.

From India to Dominica

How Choksi got Belgian residency

Next stop: Extradition to India?

In no case can the surrender be made unless the crime shall be punishable according to the laws in force in both countries with regard to extradition. India-Belgium treaty

NEW DELHI: Absconding diamond trader Mehul Choksi was arrested in Belgium on a request by India seeking his extradition in connection with the Rs 13,000 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case.He was reportedly arrested on Saturday from a hospital in Belgium.After the Interpol Red Notice against Choksi was removed, Indian authorities — including the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) — renewed efforts to extradite him from Belgium.The Belgian government had confirmed the presence of Choksi on its soil, stating that it is giving the matter ""great importance and attention"". This was after he had disappeared from Antigua last year.Choksi, along with his nephew Nirav Modi , their associates, and several bank officials, was booked by the ED and CBI in 2018 for allegedly orchestrating a massive loan fraud at PNB’s Brady House branch in Mumbai.According to the ED, Choksi, through his firm Gitanjali Gems and others, cheated the bank in collusion with certain officials by fraudulently obtaining Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) and enhancing Foreign Letters of Credit (FLCs) without following proper procedures — causing significant financial losses to the bank.So far, the ED has filed three charge sheets against Choksi, while the CBI has also submitted similar charges in the case.Choksi is believed to owe more than Rs 6,000 crore to 34 Indian banks. He allegedly secured the loans using fraudulent methods similar to those employed by his nephew, Nirav Modi. Following the exposure of the scam in January 2018, Choksi fled to the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda, where he acquired citizenship.In February 2018, the CBI initiated efforts to trace Choksi. A formal extradition request was sent through diplomatic channels to the Antiguan authorities in August that year after Choksi's presence was confirmed.Choksi challenged the extradition bid, claiming he was the target of a political conspiracy. He also raised concerns about prison conditions in India, along with his personal health and safety. Nonetheless, the Interpol’s Commission for Control of Files (CCF) rejected these arguments and approved the Red Notice.In May, 2021 he was detained again in Dominica for illegal entry. A CBI team traveled to the island nation to bring him back to India, but the effort fell through. In July 2021, the Dominica high court allowed him to return to Antigua for medical treatment.Later, on his second plea, the Interpol Red Notice was removed.In a related action, the Enforcement Directorate in February 2021 attached assets worth Rs 14.45 crore belonging to Choksi and his firm Gitanjali Group. These included a flat in Mumbai’s Goregaon, luxury watches, gold and platinum jewellery, precious stones, and a Mercedes-Benz car. The ED had earlier attached assets worth over Rs 2,550 crore in the same case.The diamond merchant's presence in in Antwerp, Belgium was confirmed last month. He was residing in Belgium, along with his wife, Preeti Choksi, after obtaining a residency card in the country, according to a report by the Associated Times. Indian authorities later requested Belgium to initiate his extradition.His wife Preeti is said to be a Belgian national.Citing unnamed sources, the report claimed Choksi submitted “false declarations” and “forged documents” while applying for residency in Belgium, failing to disclose his Indian and Antiguan citizenships.It also suggested that Choksi is planning to relocate to Switzerland, citing the need for treatment at a cancer hospital.India and Belgium have a longstanding extradition treaty that enables the transfer of fugitives accused of serious crimes such as murder, rape, manslaughter, bigamy, forgery, counterfeiting, embezzlement, and fraud.However, the treaty includes key conditions. Extradition can only be granted if the alleged offence is considered a crime under the laws of both countries. Additionally, neither country is obligated to extradite its own nationals, whether by birth or naturalisation, under any circumstances, the agreement states.""Provided that the surrender shall be, made only when, in the case of a person accused, the Commission of the crime shall, be, so established as that the laws of the country where the fugitive or person accused shall be found would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial if the crime had been there committed, and in the case of a person alleged to have been convicted, on, such evidence as, according to the laws of the country where he is found, would prove that he had been convicted,"" the treaty reads.""In no case can the surrender be made unless the crime shall be punishable according to the laws in force in both countries with regard to extradition,"" it says.","Mehul Choksi was arrested in Belgium on a request by India seeking his extradition in connection with the Rs 13,000 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud case.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes. Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118065596,imgsize-587609,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/118065596.jpg"

"NY Helicopter Crash: FAA grounds helicopter company after crash that killed 6, including Siemens executive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/faa-grounds-helicopter-company-after-crash-that-killed-6-including-siemens-executive/articleshow/120267862.cms,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Sunday announced that New York Helicopter Tours , the company whose sightseeing chopper broke apart midair and plunged into the Hudson River last week, killing six people, is ceasing operations immediately. The move comes amid mounting pressure from federal lawmakers and renewed scrutiny of the city’s helicopter tour industry.“The FAA is initiating an immediate review of New York Helicopter Tours’ operating license and safety record,” the agency said in a statement posted on X, hours after US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged regulators to revoke the company’s license.Thursday’s crash killed all on board — pilot Sean Johnson, 36, a US Navy veteran, and five members of a visiting family from Spain: Agustín Escobar, 49, a Siemens executive; his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal, 39; and their children Agustín, 10; Mercedes, 8; and Víctor, 4. The family had arrived in New York from Barcelona that same day.Schumer, speaking before the FAA announcement, called the crash “a tragic consequence of regulatory loopholes,” and demanded a crackdown on tour operators. “One of the things we can do to honor those lives and try to save others is to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” he said. “We know there is one thing for sure about New York City’s helicopter tour companies: they have a deadly track record.”The helicopter was operating under FAA’s “Part 91” regulations, a category with looser safety and training standards compared to stricter commercial flight rules. “The rules under Part 91 just aren’t strict enough when people’s lives are on the line,” Schumer said, warning that these relaxed requirements allow companies to ""cut corners and put profits over people.""The ill-fated chopper had been on its eighth flight of the day when witnesses saw it trailing smoke before it spiralled out of control and slammed into the river. Video footage captured parts of the rotor flying off midair. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), now leading the investigation, said the crash occurred less than 20 minutes after takeoff from a Manhattan heliport.Authorities believe a mechanical failure may have caused the main rotor to strike the tail, resulting in catastrophic midair disintegration. NTSB officials confirmed that the aircraft’s main rotor and transmission are still missing, and no final determination will be made until those components are recovered.New York Helicopter Tours has a troubled history. FAA records reveal that the aircraft, built in 2004, had a documented transmission issue last year. In 2013, one of its helicopters lost power mid-flight, though the pilot safely landed. The company has previously filed for bankruptcy and faces several lawsuits over unpaid debts.Schumer also called for increased FAA ramp inspections for all tour operators, including FlyNYON — another operator under scrutiny after a 2018 crash in the East River killed five people. A recent jury found FlyNYON liable for that incident.Industry advocates pushed back, with the Eastern Region Helicopter Council stating that New York sightseeing flights “already operate under the most stringent of regulations.” But critics argue that nonessential helicopter flights in densely populated areas like Manhattan remain a persistent safety hazard.After a 2016 city cap limited Manhattan heliport flights to 30,000 annually, many operators moved to nearby New Jersey. Nonetheless, five sightseeing helicopters have crashed into the Hudson or East River over the past two decades, killing 20 people.","FAA announces it is reviewing New York Helicopter Tours' license and safety record.

What will happen to Tuft student Rumeysa Ozturk as judge rules for deporting Columbia's Mahmoud Khalil?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-will-happen-to-tuft-student-rumeysa-ozturk-as-judge-rules-for-deporting-columbias-mahmoud-khalil/articleshow/120240798.cms,"Tuft University student Rumeysa Ozturk's plea is to be heard in Vermont Monday.

Poll Do you agree with the judge's decision to allow Mahmoud Khalil's deportation? No, he should not be deported. Yes, it was the right decision.

Good riddance: Trump admin reacts to Mahmoud Khalil order



What Mahmoud Khalil said after the ruling



The verdict of the Mahmoud Khalil case was crucial as several international students were detained by ICE after Khalil and are now waiting to be deported. An immigration judge, Jamee E Comans, on Friday ruled that Khalil can be deported as his presence in the US posed ""potentially serious foreign policy consequences"". The judge said the government established by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable.His lawyers said he would not be deported immediately as they would appeal the verdict. Previously, federal judges in New York and New Jersey ordered the government not to deport Khalil while his case remains in court.Tuft University doctoral student from Turkey Rumeysa Ozturkl who was detained by immigration officials near her Massachussets home has been demanding her release. She has filed an updated account of how she was surrounded by ICE officials who grabbed her phone.Rumeysa's case is like Khalil's, though Khalil is a US citizen through his marriage to a US citizen, Dr Noorr Abdallah who is going to be a mother next month.The petition to release her was filed in a Boston court and then it was moved top Vermont, which will be heard on Monday.Ozturk was one of four students who wrote an op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, last year criticizing the university’s response to student activists demanding that Tufts “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide,” disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.DHS secretary Kristi Noem said it will be 'good riddance' once Khalil is deported. ""Mahmoud Khalil hates the United States and what we stand for—so his removal should come as welcome news,"" Noem posted.""It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country,"" Noem posted.""I would like to quote what you said last time that there's nothing that's more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness. Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process. This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family. I just hope that the urgency that you deemed fit for me are afforded to the hundreds of others who have been here without hearing for months,"" Khalil said.","An immigration judge, Jamee E Comans, on Friday ruled that Khalil can be deported as his presence in the US posed ""potentially serious foreign policy consequences"" Rumeysa Ozturk who was detained by immigration officials near her Massachussets home has been demanding her release.
