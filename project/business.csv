He apprised the govt that since there is no stipulation in the Abkari Act and rules to grant such permission, the issuance of a one-time sanction for the acquisition of liquor from the Bevco warehouse in Ernakulam , in relaxation of rules, may be contemplated, as it is a solicitation from the govt of Lakshadweep.Govt scrutinised the matter and decided to confer a one-time sanction to Lakshadweep for the bulk procurement of liquor from the Bevco warehouse and transportation of the same from Kochi or Beypore port to Bengaram Island , by relaxing the rules.

""It took years for them to spread this fear and vanished within seconds...In Parliament, I see the Prime Minsiter right up front and I can tell you that the idea of Mr Modi, 56-inch chest, direct connection with god, that’s all gone now, it’s is all history now...""Rahul Gandhi also shared insights from the period leading up to the elections, noting that the Congress party's bank accounts were frozen just three months before voting began.

IAF, however, has till now inducted only 35-36 of the first 40 Tejas Mark-1 jets ordered for Rs 8,802 crore due to delays by defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics(HAL).There is also a major ongoing delay in the delivery timeframe of the next 83 Tejas Mark-1A jets to IAF, contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore contract in Feb 2021. A major reason for this is the delay in supply of GE-F404 turbofan jet engines, which currently power the jets, to HAL by US firm General Electric.All this comes at a time when another Rs 67,000 crore contract for 97 more Tejas Mark-1A fighters is also being finalized. The Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council in Nov last year had given the preliminary nod or acceptance of necessity (AoN) for the acquisition of these 97 jets.India and the US, of course, are now also conducting the techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of GE-F414 jet engines by General Electric and HAL for the Tejas Mark-II fighters in India, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion.","The IAF, Army and Navy vice-chiefs took to the skies in indigenous Tejas fighters on Monday.

India's failure to indigenously produce aero-engines for fighters, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, has been a major problem over the years.

'Last person to advise on idea of India'

'Look at their 100-year history, it is hollow,' says Congress on RSS

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) on Monday trained its guns at the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi over his criticism of the ruling party in Texas. The Congress leader is on a three-day trip to US, where he said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) looks at India as one idea while Congress thinks of India as a multiplicity of many ideas.In a sharp retort, Union minister Giriraj Singh reacted to Rahul's remarks and accused him of going abroad only to defame India, saying that a 'traitor' cannot understand RSS and said that Rahul will have to take many births to understand the values and culture of the organisation.""If there is any technology to go to his grandmother and ask her about the role of RSS, then go and ask or look in the pages of history. To know about RSS, Rahul Gandhi will have to take many births. A traitor cannot understand RSS. Those who go abroad and criticize the country cannot know RSS,"" Singh said.""It seems that Rahul Gandhi goes abroad only to defame India. Rahul Gandhi will not be able to understand RSS in this birth. RSS is born from the values and culture of India,"" he added.Giriraj also asserted that the country has rejected the grand old party under the leadership of 'Yuvraj' Rahul Gandhi for the third time in the Lok Sabha elections.""The people of the country rejected Congress for the third time under the leadership of 'Yuvraj' Rahul Gandhi. India which used to import defence, in the form of 'Make in India' is now exporting it. India which used to import Rs 19 lakh crores in the country has reached Rs 80 lakh crores today,"" Singh said.""Instead of praising India, he is going abroad and abusing India and praising China, praising the enemy country. It seems like he is thriving on China's money, and they are going abroad and branding China. If PM Modi did not protect the Constitution, cases of treason should be registered against such people who go outside India and criticize India,"" he added.BJP national spokesperson Nalin Kohli also advised Rahul to choose his words in a manner that gives a complete picture. He also alleged that Rahul does not want to associate himself with anything that is part of the country's glorious past.""Rahul Gandhi is the leader of the opposition of the world's largest democracy so he has to choose his words in a manner that gives the complete correct picture. It is strange that he always finds some good examples of China and never finds a reason to look at it from India's point of view about what all has happened in terms of the relationship between India and China. He finds fault with the parliament's functioning and refers to it as a war zone. He fails to inform people that the opposition parties led by him somehow look for an opportunity or an excuse to disrupt parliament,"" Kohli said.""He raises questions about the RSS and its history. But he won't inform the rest of the world that India's history was taught in a skewed manner right up to PM Modi's government...He wouldn't even be seen on International Day of Yoga which is now observed across the world...It's almost as if Rahul Gandhi does not want to associate himself with anything that is part of India's glorious past. He has much to answer. It cannot be on a script given to him and then he would go out and tarnish India's image,"" he added.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla also criticised Rahul and said that he should be the last person to advise on Idea of India as his family imposed emergency and trampled upon constitutional rights.""Rahul Gandhi should be the last person advising us on what is the idea of India because his family and his party after the emergency once declared that 'India is Indira' and 'Indira is India',"" he said.""They should first apologise for comparing India to Indira Gandhi...The family that imposed an emergency, trampled upon constitutional rights, put the opposition in jail, changed the preamble of the constitution is advising us about the constitution,"" he added.Meanwhile, the Congress came in backed its leader's remark and claimed that nobody should waste their time knowing and understanding an organisation which doesn't have the courage to register itself.Congress leader Pawan Khera said, ""Why would anyone who is intelligent waste their time in understanding RSS? What is there to understand? Look at their 100-year history, it is hollow, they have worked against the country, hatched conspiracy against it, colluded with the British.""""Nobody would waste their time in knowing or understanding an organisation which doesn't have the courage to register itself, which doesn't make its membership register public, which doesn't make its accounts public; at least we won't do it. They roam around as the self-appointed 'thekedar' of country, religion, culture and our concern is that we have to save our country, religion, culture from RSS,"" he added.Earlier on Monday, Rahul said that the fear of the BJP and the Prime Minister Modi had vanished among the people of India immediately after the announcement of the Lok Sabha election results earlier this year.""The other thing that happened that was very beautiful, that in fact, I was amazed that it happened so quickly was that fear of the BJP vanished, disappeared, gone and we saw that immediately. Within minutes of the election result, nobody in India was scared of the BJP or the Prime Minister of India,"" Rahul said.Rahul also talked about what he thinks is the difference in the idea of India between the RSS and the Congress party. He said, ""The RSS believes that India is one idea and we believe that India is a multiplicity of ideas and we believe by the way, very much like the United States, we believe that everybody should be allowed to participate.""""Every single word that I said to you is in the Constitution. The foundation of modern India is the Constitution and what people understood in the election clearly and I saw it happening when I used to raise the constitution like this, people understood what I was saying. They were saying that the BJP is attacking our tradition, attacking our language, attacking our states, attacking our histories, and most importantly, what they understood was that anybody who is attacking the Constitution of India is also attacking our religious tradition,"" he added.Rahul arrived in Dallas, Texas, for a three-day US visit. The Congress MP was welcomed at the airport by Sam Pitroda, chairman of the Indian Overseas Congress, and members of the Indian diaspora.","Congress leader is on a three-day trip to US, where he said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) looks at India as one idea while Congress thinks of India as a multiplicity of many ideas.

NEW DELHI: A Monkeypox case was confirmed on Monday in a patient isolated with the disease symptoms in India, the central government has said, adding that it is not a part of the current public health emergency which is regarding 'clade 1' strain of Mpox The case is consistent with previous risk assessments and is being handled according to established protocols.Public health measures such as contact tracing and monitoring are actively being implemented to control the situation. Currently, there is no evidence of any broader risk to the public, it said in a statement.""The previously suspected case of Mpox (monkeypox) has been verified as a travel-related infection. Laboratory testing has confirmed the presence of Mpox virus of the West African clade 2 in the patient. This case is an isolated case, similar to the earlier 30 cases reported in India from July 2022 onwards, and is not a part of the current public health emergency (reported by WHO ) which is regarding clade 1 of mpox,"" the health ministry said.""The individual, a young male who recently traveled from a country experiencing ongoing Mpox transmission, is currently isolated at a designated tertiary care isolation facility. The patient remains clinically stable and is without any systemic illness or comorbidities,"" it added.Earlier, the Union health secretary Apurva Chandra issued an advisory to states and union territories regarding the precautionary measures, symptoms, and causes of Mpox.Chandra in the advisory asked the state/UTs to disseminate and take action on the updated CD-Alert on Mpox issued by NCDC which details surveillance strategy (including epidemiological case definitions, contact tracing etc.), list of laboratories operationalized to undertake testing, clinical management protocol, infection prevention and control practices as well as risk communication strategy.He also directed the states to review public health preparedness particularly at health facility level at the State and Districts by senior officials and identification of isolation facilities in hospitals for taking care of both suspect and confirmed cases, availability of required logistics and trained human resources in such facilities and augmentation plan. He also asked for orientation of all key stakeholders.Additionally, he in the advisory also said that while all States are requested to undertake appropriate activities to make communities aware about the disease, it is crucial that any undue panic amongst the masses is prevented.According to the advisory, Mpox primarily affects young males with a median age of 34 years, with the sexual mode of transmission being the most common, followed by person-to-person non-sexual contact. Approximately half of the cases with available information on their HIV status are reported to be in persons living with HIV. Common symptoms include rashes (including systemic or genital rash) and fever.Chandra further said that the Union ministry of health & family welfare shall continue to monitor the situation closely and will extend all requisite support to states and UTs.Since January 1, 2022, Mpox cases have been reported to the WHO from 121 member states across all six WHO regions. The WHO Mpox report dated September 3, 2024, provides global data up to July 31, 2024. A total of 102,997 laboratory-confirmed cases and 186 probable cases, including 223 deaths, have been reported to the WHO.In July 2024, 1,425 cases and six deaths were reported globally. More than half of these cases were from the African region (55%), followed by the American region (24%) and the European region (11%). The South-East Asia Region (SEAR) reported 1 per cent of the total cases.",A Monkeypox case was confirmed on Monday in a patient isolated with the disease symptoms in India.

Navdeep and coach Naval Singh

NEW DELHI: From enduring taunts about his dwarfism to achieving glory at the Paris Paralympics , Navdeep Singh 's journey is a tale of remarkable resilience. The 4 feet 4 inches tall para javelin sensation secured the gold medal in the F41 classification at the Paris Paralympic Games .After finishing fourth at the Tokyo Paralympics three years ago and claiming bronze at the 2024 World Para Athletics Championship, Navdeep was determined to change his fate this time.He stood proudly atop the podium, with tears in his eyes, as the Indian national anthem played and the tricolor was raised at the roaring Stade de France.Initially awarded the silver, Navdeep's medal was upgraded to gold after Iran’s Sadegh Beit Sayah was disqualified for repeatedly displaying an objectionable flag, violating the International Paralympic Committee’s rules, which prohibit political gestures.Sayah’s unsporting conduct led to his disqualification, allowing Navdeep to take his place as the champion.""I was so surprised when the red card was shown to the Iranian javelin thrower. He started crying. He was in tears and weeping. I also became so emotional that I went to him and hugged him. I consoled him. Until then, I didn’t know what exactly had happened and the reason behind this big decision,"" Navdeep told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview from Paris.For Navdeep, the gold medal is redemption for the heartbreak of finishing fourth at the Tokyo Paralympics.""When I was given the gold medal, I was so happy. Tokyo is in the past now, Paris is the present. I am really delighted that I could make my country proud. I’m really happy I could add one more gold medal to India's tally. People always remember gold,"" an elated Navdeep said.""My first throw was a foul. I looked at my coach, and he asked me to remain calm. In my second attempt, I threw 46-plus. I turned toward my coach and asked him how much I threw in my second attempt. He said 46-plus. I was amazed because I didn’t put much effort into it. It gave me so much spark and motivation to do even better. And then, the rest is history,"" he said.""I never imagined I would throw 47-plus, honestly. I don’t have any idea how I did this. Because during my training just before departing for Paris, I was throwing 41 or 42. But I don’t know how I managed to throw 47-plus,"" Navdeep added.Navdeep follows in the footsteps of two-time Olympic medalist Neeraj Chopra and believes that the technique of falling just before releasing the javelin gives a powerful boost, much like Neeraj does with his throws.Navdeep credits this technique to his coach, Naval Singh, who has been instrumental in shaping his career.""My coach, Naval Singh, has worked a lot with me. He has trained me for almost seven years. He has played a big role in my career. Whatever I am today, it’s because of him. He has made me an international-level javelin thrower. All the credit for my technique and foundation goes to him,"" Navdeep said.""Mera girna mera akhiri upay hota hai. Jab gir jata hun, wo throw acha jata hai [Falling is my last resort. When I fall, that throw goes well],"" (laugh) Navdeep said.Having just returned from Paris, coach Naval watched Navdeep's final with confidence, knowing his student would bring home a Paralympic medal.""I knew Navdeep was going to make me and India proud. He has done a lot of hard work. Navdeep ki technique Neeraj Chopra se bhi behtar hai (Navdeep's technique is even better than Neeraj Chopra's). If he were in able-bodied athletics, he would have done wonders. But we are all proud of Navdeep. This is just the start for him—he is going to break several records,"" a confident coach said.",Navdeep Singh secured the gold medal in the F41 classification at the Paris Paralympic Games.

Correlated Events

Distinct Activity

BENGALURU: In multiple “firsts”, India’s Chandrayaan-3 mission has detected more than 250 seismic signals on the Moon’s south polar region , including 50 distinct ones that have no correlation to the activity of the rover’s ( Pragyan ) movement or operations of other instruments but could be possibly linked to Moonquakes .This marks the first collection of seismic data from Moon’s southern polar region and the first such data anywhere on the lunar surface since the Apollo era.This experiment by Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA), a scientific instrument aboard Vikram lander , was conducted at the landing site of 69.37° South and 32.32° East.ILSA, which operated for 190 hours between Aug 24 and Sept 4, 2023, is the first instrument to record ground accelerations from the south polar region of Moon and the first on the lunar surface that employed sensors fabricated by silicon micromachining technology.The findings have been analysed and published by a group of Isro researchers in ICARUS , a scientific journal dedicated to the field of planetary science.The paper has been published by J John, V Thamarai, Teena Choudhary, MN Srinivasa, Ashwini Jambhalikar, MS Giridhar, Madan Mohan Mehra, Mayank Garg, KV Shila, Krishna Kummari, SP Karantha, Kalpana Arvind and KV Sriram, from Isro’s Laboratory for Electro-Optics Systems (LEOS) in Peenya, Bengaluru.LEOS director Sriram told TOI: “Of the more than 250 seismic events recorded, approximately 200 signals correlate to known activities involving Pragyan’s movements or the operation of scientific instruments, the 50 others do not have any explanation. There needs to be further studies to understand what may have caused these activities.”Researchers say the longest and relatively large amplitude (maximum extent of a vibration or oscillation, measured from the position of equilibrium) records from ILSA are those corresponding to Pragyan’s navigation. The longest continuous signal record lasts for 14 minutes.About 60 signals catalogued correspond to Pragyan’s movement controlled by ground commands. The rover that weighed about 25kg had six wheels and was driven with motors. It moved at a typical speed of 1 cm per second. The dynamics of the rover and the wheel-soil interaction had been a source of complex ground vibration signal input to ILSA.“As the distance of the rover from ILSA was increased, there had been a systematic reduction in the amplitude of the signal under normal roving conditions. For example, when the rover was away from the lander by around 7m, the average peak to peak amplitude was around 200 μg (microgravity). This amplitude was halved when the distance became 12m and was one order less when the separation was 40m,” the paper, accessed by TOI, reads.Researchers further said that any event that could be classified as deep quake or shallow quake was beyond the targeted objectives and design specifications of ILSA and that they were aware of the very low probability of occurrence of those classes of events during the one lunar day operation of the instrument.However, from the data investigated as a part of the paper, there are about 50 instances where the amplitude of output from the instrument is distinctly different from its normal background level.“From the mission command history, it was confirmed that any activity that can cause ground vibration was not performed during this timeframe,” the paper reads. Hence, researchers classified these as ‘uncorrelated events’.Among the 50 uncorrelated events, the maximum peak to peak amplitude of the signal is as high as 700 μg in certain instances. “The frequency content in the signals are spread over a wide range up to 50 Hz. The signals discussed here lasted only for a few seconds. Although several distinct signals lasting less than a couple of seconds are also observed, they are not included in the count reported in this paper,” the paper read.","India's Chandrayaan-3 mission has detected more than 250 seismic signals on the Moon’s south polar region.

A discussion on WWE and the wrestling world remains incomplete without mentioning the Indian-born superstar, The Great Khali. Born in Dhiraina, Himachal Pradesh, The Great Khali whose real name is Dalip Rana Singh is an Indian professional wrestler who achieved big success in WWE.He became famous for his great height (7 feet 1 inch tall) and incredible strength following his debut and as time passed by, he impressed the audiences, and his peers and achieved enormous popularity due to his notable achievements.The latter includes winning the prestigious WWE World Heavyweight Championship in 2007 which marks one of the biggest achievements in WWE.The wrestling legend engaged in numerous high-profile matches and faced off against some of the notable names such as John Cena, Triple H, Batista, The Undertaker, and more. Despite his success and popularity that emanates from his wrestling prowess, fans are eager to delve into the WWE star’s personal life , especially his dating and relationship status. He’s married to Harminder Kaur , and the pair live a seemingly blissful life. Let’s dive a little into the same.The wife of one of the tallest WWE legends, Harminder Kaur was born on January 12, 1972, into an Indian Punjabi family.

Today, Harminder is a homemaker and is acknowledged as a major force behind her husband’s success.While The Great Khali was making waves across WWE and Harminder was engaged in her professional pursuits, their families quietly arranged their marriage behind the scenes. Once the arrangements were made, the couple was informed of their decision. Both Khali and Harminder agreed to the union and tied the knot on February 27, 2014. Prior to marrying Harminder, there was no record of The Great Khali ever having dated anyone, making their marriage a significant chapter in their personal life.The Great Khali boasts a career that goes beyond the wrestling ring.

KOLKATA: CBI's probe into financial irregularities of RG Kar Hospital details how arrested ex-principal Sandip Ghosh and his cronies minted money from diverse sources, including manipulating students' results and appointing ""candidates of his choice"" as house staff - post-MBBS internships.In submissions to a special CBI court that remanded Ghosh in custody a few days ago, the agency said it suspected Ghosh ""surpassed the process and straightaway appointed house staff of his choice"" without ""adopting a transparent method"".The agency has dug into recruitments of 2022 and 2023.Doctors at RG Kar said they knew of no panel for house staff selections . According to CBI's court submissions, Ghosh had introduced a system of ""interviews"". A list of house staff was prepared by him and many meritorious students were left out. CBI officers have reasons to believe that scores from such ""fictitious interviews "" might have been added to the MBBS marks of the candidates picked against payments to Ghosh's cronies. The appointment orders only mention final marks.The corruption, CBI found, was even more deep-rooted and spread to other areas, including ""collusive bidding"" and ""bid rigging"" in tenders for hospital equipment and services. Investigators have come across fake companies, owned by Biplav Singha and his relatives, that took part in the tenders to help his firm Maa Tara Traders bag the contracts. Singha, alleged associate of Ghosh, was arrested along with the ex-principal.CBI investigations have led to more companies, M/s Baba Loknath and Tiasha Enterprises. Singha ran the two and other companies through his ""family members, staff and friends"" and participated in the RG Kar tender process.CBI's sleuths are also scanning how Ghosh's arrested guard Afsar Ali bagged a hospital canteen contract for Eshan Cafe, a company owned by the latter's wife Nargis. Ghosh allegedly gave the canteen deal through a ""pre-determined manner"".Investigators were also surprised to find that the bid amount by participating companies for the cafe was handwritten on the documents.Handwriting experts confirmed these were written by a single person.According to CBI, Ghosh had even returned the ""non-refundable caution money (for the bidding)"" to Eshan Cafe.","CBI's probe into financial irregularities of RG Kar Hospital details how arrested ex-principal Sandip Ghosh minted money from diverse sources.

Agonda meets Yorkshire in ICAR’s new climate-resilient pig,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/agonda-meets-yorkshire-in-icars-new-climate-resilient-pig/articleshow/113204967.cms,"Panaji:

TOI

The Goa-based ICAR–Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR-CCARI) will unveil its latest innovation next week — the Goya pig, a product of crossbreeding the Goan Agonda pig and the Large White Yorkshire .“This is a climate-resilient pig variety fully adaptable to coastal conditions, since it has the blood of both local and exotic breeds,” said ICAR-CCARI director Parvin Kumar .“The variety will be officially released this month,” he said.Developed through conventional breeding methods, this hybrid variety grows up to 85-90kg in ten months. In India, pigs are typically slaughtered at around 70 kg, a weight usually achieved within six months.The Goya exhibits impressive characteristics, including a high disease tolerance inherited from its Goan parentage and superior growth rates from its Yorkshire lineage.The variety was developed by the then-director of ICAR-CCARI, E B Chakurkar, along with co-developers Amiya Sahu and Gokuldas PP , who specialise in animal reproductive sciences.“Other crossbreeds and exotic pig breeds are susceptible to African swine flu, of which plenty of cases have been reported in South Goa in the past. The Agonda breed, however, proved to be resilient towards this disease. It was also stronger in productivity and adaptability,” saidGokuldas PP.The virus causes a haemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in domestic pigs.The Large White Yorkshire is well suited for Goan conditions and has a good growth rate and feed conversion ability under intensive care, owing to which it was selected to crossbreed with the Goan Agonda pig.The feeding regimen for the Goya includes a sequence of specialised rations like a starter feed until they’re 15-20 kg, grower feed up to 50 kg, and finisher feed to reach market weight.“The pork meat of this pig can very well be utilised for the Goan sausage,” said Gokuldas PP.had reported in March 2021 that a genetic study of five generations of the pig breed was carried out and the institute had proposed this variety to be released in the coastal areas.","The Goya pig is a product of crossbreeding the Goan Agonda pig and the Large White Yorkshire.

How did 358 migrants end up using same California address for US entry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-did-358-migrants-end-up-using-same-california-address-for-us-entry/articleshow/113208657.cms,"An independent report flagged that over 350 immigrants bound for the US border listed the same California address as their final destination—a four-bedroom home in the Central Valley. This address was used over an eight-month period by migrants seeking entry appointments through the US Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) app, CBP One.The report from the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) warned that the app, which has processed over 765,000 appointments since its launch 18 months ago, is vulnerable to security breaches.""Having an address in the United States is not a legal requirement to seek asylum,"" Nicole Elizabeth Ramos , director of Al Otro Lado 's border rights project said, as reported by Newsweek, adding that the app imposes an additional burden on asylum seekers by requiring one.The report highlighted seven frequently used addresses, with one Central California home listed as the final destination for 358 individuals, 266 of whom had different last names. The app’s limitations make it difficult to flag such patterns since CBP officers at one port of entry cannot access appointment data from other ports.Additionally, other security flaws were uncovered, including migrants creating multiple accounts to increase their chances of securing an appointment. One case involved an Armenian migrant submitting 466 registrations in a month. Ramos attributed this to desperation, noting, ""If we were told our lives depended on an algorithm, of course, we would be involved in multiple accounts.""CBP responded to the OIG’s concerns by stating that new security measures were implemented earlier this year, including cross-border data sharing. However, the OIG has not closed the matter, awaiting further evidence of action from CBP.Newsweek also reported Ramos’ plea for changes, warning that without them, migrants could fall into the hands of the very people they are fleeing from or even die while waiting for appointments.","Over 350 immigrants bound for the US border listed the same California address as their final destination.

Dixon is likely to invest around Rs 250 crore for the project, though Vachani didn't give any immediate confirmation. Dixon already manufactures computers for Acer, but these are being made at its facility in Noida.For HP, the partnership deepens the company's commitment in India, and its localisation efforts. Ipsita Dasgupta , the company's India MD, has already spoken about the intent to manufacture and source more from India as she expects the computer market to double over the next five years.""I believe the PLI scheme has been a great enabler. We are participating in it because it creates a bridge for the development of the sector from a manufacturing perspective. We are quite bullish that the ecosystem will develop over the next few years, and that too pretty quickly. In the intervening period, the PLI is a solid programme.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

OSIRIS-APEX: Nasa's spacecraft to study the asteroid

A cosmic relic

What's in a name?

In a cosmic drama unfolding before our eyes, the asteroid 99942 Apophis , dubbed the "" God of Chaos "" for its menacing potential, is making headlines once more. As Earth prepares for an unprecedented celestial rendezvous in 2029, Nasa 's latest revelations promise to keep our eyes on the skies.Discovered in 2004 by astronomers at Kitt Peak National Observatory, Apophis quickly rose to notoriety.With a diameter of approximately 1,100 feet (335 meters), it was initially deemed one of the most dangerous near-Earth objects. The asteroid was predicted to come perilously close to Earth in 2029, sparking fears of a potential collision. This forecast, however, has been revised as astronomers tracked Apophis with increasing precision.The breakthrough came in March 2021. Using the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex and the Green Bank Telescope, scientists gathered high-resolution radar data that allowed them to accurately map Apophis's orbit.Apophis, classified as an S-type asteroid, is composed of silicate materials mixed with nickel and iron. Its shape, resembling a ""peanut,"" adds to the intrigue. Scientists are keen to understand its rotation and structural dynamics, including its potential for ""asteroid quakes"" due to gravitational interactions.On April 13, 2029, Apophis will pass within 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) of Earth's surface—closer than the geostationary satellites that orbit the planet. This close approach will offer a rare, unfiltered view of the asteroid for those in the Eastern Hemisphere. ""Although Apophis made a recent close approach with Earth, it was still nearly 10.6 million miles away,"" explained JPL scientist Marina Brozovic. ""We were able to acquire incredibly precise information about its distance, setting up a wonderful science opportunity.""The recent surge in attention is largely due to reports of Nasa broadcasting a live feed of Apophis , offering a rare glimpse at an asteroid of this magnitude as it hurls through space. However, this claim is incorrect.Although NASA and other astronomers are actively monitoring Apophis due to its close approach to Earth in 2029, there is no continuous live feed dedicated to tracking the asteroid.The potential changes in its trajectory can be tracked on Nasa's official website Experts, however, are reassuring the public that despite the asteroid's nickname, the chances of a collision remain incredibly slim — at least this time around.“Apophis is not on a direct collision course with Earth in 2029,” said Dr Sarah Thompson, a leading astrophysicist at Nasa, according to media reports. “But we’re watching closely, as space objects can have unpredictable behavior over time.”“It’s a one-in-a-million shot, but it’s there,” Dr Thompson added. “We’re using every resource we have to calculate its movements and ensure we’re not taken by surprise.”However, Davide Farnocchia of Nasa’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies, said the extensive analysis confirmed that the asteroid poses no threat for at least the next century. ""A 2068 impact is not in the realm of possibility anymore,"" said Farnocchia.As per media reports, if Apophis were to ever strike Earth, the results would be catastrophic. An impact from an asteroid of this size would release energy equivalent to over 1,200 megatons of TNT—enough to flatten entire cities. The event would have both local and global effects, from tsunamis to severe atmospheric disruptions.In anticipation of this close encounter, Nasa has repurposed its OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, now dubbed OSIRIS-APEX, for a detailed study of Apophis. After successfully completing its mission to collect samples from asteroid Bennu in 2023, OSIRIS-APEX will fly by Apophis on April 23, 2029, and then conduct an 18-month investigation. The spacecraft will map Apophis’s surface, analyze its composition, and observe any changes triggered by the flyby.Formed over 4.6 billion years ago, Apophis is a remnant from the early solar system. Its journey from the main asteroid belt to its current near-Earth orbit was shaped by planetary forces, particularly Jupiter's gravity.Named after the ancient Egyptian demon of chaos, Apophis continues to captivate scientists and the public alike. As we prepare for the asteroid’s close approach, it reminds us of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of our solar system.","On April 13, 2029, Apophis will pass within 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) of Earth's surface.

Exploring new worlds and immersing yourself in diverse cultures and traditions are among the many joys of international travel. However, amidst the excitement of new adventures, it's crucial to travel responsibly. A key aspect of responsible travel is ensuring you have travel insurance , a necessity in many countries.Travelling abroad involves more than just booking flights and securing visas.Every country has its own regulations, which travellers must comply with, often requiring significant time and effort for paperwork related to health conditions and documentation. The COVID-19 pandemic led many countries to impose stricter entry requirements, such as negative test results and travel health insurance. Even in nations where travel insurance isn’t mandatory, it is a wise choice. It offers protection against emergencies and can facilitate a smoother visa application process. Many countries now require travel insurance to manage healthcare costs and financially safeguard both tourists and hosts.Travelling internationally requires more than just flight bookings and visas—each destination has its own regulations that travellers must adhere to, often involving extensive paperwork related to health and documentation. Another essential requirement is travel health insurance, especially in case of illness during your trip. Many countries made COVID-19 insurance mandatory to protect visitors from potential health emergencies.Even in destinations where travel insurance isn’t required, having it is highly recommended. Unforeseen events, such as trip cancellations, medical emergencies, or lost luggage, can cause both financial and emotional strain. Adequate coverage provides peace of mind and better preparedness for unexpected situations.Tailored to meet the specific needs of an individual on their journey.A policy designed to protect the trips of two or more people travelling together, often referred to as group travel insurance.Provides financial protection for students travelling abroad to pursue higher education.A specialised travel plan that addresses the unique needs of senior citizens during their overseas trips.If you're planning to visit the following countries, purchasing travel insurance is mandatory:Travel insurance provides financial security against unexpected incidents while abroad, such as trip cancellations, lost or stolen items, and emergency medical expenses. With insurance, travellers can handle unforeseen situations without the stress of covering costs out of pocket.Travel insurance also protects host nations from financial losses. Traditionally, if a traveller fell ill or got injured, the host country bore the medical expenses. With travel insurance, these costs are shifted to the insurance provider, easing the financial burden on the host country. COVID-19 The global COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of health and safety measures. Many countries now require travel insurance to ensure that tourists are financially covered in case they contract the virus during their stay.Travel insurance can significantly impact the visa application process. In some cases, it is even a visa eligibility requirement. If you cause injury or damage during your travels, travel insurance ensures that affected locals receive fair compensation without immediate out-of-pocket expenses from you. Having travel insurance can also streamline the visa process, demonstrating to authorities that you are a prepared and responsible traveller, aware of potential risks and taking steps to mitigate them.","Travelling abroad involves more than just booking flights and securing visas.

Why are workers in Japan turning to paid services to leave their jobs?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/why-are-workers-in-japan-turning-to-paid-services-to-leave-their-jobs/articleshow/113201498.cms,"The growing demand for resignation services



The struggles of resigning in Japan



Challenges with employers and company culture

In Japan, where workplace loyalty and long hours are deeply ingrained in the culture, resigning from a job can be an emotionally taxing and challenging process. To address this, businesses like Exit and Albatross have stepped in, offering services to help employees resign from their jobs with minimal stress. These companies handle everything from informing employers of the resignation to managing final work-related formalities.Exit, one of the pioneers in this niche market, was launched in 2017.Since then, it has assisted around 10,000 people annually with their resignations. For a fee of 20,000 yen (approximately Rs 11,600), Exit handles the entire resignation process—making the initial call to the employer, discussing the last working day, and collecting company property such as uniforms and technology.Inspired by Exit's success, other companies like Albatross and Momuri have entered the market, offering similar services. Albatross manages the resignation process by contacting the employer and specifying the employee's last working day. Momuri, which translates to ""I can't do this anymore,"" has also gained popularity, reflecting the widespread difficulties workers face in Japan.The demand for resignation services is driven by the difficulties where many Japanese workers encounter when trying to quit their jobs. The pressure from employers can be immense, with some employees reporting that resignation letters have been torn up or that they have faced harassment when attempting to leave. Exit's co-founder, Toshiyuki Niino, explains that in Japan, people are not typically educated to debate or express opinions, making the resignation process particularly stressful.The resignation difficulties often stem from poor workplace conditions. Employees frequently deal with difficult bosses, unpaid overtime, and restrictions on using paid time off. While most bosses accept resignations when handled by a third party, some situations require legal negotiations. According to Shinji Tanimoto, CEO of Albatross, legal involvement is sometimes necessary when employers are reluctant to let employees go.Interestingly, as these services become more popular, some Japanese companies have started reaching out to quitting agencies for referrals when they need to fill positions, signalling a shift in the traditional employment practices in Japan.","In Japan, where workplace loyalty and long hours are deeply ingrained in the culture, resigning from a job can be an emotionally taxing and challenging process.

"'America's no. 1 condom' allegedly contains cancer-causing 'forever chemicals,' lawsuit claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/americas-no-1-trojan-condom-allegedly-contains-cancer-causing-forever-chemicals-lawsuit-claims/articleshow/113207169.cms,"Study reveals PFAS contamination in condoms and lubricants

PFAS absorption through skin higher than previously thought

A new lawsuit claims that Trojan condoms, marketed as ""America's No. 1 Condom,"" contain toxic ""forever chemicals"" linked to cancer. Plaintiff Matthew Goodman filed the proposed class action in Manhattan federal court, alleging that the condoms contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are harmful to health. PFAS , known for their persistence in the environment and human body, are used in many consumer products for their non-stick and water-resistant properties.Goodman claims lab tests of Trojan Ultra Thin condoms revealed the presence of organic fluorine, a marker for PFAS, and that these chemicals are not disclosed on the packaging. He argues that had he known about the presence of these chemicals, he would not have purchased the product or would have paid significantly less. The lawsuit seeks at least $5 million in damages for customers nationwide who purchased Trojan condoms.PFAS exposure has been linked to several health issues, including cancer, low birth weights, and reduced immune response. Church & Dwight, the manufacturer, has not yet responded to requests for comment following the lawsuit.A study by consumer advocacy group Mamavation has uncovered potential contamination of condoms and lubricants with PFAS, or ""forever chemicals."" The EPA-certified lab testing found traces of PFAS in 14% of the 29 products tested, including Trojan Ultra Thin condoms. The tests detected organic fluorine, a sign of PFAS, in 3 out of 25 condom samples and 1 out of 4 lubricants. These chemicals are widely used for their water, oil, and stain-resistant properties but are persistent and toxic.The contamination is believed to stem from manufacturing processes, where PFAS may be unintentionally introduced into the products. Linda Birnbaum , a scientist and former director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, raised concerns about exposure in sensitive areas of the body, saying, ""The vagina and penis are highly vascular areas, making them more vulnerable to the effects of toxic chemicals.""Mamavation has called for the condom industry to take action to remove PFAS from these products, stressing that the full health risks of exposure in intimate areas are not yet known. Consumers are encouraged to seek safer alternatives while manufacturers work on addressing potential contamination.Recent research, titled Dermal bioavailability of perfluoroalkyl substances using in vitro 3D human skin equivalent models, has shown that perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can be absorbed through the skin at higher levels than previously believed. In the study, human skin models were exposed to 17 different PFAS compounds, and certain chemicals, such as perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), had the highest absorption rates, at 58.9% and 48.7%, respectively.Shorter-chain PFAS, particularly those with carbon chains of eight or fewer atoms, showed greater absorption compared to longer-chain variants, which tend to accumulate in the skin rather than being directly absorbed. The study also suggested that factors like skin pH could influence how PFAS penetrate the skin. Even in ionised forms, PFAS can still permeate the skin, indicating that dermal exposure may be a significant source of PFAS absorption.","Plaintiff Matthew Goodman filed the proposed class action in Manhattan federal court. Goodman claims lab tests of Trojan Ultra Thin condoms revealed the presence of organic fluorine, a marker for PFAS. The lawsuit seeks at least $5 million in damages for customers nationwide who purchased Trojan condoms.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113207435,imgsize-694121,width-400,resizemode-4/113207435.jpg"
New US antitrust trial focuses on Google's online ad dominance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-us-antitrust-trial-focuses-on-googles-online-ad-dominance/articleshow/113204932.cms,"One month after a judge declared Google's search engine an illegal monopoly, the tech giant faces another antitrust lawsuit that threatens to break up the company, this time over its advertising technology. The justice department , joined by a coalition of states, and Google each made opening statements Monday to a federal judge who will decide whether Google holds a monopoly over online advertising technology.The regulators contend that Google built, acquired and maintains a monopoly over the technology that matches online publishers to advertisers. Dominance over the software on both the buy side and the sell side of the transaction enables Google to keep as much as 36 cents on the dollar when it brokers sales between publishers and advertisers, the govt contends in court papers. They allege that Google also controls the ad exchange market, which matches the buy side to the sell side. ""One monopoly is bad enough. But a trifecta of monopolies is what we have here,"" justice department lawyer Julia Tarver Wood said.In her opening statement, Google lawyer Karen Dunn said the govt's case is based on an internet of yesteryear. The company says the case is improperly focused on display ads and banner ads that load on web pages accessed through a desktop computer and fails to take into account consumers' migration to mobile apps and the boom in ads placed on social media sites.As per Google's annual reports, revenue has actually declined in recent years for Google Networks , the division that includes services like AdSense and Google Ad Manager that are at the heart of the case, from $31.7 billion in 2021 to $31.3 billion in 2023,The Virginia case comes on the heels of Google's defeat over its search engine, which generates the majority of its $307 billion in annual revenue. A judge in the district of Columbia declared the search engine a monopoly, maintained in part by tens of billions of dollars Google pays each year to companies to lock in Google as the default search engine.

'Inspired attacks across the world'

Facing serious charges

The US department of justice ( DOJ ) announced criminal charges against two alleged leaders of a white supremacist group, the Terrorgram Collective, accusing them of inciting attacks against Black, Jewish, LGBTQ people, and immigrants to provoke a race war. Dallas Humber , 34, and Matthew Allison , 37, were arrested on Friday and face a 15-count indictment for soliciting hate crimes, the murder of federal officials, and providing material support to terrorists.According to the indictment unsealed in Sacramento, California, the Terrorgram Collective operated on the social media platform Telegram, where they encouraged white supremacist violence and sought to destabilize the US by targeting government officials and critical infrastructure. ""Today's arrests are a warning that committing hate-fueled crimes in the darkest corners of the internet will not hide you,"" said Attorney General Merrick Garland. ""We will hold you accountable.""The group’s ideology, known as white supremacist accelerationism, promotes the belief that societal collapse is necessary to establish a white ethnostate. The indictment alleges that Humber and Allison led the group in producing propaganda videos and publications promoting violent actions, including bias-motivated attacks and terrorist attacks on government infrastructure.Dallas Humber and Matthew Allison , leaders of the Terrorgram Collective, meticulously planned a series of violent acts to advance their white supremacist ideology. They aimed to incite a race war and destabilize the US by targeting government infrastructure and high-profile officials. Their strategy involved detailed instructions on how to execute attacks on federal buildings, energy facilities, and individuals deemed “high-value targets” based on race, religion, or other identifiers. By using the Telegram platform, they disseminated propaganda, created hit lists, and guided followers on carrying out bias-motivated and terrorist attacks.""Attacks on “high-value targets” — like politicians and government officials — whose murders Terrorgram believes would sow chaos and further accelerate the government’s downfall,"" the DOJ said.The Terrorgram Collective's influence extended far beyond the US, inspiring violent acts around the world. Their propaganda and guidance led to real-world attacks, including a deadly shooting outside an LGBT bar in Slovakia, a planned assault on energy facilities in New Jersey, and a stabbing near a mosque in Turkey. These incidents underscore the group's ability to incite violence globally, demonstrating how extremist ideologies can motivate and direct individuals to commit acts of terror and hatred across international borders. The widespread impact of their actions highlights the urgent need for global cooperation in combating such extremist threats.The charges against Humber and Allison include conspiracy, soliciting hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials, doxing, threatening communications, and distributing bomb-making instructions. If convicted, they each face a maximum penalty of 220 years in prison. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke reiterated the federal government’s resolve to combat hate crimes, especially as extremist groups increasingly turn to online platforms. ""The Justice Department is committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans,"" she said.The case remains under investigation by the FBI's Sacramento and Salt Lake City offices, with support from multiple law enforcement agencies. The DOJ’s Civil Rights and National Security Divisions are leading the prosecution.","Dallas Humber, 34, and Matthew Allison, 37, were arrested on Friday and face a 15-count indictment for soliciting hate crimes, the murder of federal officials, and providing material support to terrorists.

Petroleum: Blue water economy: Massive oil and gas discovery in Pakistan's water,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/blue-water-economy-massive-oil-and-gas-discovery-in-pakistans-water/articleshow/113154434.cms,"A significant deposit of petroleum and natural gas has been discovered within Pakistan's territorial waters, following a detailed three-year survey carried out in collaboration with a friendly nation. The discovery could potentially offer a drastic boost to the nation's economy, according to a Pakistani senior security official quoted by DawnNewsTV.The official explained that the survey has successfully identified the location of the reserves, and relevant government bodies have been informed.These resources, located in the depths of Pakistani waters, represent a critical step towards capitalising what the official referred to as the "" blue water economy .""While this discovery could lead to a major boost for Pakistan’s energy sector, the process of exploration is still in its early stages.The work of digging wells and actually getting oil out could take several years. The official also talked about the potential of the blue water economy, pointing out that valuable minerals and elements could be extracted from the ocean, providing additional economic benefits for Pakistan.Estimates suggest that this discovery could be among the world’s largest oil and gas reserves , potentially placing Pakistan as the holder of the fourth-largest deposit globally.Venezuela currently leads in terms of oil reserves, with approximately 3.4 billion barrels, followed by countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Canada, and Iraq. The US is also notable for holding the most significant untapped shale oil reserves.In an interview with DawnNewsTV, Muhammad Arif, a former member of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) said that while the discovery is a positive development, there is no guarantee the reserves will be as large or easily recoverable as initially hoped.He said, ""If this is a gas reserve, it can replace LNG imports and if these are oil reserves, we can substitute imported oil.""The significant financial investment needed to explore offshore oil and gas reserves, estimating the cost at around $5 billion just for exploration, further claimed Arif.","A significant deposit of petroleum and natural gas has been discovered within Pakistan's territorial waters.
