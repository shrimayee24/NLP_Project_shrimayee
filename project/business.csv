IT Act

relief for social media intermediaries'

NEW DELHI: In a landmark verdict, Supreme Court on Monday ruled that mere viewing of child pornographic material on the internet is also an offence under Section 15 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and provisions of Information Technology Act, thus considerably expanding the scope of the two laws through purposive interpretation.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justice J B Pardiwala said, ""Any act of viewing, distributing or displaying of any child pornographic material...over the internet without any actual or physical possession or storage of such material in any device or in any form or manner would also amount to 'possession' in terms of Sec 15 of Pocso Act .""The verdict settled conflicting high court verdicts and accepted senior advocate H S Phoolka's argument on behalf of NGO 'Just Rights for Children Alliance' to set aside an ""egregiously erroneous"" order of Madras HC, which quashed a Pocso case against a porn-addict, saying he had not circulated it.In a significant step to check proliferation of child porn on the internet, SC Monday said social media intermediaries cannot claim exemption, or 'safe harbour', under IT Act without deleting such offensive videos, images and reporting about this to police as per Pocso Act mandate.Section 79 of IT Act provides 'safe harbour' to intermediaries, that is non-liability for third-party information, data or communication links made available or hosted by them, if they follow the prescribed due diligence. Pocso Act places an obligation on them to not only report offences thereunder but hand over material, including source from which such material originated, to the special juvenile police unit or the local police or cyber crime portal.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice J B Pardiwala referred to a MoU between National Crime Records Bureau under home ministry and National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a US-based NGO, which requires all social media intermediaries to report cases of child abuse and exploitation to NCMEC for forwarding it to state police concerned for necessary action.The bench expressed concern that intermediaries only complied with the requirement under the MoU but did not report child abuse and exploitation cases to local authorities as mandated under Pocso Act. ""An intermediary cannot claim exemption from liability under Section 79 of IT Act for any third-party information, data or communication links made available or hosted by it, unless due diligence is conducted by it and compliance is made of these provisions of Pocso Act,"" the bench said.""Social media intermediaries, in addition to reporting the commission or the likely apprehension of commission of any offence under Pocso Act to NCMEC is also obligated to report the same to authorities specified under Section 19 of Pocso Act, ie special juvenile police unit or local police,"" it said.The bench cautioned courts against showing any leniency or leeway in offences under Section 21 of Pocso Act, ""particularly to schools/educational institutions, special homes, children's homes, shelter homes, hostels, remand homes, jails etc who failed to discharge their obligation of reporting the commission or apprehension of commission of any offence or instance of child abuse or exploitation under Pocso Act"".",The verdict settled conflicting high court verdicts and accepted senior advocate H S Phoolka's argument on behalf of NGO 'Just Rights for Children Alliance' The bench expressed concern that intermediaries only complied with the requirement under the MoU but did not report child abuse and exploitation cases.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

Last year, the withdrawal started on Sept 25. The monsoon season technically ends on Sept 30, but the withdrawal process continues till October 15.As predicted by the IMD, the overall four-month monsoon season (June-Sept) is expected to end with ‘above normal’ rainfall. It means the monsoon is expected to be in the category of 105-110% of the long period average (LPA). The cumulative (June 1-Sept 23) rainfall as on Monday recorded over 5% more than the ‘normal’ rainfall of the period, even as the first month of the season (June) recorded 11% deficit.The monsoon onset over Kerala and most parts of northeast happened this year simultaneously on May 30 against its normal date of June 1 and June 5 respectively, and covered the entire country by July 2 - six days before its normal date (July 8) of covering the entire India.Normally, monsoon covers the entire India in 38 days (June 1-July 8).

It was the third consecutive year when the monsoon covered the entire country by July 2.Besides farming activities, water and hydro-power management also depends on the timing of onset, duration of coverage and withdrawal of the monsoon. Backed by ‘above normal’ rainfall, the acreage of Kharif (summer sown) crops in the country has already exceeded the normal (average of last five years) acreage of the sowing season with the sown area under paddy, coarse cereals, oilseeds and sugarcane reporting higher coverage signalling good output in the 2024-25 crop year.Sowing data, released by the agriculture ministry on Monday, shows that the overall sown area as on last Friday stand at around 1105 lakh hectares which was 8 lakh hectares more than the ‘normal’ acreage and 16 lakh hectares (1.5%) more than the overall acreage of Kharif crops during the corresponding period last year.","Monsoon on Monday started withdrawing from some parts of West Rajasthan and Kutch.

Amid an air of despondency over the failure of UN and the multilateral system in meeting global challenges, notably the ongoing conflicts, PM Modi on Monday once again stressed the need for ""reforms in global institutions"", saying these are essential for worldwide peace and development.While he did not mention Gaza or Ukraine in his speech, Modi said the ""success of humanity lies in our collective strength, not in the battlefield"".Addressing UN's 'Summit of the Future' in New York, the PM said ""reform is the key to relevance"", adding, ""Permanent membership of the G20 for African Union at the summit in Delhi was an important step in this direction.""As he highlighted India's record in pulling people out of poverty, and its readiness to share the experience with Global South, Modi said a human-centric approach must be accorded highest priority in any deliberation on global future.While prioritising sustainable development , PM Modi said the global community must ensure human welfare and food and health security.Modi also raised the issue of terrorism in his address, saying while on the one hand the menace posed a serious threat to global peace and security, on the other, areas like cyber, maritime and space are emerging as new theatres of conflict. ""On all these issues, I will stress that global action must match global ambition,"" said the PM.Modi emphasised the need for balanced regulation at the global level for the safe and responsible use of technology, saying the world needs global digital governance which ensures that national sovereignty and integrity are upheld.The PM said that digital public infrastructure should be a bridge, not a barrier for global good.

relief for

social media intermediaries

'

NEW DELHI: In a landmark verdict, Supreme Court on Monday ruled that mere viewing of child pornographic material on the internet is also an offence under Section 15 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and provisions of Information Technology Act, thus considerably expanding the scope of the two laws through purposive interpretation.A bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justice J B Pardiwala said, ""Any act of viewing, distributing or displaying of any child pornographic material...over the internet without any actual or physical possession or storage of such material in any device or in any form or manner would also amount to 'possession' in terms of Sec 15 of Pocso Act .""The verdict settled conflicting high court verdicts and accepted senior advocate H S Phoolka's argument on behalf of NGO 'Just Rights for Children Alliance' to set aside an ""egregiously erroneous"" order of Madras HC, which quashed a Pocso case against a porn-addict, saying he had not circulated it.In a significant step to check proliferation of child porn on the internet, SC Monday said social media intermediaries cannot claim exemption, or 'safe harbour', under IT Act without deleting such offensive videos, images and reporting about this to police as per Pocso Act mandate.Section 79 of IT Act provides 'safe harbour' to intermediaries, that is non-liability for third-party information, data or communication links made available or hosted by them, if they follow the prescribed due diligence. Pocso Act places an obligation on them to not only report offences thereunder but hand over material, including source from which such material originated, to the special juvenile police unit or the local police or cyber crime portal.A bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice J B Pardiwala referred to a MoU between National Crime Records Bureau under home ministry and National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a US-based NGO, which requires all social media intermediaries to report cases of child abuse and exploitation to NCMEC for forwarding it to state police concerned for necessary action.The bench expressed concern that intermediaries only complied with the requirement under the MoU but did not report child abuse and exploitation cases to local authorities as mandated under Pocso Act. ""An intermediary cannot claim exemption from liability under Section 79 of IT Act for any third-party information, data or communication links made available or hosted by it, unless due diligence is conducted by it and compliance is made of these provisions of Pocso Act,"" the bench said.""Social media intermediaries, in addition to reporting the commission or the likely apprehension of commission of any offence under Pocso Act to NCMEC is also obligated to report the same to authorities specified under Section 19 of Pocso Act, ie special juvenile police unit or local police,"" it said.The bench cautioned courts against showing any leniency or leeway in offences under Section 21 of Pocso Act, ""particularly to schools/educational institutions, special homes, children's homes, shelter homes, hostels, remand homes, jails etc who failed to discharge their obligation of reporting the commission or apprehension of commission of any offence or instance of child abuse or exploitation under Pocso Act"".",The verdict settled conflicting high court verdicts and accepted senior advocate H S Phoolka's argument on behalf of NGO 'Just Rights for Children Alliance' The bench expressed concern that intermediaries only complied with the requirement under the MoU but did not report child abuse and exploitation cases to local authorities.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113613574,imgsize-168066,width-400,resizemode-4/113613574.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India has reported its first case of Monkeypox (Mpox) caused by the fast-spreading Clade 1B strain of the virus. Last month, WHO declared Mpox a disease of international concern.Health ministry sources said the strain has been found in a patient from Kerala who returned from Dubai recently. ""The patient is stable, and contact tracing to identify any potential spread of the disease is being carried out,"" a source in the ministry said.""There is no indication of any widespread risk to the public at this time.""""Unlike influenza or Covid-19, Mpox is not airborne,"" a ministry official said. ""It spreads mostly through unprotected close physical contact. Sexual transmission is also an important mode of spread. In addition to that, it can spread from contact with infected material from blisters and scabs of a patient.""The infected fluid from blisters and scabs of a patient can contaminate material such as bedding,"" said a health ministry official. ""Therefore, maintaining hygiene is important. Another mode of transmission is through caregivers who are not using personal protective measures.""Mpox cases have been reported in India earlier as well. From 2022 to 2024, officials said, more than 30 cases of the disease have been reported from various parts of the country, mostly involving people with a history of travel to African countries, where the disease is widespread.""All mpox cases reported earlier were caused by the Clade II strain of the virus. This one from Kerala is the first case where the infection has been caused by Clade 1B which is known to be more transmissible and has a higher fatality rate as compared to Clade II,"" an official said.Recently, a case of Mpox caused by the Clade II strain of the virus was detected in a 26-year-old resident of Haryana's Hisar. He was isolated at Lok Nayak Hospital for a few days and discharged. A health ministry source said public health measures, including contact tracing and monitoring, are actively in place to ensure the situation is contained.","India has reported its first case of Monkeypox (Mpox) caused by the fast- spreading Clade 1B strain of the virus.

loom as govt pushes for ONOP

The Election Commission , in its submissions to the Kovind committee on ' one nation one election ', said conducting simultaneous polls across the country in 2029 would require Rs 7,951 crore, reports Bharti Jain. It sought a ""definite lead time"" before polls are synchronised as logistical requirements would go up enormously - from electoral rolls to EVMs and movement of security personnel.EC's inputs sent to the Law Commission in March 2023 - iterated in its Jan 19, 2024 letter to the Kovind panel - said the number of polling stations across the country would have to go up to 13.6 lakh in 2029.It estimated a shortfall of 26.5 lakh ballot units, 17.8 lakh control units and 17.8 lakh VVPATs.New Delhi: Apart from the challenge of getting the numbers to push through constitutional amendments for 'One Nation One Election', the govt also has to tackle several logistical issues, including regularisation of electoral rolls for panchayat polls.From electoral rolls to electronic voting machines and movement of personnel, the logistical requirements are enormous, sources said. In its submissions to the Kovind committee, Election Commission had sought a ""definite lead time"", while projecting funds requirement for the exercise in 2029 at Rs 7,951 crore.While electoral rolls for assembly and Lok Sabha polls are streamlined and a rigorous process is adopted in preparing them, the process for local body polls need to be streamlined, govt officials said, days after the Union cabinet accepted the recommendations of the committee led by former President Ram Nath Kovind on holdingsimultaneous elections .As per EC's inputs sent to the Law Commission in March 2023 - which it had reiterated in its letter dated Jan 19, 2024, to the Kovind committee - the number of polling stations across the country would have to be increased to around 13.6 lakh in 2029, requiring the deployment of 53.8 lakh ballot units (BUs), 38.7 lakh control units (CUs) and 41.6 lakh voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPATs).EC stated that while 30.8 lakh BUs, 22.1 lakh CUs and 23.8 lakh would be available for synchronised polls in the 2029 general election cycle, 3.6 lakh BUs and 1.25 lakh CUs would have completed their life and would need to be phased out. It had projected a shortfall of 26.5 lakh BUs, 17.8 lakh CUs and 17.8 lakh VVPATs.Given disruptions in the supply chain for semiconductors, the poll panel had highlighted this as a concern, and had called for ramping up the pace and capacity of production.Also stating that EVM models were regularly upgraded by the technical expert committee, with three models being developed in the past 20 years, the commission said it may be a possibility that the next generation EVM may be launched in the interim, posing a challenge as ""the entire magnitude of EVMs/VVPATs for simultaneous elections have to be manufactured afresh"".EC had also projected a major rise in manpower requirement in the event of simultaneous polls, saying that more polling personnel including the presiding officer will be needed at each polling station. It said additional staff would be required for first-level checks, transportation, security, storage and wider law and order requirements.Predicting a 50% rise in deployment of central forces in the event of synchronised polls, EC had said over 4.7 lakh personnel would be required if they are conducted in 2019. Though EC did not predict the requirement for the 2029 simultaneous polls, working with the same 50% rise, it could be almost 7 lakh security personnel. EC also said an additional 800 warehouses would be required for EVM/VVPAT storage.","The Election Commission said conducting simultaneous polls across the country in 2029 would require Rs 7,951 crore.

Centre to formulate guidelines to deal with ‘health-washing’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-to-formulate-guidelines-to-deal-with-health-washing/articleshow/113608850.cms,"NEW DELHI: Centre will soon formulate guidelines to deal with “health-washing”, amid a growing trend of companies making misleading claims to promote their products as more healthy by advertising that they contain multigrains, natural extracts, and are sugar free. In several cases, such products cost more.Consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare said Monday that the issue of “health-washing” has come to the department’s notice, and it will start working on formulating norms to ensure consumers do not get misled.She said guidelines for prohibiting “green-washing” and misleading advertisements by coaching centres are in the final stage, and will be released soon. The department is also carrying out consultation on prohibition of surrogate advertisements to protect consumers.“Green washing” refers to companies or entities making misleading claims about how environmentally friendly their products, services, or operations are, while “surrogate ads” are marketing techniques that indirectly promote brands and products, such as tobacco and alcohol, which are banned from advertising.There have been instances of alcohol and gutkha manufacturers promoting their brands through mineral water, playing cards and music CDs, and paan masala.These violations fall under misleading advertisements of the Consumer Protection Act. As per the law, resorting to misleading advertisements can attract a penalty of up to Rs 50 lakh and a maximum of five years in jail.Talking to reporters on the achievements of the first 100 days of the Modi govt, Khare said the department also wantse-commerce companies to stop selling banned and unsafe items through their websites.It has started nudging them to sign a “safety pledge” to stop promotion and selling of such items through their portals.As per the draft pledge, e-commerce companies will be expected to recall any hazardous or unsafe items being sold on their platform within 36 hours of being informed. “They also have to cooperate with government officials to identify the seller who is selling unsafe goods,” Khare said.The department referred to global best practices such as in the European Union, Japan, Australia, South Korea and Canada while preparing the draft norms. Khare said a panel with members from major e-commerce platforms, voluntary consumer associations, industry bodies and national law universities is expected to submit its report in two weeks.","“Green washing” refers to companies or entities making misleading claims about how environmentally friendly their products, services, or operations are. “Surrogate ads” are marketing techniques that indirectly promote brands and products, such as tobacco and alcohol, which are banned from advertising.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

This question was raised to the Congress by the Kisan Mahapanchayat held in Pipli on Sunday, asking whether the Congress would open the Shambhu and Khanauri borders of Haryana to allow farmers to proceed to Delhi to protest for their pending demands.Farmers have been sitting on Haryana’s borders since February 13, for over 220 days, in an attempt to reach the national capital, but the incumbent BJP government in Haryana has blocked the border with concrete walls, heavy police, and paramilitary forces.Hooda was in Ambala on Monday to seek votes for his party’s Ambala City candidate, Nirmal Singh. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge was also scheduled to visit Ambala, but his visit was cancelled.Hooda also promised to establish an Industrial Model Township (IMT) in Ambala to boost industrial and employment growth in the region.Addressing the gathering, Hooda said the BJP has no faith in democracy. “This dictatorial government first imposed three anti-farmer laws and then used lathis and fired bullets on farmers when they opposed these laws. Roads were dug up to stop the farmers, and even now, the Haryana government has stopped the farmers at the Shambhu border. Due to this, traders are also suffering huge losses,” Hooda said.“When the Congress government is formed, the Shambhu border will be opened, and farmers will be given a legal guarantee of MSP . At the same time, Rahul Gandhi is fighting for the demand to implement the Swaminathan Commission report for farmers at the Centre,” Hooda added.Hooda further said that Ambala had neither a sewer system, nor a stadium, nor walkable roads before the formation of the Congress government. “The Congress government established all the facilities in Ambala. Now, our goal is to establish IMT here to advance Ambala from an industrial point of view. With the establishment of IMT, new employment opportunities will develop in Ambala,” he said.“Along with this, the seven guarantees given by the Congress so far will be fulfilled. The BJP is questioning where the budget will come from. First of all, the BJP should explain where they will get the budget from, as they have copied the Congress manifesto,” he added.Candidate from Ambala City, Nirmal Singh, said, “We have seen the tenure of the Congress government led by Bhupinder Singh Hooda for 10 years. He waived the electricity bills of farmers worth Rs 1,600 crore with a stroke of the pen. Loans worth Rs 2,300 crore were also waived.”“Haryana became the number one state in the country under Congress rule. It was Congress that implemented schemes like the Green Revolution, MNREGA, RTI, Right to Education, Right to Food, Mid-Day Meal, and the nationalization of banks in the country,” Nirmal Singh added.","Farmers have been sitting on Haryana’s borders since February 13, for over 220 days, in an attempt to reach the national capital.

NEW DELHI: After reports of beef fat and fish oil being found in the cow ghee samples used to make the Tirupati 'laddu prasadam ,' Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams said that sanctity of the 'prasadam' has been restored. The temple trust has also stalled the use of cow-based products temporarily for making Srivari Prasadams.""The sanctity of Srivari laddu prasadam is restored again,"" it said in late Friday night a post on X.""After receiving feedback from pilgrims regarding the poor quality of laddus in recent years and after consulting with the Potu workers (laddu makers), TTD, for the first time, sent ghee samples to an external lab for adulteration testing,"" it said.Addressing the lab report that confirmed the presence of foreign fats in the ghee used, TTD said, ""Foreign fats such as soybean, sunflower, palm kernel fat, or even lard and beef tallow. The acceptable S-value range for pure milk fat is between 98.05 and 104.32, but the tested samples showed values ranging from 23.22 to 116, indicating significant deviations.""""The lack of an in-house lab for ghee testing allowed suppliers to take advantage of the situation. However, NDDB has offered to donate ghee adulteration testing equipment, valued at Rs. 75 lakh,"" TTD added.The public laboratory analysis had revealed that there were foreign fats present in the ghee used to make laddus, including lard (clarified pig fat), tallow (beef fat) and fish oil.The samples also included fats from vegetable sources such as coconut, linseed, rapeseed, and cottonseed. This analysis took place on July 23 following complaints received by the government regarding a change in the taste of the laddu prasadam.The trust warned the suppliers to ensure high-quality ghee, adding that failure to do so would get them blacklisted.""There were five ghee suppliers to TTD, with prices ranging from Rs 320 to Rs 411. These suppliers are Premier Agri Foods, Kriparam Dairy, Vaishnavi, Sri Parag Milk, and AR Dairy. However, these rates do not seem viable for supplying pure ghee,"" it said.""Despite the warnings, four ghee tankers sent by AR Foods were found to be of substandard quality. S-value analysis carried out on the samples, sent to the reputable NDDB CALF Anand, showed results outside the standard limits, indicating the presence of foreign fats,"" it added.Meanwhile, the trust has formed an experts committee and has halted the supplies temporarily to ensure quality checks.",Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams said that sanctity of the 'prasadam' has been restored.

"India Drone Deal: Eye on aggressive China, US 'welcomes' progress on $3.9bn predator drone deal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-aggressive-china-us-welcomes-progress-on-3-9bn-predator-drones-deal/articleshow/113581058.cms,"NEW DELHI: The US has welcomed India’s impending $3.9 billion procurement of 31 armed MQ-9B `hunter-killer’ Predator drones, as part of their overall defence partnership that will see the two countries further ramp up military interoperability, intelligence-sharing, space and cyber cooperation as well as defence-industrial and innovation collaboration, with an eye firmly on China’s aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific.The govt-to-govt deal for the 31 high-altitude long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), with 15 Sea Guardian drones earmarked for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF, is set to be inked in mid-Oct after the two sides wrapped up the techno-commercial negotiations, as was earlier reported by TOI.“President Joe Biden welcomed the progress towards India concluding procurement of 31 General Atomics MQ-9Bs and their associated equipment, which will enhance the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities of India’s armed forces across all domains”, a joint fact-sheet issued after the Modi-Biden talks said.The drone deal will take the collective worth of lucrative Indian defence contracts bagged by the US to well over $25 billion just since 2007. Instead of such direct acquisitions, India is now pushing for co-development and co-production of advanced weapon systems under the ambitious defence-industrial cooperation roadmap finalized in June last year.While no such joint project has been sealed till now, Modi and Biden “recognised the remarkable progress” achieved under the roadmap, including “ongoing collaboration to advance priority co-production arrangements for jet engines, munitions, and ground mobility systems”.India and the US, for instance, are conducting techno-commercial negotiations to jointly produce GE-F414 jet engines for the Tejas Mark-2 fighters here, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion.The fact-sheet also mentioned that the US demonstrated its Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicle, with the Javelin anti-tank guided missiles, on the margins of the joint `Yudh Abhyas’ exercise that concluded in Rajasthan on Saturday.TOI had earlier reported that the discussions were in an advanced stage for the joint manufacture of the eight-wheeled Strykers, with the Indian Army projecting a requirement for around 530 such vehicles, though there is some criticism about indigenous options being ignored in the process.The two leaders also welcomed efforts to expand other defence-industrial partnerships, including for the co-development and co-production of unmanned surface vehicle systems to strengthen undersea and maritime domain awareness, as well as enhance India's MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) capabilities for the repair of aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles.Modi and Biden also lauded ongoing efforts to deepen the bilateral military partnership and interoperability to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific, noting that India hosted the largest and most complex bilateral tri-Service exercise “Tiger Triumph” till date in March.“The leaders commended work to advance cooperation in advanced domains, including space and cyber, and looked forward towards the Nov 2024 bilateral cyber engagement to enhance the cyber cooperation framework. Areas of new cooperation will include threat information sharing, cybersecurity training, and collaboration on vulnerability mitigation in energy and telecommunications networks,” it said.Under a MoU on the deployment of military liaison officers, India will now post a Colonel-rank officer to the US Special Operations Command at Florida, while another officer will go to the Indo-Pacific Command at Hawaii.","The govt-to-govt deal for the 31 high-altitude long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), with 15 Sea Guardian drones earmarked for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF, is set to be inked in mid-Oct.

Sri Lanka New President: A curveball India prepared for; Anura Kumara Dissanayake against Adani project but backs Indian security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-lankan-president-a-curveball-india-prepared-for-akd-against-adani-project-but-backs-indian-security/articleshow/113576472.cms,"NEW DELHI: With Marxist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake winning the hotly contested Sri Lankan presidential poll, India is faced with another challenge in the neighbourhood of dealing with a leader who remains a relatively unknown quantity. However, with its $ 4 billion-worth assistance that helped Lanka tide over an unprecedented economic crisis and recent outreach that had the Indian government hosting him earlier this year, India is perhaps in a lot better position to absorb the shock than it was in Bangladesh.India’s high commissioner Santosh Jha was the first diplomat to call on the president-elect and congratulate him, saying India, as a civilisational twin, was committed to deepening ties for the prosperity of the people of both countries.After his swearing-in on Monday, the 55-year-old National People’s Power alliance leader will become the first Leftist president to head a Lankan government. A marginal player till now in Lankan politics, who got only 3 percent votes in the last election, Dissanayake defeated the pro-India leader of opposition, Sajith Premadasa, after a historic counting of second preference votes, as no candidate could get more than 50 percent votes. He eventually won with 42.31 percent votes.While India followed the elections with a non-partisan approach, it would have ideally liked incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe or Premadasa to win for the sake of continuity, if nothing else. This would have allowed a more sure-footed Indian government to build upon the goodwill generated by its recent handholding of the strategically important Indian Ocean neighbour through a period of acute crisis.Despite the traditionally anti-India stance of his Marxist- Leninist party JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna), the Indian government reached out to Dissanayake, popularly known as AKD, in February inviting him to visit the country. The invitation acknowledged his increasing popularity, especially among the youth, on the back of widespread anger over the mishandling of the crisis and a pro-poor, anti-corruption “agent of change’’ image that proved decisive in an election dominated by issues related toSri Lanka ’s economic recovery. These included a controversial IMF bailout deal he wants renegotiated. Both foreign minister S Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval met him in Delhi.Interestingly, during his visit to India, Dissanayake agreed to visit the Amul plant in Gujarat after alleging that the Indian dairy giant was planning to take over dozens of Lankan state owned dairies.The Indian mission in Colombo has remained in regular contact with Dissanayake.For India, the key priorities in Sri Lanka remain the need to address the requirements of the India-origin Tamil community, including full implementation of the 1987 13th Amendment to the Constitution, expediting connectivity, energy and other projects as China expands its footprint and a more humanitarian approach towards Indian fishermen. It’s also important for India that Sri Lanka, in line with a bilateral agreement, doesn’t allow China military use of its ports in a manner prejudicial to India’s interests.While many have speculated that Dissanayake might seek stronger ties with China, it’s important for India that he said recently he won’t allow anyone to use his country’s sea, land and airspace to threaten India.The socialist leader made headlines recently by saying he will scrap a wind power project by the Adani group , which has run into problems because of environmental issues, saying it violates Sri Lanka’s “energy sovereignty”. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, which promotes cross-border trade and investment, is said to have emphasised before Dissanayake that the project might help attract more investments into the country.Dissanayake is also learnt to have expressed concerns before Indian officials about corruption and lack of transparency in the execution of some of Chinese flagship projects, like the Hambantota port and Colombo port city project. India believes that while he might look to remodel some of the projects, it’s unlikely he will revoke any. “His focus on corruption and the need for transparency is in line with India’s stand against opaque lending practices. Indian projects are based on the needs of the local people,’’ said an official here.Dissanayake has sounded ambivalent about the 13th Amendment and his party has strongly opposed the 1987 India-Sri Lanka accord but, barring Premadasa, no other major candidate, not even Wickremesinghe, had promised its full implementation. While seeking Constitutional changes, Dissanayake has said it’s important to implement provisions that can establish peace and to focus on the future, not the past. ``To do that, Tamil people should be given a strong guarantee of rights in politics. They must be given a right to make decisions for themselves,’’ he said earlier this year.","Anura Kumara Dissanayake will become the first Leftist president to head a Lankan government. India's high commissioner Santosh Jha was the first diplomat to call on the president-elect and congratulate him.

EY employee death: Backlash mounts as Nirmala Sitharaman's remarks on stress management spark outrage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ey-employee-death-backlash-mounts-as-nirmala-sitharamans-remarks-on-stress-management-spark-outrage/articleshow/113595352.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is facing sharp criticism from opposition parties following her comments on stress management , made in reference to the tragic death of Anna Sebastian Perayil , a young CA. Sitharaman suggested that colleges and universities should teach students to manage stress through spirituality and inner strength—remarks that opposition leaders have condemned as ""outright cruel.""Perayil, who passed her CA exams in 2023 and had been working at EY's Pune office for just four months, died in July.In a letter to EY India Chairman Rajiv Memani, her mother, Anita Augustine, described the ""backbreaking"" workload her daughter endured, which affected her ""physically, emotionally, and mentally.""During an event at a private medical college, Sitharaman referenced the 26-year-old’s death without naming her or the company involved, saying: ""A company, without mentioning its name... A woman who had studied CA well, unable to cope with the work pressure... she died unable to cope with the pressure.""The finance minister went on to say that students should not only receive education but also be taught stress management through spirituality and inner strength. ""Believe in God, we need to have God's grace. Seek God, learn good discipline. Your Atma shakti (inner strength) will grow only from this,"" she said, adding that educational institutions should bring in divinity to help students ""handle pressure.""These comments sparked immediate backlash. Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi criticizing Sitharaman for ""victim-shaming"" and ignoring the real issue said, ""Dear Nirmala Sitaraman ji, Anna had (the) inner strength to handle the stress that came with pursuing a gruelling Chartered Accountancy degree. It was the toxic work culture , long work hours that took away her life which needs to be addressed. Stop victim-shaming and at least try to be a little sensitive, am sure God will be the guide if you seek.""CPI MP P Sandosh Kumar echoed these sentiments, calling the finance minister’s remarks ""bizarre and insensitive."" He argued that the focus should be on addressing the ""inhuman working conditions"" faced by young employees rather than advising them to rely on God. ""Overwork, inhuman working conditions, pervasive unemployment, and lack of social security are creating stress and insecurity among workers... Instead of addressing these structural concerns, the Finance Minister's advice to 'rely on God' is bizarre and insensitive,"" he said.Congress leader K C Venugopal also condemned the remarks, saying, ""The ruling regime and the Finance Minister can only see the pain of corporate giants like Adani and Ambani, not the pain of the hardworking and toiling young generation... It is downright cruel on part of the Finance Minister to blame Anna and her family for suggesting that she should have learnt stress management at home.""He added, ""The toxic work environment should have triggered an honest review of corporate practices and led to necessary reforms that protect employees.""Amid the growing outrage, the government has promised to investigate EY’s work environment, though critics continue to press for structural changes that would protect young professionals from being overworked.","Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is facing sharp criticism from opposition parties following her comments on stress management.

I had to make >800 applications and sit through 65 interviews before landing my first job.

Sounds insane but that was my reality when I graduated in the US - during a recession!

The job market was brutal, and every door seemed to be slammed shut—especially in the tech and VC industry, where I desperately wanted to work.

And unfortunately, I wasn’t from Harvard, Yale or Stanford or any other Ivy League.

I watched as others walked into jobs I knew I was capable of doing, and honestly, it drove me nuts. Every application, email, and interview hit a dead end.

But quitting was never on the table although I was dead-broke and finding it hard to make ends meet.

So, when Y2K came around and COBOL became a hot skill, I rolled up my sleeves & taught myself basic mainframe coding.

Eventually, landed an entry-level job as a COBOL programmer with Keane – I hated every minute of it 😥

Fortunately, just before I completely lost my mind, I got a call from

MicroStrategy

in Boston and was quickly hired as a pre-sales consultant.

But I knew the real action was in their Washington D.C. HQ. So, I took a shot in the dark and wrote directly to Michael Saylor the founder & CEO, asking for a role in their new venture Strategy.com

I got the role 😅 > Moved to D.C. > 2 years later, I was Director of Strategic Partnerships at a company that was the toast of Wall Street and darling of the tech world💪🏼

We went from a $100m to $40b mkt cap in that time. Yeah, let that sink in🚀

That job & my time in the US shaped me into who I am today🙏

But here’s the thing - this struggle wasn't just about landing a job- it was also about proving to myself that I was as good as the best.

To every struggler out there, the road is tough, but every ""no"" gets us closer to a yes, and that one ""yes"" has the power to change everything in our lives ✅

So, keep pushing, keep learning, and keep fighting for what you deserve coz our breakthroughs are out there. Sometimes they just need a little time to find us 🤗

Anupam Mittal - founder and CEO of People group has shared a post on LinkedIn, recounting his early career challenges, and how he sat through 65 interviews to land his first job. “I had to make >800 applications and sit through 65 interviews before landing my first job.

HYDERABAD: For the first time in its over 60-year history, the Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences ( NIMS ) has changed the uniform of its in-house nurses -- from white sarees, churidar, and frocks to colourful shirt-pant sets ( scrub suits in medical parlance) and salwars.It has also done away with the age-old nightingale cap, following a persistent demand from nurses seeking comfort and convenience.Shunning the all-white look, the new dress code includes turquoise blue scrub suits or churidar with half sleeves for staff nurses, burgundy scrub suits or churidar with three-fourth sleeves for head nurses, and peach colour scrub suits, saree or churidar for the nursing superintendent.""The decision was taken after consulting the Indian Nursing Council and getting a go-ahead from them. The council agreed that this change will enhance the self-image of nursing professionals. It's easy to work in these dresses,"" said Krishna Teja, senior nursing officer at NIMS. ""Nurses had been representing this issue for two years.

While maintaining a white uniform is an issue and we have to keep buying new ones frequently, wearing these during menstrual cycles is even more challenging,"" said a nurse posted in the emergency ward at the Osmania General Hospital (OGH). She added how the newer crop of nurses also finds it difficult to wear a saree.""The scrub suits give a more professional look as well,"" said a newly-inducted nurse at OGH drawing parallels with the private sector. ""Unlike in corporate hospitals, nurses in govt facilities seem to be stuck in the past. Also, I feel it's very difficult to handle so many patients and do the running around from ward to ward in a saree,"" said the young nurse, one among the recent set of 6,000 nurses recruited by the state govt.In fact, the Telangana Nursing Association has even submitted a representation to the state govt in Aug demanding a change in the dress code. ""We are awaiting a response from the govt,"" said Mariamma, general secretary of the association.

She added how the newer crop of nurses also finds it difficult to wear a saree.""The scrub suits give a more professional look as well,"" said a newly-inducted nurse at OGH drawing parallels with the private sector. ""Unlike in corporate hospitals, nurses in govt facilities seem to be stuck in the past. Also, I feel it's very difficult to handle so many patients and do the running around from ward to ward in a saree,"" said the young nurse, one among the recent set of 6,000 nurses recruited by the state govt.In fact, the Telangana Nursing Association has even submitted a representation to the state govt in Aug demanding a change in the dress code. ""We are awaiting a response from the govt,"" said Mariamma, general secretary of the association. The change, she said, has been sought for male nurses as well whose white trouser-shirt outfit is same as the uniform of Class IV employees in govt hospitals.","For the first time in its over 60-year history, the Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences ( NIMS ) has changed the uniform of its in-house nurses. It has also done away with the age-old nightingale cap, following a persistent demand from nurses seeking comfort and convenience. The new dress code includes turquoise blue scrub suits or churidar with half sleeves for staff nurses, burgundy scrub suits with three-fourth sleeves for head nurses.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113616038,imgsize-42268,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/113616038.jpg"

His resilience earned him widespread respect.The nickname, 'Little Master' was a tribute to his short stature and his extraordinary skill, reminiscent of another Indian cricketing legend, Sunil Gavaskar Tendulkar’s ability to play every shot in the book with precision, combined with his calm temperament and hunger for runs, solidified his place as one of cricket's greatest batsmen.Throughout his career, Sachin broke numerous records, including becoming the first cricketer to score 100 international centuries.His consistency, humility, and mastery over the game made him a global icon, forever etching his name as the 'Little Master' of cricket.","Sachin Tendulkar was the first cricketer to score 100 international centuries.

The purpose of the puja, performed inside Bharatpur police station, was to seek blessings from deities for smooth operations in the future and to prevent further controversies.The development coincided with the installation of CCTV cameras at the station.Despite the fact that Rs 4.5 crore was spent on the construction of the modern, three-storied police station, it was surprisingly not equipped with CCTV cameras, until now.Twenty-five CCTV cameras have been installed at key locations throughout the police station. These locations include the entry and exit points, lock-up, corridor, reception area, inspector’s room, other rooms where police officers sit, areas outside the lock-up, in front of the police station compound, outside the washroom/toilet, duty officer’s room and the backyard of the police station.“We organised the puja to bring good fortune to the station and ensure the well being of everyone. CCTV cameras, too, have been installed,” Bharatpur station inspector in-charge (IIC) Deepak Khandayatray said. He was appointed the IIC on Sept 18 following the suspension of his predecessor, Dinakrushna Mishra.“Today, we have completed the process and installed the cameras in the new building,” another police officer said.State crime branch, which is probing the alleged assault case, had earlier admitted the investigation to gather evidence could run into a hurdle in the absence of CCTV cameras at Bharatpur police station.Law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan said the govt would ensure that all police stations across the state are brought under CCTV surveillance. “We came to know that some police stations in Odisha do not have CCTV cameras.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
