NEET-UG row fallout: Government mulls NTA reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neet-ug-row-fallout-government-mulls-nta-reforms/articleshow/111067540.cms,"NEW DELHI: Post-resolution of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-undergraduate ( NEET-UG ) controversies, significant reforms are anticipated within the National Testing Agency (NTA). According to govt sources, extensive changes in the agency's operations and exam administration are under consideration, with a high-level committee likely to be established for recommendations..The NEET-UG 2024 results, announced on June 4, faced widespread criticism from students and parents. Legal challenges were filed against the results, highlighting three main issues: the provision of grace marks to some students, claims of a leaked question paper, and suspected irregularities at specific exam centres. Many have called for an investigation and a retake of the exam.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan emphasised on Sunday that the ""harshest punishment"" would be administered to those found guilty in the NEET UG 2024 ""scam"", while assuring students and parents that govt is taking the matter seriously.A senior govt official said: ""The matter is currently in the courts. The education ministry and NTA are also examining the details. However, once the issue is resolved based on the investigations and court orders, significant reforms will be initiated in all aspects of conducting these crucial examinations."" The official added that the ministry of education is likely to form a committee to recommend the reforms.As of Nov 2023, the NTA registered over 1.23 crore candidates, making it one of the largest exam-conducting bodies globally, second only to China's Gaokao, which registered 1.29 crore candidates in 2023.For NEET-UG 2024, over 24 lakh candidates registered, while 14.7 lakh registered for the Joint Entrance Examination (Main), and more than 13.4 lakh for the CUET-UG 2024. Besides these major entrance exams for various undergraduate programmes, NTA also conducts other exams such as the National Council of Hotel Management Joint Entrance Exam (12,738 candidates), the Admission Test for Diploma in Sports Coaching (ATDSC) - 2024 of the National Institute of Sports (NIS), the Graduate Aptitude Test - Biotechnology (GAT-B), the Common Management Admission Test, the Graduate Pharmacy Aptitude Test, the All India Sainik School Entrance Exam, and Swayam examinations, among others.Speaking to TOI, Pradhan said, ""Govt will thoroughly review what happened in NEET and take steps to reform both the examinations and NTA. NTA is evolving and not perfect; we need to strengthen it further. We are concerned about the future of lakhs of young students.""In addition to three of the most competitive and high-profile entrance exams-NEET-UG and PG, CUET-UG and PG, and JEE (Main)-NTA also conducts the NET for UGC, recruitment exams for the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation, Navodaya Vidyalaya Sangathan, Central Universities and Military Nursing Service, among others.Govt sources indicate that the planned reforms will include administrative, operational and logistical changes (centres and question papers) and capacity building, among other areas.","Post-resolution of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-undergraduate ( NEET-UG ) controversies, significant reforms are anticipated within the National Testing Agency.

Note to CM M K Stalin: Prepping for 2026? Here’s what’s left on your to-do list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/note-to-cm-prepping-for-2026-heres-whats-left-on-your-to-do-list/articleshow/111042998.cms,"With a full score of 40 Lok Sabha seats for the DMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the just-concluded polls, the focus has shifted to meeting public expectations before the 2026 Assembly polls , which will be even more strongly rooted in state and constituency-level issues.Chief minister M K Stalin , who has set himself a 200-plus seat goal, has resumed implementation of social welfare benefits after the poll code ended, most recently the Tamil Pudhalvan monthly higher education stipend scheme for male students in govt schools. This follows up on the Pudumai Penn scheme for girl students and `1,000 a month allowance under the Magalir Urimai Thittam besides the universal free bus passes for womenThere are other promises on the table that the DMK made in its 2021 manifesto that are yet to gain traction and need a sustained administrative push to fill governance deficits that are affecting service delivery.These issues are not new, and the manifesto for the previous Assembly poll took note of the gaps while making key promises: enacting a Right to Services Act , reviving the State Lok Ayukta and its operations, revamping the DVAC against corruption , re-establishing uzhavar sandhais across Tamil Nadu, changing over to monthly electricity billing, and opening 500 Kalaignar canteens.The toughest among the pending reforms is the right to services law, since it requires administrative processes to be streamlined and computerised over a period of time, and successfully guarantee a time-bound service — while incorporating penalties for officers who cause delays without a valid reason.Over a decade, the BJP-led Union govt failed to come up with a right to service law on the lines of the Right to Information Act of the UPA, which states could have adopted. The DMK made an election promise in 2021, but there has been no momentum to achieve this. Incremental reforms have been made, such as self-certification for newly built small houses to address bottlenecks and rent-seeking in property registration, but bigger problems remain. Approvals for building plans and water and electricity connections remain problematic, with no pressure on officials to provide a time-bound service or face a penalty.In the case of the registration department, where smooth access to services even now usually depends on document writers acting as intermediaries, the DMK-era high-level committee on administrative reforms and prevention of corruption, led by Justice G Ramanujam in 1997, said in its report, “a whole institution of document writers, copy writers and stamp vendors has grown with the department over several years, and many among these professionals are perceived as agents or touts for arranging the regular flow of mamool bribe money from registrants to departmental officers.”While stamp paper as a resource has been replaced with online fee payment, discretion in the calculation of property value is removed, and online scheduling of registration appointments introduced, a key aspect observed by the committee, of property documents narrated in dense and complicated language, continues to push registrants to document writer-agents.A right to services law should support registrants with access to online and designated physical centres, at a nominal fee. Compulsory service timelines would be set and penalties levied on officers for default, making the system more accountable. This writer recently encountered document writers stipulating an unrecorded payment of `25,000 for settlement deed registration, in addition to the legal fee payable to the govt.The rise of large real estate projects has led to built-in payments for service agencies, with realtors marking up fees for civic services such as electricity and water connections in gated communities and residential buildings. Despite house buyers being aware, there is no scrutiny of these inflated service fees.The Ramanujam Committee noted that the govt had said it would produce a Tamil booklet on the procedures to be followed in real estate to clear the air for citizens. The govt could highlight in such a book and more widely, the procedure to file complaints of corruption with the state lok ayukta in plain language, doing away with the requirement for technical, notarised complaints.In May, there were a mere four complaints filed with Tamil Nadu lok ayukta, and 29 were pending. No complaints were disposed of during the month. Moreover, even the case details at this body are not published, with no names or details of lok ayukta orders passed. Interestingly, it was during the 2020-22 COVID-19 phase that maximum complaints were filed before the lok ayukta. Taking the DMK manifesto promise forward, the functioning of this body needs review and more light has to be thrown on its cases and orders.Two decades ago, the World Bank recommended Tamil Nadu conduct periodic independent surveys on public perception of corruption in administration and service delivery, with the results published. Such a step would raise transparency.The review recommended strengthening the DVAC by moving from “raid and trap” methods to active monitoring of administrative processes to detect corruption. The committee noted that the department is ill-equipped for complex cases involving procurement, execution of works, and service delivery corruption. Little has changed since.Despite several online initiatives, only a law enforcing time-bound service delivery with penalties for officials can hold the administrative machinery accountable. A template for this is available in the UPA-era right of citizens for time-bound delivery of goods and services and redressal of their grievances bill and electronic delivery of services bill, both from 2011. The former provided for a penalty of up to `50,000 to be levied on govt officials failing to deliver the service and the latter, penalty of between `5,000 and `20,000. The bills inevitably lapsed.Expanding the map of uzhavar sandhais, including in big cities, making all services disabled-friendly and opening many times more than the promised 500 Kalaignar canteens would strengthen the next political manifesto.Computerisation and electronic applications eliminate friction and bottlenecks in govt services. As a state with strong welfare policies, it is crucial to eliminate administrative corruption with a strong service delivery law. Strengthening the RTI Act by appointing information commissioners and mandating full disclosure by govt departments will make administrative reform meaningful.(The writer is a Chennai-based journalist)(Email your feedback to southpole.toi@timesgroup.com)",The DMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry won 40 Lok Sabha seats in the just-concluded polls.

They cited the provision which mandates the loco pilots to stop at red signal for one minute and proceed at not more than 15 kmph.The authority letter, which was issued to all the trains that ran during the defect in the automatic signalling system, mentioned, “When encountering an automatic signal at ‘ON’ aspect and after waiting for the prescribed time, loco pilot should proceed with great caution at a speed not exceeding 15 kmph where visibility is good and not exceeding 10 kmph where visibility is not good until the next Stop signal, looking out for any possible obstruction and be prepared to stop short of the same.”Officials said though the goods train driver was authorised to cross all red signals between Ranipatra Railway Station (RNI) and Chattar Hat Junction (CAT) as the automatic signalling system was “defective”, the train’s speed was above the permissible limit.The detailed investigation into the crash will reveal at what speed the goods train was travelling on this section when the accident took place.Railway Board officials said while the driver of Kanchanjunga Express adhered to the speed norms and stopped at all red signals for one minute, the driver of the goods train did not follow the norms and hit the stationary passenger train from behind.Sources also said that at least four trains had passed the signal before the goods train and they had followed the norms. ""In this case, it seems the pilot did not slow down at the signal,” a source said.V Balachandran, central organising secretary of the All-India Loco Running Staff Association, said that until the Commissioner of Railway Safety's report or the departmental fact-finding inquiry came to a conclusion, it was not advisable to put the blame on anyone.",The loco pilot of the goods train involved in the fatal train crash in Darjeeling had got the authority to cross the signals during a defect in the automatic signalling system.

"US, India pledge to dismantle barriers, prevent tech leakage to countries of concern",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-india-pledge-to-dismantle-barriers-prevent-tech-leakage-to-countries-of-concern/articleshow/111066806.cms,"NEW DELHI: US NSA Jake Sullivan and his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval committed ""concrete action"" in coming months against long-standing barriers to strategic trade , technology and industrial cooperation, while pledging to prevent leakage of sensitive technologies to countries of concern, in what was the first high-level engagement between the 2 countries since the return of the NDA government this month.After several false starts earlier this year, Sullivan finally arrived in India Monday to undertake along with Doval a comprehensive review of cooperation under the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET). The initiative is expected to propel the relationship to the next level by removing regulatory barriers and developing a new defence industrial roadmap for joint development and production.Sullivan also held talks with foreign minister S Jaishankar and called on PM Narendra Modi who said in a post on X India remains committed to strengthening the India-US partnership for global good. Sullivan briefed him about the progress in iCET cooperation in areas like AI, semiconductors, defence and space. In the meeting, Modi expressed satisfaction at the speed and scale of the growing partnership and the convergence on regional and global issues.The NSAs exchanged views also on issues like the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in Gaza. According to a joint factsheet issued after the NSA meeting, Doval and Sullivan in what was their second iCET talks underscored the vital importance of adapting their ``technology protection toolkits’’ and resolved to prevent the leakage of sensitive and dual-use technologies to countries of concern. While neither side identified the countries of concerns, the US has been working to block the flow of technology to Russia, a country India continues to maintain strong defence ties with despite the promise of unprecedented transfer of technology from the US like in the GE-HAL deal for co-production of jet engines.According to the factsheet titled India and the US will Continue to Chart an Ambitious Course for iCET, Doval and Sullivan stressed the need for continued efforts, particularly under the Strategic Trade Dialogue, to address outstanding barriers to technology collaboration. They acknowledged progress in the GE-HAL jet deal negotiations, India’s planned acquisition of the MQ-9B armed drones and possible co-production of land warfare systems.In defence, they also focused on deepening cooperation to accelerate the joint adoption of cutting-edge commercial technologies for military solutions and capability enhancement of both defense ecosystems, including through an MoU, and expanding defence industrial partnerships, like through the launch of a jointly developed AI Multi-Domain Situational Awareness product.``Our work also continues to be anchored in a shared commitment to ensuring that technology is designed, developed and deployed in a manner consistent with our democratic values and respect for universal human rights, as well as a recognition that the future security and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific will hinge on the strength of the India-US,’’ said the joint factsheet.Doval and Sullivan, who twice postponed his visit earlier this year, also underscored their commitment to striving for breakthrough achievements in priority critical and emerging technology areas, by focusing on co-production, co-development and R&D opportunities. They focused on enhancing coordination with like-minded nations to deliver secure, reliable, and cost-competitive technology solutions for the ``Indian and American people and our partners around the world’’.","US NSA Jake Sullivan and his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval committed ""concrete action"" in coming months against long-standing barriers to strategic trade, technology and industrial cooperation.

"MP: Trackers refuse to be butchers for Kuno Cheetahs; move on strike, approach CM",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trackers-refuse-to-be-butchers-for-kuno-cheetahs-move-on-strike-approach-cm/articleshow/111057018.cms,"BHOPAL: A tense situation has arisen at Kuno National Park (KNP) in Sheopur district of Madhya Pradesh as around 30 villagers, hired to monitor and track cheetahs round-the-clock, have stopped work. The reason for the strike? Their refusal to butcher animals for feeding the big cats within the special enclosures known as soft release bomas (SRBs).Primarily from the Yadav and Gurjar communities, these villagers were recruited for their knowledge of the park's terrain. However, their religious beliefs clash with the assigned duty of slaughtering goats and buffaloes for the cheetahs. They have vehemently rejected this task and reportedly even refused training offered by the park authorities for the same.This unexpected strike has thrown a wrench into the cheetah tracking program. Park officials are scrambling for alternate solutions, considering outsourcing procurement of pre-cut meat from licensed vendors through tenders. They downplay the immediate impact, assuring that most cheetahs are currently within the secure bomas and can be monitored by existing staff. To facilitate closer monitoring and potentially foster a level of trust, each tracker is assigned a specific cheetah to observe its behaviour within the enclosure. This includes monitoring feeding times, ensuring the cheetah's well-being, and providing enrichment activities where appropriate. While forming close bonds with wild animals is challenging, familiarity can aid in cheetah acclimation and data collection, say sources.“The trackers stopped working and came to Kuno four days ago. They went straight to the Chief Minister's office instead of raising the issue with park or wildlife headquarters first. Currently, most cheetahs are within the secure enclosures and our existing staff can manage them. The villagers' absence won't significantly impact cheetah tracking and monitoring,” an officer told TOI. Trackers are paid around Rs 9000 a month and they work in shifts.Undeterred, the villagers remain resolute in their demands. Their representatives, who approached the Chief Minister Dr Mohan Yadav's office for intervention, have highlighted two key points: Insurance Coverage and Exemption from Slaughtering Duties. They couldn’t meet the CM but were able to submit their pleas before his OSD – S K Tiwari, who further inquired about the matter from concerned officers.""We're on strike and haven't heard back from park officials. Our demands are clear: we can't participate in the animal preparation for cheetah feeding,"" a tracker said.They seek comprehensive insurance to be protected against any hazards associated with their work in the park, including encounters with wild animals or injuries sustained during tracking activities and their primary objection is the requirement to kill and butcher animals for cheetah feeding. Citing religious beliefs against animal slaughter, they have refused to compromise on this issue, say sources.The villagers have made it clear they will not return to work until their demands are met. This incident lays bare a potential conflict between cultural beliefs and wildlife conservation efforts. Kuno National Park, known for its recent introduction of cheetahs, now faces the challenge of balancing animal welfare with the religious sentiments of its hired workforce. Finding a solution that addresses both concerns is crucial to ensure the smooth functioning of the cheetah monitoring program.The already strained situation at Kuno National Park is often compounded by the continued adventures of cheetahs venturing outside the protected area. The female cheetah Veera had strayed from the park boundaries, venturing further than ever before. It reached Baghwala village, located near the Gwalior-Morena border, a significant distance from the park's core area. That was the first instance of a cheetah venturing so close to a major city. The trackers and officers had spent sleepless nights trying to get it back. Veera isn't the only cheetah exhibiting a penchant for exploration. Another cheetah, Pawan, had also been known to wander outside the park's confines. Just recently, Pawan was retrieved from Karoli in Rajasthan.The trackers have faced conflict situations in the region. In one of the recent incidents, the trackers tasked with locating a cheetah that moved out of the park was attacked by villagers in Burakheda village of Morena. The villagers, mistaking the team for cattle thieves due to their nighttime presence and clothing, opened fire and launched a physical attack. No serious injuries were reported.Kuno is experiencing a mix of triumphs and challenges in its ambitious cheetah reintroduction project since the first lot was translocated from Namibia in Sep 2022 and released into enclosures by PM Narendra Modi . However, a significant milestone had recently been achieved with cheetah Gamini giving birth to five cubs, bringing the total number of Indian-born cheetahs to 13. It was the fourth litter born in India and the first by a South African cheetah. Kuno is now home to 26 cheetahs, with half being cubs.This is a positive sign for the project's progress. Prior to Gamini's cubs, Namibia's Jwala had successfully delivered three cubs in her second litter, following the loss of one from her first litter of four.Additionally, cheetah Aasha had previously contributed three cubs to the growing Kuno population. Since the initial translocation of cheetahs from Namibia in September 2022, ten cheetahs have died. Harsh summer temperatures reaching 46-47 degrees Celsius resulted in the loss of three cubs born to Jwala in May 2023.The growing cheetah population may necessitate the exploration of alternative habitats like the Gandhisagar sanctuary. German researchers have expressed concerns regarding Kuno's cheetah carrying capacity. Determining this will require further study as the cheetahs establish their home ranges.","Around 30 villagers, hired to monitor and track cheetahs round-the-clock, have stopped work.

Last year, the former chief advisers for the political science textbooks had criticised the rationalisation exercise for ""mutilating"" the books beyond recognition and demanded the removal of their names.They said textbooks, once a source of pride, had become a source of embarrassment. Despite their objections, the revised textbooks still list them as chief advisers.Expressing shock that ""more than a year after our original request, NCERT has gone ahead to publish... without removing our names"", Yadav and Palshikar said in their letter, ""We are also distressed to learn that NCERT has taken a step further in its drive towards indiscriminate distortion of these textbooks. NCERT has resorted to significant additions and rewriting that are out of sync with the spirit of the original textbooks. Both of us, as chief advisers of the original textbooks, have already registered our strong disapproval of this unethical mutilation of textbooks that violate both the authors' rights to intellectual property and the students' right to quality education.""They also said if NCERT considered these textbooks inappropriate, it was entirely within its rights to withdraw them and publish new versions, however, adding that it had no moral or legal right to alter these textbooks ""without consulting any of us and yet publish these under our names despite our explicit refusal... it is bizarre that authors and editors are forced to associate their names with a work they no longer identify as their own"".Last year, NCERT had said that ""withdrawal of association by any one member is out of question"" as the textbooks were a collective effort. NCERT director Dinesh Prasad Saklani could not be contacted for his comment. The council has once again courted controversy as its revised Class 12 political science textbook omits the mention of Babri Masjid, referring to it only as a ""three-domed structure"". Other deletions include references to BJP's 'rath yatra' from Somnath to Ayodhya, the role of kar sevaks and communal violence following the Babri Masjid demolition, among others.","Political scientists Yogendra Yadav and Suhas Palshikar wrote to NCERT on Monday objecting to the inclusion of their names in new textbooks.

NEW DELHI: Heat wave to severe heat wave conditions are likely to continue over many parts of north India for the next two days and gradually abate thereafter under the influence of approaching western disturbance towards northwest India , India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday.

Northwest India, including Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR , which continued to be under heat wave conditions on Monday, may not see significant change in maximum (day) temperatures during the next 24 hours.

Day temperatures may, however, fall by about 2 degree Celsius thereafter as IMD predicted isolated to scattered light rainfall with thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan during June 18-20.

As far as monsoon is concerned, the Met department said the conditions are favourable for its further advance into some more parts of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, some parts of Gangetic West Bengal, remaining parts of Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and some parts of Bihar during the next four days.

Himachal faces worst fire season in years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/himachal-faces-worst-fire-season-in-years/articleshow/111067004.cms,"KULLU: There is no let-up in forest fires in Himachal Pradesh , as 2,004 blazes have already been recorded in what has become one of the worst summers for forests and wildlife across the state.The fires so far have destroyed 22,466 hectares of land and caused an estimated loss of Rs 7.62 crore to the department besides harming and unsettling the wildlife. Compared to last year when only 104 forest fires were recorded in the state during summer , the rise this year is a whopping 1826%.Maximum fires recorded are in regions where average maximum temperature hav been higher this month.According to the forest department data, Dharamshala has recorded the highest 478 fires, followed by Mandi with 328 fires, Hamirpur 243, Nahan 234, Solan 192, Chamba 144 and Shimla 143.Forest circles which have suffered the worst losses include Mandi with Rs 1.89 crore, Dharamshala Rs 1.38 crore, Hamirpur Rs 1.23 crore and Bilaspur Rs 1.10 crore.Ajit Thakur, chief conservator of forests, Mandi Circle, told TOI that there were many reasons for the forest fires but the hot weather tops the list. ""This summer, we have been witnessing 40°C and above temperatures in many of our forest circles in the state.Heat provides ideal conditions for the initial spark off and more than often it's the villagers who deliberately ignite forest fires. It also becomes difficult to put out a forest fire in such high temperatures, which can reach well above 50°C in an area of fire incident. ""The other reason is the pine tree leaf-shedding. In the last two years, there have not been any major fires in Himachal forests and this has resulted in an accumulation of dried leaves and grass, which become highly combustible material in rising mercury. Also, the soil's moisture-holding capacity also decreases in forests due to constant heat and this again is another reason for the fires,"" said Thakur.According to Thakur, better fire-fighting technology was required for the forests of Himachal. ""Technology has made fire detection much easier, but we are still not close to using it to douse fire. Unlike the developed countries where fire fighting is an exclusive department with high reliability on technology, we depend manually on our workforce to put out forest fires. We have used army helicopters only in emergency situations,"" said Thakur. ""Our main target remains to douse a forest fire immediately within the first one to two hours as when it spreads then it becomes uncontrollable,"" added Thakur.Out of the total forest area of 37,033 sq km in Himachal Pradesh, around 17.8% has chir pine forests, which is highly sensitive to forest fires due to their highly inflammable resin content. The state forest department has marked as many as 26 forest divisions, having chir pine trees, in the state, as highly sensitive to forest fires.","The fires have destroyed 22,466 hectares of land and caused an estimated loss of Rs 7.62 crore.

A group of Democrat Senators led by Jeff Merkley, who is also a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken calling for a strong diplomatic response, following the ``credible allegations’’ about the involvement of an Indian official in the plot.They asked the US government to match words with action to hold the Indian officials involved accountable, and to send a ``clear message’’ that there will be consequences for such behaviour. ``It is imperative that we take an unequivocal stand against such a threat to the rights of a US citizen and violation of US sovereignty, which are examples of India’s increasingly irresponsible efforts to silence critics of its government among its diaspora around the word,’’ said the senators in their official communication.Gupta, who allegedly hired a hitman to eliminate the Khalistan separatist and US-Canadian national at the instance of an Indian government official, was scheduled to be produced in a Manhattan federal court on Monday. The announcement of his extradition to the US, which has an extradition treaty with the Czech Republic, was made by the Czech justice minister Pavel Blazek. Czech authorities arrested and detained Gupta on June 30, 2023.The minister said he approved the extradition on June 3. Sullivan has been pursuing the case with India, saying on several occasions that the US takes it very seriously and has been pressing India to act against the Indian official who allegedly masterminded the plot. He said last week that the US will continue to raise the issue with India at very high levels.Sullivan was widely expected to raise the same issue in his meetings on Monday, but both sides were tight-lipped about whether he actually did that. This was the first time he met his counterpart Ajit Doval since the US Justice Department announced charges against Gupta.Gupta is charged with murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire. Each count carries a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in prison. According to the indictment, the Indian government employee, working together with others, including Gupta, in India and elsewhere, directed a plot to assassinate Pannun. The issue was raised by President Biden himself in his meeting with PM Modi on the margins of the G20 summit last year in Delhi.Gupta allegedly contacted an individual whom he believed to be a criminal associate, but who was in fact a confidential source working with US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), for assistance in contracting a hitman to murder Pannun.",US NSA Jake Sullivan is in India for a review of the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET) The arrival of Sullivan coincided with an announced by the Czech government that Indian national Nikhil Gupta was handed over to the US.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111066970,imgsize-64840,width-400,resizemode-4/111066970.jpg"

""There were two parcel vans ahead, because of which there was no more damage than what has already happened.""A copy of the PLCT (T/A 912) issued to the loco pilot by the stationmaster of Rangapani surfaced later in the day, authorising him to cross all red signals. ""Automatic signalling has failed and you are hereby authorised to pass all automatic signals between RNI (Rangapani Railway Station) and CAT (Chater Hat Junction),"" the note states.A railway official said a loco pilot was required to approach a red signal at 10 kmph, halt close to the signal, wait a minute during daytime and two minutes at night, and then resume at 10-15 kmph. ""Also, after passing the signal, the loco pilot must ensure that a minimum distance of 150 metres is maintained between his train and the preceding one or any obstruction along the line.""Various reports suggested that the automatic signalling system on the Rangapani stretch of the route, around 30km from New Jalpaiguri station, had been malfunctioning for some time, necessitating the use of PLCT as an alternative.""Employees manning the control rooms were aware of the snag as stationmasters on that stretch would issue paper signals for all passing trains. Two trains couldn't have entered the same track without receiving a PLCT for that specific line,"" a source said.A PLCT is a document that allows trains to proceed on a single line section when a block instrument fails but communication between stations is still available.The stationmaster, after coordinating with the up and down stations, gives the all-clear to an oncoming train. The signal man holds up a racket-like contraption containing the chit of paper for the loco pilot's assistant to collect even as the train is in motion.""Only a detailed inquiry can reveal what actually happened. The question doing the rounds is whether a PLCT each was at all issued to the trains that collided. Why would a loco pilot disregard a PLCT?"" a retired railway engineer wondered.PTI reported that the automatic signalling system between Rantipatra station and Chattar Hat junction, where the goods train hit the Kanchanjunga Express , had been defective since 5.40am Monday.But sources said the snag occurred much before that because of inclement weather.According to norms, the driver who is issued a PLCT is supposed to stop the train for a minute at each defective signal and then proceed at a speed not higher than 10kmph.V Balachandran, central organising secretary of the All-India Loco Running Staff Association, said that until the Commissioner of Railway Safety's report or the departmental fact-finding inquiry came to a conclusion, it was not advisable to put the blame on anyone. ""It will influence the inquiry to divert it as an error by the loco pilot in the eyes of the public and other railwaymen,"" he said.The assistant loco pilot of the goods train survived the collision but is not in a condition to have his statement recorded, officials said.","A copy of the PLCT (T/A 912) issued to the loco pilot by the stationmaster of Rangapani surfaced later in the day, authorising him to cross all red signals.

The sources told Reuters that a reduction in personal tax could boost consumption and increase savings for the middle class. The first source mentioned that individuals earning over Rs 15 lakh ($17,960.42) annually, up to a certain undetermined amount, may receive some tax relief.

The changes could be made to the new income tax regime introduced in 2020, where annual income up to Rs 15 lakh is taxed at rates between 5% and 20%, while earnings over Rs 15 lakh are taxed at 30%.

The second source pointed out that the personal tax rate increases six-fold when an individual's income rises from Rs 300,000 to Rs 15 lakh, which they described as ""quite steep.""

The government may also consider lowering personal tax rates for annual incomes of Rs 10 lakh, according to the first source. They added that a new threshold is being discussed for income taxed at the highest rate of 30% under the old tax system.

The second source noted that any loss of tax income to the government through tax cuts could be partially offset by increased consumption from this category of income earners.

Why Murthy wants these social media changes



“The mental health crisis among young people is an emergency — and social media has emerged as an important contributor.”

US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy is calling for a change in how social media interacts with the youth. He has urged Congress to make it mandatory for social media platforms to display warning labels (similar to those found on tobacco and alcohol products) that will highlight the potential mental health risks associated with excessive use.These proposed labels aim to raise awareness among both parents and adolescent users about the potential negative impacts of social media on mental health.Murthy hopes that by increasing transparency and prompting reflection on usage habits, these warnings will encourage healthier online behaviour.Apart from these warning labels, Murthy has also called for legislation that will protect young users from online harassment, abuse, exploitation, and exposure to extreme violence and sexual content on social media.Murthy said that these protections alongside others that recommend banning platforms from collecting children’s data and restricting features like push notifications, autoplay, and infinite scroll should also be implemented. This social media feature “prey on developing brains and contribute to excessive use,” Murthy pointed out.He also wants the US government to force social media companies to allow independent safety audits and share the data related to health effects with independent scientists and the public.In an article published in The New York Times, Murthy wrote:He also cited studies that have found almost half of adolescents say social media gives them body image issues and that those who spend over three hours a day on it are twice as likely to face symptoms of anxiety and depression.In May 2023, Murthy issued another advisory while acknowledging that the subject wasn’t fully understood. At that time, he warned that social media poses a “profound risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.”","US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy is calling for a change in how social media interacts with the youth.

According to Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, a Republican, ""Pfizer made multiple misleading statements to deceive the public about its vaccine at a time when Americans needed the truth."" The lawsuit alleges that Pfizer hid evidence linking the vaccine to pregnancy complications, including miscarriage, as well as heart inflammation (myocarditis and pericarditis) shortly after the vaccine's rollout in early 2021.

Pfizer has denied the allegations, stating, ""The representations made by Pfizer about its Covid-19 vaccine have been accurate and science-based."" The company believes the lawsuit has no merit. In June 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration added a warning about the rare side effects of myocarditis and pericarditis to the vaccine's label, which primarily affect adolescent boys and young men. A 2023 review by the US National Institutes of Health found no link between Covid vaccines and miscarriage.

The lawsuit also claims that Pfizer falsely stated that its vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech for the original strain of the virus, maintained high effectiveness against mutated variants and could prevent not only illness but also transmission. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a similar lawsuit against Pfizer last year, which is still pending and has also been called meritless by the company.

Attorney General Kobach indicated that other states have been collaborating with Kansas in its investigation and are expected to file similar lawsuits. BioNTech is not named as a defendant in the case.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Later Tuesday, he is to become the first premier to visit Malaysia since 2015.Li, China's second-most powerful leader after president Xi Jinping, will inspect iron ore miner Fortescue 's clean energy research facility in Perth.Fortescue's chairman Andrew Forrest said Li was interested in the company's plans to produce iron ore without carbon emissions and potentially ""green iron.""""I think China chose us because it's not just the best technology to go green in Australia, it's the best technology to go green in the world, and we've got real examples of it in trains, ship engines, trucks,"" Fortescue said.The Perth facility is testing technology on hydrogen, ammonia and batter power for trains, ships, trucks and heavy mining equipment.Li will also visit Chinese-controlled tianqi lithium energy Australia's processing plant south of Perth to underscore China's interest in investing in critical minerals. The plant produces battery-grade lithium hydroxide for electric vehicles.Australia shares US concerns over China's global dominance in critical minerals and control over supply chains in the renewable energy sector.Citing Australia's national interests, treasurer Jim Chalmers recently ordered five Chinese-linked companies to divest their shares in the rare earth mining company Northern Minerals.Prime minister Anthony Albanese wrote in an opinion piece published in Perth's main newspaper, The West Australian, on Tuesday that his government was acting to ensure foreign investment ""continues to serve our national interests.""""This includes reforming the foreign investment framework so that it's more efficient, more transparent and more effective at managing risk,"" Albanese wrote.Forrest said the national risk from Chinese investment in the critical minerals sector was overstated.""Australia should be producing all the critical minerals in the world because we're a great mining country, so by all means let's go in harder after critical minerals, but let's not do it with panic because there is no reason for panic,"" Forrest said.Qiang and Albanese flew to Perth in separate planes late Monday from the national capital Canberra, where the two leaders held an official annual meeting with senior ministers in Parliament House.Albanese revealed that his office had complained to the Chinese Embassy about the behaviour of two officials during a media event with the two leaders after the meeting.Australia had ""concerns"" about two Chinese officials who stood in the way of cameras taking images of well-known Australian journalist Cheng Lei sitting with other reporters as the leaders spoke, Albanese said.Cheng spent more than three years in detention in China for breaking an embargo with a broadcast on a state-run TV network while she was based in Beijing. She was released last year after interventions by the Australian government and now works for Sky News Australia.""When you look at the footage, it was a pretty clumsy attempt, frankly, by a couple of people to stand in between where the cameras were and where Cheng Lei was sitting,"" Albanese told Australian broadcasting corp.""There should be no impediments to Australian journalists going about their job, and we've made that clear to the Chinese embassy,"" Albanese added.Chinese-born, Cheng told Sky News on Monday, the officials ""went to great lengths to block me from the cameras and to flank me.""""I'm only guessing that it's to prevent me from saying something or doing something that they think would be a bad look. But that in itself was a bad look,"" Cheng said.The embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Li and Albanese made statements during the press event, but neither took questions from the assembled journalists.",Chinese premier Li Qiang ends his Australian tour on Tuesday in the West Coast city of Perth.

Preservation marvel: 250-year-old cherries discovered at first US president George Washington's mansion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/preservation-marvel-250-year-old-cherries-discovered-at-first-us-president-george-washingtons-mansion/articleshow/111067712.cms,"George Washington , the first US president, is often associated with the famous story of cutting down a cherry tree, which is not historically accurate. However, a recent archaeological discovery at his Mount Vernon estate revealed that Washington had a fondness for cherries and other fruits. During a restoration project, dozens of bottles containing perfectly preserved cherries and berries were found in storage pits in the cellar of his mansion on the Potomac River.The discovery of such well-preserved fruit from over 250 years ago is considered extremely rare and remarkable. Mount Vernon's principal archaeologist, Jason Boroughs, emphasized the significance of the find, stating, ""Finding what is essentially fresh fruit, 250 years later, is pretty spectacular.""Mount Vernon is collaborating with the US department of agriculture to conduct DNA testing on the fruit and examine the cherry pits to determine if any can be used to grow new trees. Although the chances of successfully growing a tree from the waterlogged pits are slim, the bottles themselves provide valuable insights into preservation techniques and the dietary preferences of the Washingtons.Historical records indicate that George and Martha Washington enjoyed cherries, particularly when mixed with brandy, as evidenced by Martha's recipe for a ""cherry bounce"" cocktail. However, the cherries found in the bottles were likely intended to be consumed as fresh fruit. The exceptional preservation quality of the fruit is attributed to the highly skilled work of the enslaved individuals who managed the plantation's kitchen and oversaw the bottling process.The bottles were discovered during a $40 million revitalization project of the mansion, which is expected to be completed by the nation's 250th birthday in 2026. The archaeological work, which is inherently destructive, was necessary due to the structural repairs required for the mansion. The bottles predate 1775, as determined by the expansion of the mansion that led to the area being covered with a brick floor.In total, 35 bottles were found in six distinct storage pits, with 29 bottles intact and six broken. The bottles contained a mix of cherries and other berries, believed to be currants and gooseberries.

US surgeon gen calls for warning labels on social media platforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-surgeon-gen-calls-for-warning-labels-on-social-media-platforms/articleshow/111067605.cms,"The US surgeon general , Vivek Murthy, announced Monday that he would push for a warning label on social media platforms advising parents that using the platforms might damage adolescents' mental health.Warning labels - like those that appear on tobacco and alcohol products - are one of the most powerful tools available to the nation's top health official, but Dr. Murthy cannot unilaterally require them; the action requires approval by Congress. No such legislation has yet been introduced in either chamber. A warning label would send a powerful message to parents ""that social media has not been proved safe,"" Dr. Murthy wrote in an essay published in NYT opinion section on Monday.In his essay, he cast the effects of social media on children and teenagers as a public health risk on par with road fatalities or contaminated food. ""Why is it that we have failed to respond to the harms of social media when they are no less urgent or widespread than those posed by unsafe cars, planes or food?"" he wrote. ""These harms are not a failure of willpower and parenting; they are consequence of unleashing powerful technology without adequate safety measures, transparency or accountability.""Murthy pointed to research that showed that teens who spent more than three hours a day on social media faced a significantly higher risk of mental health problems, and that 46% of adolescents said social media made them feel worse about their bodies.US teens are spending an average of 4.8 hours per day on platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, according to a Gallup survey of over 1,500 adolescents released last fall.Past warning labels have had significant effects on behaviour. In 1965, after a landmark report from the surgeon general, Congress voted to require all cigarette packages distributed in the US to carry a warning that using the product ""may be hazardous to your health."" That was the beginning of a 50-year decline in smoking. When the warning labels appeared, around 42% of US adults were daily cigarette smokers; by 2021, that portion had dropped to 11.5%.","Vivek Murthy, the US surgeon general, announced Monday that he would push for a warning label on social media platforms advising parents that using the platforms might damage adolescents' mental health.

"US severe weather: Heat moves east, storms threaten Plains, snow falls in the Rockies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-severe-weather-heat-moves-east-storms-threaten-plains-snow-falls-in-the-rockies/articleshow/111067529.cms,"PHOENIX: Hot and cold extremes are expected this week in the US Officials warned residents from coast to coast to take precautions as a heat wave moved east, while heavy rains and flooding could drench the Gulf states and snow threatens parts of the Rockies and Northwest.Extreme heat spread across Arizona, New Mexico and parts of Texas, Colorado and Kansas as severe weather swept across many parts of the US on Sunday. There was unseasonable cold in the Pacific Northwest, snow headed to the northern Rocky Mountains and heavy rainfall forecast from the northern Plains to the Upper Midwest.The National Weather Service estimated more than 63 million people were under heat advisories on Sunday, stretching from the Southwest northward up through Denver and into Chicago. Much of the Midwest and Northeast were under heat warnings or watches on Monday.Temperatures in Phoenix, which hit 112 degrees Fahrenheit (44.4 Celsius) on Saturday, eased slightly on Sunday to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 Celsius). Weather service forecasters say the first two weeks of June in Phoenix already have been an average of 5.6 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than normal, making it the hottest start to June on record.""We have already seen some pretty significantly high temperatures in our area,"" said Ted Whittock, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix. ""We are recommending that everyone reduce their time outdoors between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., stay hydrated and wear light, looser fitting clothing.""The heat in metro Phoenix will ease a bit Monday through Wednesday, with the highs pushing back up as the week progresses, likely prompting another excessive heat warning, Whittock said.The heat has been especially dangerous in recent years in metro Phoenix, where 645 people died from heat-related causes in 2023, which was a record.The city and Maricopa County have adopted additional measures this year in hopes of keeping people safer, including two new overnight cooling centers where people can rest in air conditioning after the sun goes down. There are more than 100 other cooling centers that have been open since May 1 where people can get cold water and sit in a cool space during daytime hours.In neighboring New Mexico, a heat advisory was in effect over the weekend for the Chavez County plains including Roswell, where the high was forecast to hit 107 degrees F (41.6 degrees C) on Monday. The high for Albuquerque reached 99 degrees F (37 C) on Sunday and is forecast to cool slightly to 98 degrees F (36 C) on Monday. The high Sunday was 104 F (40 C) in El Paso, Texas, which opened five cooling centers.Temperatures in Colorado ranged from near 90 degrees F (32.2 C) in areas of metropolitan Denver Sunday to 100 degrees F (37.7 C) in the southern city of Pueblo, with temperatures expected to surpass 100 degrees F Monday in the southern reaches of the state.The heat wave was moving eastward Sunday into the Plains and the Great Lakes area and was expected to arrive in the Northeast by Tuesday. The threat of thunderstorms with potential high winds and heavy rainfall increased in the Chicago area, even as heat indices were forecast to reach near 100 degrees F (37.7 C) through the middle of the week.As the heat wave spreads eastward, temperatures in Washington, D.C., and the rest of the mid-Atlantic, as well as New England, were likely to see highs in the mid- to upper-90s as the week progresses, with excessive humidity making it feel even more oppressive.The US last year saw the most heat waves, consisting of abnormally hot weather lasting more than two days, since 1936.While much of the country swelters, late season snow was forecast for the northern Rockies Monday and Tuesday. Parts of Montana and north-central Idaho were under a winter storm warning , with as much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of heavy, wet snow expected in the mountains around Missoula, Montana. As much as 20 inches (51 centimeters) was predicted for higher elevations around Glacier National Park.Meanwhile, a fresh batch of tropical moisture will bring an increasing threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to the central Gulf Coast late Sunday into Monday. Heavy rain is expected to start Monday morning, with the moisture shifting toward the Gulf Coast by Tuesday.The intense flooding from heavy rains continued to dissipate in southern Florida, where some areas in and around Miami and Fort Lauderdale were left underwater in recent days as storms dumped up to 20 inches (50 centimeters).That unnamed storm system coincided with the early start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.","Extreme heat spreads across Arizona, New Mexico and parts of Texas, Colorado and Kansas.

Fear of Trump 2.0: Preparations underway in US to counter potential second Trump presidency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fear-of-trump-2-0-preparations-underway-in-us-to-counter-potential-second-trump-presidency/articleshow/111064362.cms,"NEW DELHI: Adversaries of Donald Trump are preparing potential legal actions in anticipation of his possible reelection in November and the implementation of his promised mass deportations , New York Times reported.The fear that Trump's return to power would not only jeopardize their agenda but also American democracy itself has brought together Democratic officials , progressive activists, watchdog groups, and former Republicans, who are taking measures to prepare for a potential second Trump presidency.Despite the Supreme Court 's recent rejection of an attempt to nullify federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, liberals are concerned that a new Trump administration could rescind the approval or criminalize interstate distribution of the drug, the report said.In response, Washington governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, has secured a sufficient supply of mifepristone pills to ensure access for women in his state throughout a potential second Trump administration. ""We have it physically in the state of Washington, which could stop him and his anti-choice forces from prohibiting its distribution,"" Inslee said. ""It has a life span of five or six years. If there was another Trump administration, it'll get us through.""If Trump returns to power, he plans to implement radical changes, including using the Justice Department to seek revenge on his adversaries, deploying federal troops to Democratic cities, conducting mass deportations, establishing camps for immigrant detainees, facilitating the dismissal of civil servants and replacing them with loyalists, and expanding and centralizing executive power.Many centrist and left-leaning group leaders insist that their primary focus is on preventing Trump from regaining power in the first place. They are also cautious about publicly discussing their contingency plans to avoid signaling a lack of confidence in President Joe Biden's campaign prospects.The Biden administration pushed through numerous regulations in the spring, meeting a deadline to ensure that those rules could not be easily overturned next year if Trump wins the election and Republicans gain complete control of Congress. However, administration officials have generally been reluctant to engage in contingency planning, insisting they are confident Biden will secure a second term.A common tactic used to counter the first Trump administration was litigation that tied up his policies in court. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), one of the primary litigants against the first Trump administration, plans to assume a similar role if he regains the White House. The ACLU has identified 63 scenarios in which a new Trump administration could threaten individual rights and the rule of law, focusing on four areas for which it is drafting potential legal filings.Another hub of liberal resistance plans for a second Trump administration is Democracy Forward, an organization formed after Trump's 2016 victory that filed numerous legal challenges to his policies during his first term. The organization has developed a threat matrix covering issues such as abortion, health care, civil rights, environmental protections, immigration, and the ""weaponization of government.""However, there is a widely held view among Democrats that many types of legal actions may be less effective during a second Trump term than they were during his first, due to a more conservative Supreme Court remade by Trump. This legal reality has led those planning for a Trump return to power to focus on state-level actions that can be locked in before the 2024 election.Democratic governors and state attorneys general have been working together to plan litigation, pass shield laws to protect abortion providers and patients from penalties in other states, and secure stockpiles of abortion pills. The Reproductive Freedom Alliance, founded by California governor Gavin Newsom, serves as a hub for governors to coordinate their strategies and could be the foundation for broader collaboration to resist Trump's agenda.",Adversaries of Donald Trump are preparing potential legal actions in anticipation of his possible reelection in November and the implementation of his promised mass deportations. The fear that Trump's return to power would not only jeopardize their agenda but also American democracy itself has brought together Democratic officials.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111064720,imgsize-1317011,width-400,resizemode-4/111064720.jpg"
Pakistan: Tomato prices soar to PKR 200 per kg ahead of Eid festivities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tomato-prices-soar-to-pkr-200-per-kg-ahead-of-eid-festivities/articleshow/111049153.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The price of tomatoes has surged to over PKR 200 per kilogram in a single day just ahead of Eid al-Adha, despite the district government setting the price cap at PKR 100 per kilogram, as per reports.This annual occurrence during Ramadan and Eid al-Adha typically goes unnoticed by authorities, despite their assurances to the contrary.In response to the situation, the Peshawar Deputy Commissioner has taken action by imposing a ban, under Section 144, on transporting tomatoes out of the district.With Eid al-Adha merely two days away, local retail markets have seen tomato prices double, aligning with earlier predictions that tomatoes, along with onions, would once again be sold at inflated prices during this festive period.Residents of the area have expressed frustration, noting that prices have escalated by Rs100 per kilogram in just one day. Many believe that the district administration's efforts will likely be limited to verbal instructions, as has been the case in previous instances, as per reports.During the budget presentation, one of the standout assertions was the government's commitment to maintaining inflation at 12 per cent in the upcoming fiscal year. On the surface, this goal appears supported by various planned initiatives aimed at curbing inflation rates.However, the implementation of aggressive tax measures, highlighted as key revenue strategies, seems paradoxical as they could potentially escalate prices instead of stabilising them.Regardless of the method used to gauge inflation, the stark reality is that any figure exceeding the previous fiscal year's average monthly inflation rate of 24.9 per cent will inevitably lead to increased consumer prices.Abid Suleri, Executive Director of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), argues that the government ought to have adjusted the minimum taxable income thresholds to factor in inflation when outlining personal income tax brackets. He criticises the current monthly exemption of PKR 50,000 as insufficient and warns that doubling taxes on those falling within the initial tax slab could reduce their disposable income, thereby exacerbating economic hardships.Moreover, heightened fuel expenses stemming from amplified levies and augmented GST rates in specific sectors are anticipated to drive inflation even higher, intensifying the overall cost of living. Suleri emphasises the absence of any mention regarding the taxation of agricultural income, which he believes could substantially broaden the tax base, Dawn reported.","The price of tomatoes has surged to over PKR 200 per kilogram in a single day just ahead of Eid al-Adha.
