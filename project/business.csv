National Conference (NC) Vice President Omar Abdullah expressed optimism on Tuesday and hoped for a positive outcome as the election results were awaited.The NC leader also extended his best wishes to colleagues and allies, saying, “We fought the good fight & now, InshaAllah, the results will reflect that."" His remarks came at a critical juncture as the region awaits the final tally of votes following the recently concluded Assembly elections .A day earlier, Omar Abdullah had sought to deny rumours about the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) offering support to the National Conference.He emphasised the need to wait for the official results before jumping to conclusions and termed the speculations as premature. His comments were in response to his father, Farooq Abdullah ’s statement that the NC-Congress alliance might accept support from the PDP, even if it wasn’t required, as they should ""go ahead together.""He took the matter to social media platform X and wrote, “They haven’t extended support, they haven’t offered support and we don’t know what the voters have decided yet, so I really wish we could put a lid on all this premature speculation for the next 24 hours.”In the recently concluded Assembly elections, the Election Commission of India reported an overall voter turnout of 63.88 per cent across three phases. The final phase, held on October 1, saw a voter turnout of 69.69 per cent. This was the first Assembly election in Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370, marking a significant moment in the Union Territory’s political landscape.The NC and Congress, as part of the INDIA-bloc , contested the elections jointly, while the PDP and BJP ran independently.Remarkably, the elections saw a notable rise in voter participation in regions previously marked by militancy and electoral boycotts.",National Conference (NC) Vice President Omar Abdullah expressed optimism on Tuesday and hoped for a positive outcome as the election results were awaited.

NGLV Recovery & Reusability

BENGALURU: With India’s space mission expanding both in size and vision, the Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) is all geared up for the establishment of the third launch pad at its spaceport in Sriharikota.In an exclusive interview with TOI, Isro chairman S Somanath said: “We only have the second launch pad now. The first one was created for PSLV, but it can’t be used for GSLV as it cannot handle the cryogenic stage .When LVM-3 came, we re-engineered the second launch pad. Now, LVM-3 will also have a semi-cryo stage, and the human spaceflight initially has to happen there.”Pointing out that the second launch pad has been undergoing several improvements in the past two decades, Somanath said in case something happens to the second launch pad — an explosion, for instance — there won’t be a launch pad available for GSLV, and every programme will come to a standstill.“The primary objective of the third launch pad is to serve as a redundancy. Next is that we are moving to a new philosophy with the NGLV (New Generation Launch Vehicle); it is going to be integrated horizontally and tilted, not vertically. The launch pad must support this aspect. NGLV will be more liquid engine booster-based than solid engine, so the entire launch pad jet deflector design will change. Also, the entire stage testing will happen here and not at Mahendragiri. The launch pad will cater to all of this,” Somanath said.According to S Sivakumar, project director, NGLV, the need for the new rocket — a three-stage vehicle with a reusable first stage — comes in the wake of emerging technologies and the need to reduce launch costs, aside from the realisation that existing launch vehicles cannot meet future demands.“Current operational vehicles cannot meet future requirements because we are targeting a 20-tonne payload capacity to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) from LVM-3’s capacity of 9.2 tonnes. The target for Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) is 9 tonnes compared to the current 4.3 tonnes,” he said.“Both are possible, but both have penalties. For example, the vehicle already has a velocity to move away from land, and you have to kill all the velocity and bring it back to the launch site; you will need a lot of fuel, which means you’ll have lower payload capability,” Somanath said.He added: “Initially, you need to do that on land only because sea-based recovery is costly, and you won’t have such a platform available readily. Later, once you have confidence, you move to the sea and land it there. Both capabilities are there. When you do it at sea, you will get a higher payload.”On the NGLV’s reusability, Sivakumar said that while both vertical and horizontal landing options are available, the first stage needs to have a horizontal landing or a wing-body supported vertical landing. “Otherwise, the structural mass will be enormous,” he said in his talk on transportation vehicles on Oct 6.While the establishment of the launch pad got the National Space Commission nod at the 153rd meeting of the panel ahead of the Sept 18 Cabinet meeting, which cleared four big-ticket space projects — Chandrayaan-4, NGLV, Venus Orbiter Mission (VOM), and the establishment of the first module of India’s own space station — it will be put up before the govt by Isro for final approval.","The Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) is all geared up for the establishment of the third launch pad at its spaceport in Sriharikota.

NEW DELHI: The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations ( CISCE ), which conducts ICSE and ISC board exams, is gearing up for sweeping reforms with introduction of robotics and artificial intelligence as subjects for students of Classes XI and XII from 2025-26.At elementary level, these subjects will be offered in an integrated approach, where computer science will also include AI and coding.Another notable introduction will be a holistic progress card, which will provide a 360-degree assessment of students' progress in achieving learning outcomes. The changes will include increasing competency-based questions for Board exams starting with 25% in 2025 to 50% in 2027, and curriculum revision based on NCERT's National Curriculum Framework, among others.The changes targeted at bringing CISCE's academic and administrative practices in line with National Education Policy 2020, will impact over 30 lakh school students across country. One of the key initiatives is introduction of three-stage non-retaining digital assessments for Classes III, V, and VIII, starting from 2025-26 academic session. Envisioned in NE, these assessments will serve as diagnostic tools for remediation and identifying gifted students.Joseph Emmanuel, CEO & secretary of CISCE, said, ""This approach, integrating humanities, arts, and STEM subjects, has shown positive outcomes, including increased creativity, innovation, critical thinking, & higher-order thinking capacities.""A major shift will be seen in assessment, with the initiation of competency-based education from 2025. In Board exams, 25% questions will be competency-based in 2025, increasing to 40% in 2026 and 50% in 2027. The aim is to test core competencies rather than memorised facts, making Classes X and XII Board exams ""easier"".CISCE will also roll out a school improvement plan from next year . Emmanuel further added, ""The larger vision is for high-performing schools to voluntarily work with state govts to improve quality of govt schools.""","The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations ( CISCE) is gearing up for sweeping reforms.

HIV prevention therapy likely to become cheaper but accessibility concerns remain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hiv-prevention-therapy-likely-to-become-cheaper-but-accessibility-concerns-remain/articleshow/114024882.cms,"US pharma giant Gilead Sciences' partnership with domestic companies to produce generic versions of its groundbreaking HIV prevention therapy, lenacapavir , is expected to make treatment significantly more affordable, with prices likely to drop to a fraction of those charged in the US. However, despite this potential for reduced costs, concerns persist regarding accessibility in high-incidence developing countries and those experiencing rising HIV infections.On Oct 2, Gilead announced it will allow generic manufacturers including Dr Reddy's, Emcure, Hetero and Mylan - to produce a generic version of the twice-yearly HIV injection in 120 low- and lower-middle-income countries. The pathbreaking AIDS therapy which costs around $44,000 for twice-yearly injections in the US, has garnered attention for its potential in HIV prevention globally. ""Given the transformative potential of lenacapavir for prevention, our focus is on making it available as quickly and broadly as possible where the need is greatest,"" said Daniel O'Day, chairman and CEO of Gilead.The entry of generics is projected to drastically reduce prices in India from the exorbitant $40,000 per patient per year to around $200-300 within next couple of years, following necessary regulatory approvals. A study by Liverpool University estimated that prices for generic lenacapavir could initially fall to $100 per person per year and eventually reach $40 per person per year as production volumes increase. ""We are not able to comment on pricing at this point. However, the aim of this collaboration is to increase access so we will price it affordably,"" a Dr Reddy's spokesperson said.Patent and public health experts argue that voluntary license (VL) granted by Gilead is ""restrictive,"" limiting the ability of generics to significantly contribute to ending the decades-long HIV pandemic. ""The VL appears good on paper. However, it seeks to control production of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), key to production of affordable versions, while failing to fully utilise the capabilities of large API manufacturers like Natco, Lupin, Aurobindo and Laurus Labs. And for finished formulation - Lupin, Strides and Aurobindo. If overall supply of API is restricted, a reduction in the prices could take longer,"" Leena Menghaney, India Head of Medecins Sans Frontieres Access Campaign told TOI.A faster regulatory approval for patients here hinges on waiver of local clinical trials, she added.Gilead has filed patents widely on the drug, and the VL meant to overcome patent barriers will not make lenacapavir accessible in key countries, KM Gopa Kumar a senior researcher with Third World Network said.","US pharma giant Gilead Sciences' partnership with domestic companies to produce generic versions of its groundbreaking HIV prevention therapy, lenacapavir.

Infamous 'bride bazaar' of Hyderabad moves online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/infamous-bride-bazaar-of-hyderabad-moves-online/articleshow/114023971.cms,"TOI

TOI

HYDERABAD: Fatima (name changed) is decked up for her wedding day. An embellished kameez under the burqa and a bold lip, modestly hidden behind the veil. But her cheeks are washed out. There's no new-bride twinkle in her eyes.This marriage, after all, isn't one for the albums. She signed up for it only to get her ailing grandmother out of hospital and put her younger sister through school.The 22-year-old's prospective groom - close to three times her age - has promised Rs 2 lakh for this nikah and for her to be sent to him in Oman.Fatima is just another bride from the bazaars of Hyderabad's Old City that continue to flourish and cater to rich Arab clients , albeit stealthily. These ""transactions"" have now resurfaced online.Instead of shady halls and hotels, these marriages are now performed on WhatsApp, with many claiming “business” is better than ever. Famously chronicled in ‘Bazaar’, the 1982 film starring Smita Patil, Naseeruddin Shah and Farooq Shaikh, this decades-old “trade” of young girls being wedded to aged men with deep pockets — often for just a few weeks — had slowed down post a series of crackdowns in 2018. Many even assumed it had died out. But, as Fatima’s tale and those others suggest, they were mistaken.Fatima’s wedding venue was right in the middle of the road. “They asked me to go to Mysuru with them to complete the nikah… I got scared and refused,” the stoic Fatima told, stepping out of an autorickshaw that had pulled up on the side of a crowded Chadrayangutta market where she’d been dropped off an hour ago. “They” here are agents — two burly men in an SUV — who had set up Fatima’s video-conference-nikah inside the car. The agents’ fee: Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh.Now, with the deal called off, the young woman must wait for her next proposal.“At least 20 to 30 such weddings are happening every month,” said Hussain (name changed), who has been brokering such marriages for years now. “If not me, someone else will do it… there’s tremendous demand,” he nonchalantly puts it, showing off his phone gallery that has at least half a dozen photos and videos of young girls “shortlisted” for these nikahs. The girls are between 18 and 25 years old.There’s a folder for grooms as well. Visibly wealthy Arab men looking for their next bride. And while many of them appear well past their 50s, their ID cards claim they aren’t a day older than 35, or 39 at best. Almost all are businessmen from Oman, Bahrain, Qatar etc.“Unlike earlier when they travelled to Hyderabad to physically choose their bride, the entire process is online these days. The men are sent photographs of the girls and once they make their selection, agents on both sides strike a deal. Then a date is fixed, a qazi is taken on a video call — most of them are from Hyderabad or Mumbai — and the nikah is completed,” Hussain explained.He was speaking in between answering a call from an agent in Oman who said that her client wasn’t happy with the photos of prospective brides sent to him.listened in to the conversation: “…mere paas aur aisi bacchiyan hain… main bhejti hoon (I have more girls like this… I will send their photos),” the agent is heard saying, relaying to Hussain what she had told her client.Audio recordings and conversations with more young girls and their agents revealed that after these weddings, these women are sent to their husbands on tourist visas. What happens to them next is tough to hazard a guess on.“I had to run away from the house because I realised the man was too old and he had taken me there to keep me as a domestic help. I also got only Rs 5,000 as opposed to Rs 2 lakh promised initially. The rest was siphoned off by the agents, including a lady in Oman who hosted us initially,” said Suhana*, another 20 something from the city who had to plead with her family back home to borrow some money to help her return.“It’s very tough to trap the culprits because the entire process is online. Brokers, visa agents must be closely monitored and local public representatives must be involved to arrest this activity,” a senior Telangana police officer said.","The decades-old 'trade' of young girls being wedded to aged men with deep pockets has resurfaced online.

PM Modi accepts Muizzu invite to visit Maldives next year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-accepts-muizzu-invite-to-visit-maldives-next-year/articleshow/114023922.cms,"NEW DELHI: As PM Narendra Modi and Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu sought to boost ties in a bilateral meeting, India announced support in the form of $400 million and Rs 3,000 crore as a bilateral currency swap agreement which, Muizzu acknowledged, will be instrumental in tackling the ongoing financial challenges faced by his country.Looking to strengthen strategic ties, including through increased defence cooperation , Modi and Muizzu agreed to comprehensively transform the bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership.While underlining India’s traditional support to the Maldives as the first responder, Modi announced the two sides will initiate discussions for a Free Trade Agreement.“Today, as per the need of Maldives, a currency swap agreement of USD 400 million and INR 3000 crore (INR 30 billion) has also been concluded,” said Modi, adding Muizzu’s visit marked a “new chapter” in ties. The Maldivian President also invited Modi to visit the island nation next year when the two countries celebrate the 60th anniversary of establishment of bilateral ties . “PM Modi accepted President Muizzu's invitation to visit Maldives next year.” foreign secretary Vikram Misri said.The two sides signed five MoUs and made several announcements, including the inauguration of the new runway of Hanimaadhoo International Airport and another for refit of a Maldivian Coast Guard ship.Muizzu said India is a key partner in the socioeconomic and infrastructure development of the Maldives, and has stood by the Maldives during its times of need.“I am thankful for the Indian govt’s decision to provide support in the form of INR 30 billion, in addition to $ 400 million bilateral currency swap agreement, which will be instrumental in addressing the foreign exchange issues we are facing right now. Our discussions today underscored a shared commitment to remain engaged on further measures that will bolster the Maldives’ economic resilience and stability,” he said, adding the Maldives will remain a true friend, committed to the shared vision of peace and development in the region.Modi said he engaged in comprehensive discussions on various aspects of defence and security cooperation. “We will continue our cooperation in training and capacity building of the Maldives National Defence Forces. Together, we will strive for stability and prosperity in the Indian Ocean Region.We will enhance our cooperation in hydrography and disaster response,” he said.“India has consistently acted as the first responder for the Maldives. Be it essential commodities for the people of the Maldives, providing drinking water during natural disasters, delivering vaccines during the COVID pandemic, India has consistently upheld its responsibilities as a neighbour,” he added. “In future, we will work to connect India and the Maldives through UPI as well,” Modi said.The bilateral ties took a hit when Maldivian ministers made critical remarks about Modi last year. However, Muizzu has since toned down his anti-India stance and even sacked ministers who were critical of Modi. ""Yaarana jaari rahega (friendly ties will continue),"" Misri said when asked how India managed to bridge the sharp divide in the bilateral ties that had emerged.India extended emergency financial support to the Maldives last month by subscribing to its $50 million treasury bill at the request of Muizzu's govt, days after China agreed to strengthen trade and investment in the Indian Ocean nation.“Development partnership is a key pillar of our relationship.And we always give preference to the priorities of Maldivian people in this context,” said Modi, adding India is Maldives closest neighbour and a steadfast friend.

Fay and Michelle were trying to summit the unclimbed southeast buttress of the Chaukhamba-III peak when they lost their gear and essential supplies, leaving them vulnerable to freezing temperatures.Manners, 37, told a London newspaper: ""We would have either frozen to death or attempted to cross the steep glaciers without the right equipment and slipped to our peril."" She and Michelle, 31, lost almost all their equipment, food and water in a rockfall on Wednesday as they tried to become the first team to summit the 6,995-metre peak. They were stranded in temperatures as low as minus 15°C, surviving for three nights with nothing but a sleeping bag.The pair had been climbing for five days when the rockfall severed a rope they were using to haul a rucksack behind them. In a social media post, Fay said, “I watched the bag tumble down the mountain and I immediately knew the consequence of what was to come.” The loss of gear forced them to abandon their summit attempt and battle the extreme conditions for survival.“Losing the bag devastated us, knowing we had to deal with this crisis in an exhausted state,” she added. Without their tent, stove and crampons, they were left exposed to freezing conditions and at risk of hypothermia.Reflecting on the critical moment, Fay said: “Nothing can describe the sinking feeling when we saw our bag with essential supplies tumble down the mountain.” Without proper equipment, they faced the danger of freezing or starving. That night, they found a small ledge to shelter on and crawled into a double sleeping bag they luckily still had. “I was freezing; my down trousers, thicker socks, and all the warmer clothes I had in my bag for the evenings were no longer accessible,” Fay told Telegraph (London).The climbers had set off from their base camp on the Satopanth Glacier on Sept 27 to attempt the unclimbed route but faced increasingly hazardous conditions.Despite sending out an SOS, the pair felt hopeless when a rescue helicopter flew by twice without spotting them. “I felt hypothermic, constantly shaking, and with the lack of food, my body was running out of energy to keep warm,” Fay was quoted by the UK paper as saying. By Saturday, they had barely survived another night. “We were destroyed and we were losing faith,” she admitted. It was only after a team of three French mountaineers, who were in the area for their own summit attempt, spotted them that their ordeal came to an end. “It was a small miracle,” Fay said. “As we were abseiling down on Saturday, we could see a team of climbers coming up the mountain towards us.”The French climbers provided the much-needed support, helping Fay and Michelle cross the steep glacier and giving them food and water. “They gave us their tent and sleeping bags and finally told the helicopter where to come and collect us,” Fay said. In fact, the French climbers abandoned their ascent to the peak to help the stranded duo.On Sunday, an Indian Air Force helicopter landed at 5,300 metres above sea level on the Panpatia Bank Glacier and airlifted the pair to safety in Joshimath. Col Madan Gurung, who coordinated the rescue operation for the Indian Mountaineering Foundation, said that the women were “exhausted” but otherwise “perfectly fine”.","British alpinist Fay Jane Manners recounted the harrowing experience that left them stranded for four nights at 20,997 feet (6,400m) Fay and Michelle were trying to summit the unclimbed southeast buttress of the Chaukhamba-III peak when they lost their gear and essential supplies, leaving them vulnerable to freezing temperatures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114024065,imgsize-83304,width-400,resizemode-4/114024065.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu on Monday expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the government's decision to provide financial assistance of Rs 30 billion ($360 million), in addition to a $400 million bilateral currency swap agreement .""I am thankful for the Indian Government's decision to provide support in the form of Rs 30 billion in addition to $400 million bilateral currency swap agreement which will be instrumental in addressing the foreign exchange issues we are facing right now,"" Muizzu said, ANI reported.The agreements were signed during the bilateral and delegation-level talks held at Hyderabad House in New Delhi.Prime Minister Modi described the ""development partnership"" as a key pillar in the relations between India and the Maldives, stating that India has always prioritised the needs of the Maldivian people.Furthermore, PM Modi and President Muizzu witnessed the first transaction of RuPay card payments launched in the Maldives, and virtually inaugurated the runway of Hanimaadhoo International Airport.The runway was developed with a concessional line of credit funding from India.PM Modi in a joint press statement along with President Muizzu said that India and the Maldives will be connected through UPI in the future, adding that, ""A few days back, RuPay card was launched in Maldives. In the time to come, India and Maldives will be connected through UPI.""In September, India announced that the State Bank of India would subscribe to $50 million worth of Maldivian government bonds. Earlier, in May 2024, SBI had similarly subscribed to $50 million in T-bills under the same mechanism, following a request from the Government of Maldives.President Muizzu, who is on a five-day visit to India, was accorded a ceremonial reception at the Rashtrapati Bhavan and met with external affairs minister S Jaishankar.This marks Muizzu's second visit to India this year, following his attendance at Prime Minister Modi's swearing-in ceremony in June.Elaborating on the Indian government's decision to provide financial assistance to Maldives' struggling economy, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said: ""In so far as the currency swap agreement is concerned, this is an agreement that has two elements to it. There is the element to allow Maldives to avail a $400 million window and a separate Rs 30 billion window under this. The idea is essentially to bolster Maldives' foreign exchange reserves, and that they have access to these reserves.""Misri added that India will also undertake the repairs and refit of the Maldives Coast Guard ship Huravee which is a patrol vessel that had been gifted to Maldives by the government of India a few years ago.The Maldives Anti-Corruption Commission and the Central Bureau of Investigation of India have also inked an MoU on cooperation in preventing and combating corruption.","Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu on Monday expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the government's decision to provide financial assistance.

IAF quietly shooting down 'Chinese spy balloons' at high altitudes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-quietly-shooting-down-chinese-spy-balloons-at-high-altitudes/articleshow/113993660.cms,"NEW DELHI: The IAF has quietly been practising shooting targets mimicking Chinese spy balloons at very high-altitudes, with the latest instance being of an omni-role Rafale fighter jet using an air-to-air missile to bring down such a target in the eastern sector a few months ago.The IAF began drawing up contingency plans for such an eventuality after a 200-foot-tall intelligence-gathering Chinese balloon flew over continental US for several days in Jan-Feb 2023 before it was finally shot down by an American F-22 Raptor using an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile.The US had shared information with India and other countries about the incident.""The IAF formulated TTPs (tactics, techniques and procedures) to handle such contingencies. It has been practising the capability to interject in such situations at different flight envelopes,"" a source told TOI.""Rafale's demonstration was at an altitude of over 55,000 feet, way over what had been practised earlier. The target balloon, with a payload, was relatively smaller than the Chinese one that violated US airspace,"" he added.The fifth-generation F-22 flying at an altitude of 58,000 feet, had launched the missile to hit the balloon at an altitude of well over 60,000 feet on Feb 4 last year.The IAF's 4.5-generation Rafale, which are armed with the 120-150-km range 'Meteor' and 70-km MICA air-to-air missiles among other weapons, in turn, went after the target that was flying at an altitude of over 55,000 feet.Chinese spy balloons, which are akin to huge unmanned airships and capable of sending ""burst transmissions"", are difficult to detect and intercept since they have low radar cross-sections and fly at very high altitudes.In early-2022, a high-altitude balloon-like object was spotted over the strategically located Andaman and Nicobar islands but nothing much could be done because India as yet does not deploy fighters on the archipelago on a permanent basis, though IAF fighters do operate from the islands on short-term detachments for exercises.China, of course, also regularly deploys its 'spy' vessels in the Bay of Bengal and southern India Ocean to track India's ballistic missile launches as well as map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.The IAF has based its 36 Rafales at the Hasimara and Ambala airbases. Hasimara is close to the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction and the strategically-vulnerable Siliguri Corridor on the eastern front with China.",The IAF began drawing up contingency plans for such an eventuality after a 200-foot-tall intelligence-gathering Chinese balloon flew over continental US for several days in Jan-Feb 2023.

India set to discuss surge in silver imports with UAE,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-set-to-discuss-surge-in-silver-imports-with-uae/articleshow/114025866.cms,"Piyush Goyal

MUMBAI/ NEW DELHI: India's concerns over a surge in silver imports from UAE after implementation of a bilateral trade agreement is expected to be taken up during a joint meeting next week.""We have a joint trade committee which works on these issues. Next week they have a meeting in the UAE and that will be taken up over there. I have already discussed that issue with my counterpart Thani bin Ahhmed Al Zeyoudi and the UAE has assured that there will be nothing that will hurt India business interests and trade interests,"" commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal told reporters.Silver imports from UAE soared from $29 million 2022-23 to $1.7 billion during the last financial year, amid concerns of gaps in the implementation of rules of origin.The two govts are, however, upbeat on the progress made by the trade agreement. India and the UAE are also working on inter-linking two national payment platforms - UPI (India) and AANI (UAE) - to facilitate seamless cross border transactions between the two countries.At a press conference, Goyal also announced that India and the UAE would set up a food corridor, investing over $2 billion over two to two-and-a-half years, which will help Indian farmers earn higher income and create more jobs. The discussions also included plans to set up food parks in the country.""It has been under discussion for a very long time that the UAE would like to invest in setting up food processing facilities in India to enable the availability of high-quality products suitable to the UAE, using Indian farmers' products and to be sold in the UAE,"" the minister said after a meeting of India-UAE High-Level Task Force on Investment.Without giving any timeline, Goyal said that the investments from UAE may touch $100 billion and flow into multiple sectors, including infrastructure and manufacturing.

Monetary policy committee meet: RBI moving closer to rate cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/monetary-policy-committee-meet-rbi-moving-closer-to-rate-cut/articleshow/114029546.cms,"Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das

There is agreement that the Reserve Bank of India needs to pivot from its hawkish hold to policy easing. Consensus is expecting the first cut in December. We think it will happen at the Oct. 9 review. The three new external members on the monetary policy committee, along with the RBI members, are likely to focus on the latest developments — a jumbo Federal Reserve rate cut and hostilities in the Middle East that heighten supply-chain risks. Abhishek Gupta, India economist

Inflation rhetoric may be toned down

Bond markets could rally

India’s new monetary policy committee may lay the ground for an interest rate cut on Wednesday as a wave of global easing kicks off and growth in the world’s fastest-expanding major economy moderates.While most of the 35 economists in a Bloomberg survey expect the Reserve Bank of India ’s six-member MPC to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.5%, several predict a switch to a ‘neutral’ stance for the first time since June 2019 from its current hawkish view.The meeting is the first under a new policy committee following the appointment last week of three external members, well-known economists with academic and finance backgrounds.Governor Shaktikanta Das has so far dismissed calls for rate cuts, concerned that high food prices will prevent inflation from staying at the 4% target level on a sustainable basis. However, with the US Federal Reserve now pivoting and other central banks following with rate cuts, pressure is building on the RBI to do the same, especially after good rainfall and predictions of a bumper harvest.A change in the RBI’s policy stance language would pave the way for a quarter-point rate cut in December, according to economists at HSBC Plc.“We believe the RBI doesn’t gain from waiting any longer,” Pranjul Bhandari and Aayushi Chaudhary wrote in a note. They expect another quarter-point reduction at the February meeting, taking the repurchase rate to 6%.Here are some of the key issues to watch out for in the policy statement at 10 am:Three new external members joined the MPC, although only one of them — Saugata Bhattacharya, a former chief economist at Axis Bank Ltd — has publicly voiced his views on inflation and growth recently, advocating recently for the RBI to cut rates.However, economists said it’s unlikely the new members will vote against the three other RBI officials on the MPC so early on.They “may agree with RBI’s house view for some time,” said Rahul Bajoria, an economist at Bank of America Corp. “Still, incoming near-term data is much more mixed, and growth risks appear tilted to the downside,” he said, predicting a shift in policy stance.In the past two MPC meetings, external members Ashima Goyal and Jayanth Varma voted for rate cuts stating, arguing that the RBI’s insistence on keeping rates high was damaging growth. Abhishek Gupta , India economistThe RBI will likely stick to its fiscal year growth and inflation forecasts of 7.2% and 4.5%, respectively, although there’s a chance the quarterly CPI forecasts could be adjusted, particularly for the July-September period, said Kaushik Das, an economist at Deutsche Bank AG.The central bank had projected 4.4% inflation for the period, but the actual reading could turn out to be lower, in the range of 4-4.1%, he said.India had its best monsoon rains, which irrigate about half of the country’s farmland, since 2020, setting the stage for a bumper harvest of crops such as rice, and boosting economic prospects for rural areas.Since the last rate decision, official data showed economic growth moderated to 6.7% in the April-June quarter, below the central bank’s projection of 7.1%, while signs are growing of a softening in urban consumption.Any signs of dovishness from the central bank, such as a tweak in the policy stance language, could propel a bond rally. Traders are also watching any possible changes that could indicate easier liquidity conditions in the banking system. Yields have eased around 40 basis points from the year’s peak of 7.25% on hopes of RBI easing.“The next move from the RBI will be a rate cut,” said Nathan Sribalasundaram, a rates strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc in Singapore. “Favorable demand-supply, banks’ investment requirements and foreign investor demand will push yields lower.”",The Reserve Bank of India ’s six-member MPC to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.5%.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Some high-profile A-list celebrities are quietly settling with alleged victims to avoid being publicly named in lawsuits related to the Diddy sex assault case, according to attorney Tony Buzbee , who represents more than 120 alleged victims.The lawyer told TMZ that his firm is suing huge stars, and he’s giving them a chance to settle with victims to avoid being named publicly in the lawsuit .Some celebrities have opted to settle, he added.“In every single case, especially cases like this… because it’s in the best interests of the victim, we attempt to resolve these matters without the filing of a public lawsuit and we’ve done that already with a handful of individuals, many of which you’ve heard of before,” Buzbee said, as quoted by the New York Post.Buzbee is set to file a series of lawsuits this month, including cases representing 25 minors. He has already sent out demand letters notifying others, in addition to Combs, who will also face legal action.“If you were there in the room, participated, watched it happen and didn’t say anything or helped cover it up, in my view, you have a problem,” the plaintiff's lawyer said.“A lot of people saw this activity going on, a lot of people allowed it to go on, said nothing, didn’t intervene… all of these individuals and entities have exposure.”Buzbee stated that he plans to ‘aggressively’ pursue anyone who witnessed the alleged abuse but failed to intervene or protect the victims.However, Buzbee clarified that the disclosure of notable names won't happen this week.""Everyone is focused on which other celebrities were involved, who will be named, and who will be exposed. I don’t expect that to happen this week,"" he said.""We want to ensure that if we name individuals beyond Mr. Combs, we've done our homework, as it will spark a firestorm, and we're fully aware of that,"" he added.Combs, 54, has been in custody since he was arrested on September 16, he was accused of forcing women into drug-fueled sex sessions with male prostitutes, some lasting days.Authorities have claimed that the abuse lasted over a decade, involving violence or threats.Combs denies the allegations, including those involving minors, claiming that all the ‘ freak offs ’ were among consenting adults.","Some high-profile A-list celebrities are quietly settling with alleged victims to avoid being publicly named in lawsuits related to the Diddy sex assault case.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit , following India's refusal earlier. Last Friday, India confirmed that foreign minister S Jaishankar would lead a delegation to Pakistan for the summit in Islamabad.Responding to a question on Jaishankar's visit and India-Pakistan relations , the spokesperson said that Pakistan had ""officially received notification"" about the visit and is prepared to welcome all participating members.Further on the question of bilateral talks, the spokesperson cited Jaishnakar's refusal and assured to toe the same line.""Regarding your question about bilateral meetings, I would like you to refer to the remarks made by the Indian minister for external affairs on 5th of October, in which he maintained that his visit was meant for a multilateral event and not for discussing Pakistan-India relations. These remarks are self-explanatory,"" she said.The last time an Indian external affairs minister visited Pakistan was when Sushma Swaraj in December 2015 travelled for a forum on the Afghanistan issue. However, Jaishankar's upcoming visit is looked at as a significant move by New Delhi, given the strained bilateral relations between the two countries.Tensions escalated after India carried out airstrikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Balakot in February 2019, following the Pulwama terror attack. Relations worsened further after India revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status and reorganised the state into two union territories in August 2019, leading Pakistan to downgrade diplomatic ties.India has consistently stated its desire for normal relations with Pakistan, which New Delhi has said will depend on Islamabad creating an environment free of terrorism and hostility.In May 2023, Pakistan's then foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India for an SCO foreign ministers' meeting in Goa, marking the first such visit by a Pakistani foreign minister in nearly 12 years.Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, however, confirmed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will chair the upcoming Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting of the SCO.""We expect high-level participation from SCO members; the observer state of Mongolia; Turkmenistan as a special guest; and representatives of the international organisations, including Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and European Economic Community (EEC),"" she said.The spokesperson stated that the CHG meeting will focus on discussions regarding cooperation in areas such as the economy, trade, environment, and socio-cultural connections, while also reviewing the SCO's overall performance.","Pakistan has ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit.

Reality via research

Same old story

all

Remember that movie,? It opens with a manager of a ritzy London hotel acting snooty to a Singaporean mom and her kids. Why don’t you try Chinatown, the manager tells them, in a fine example of British racist prejudice. Mighty cheesed off, mom calls her husband, who solves the problem – by buying the hotel his family was trying to check into.That scene tells you everything about Singapore’s wealth.It reinforced a certain image of the city-state. Singapore – everything’s shiny, everyone’s happy. This is a country where a popular slogan was built around the idea of material possessions. Called “5Cs”, it defined Singaporeans’ aspirations – cash, country club membership, car, credit card and condo. Plenty of people in other countries want/have these things, too. Only Singapore coined a slogan around this.Plus…This is by no means an exhaustive list of what makes Singapore tick.But…Singapore is not all shiny, happy.A well-heeled visitor driving down a beautiful road from Changi airport to a world class hotel, thence to dine at a world class restaurant (Singapore hosts five of the world’s top 100 restaurants) won’t probably see this, or even know about it – there’s poverty , some of it deep, in Singapore. And it’s a problem likely to sharpen because the city-state, like many rich countries, is ageing.Most countries define a poverty line, a level of income/expenditure that differentiates the poor from the non-poor. There's a good reason for this. A poverty line allows policymakers to better target those who need the most help. India has a poverty line, so does America, and so do most countries. Singapore doesn’t.Why? Singapore govt’s approach, as Arabella Woo wrote in a London School of Economics research paper (“Inequality in Singapore: The Hidden Poor”) is “to reward citizens in alignment with the work that is done”. As for economically vulnerable citizens, govt wants “citizens…to protect themselves…to do it themselves”.If that’s your take on poverty, obviously there’ll be no official poverty line. Naturally, there’s no official count of poor people either.With govt not defining poverty, researchers have had to work with other data. A superbly researched paper (“A handbook on inequality, poverty and unmet social needs in Singapore”), by Catherine J Smith, John A Donaldson, Sanushka Mudaliar, Mumtaz Md Kadir & Lam Keong Yeoh, quotes a separate study by one of the authors, who had used expenditure survey data. Per that study, “there are 110,000 to 140,000 households in Singapore who fit the definition of absolute poverty…these include the working poor, unemployed poor and poor retiree households”.Absolute poverty is defined as an economic situation where a person or a household doesn’t earn enough to cover basic needs.In a small country (population just over 6 million), 140,000 households, that is, around 560,000 people (reasonably assuming 4 people per household), is not a vanishingly small number. You wouldn’t think, visiting Singapore, there are more than 5.5 lakh people living in absolute poverty.Economists also use a concept called relative poverty – a measure that captures living standard relative to that enjoyed by those earning median wage (a median is defined as the middle value of a sequence of numbers, arranged in ascending or descending order).By this measure, per the handbook quoted above, 25% to 30% of Singaporeans live in relative poverty. The same research points out that many Singaporean middle-class families have faced “stagnating wages and an increased cost of living”. This double whammy hits middle-classes, and the poor, who are hit harder, in many countries, including India. But it’s also true for that island of gleaming high-rises.In a report on poverty and inequality in Singapore, BBC said this: “The city-state, which has some of the highest-paid ministers in the world, is a place of sometimes extreme contrasts, with glittering condominiums and towering facades just a stone's throw from one-room rental apartments inhabited by elderly and blue-collar families.”The same BBC report also quoted two local studies that concluded that in multiracial Singapore, it’s not race but class that’s become the deepest social faultline.Poverty, absolute or relative, and sharp income inequality in Singapore can be traced to pretty much the same set of reasons that’s produced similar outcomes in other countries. Policy attention on maintaining high GDP growth, low corporate taxes to attract investment, an emphasis on meritocracy, and the transition from old economy to knowledge economy. Implemented well, as Singapore govt has, this set of policies can produce shining economic performance – but it can also produce an underclass that gets caught in a deprivation trap. And the problem gets worse, as is the case in Singapore, when a society starts ageing. Elderly poor face the worst kind of poverty.None of this invalidates Singapore’s success story. But all of it tells us about a Singapore that most people don’t know exists.To saySingaporeans are crazy, rich is crazy, and full of rich irony.","At $141,500, its per capita income in PPP terms (a fairer measure than nominal dollar figures) ranks second after Luxembourg globally.

Tourism Crunch

The president of the Maldives swept into power a year ago on a campaign to push India out of the island nation’s affairs and draw closer to China. Now, as a debt crisis looms and earlier Chinese loans come due, he is in New Delhi looking to mend some fences.Mohamed Muizzu arrived in New Delhi on Sunday on his first state visit, with the country’s financial crisis likely to be a key feature of discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.Prior to his visit, Muizzu has softened his rhetoric notably, saying he’s never opposed India and New Delhi knows the financial strain his nation is under and was willing to help.That’s a contrast to a year ago when he took office, pushing for the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Maldives and promising new big-ticket projects backed by China. His campaign thrust the Maldives to the center of the rivalry between the two powers, which have been vying for influence over the Indian Ocean nation known for pristine beaches and its strategic location straddling global shipping routes.Both countries — and others — have poured hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loans into the Maldives in recent years, saddling the tourism-dependent nation amid a protracted economic slowdown, a drought of foreign reserves and a slow return of visitors.The country’s debt is estimated at 110% of gross domestic product, and risks are growing it may fail to make payments on its sukuk. If that were to happen, it would be the world’s first default of an Islamic bond.India gave the Maldives a $50 million lifeline last month to help it avoid that outcome, but that was likely only a short-term fix given additional looming payments, according to investors and analysts.Fitch Ratings estimates the country’s total external debt obligations will grow to $557 million in 2025, and exceed $1 billion by 2026. The island nation’s foreign reserves stood at just $437 million as of the end of August, sufficient to cover only around one-and-a-half months of imports.A default event was looking more likely, according to Fitch, while the International Monetary Fund has also warned of a potential debt crisis.“This is a growing concern and the debts are piling up,” said Aditya Gowdara Shivamurthy, an associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank. “They’ve been able to repay until now. What will happen next is something we will have to see.”Muizzu met with India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday and is due to meet with Modi on Monday.China and India are the No. 1 and 2 external lenders for Maldivian central government debt, respectively. The Maldives owed about $400 million to the Export-Import Bank of India and about $530 million to the Export-Import Bank of China at the end of last year, according to official figures.The Maldives Monetary Authority has said officials are working on a $400 million foreign-currency swap with India’s central bank, which could provide a key source of funds for future debt payments. China meanwhile has said it’s held discussions with Male over debt relief.“President Muizzu has tried to steer the Maldives away from its traditional reliance on India to a more independent foreign policy, including friendlier relations with China,” said Søren Mørch, head of emerging markets debt at Danske Bank AS. “This recent bailout from India has shown the limits of this approach.”The debt crunch comes as the Maldivian economy has failed to maintain momentum in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. While GDP growth reached 13.9% in 2022, it slowed to 4% last year, with tourists spending at rates below pre-pandemic levels, according to the World Bank.Relations between the Maldives and India took a dive in January after a social-media spat in which a Maldivian deputy minister mocked Modi, prompting a backlash from Indian citizens and several celebrities calling for a tourism boycott of the island.In an interview with the BBC, Muizzu said the Maldives is not facing a sovereign debt default, nor would it join an IMF funding program. Still, India’s backing in any potential debt restructuring is likely to prove invaluable, making a fence-mending with New Delhi all the more important, said Gulbin Sultana, associate fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, a government-backed think tank in New Delhi.“Muizzu is re-balancing ties with India, as is New Delhi trying to reset its ties with the island nation,” she said.",Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu is in New Delhi on his first state visit. The country's financial crisis is likely to be a key feature of discussions with New Delhi. India and China are the No. 1 and 2 external lenders for Maldivian central government debt.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114012946,imgsize-1059747,width-400,resizemode-4/114012946.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.As per media reports in the Maldives , Muizzu, his wife Sajidha Mohamed, and a high-level delegation of Maldivian government officials traveled on a special flight arranged by the Indian government, a gesture reserved for such visits by Maldivian presidents.Muizzu will receive an official welcome on Monday.During his visit from October 6-10, Muizzu will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi , external affairs minister S Jaishankar and other top ministers to discuss various bilateral, regional, and international issues.The president's upcoming discussions are expected to lead to several agreements that could enhance bilateral cooperation.Muizzu has been criticised for pivoting his island nation sharply towards China, and eyebrows were raised in New Delhi after he decided to break tradition by not making India his first foreign visit after taking office in November last year. Instead, he initially visited Turkey and China - a significant diplomatic shift, particularly given that his administration has been perceived as pro-China and has previously campaigned on an ""India Out"" platform.This change in approach had raised concerns about the future of India-Maldives relations, which had become strained following Muizzu's election.However, ties between the two countries have been warming up with Muizzu publicly acknowledging India's importance, referring to it as ""one of the closest allies and invaluable partners"" of the Maldives. The Maldivian president's acknowledgment of India's role in providing aid during times of need also indicates a willingness to move past contentious rhetoric towards constructive engagement.This shift could pave the way for a more balanced approach that respects Maldivian sovereignty while recognising India's strategic interests in the region.Geopolitically, the Maldives is crucial for India's 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) initiative and its 'Neighbourhood First Policy'. The Maldives serves as a key maritime neighbor in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), making it strategically significant for India's national security interests.The president met EAM Jaishankar on Sunday evening shortly after landing in New Delhi.""Pleased to call on President Muizzu today at the start of his State Visit to India. Appreciate his commitment to enhance 🇮🇳 🇲🇻 relationship. Confident that his talks with PM Modi on Monday will give a new impetus to our friendly ties,"" the external affairs minister posted on X.Official talks and signing of agreements with Indian leadership are scheduled for Monday.President Muizzu will also meet with the Maldivian community living in India, on Sunday.He will also engage in business events in Mumbai and Bengaluru, highlighting the importance of economic ties between the two nations.The delegation accompanying president Muizzu includes foreign minister Dr Abdullah Khaleel, defense minister Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon, minister of homeland security and technology Ali Ihusaan, finance minister Moosa Zameer, health minister Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim, and economic development minister Mohamed Saeed.Other key officials joining the visit are attorney general Ahmed Usham, tourism minister Ibrahim Faisal, transport & civil aviation minister Mohamed Ameen, construction & infrastructure minister Dr Abdulla Muththalib, and chief of staff at the President's Office Abdulla Fayaz, alongside several senior officials.Muizzu last visited India in June to attend the swearing in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During the visit, the two leaders met and discussed strengthening bilateral relations between Maldives and India.The two leaders also met on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai in December last year.Relations between the two countries had deteriorated after two Maldivian deputy ministers made defamatory comments about PM Modi and India on social media, amid ongoing discussions about the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the Maldives.The two officials, Malsha Shareef and Mariyam Shiuna were suspended from their roles in the Ministry of Youth and later resigned on September 10 this year.Withdrawal of Indian military personnel was a key pledge of President Muizzu, and the transition was carried out peacefully, with civilians replacing Indian troops as per the agreement between the two governments.Muizzu's administration has since appeared committed to mending relations with India.","Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.

"Woman's body found in her UK flat 3 years after death, her diary said she was 'starving'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/womans-body-found-in-her-uk-flat-3-years-after-death-her-diary-said-she-was-starving/articleshow/113983021.cms,"A 38- year old woman’s “mummified and almost skeletal” dead body lay unnoticed in her social housing flat for more than three years. As per inquest, she had written in her diary that she was starving and running out of food. The vulnerable woman’s family had raised concerns about her two months prior she was discovered.According to The Guardian, Laura Winham , who was deaf and had schizophrenia, was discovered in her Woking flat by her brother in May 2021, after her family asked police to break in.Her family, whom she had previously asked not to contact her, claimed she was ""abandoned and left to die"" by social and mental health services .A pathologist told the inquest at Surrey Coroner’s Court this week that determining an exact time of death was impossible. However, the court heard that a calendar in Winham’s flathead dates marked off until 1 November 2017. She was running low on food and money according to extracts from her diary, which were read out by coroner Karen Henderson on Thursday.An entry dated 28 September 2017 read: “My mobile gave up on 7 September. I got a Tesco run in before it died. I have slept weeks away … I haven’t stocked any food for months because I don’t know what’s happening.”Another extract from October 2017 said, “It has been a whole month since my last food shop. I cannot believe I have survived this long.”Other extracts hinted that she had been living off potatoes and cheese and had almost about £5 left on her.An extract from 15 September 2017 said: “Wish I’d bought rice. Dreaming of [food]. Anyway, I’m starving.”It was previously revealed by the inquest that Winham’s family could not stay in contact with her after years of mental health struggles caused her to believe they would harm her.Luke Addams, Surrey Council’s director of practice, assurance, and safeguarding, told the inquest that a council representative should have attempted an in-person visit to Winham rather than relying on letters for communication. A Woking Council official also acknowledged that Winham's vulnerabilities should have been reported to the company managing the council's housing stock at the time.The inquest on Wednesday, heard that she was contacted by the Department for Work and Pensions in February 2016 asking her to claim for the new personal independence payment, which replaced the disability living allowance (DLA).The court heard that Winham was informed she might need to attend a medical assessment. In response, she wrote to the Woking Council, expressing her alarm, stating: ""I have only lived on my savings and DLA benefit."" However, these concerns were not forwarded to the DWP.The inquest also heard that policies have been changed by Woking borough council and Surrey county since Winham’s death.","Laura Winham, 38, who was deaf and had schizophrenia, was discovered in her Woking flat by her brother in May 2021.
