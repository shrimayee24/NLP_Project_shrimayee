NEW DELHI: Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Thursday thanked leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi after he hailed job creation at Foxconn in Karnataka.Vaishnaw said that the Congress leader has acknowledged “the success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Make in India’ programme.”“Thanks Rahul Gandhi for acknowledging the success of PM Shri @narendramodi Ji’s ‘Make in India’ programme. As you have noted, we are becoming a producer economy as we implement our PM’s vision,” he said.Earlier, Rahul Gandhi, in his post, had referred to a media report titled ‘Foxconn hires 30k staff at new, women-led unit’ and said India must have jobs with dignity and opportunities for all.“30,000 staff hired in just eight-nine months — the fastest factory ramp-up seen in India so far. This is not just a statistic. It is transformative job creation. What makes it even more powerful is that the unit is largely women-led, with around 80% women, most aged 19–24, and for many, this is their first job,” Rahul said in his post.“Karnataka is setting an example by creating an ecosystem where manufacturing can grow at this scale and speed. This is the India we must build: jobs with dignity, and opportunities for all,” he added.This comes after the Taiwanese electronics major Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (Foxconn) recruited close to 30,000 employees at its new iPhone assembly facility in Devanahalli near Bengaluru within just eight to nine months, marking the fastest factory scale-up seen in India so far.The 300-acre facility is largely operated by women, who make up around 80% of the workforce. Most of these employees are in the 19–24 age bracket and are entering the workforce for the first time, the report said.","Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw thanked leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi after he hailed job creation at Foxconn in Karnataka.

Vande Bharat Sleeper Train: Ready for New Year Launch from Bengaluru,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/made-in-bengaluru-vande-bharat-sleeper-set-for-new-year-rollout/articleshow/126126743.cms,"Made in Bengaluru: Vande Bharat Sleeper set for New Year rollout?

Is Vande Bharat sleeper better than Rajdhani Express?

BENGALURU: India's first semi-high-speed sleeper train, Vande Bharat Sleeper, is getting closer to its rollout. Manufactured in Bengaluru by Bharat Earth Movers Ltd (BEML), the train's second rake was recently dispatched to Indian Railways Contrary to speculations, the rake is still in Bengaluru and arrived at SMVT railway station Monday morning. A senior official from Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Chennai stated, ""The second rake of Vande Bharat Sleeper has come out of BEML and is still at SMVT station. It will likely remain there for another two or three days.""Vande Bharat Sleeper is designed for long-distance journeys exceeding 800–1,000km. Like the existing chair-car versions, this variant is engineered for a potential speed of 160 km/h, with quick acceleration and deceleration. However, the actual running speed will depend on the track infrastructure available on the route, as only a small portion of India's rail network can support speeds above 150 km/h.The rake spotted in Bengaluru consists of 16 coaches divided into three categories: third A/C, second A/C, and first A/C, similar to other air-conditioned rakes. Although the route for the initial commercial service has yet to be confirmed, it will be operated by Northern Railway zone which covers key cities such as Delhi, Ambala, Moradabad, Kanpur, Jaipur, and Jodhpur, across Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir.As this rake is the first of its kind, there are some minor issues to resolve before clearance is granted. While the possibility of another trial run has not been ruled out, a decision has not yet been made. Eight more are planned, with a deadline set for March 2026. This initial batch of 10 rakes will be adequate to operate five sleeper services.Officials have acknowledged that minor technical modifications will be made in future rakes. ""We are identifying some minor rectification work, but we will implement that in the next rake. There are no issues with the aesthetics or design; the first two rakes are ready to operate without problems.""Once all formalities are complete, the rake will be transferred to Northern Railway. While Railway Board has yet to announce the details of the first commercial service, officials believe it might serve as a ‘New Year gift', with serious planning already under way.","India's first semi-high-speed sleeper train, Vande Bharat Sleeper, is getting closer to its rollout.

The significantly higher bid has intensified concerns over the project's financial viability and long-term burden on citizens.Responding to these concerns, deputy chief minister and Bengaluru development minister DK Shivakumar said the govt's financial commitment will be capped at 40% of the project cost as estimated by the state. ""Beyond that, investment has to be made by private players. That is why the project is being taken up on build-operate-transfer basis,"" he said.He said he had reviewed Metro projects undertaken by BMRCL and tunnel projects in Mumbai, where costs are around Rs 1,200 crore per km. ""What has been quoted for this project will have to be examined,"" the DCM said.The project was tendered in two packages. Sources in Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) said Adani Group's bid overshoots the govt estimate by 24% for package 1 and 28% for package 2, gaps that are likely to require cabinet-level scrutiny before any award decision is made.The Hyderabad-based Vishwa Samudra Engineering Ltd was the only other firm to qualify for the financial bidding stage. Of the four firms that initially submitted bids, Dilip Buildcon was disqualified under a tender clause barring companies with a history of bridge, flyover or tunnel collapses, while Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd withdrew after its joint venture partner failed to meet technical eligibility criteria.The opposition BJP has demanded that the govt drop the tunnel project. BJP MP from Bengaluru Central PC Mohan cautioned that major tunnelling firms had stayed away from the tender, highlighting a poor risk–reward balance under the BOT model, where private concessionaires fund 60% of the cost and recover their investment through tolls. Mohan also pointed to limited soil testing and traffic data as factors that could drive further cost escalation once construction begins.Mobility experts who have been critical of the project said the Rs 22,267-crore cost quoted could eventually increase sharply, with construction stretching over a decade. Under BOT framework, toll recovery by private concessionaires could force commuters to bear both tolls and taxes for decades.","Adani Group has emerged as the lowest bidder for the proposed 17km tunnel road project.

Kunal Kushwaha, an Indian-origin tech educator and developer advocate, shared a personal account of the limits he says come with holding an Indian passport while working globally. In a viral post on X, Kushwaha described how visa rules and paperwork often disrupt his travel plansAfter a recent trip to Berlin, Kushwaha said he was unable to travel to Ireland to surprise his best friend on his birthday because there was not enough time to apply for another visa. What should have been a simple decision, booking a flight, instead turned into hours spent navigating visa websites. The episode, he wrote, showed how routine travel can become unnecessarily complicated.In his post, Kushwaha described standing in long airport queues while other travellers passed through quickly. He said he often carries folders of documents he has already submitted many times. Schengen visa applications, he added, feel like a full-time job. They require bank statements, cover letters and detailed explanations for ordinary trips.“I’m not angry. I’m tired,” he wrote. Kushwaha stressed that his frustration is practical rather than emotional.He said national pride does not reduce the mental effort needed to deal with constant paperwork.The post also pointed to wider questions about passport strength. India ranks low on global mobility indexes and offers visa-free access to relatively few destinations. Kushwaha argued that these rankings translate into real constraints for professionals who travel frequently for work, conferences and collaboration.Many replies to his post shared similar experiences. Users posted stories of delayed appointments, short visa validity periods and uncertainty even for repeat travellers with established international careers.Kushwaha also touched on issues beyond travel. He said investments made in India had lost value over time because of the rupee’s decline. He also mentioned air pollution and outdated banking and KYC processes as factors that add to everyday friction.","Kunal Kushwaha, an Indian-origin tech educator and developer advocate, shared a personal account of the limits he says come with holding an Indian passport.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday slammed the Centre’s directions to states to impose a ban on granting new mining leases in the Aravalli range, calling it a “bogus attempt at damage control that will not fool anybody”Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh alleged that despite the fresh directive, “the Aravallis are not being saved, but are being sold out,” he said in a post on X.On Wednesday, the Union environment ministry directed states to impose a complete ban on new mining leases in the Aravallis and expand protected zones, describing it as a major step toward the “conservation and protection.” The directive aims to safeguard the Aravallis as a continuous geological ridge extending from Gujarat to the NCR and to end unregulated mining across the region.The Centre’s order came after a public row over its new definition of the Aravallis, which classifies an “Aravalli Hill” as a landform with an elevation of at least 100 metres above its surrounding terrain, and an “Aravalli Range” as a cluster of two or more such hills within 500 metres of each other.However, the former Union environment minister dismissed the move as insufficient, arguing that the core issue remains unaddressed. “These are pious proclamations but the dangerous 100m+ redefinition of the Aravallis -- rejected by the Forest Survey of India, the Supreme Court-mandated Central Empowered Committee, and the Supreme Court's amicus curiae -- remains unchanged,” said Ramesh.He has repeatedly said that the redefinition being adopted by the Centre has been opposed by the Forest Survey of India, the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court, and the apex court’s amicus curiae.The Bharatiya Janata Party-led Centre rejected the charge that the new definition weakens environmental safeguards, maintaining that more than 90 per cent of the Aravalli region remains protected and that the revised definition does not relax mining controls, reported PTI.In an earlier post, Ramesh had accused the government of misleading the public on the issue. “It is by now abundantly clear that the Union Minister of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change is being economical with the truth on the Aravallis issue and is misleading the public,” he said.He also questioned why the PM Modi-led government is pushing through what he described as a “fatally flawed” redefinition of the Aravallis despite widespread expert opposition.","Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh alleged that despite the fresh directive, “the Aravallis are not being saved, but are being sold out” On Wednesday, the Union environment ministry directed states to impose a complete ban on new mining leases in the Aravalli range.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126163749,imgsize-762827,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-33.jpg"

‘Can’t Stay Two Days In Delhi’: Gadkari On Severe Pollution, Transport Sector Role

NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the NCR and adjoining areas on Wednesday lifted GRAP-IV with immediate effect, even though air quality across large parts of the city remained in the ‘very poor’ category.According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), areas such as ITO and India Gate recorded AQI levels crossing 350, underscoring the persistence of hazardous air conditions in the national capital.The CAQM said the decision was taken to revoke its order dated December 13, 2025, which had invoked actions under Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).GRAP Stage IV is enforced when air quality reaches the ‘severe+’ category with an AQI above 450. The commission, however, clarified that measures under Stage I, Stage II and Stage III of the extant GRAP will continue and will be implemented as per the modified GRAP dated November 21, 2025.The easing of curbs came hours after the Delhi High Court directed the GST Council to meet at the earliest to consider lowering GST on air purifiers in view of the worsening air quality.During the hearing, the court questioned the Centre over 18% GST imposed on air purifiers.At the outset, the bench expressed displeasure over the lack of action in the matter, observing that every citizen is entitled to clean air.Earlier, GRAP Stage-IV measures had been enforced across Delhi-NCR to curb rising pollution levels. Under Stage IV, private vehicle movement was not completely banned, with restrictions largely dependent on emission norms and fuel type. While vehicles meeting prescribed standards were allowed to operate, older vehicles face stricter curbs. BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles are not permitted to ply in Delhi-NCR during this phase, except those providing essential services.","The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) lifted GRAP-IV with immediate effect.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Wednesday ordered states to impose a complete ban on new mining leases in the Aravallis and expand protected zones, a major move amid public outcry over the ""new definition"" of the mountain range.The Union environment ministry said the decision was aimed at the ""conservation and protection"" of one of the world’s oldest mountain systems, covering the stretch from Delhi to Gujarat. The directive seeks to safeguard the Aravallis as a continuous geological ridge extending from Gujarat to the National Capital Region and to put an end to unregulated mining across the region.As part of the announcement, the ministry instructed the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) to identify further zones across the Aravallis where mining must be prohibited, beyond those areas already notified by the Centre-based on ecological, geological and landscape-level assessments.The Centre also said it intends to expand the list of areas protected and restricted from mining across the range. For mines that are currently operational, state governments have been asked to ensure ""strict compliance"" with environmental safeguards and adherence to Supreme Court orders.On Monday, Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav said at a press conference that ""no new mining leases will be permitted, especially in core, protected and ecologically sensitive areas, including the NCR"".Responding to the Supreme Court's acceptance of the ""new definition"" of the Aravallis, he said: ""The ruling recognises and endorses the Government of India’s sustained efforts to protect the Aravalli range through scientific assessment, strict safeguards and initiatives such as the Aravalli Green Wall Project.""He further underlined the government’s efforts such as the expansion of Ramsar sites, afforestation drives and global recognition of India’s forest cover, adding that the BJP-led NDA government remains ""firmly committed to balancing ecology and economy, while countering misinformation with facts and science"".The Supreme Court's acceptance, classifying any landform in Aravalli districts with an elevation of 100 metres or more from the local relief as Aravali Hills-sparked concern among several stakeholders, who fear the new definition could leave more than 90% of the range open to mining, as most landforms fall below the 100-metre threshold.","The directive seeks to safeguard the Aravallis as a continuous geological ridge extending from Gujarat to the National Capital Region.

‘Not Misleading Propaganda’: Bangladesh Responds To India Over Delhi High Commission Protest

SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir Students Association (JKSA) on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , seeking urgent intervention to ensure the safety and well-being of Indian medical students currently studying in Bangladesh amid ongoing protests, tensions, and incidents of violence, particularly in Dhaka and surrounding regions.In the letter addressed to the Prime Minister, the Association urged him to intervene to ensure the safety and protection of Indian medical students in view of the prevailing unrest and uncertain conditions in Bangladesh.National Convenor of the Association, Nasir Khuehami, said that there are around 9,000 Indian students pursuing medical education in various colleges across Bangladesh, among them over 4,000 students from the Kashmir Valley.Nasir Khuehami said, ""We have been told by students studying in Dhaka that they have been advised to hide their identity for their own safety, which is deeply disturbing and unacceptable for young Indians who have gone abroad solely to pursue education."" He added that the reported ""death and lynching of a student leader has further shocked and alarmed the entire student community and their families back home,"" underlining the gravity of the situation and the potential risks faced by Indian students on the ground.Highlighting the plight of students, the association said, ""Many students are confined to hostels and accommodations, facing restrictions on movement, lack of clarity, and fear of being caught in violence. Parents in India are living in constant anxiety, unsure about the safety of their children. The prevailing conditions are unsafe and uncertain, and students feel vulnerable and stranded.""Khuehami said the association has been receiving distress calls and messages from students and their families, who are extremely anxious about the rapidly deteriorating situation and the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty prevailing there.Urging immediate action, Khuehami said, ""We urge the Prime Minister to kindly intervene to ensure the immediate safety and protection of Indian medical students in Bangladesh. We request the ministry of external affairs and the Indian high commission in Dhaka to urgently take up this matter with the government of Bangladesh and seek firm assurances for the security, dignity, and well-being of our students.""The Association also appealed for evacuation if the situation worsens, stating, ""If the situation of tension and violence continues or worsens, the government of India should kindly consider making arrangements to evacuate and bring back Indian students safely to India, so that no young life is put at risk.

From Work-From-Home To Vehicle Ban- Delhi Rolls Out Fresh Pollution Curbs

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the GST Council to meet at the earliest to consider lowering of GST on air purifiers in view of worsening air quality.During the hearing the court questioned the Centre over the imposition of 18% GST on air purifiers.At the outset of the hearing, the bench voiced its displeasure over the lack of action in the matter, observing that every citizen is entitled to clean air, PTI reported.“Let the purifiers be provided. That’s the minimum you can do. When will you come back?…. Even if it is for temporary, give exemption for next one week or one month… Consider this an emergency situation, only for temporarily. Take instructions and come back,” the bench said.“We will place it before the vacation bench only for compliance. As we speak, we all breathe. You know how many times we breathe in a day, at least 21,000 times a day. Just calculate the harm you are doing to your lungs just by breathing 21,000 times a day, and that’s involuntary,” the bench added.""We will place it before the vacation bench only for compliance. As we speak, we all breathe. You know how many times we breathe in a day, at least 21,000 times a day.Just calculate the harm you are doing to your lungs just by breathing 21,000 times a day, and that's involuntary,"" it further added.In the post-lunch session, the counsel council for the government submitted that the issue fell within the policy domain of the GST Council, a body comprising representatives of all states and the Union, and that any meeting must be convened by the Union finance minister, who chairs the council.""This is a policy decision to be taken by GST council. It comprises of members of all States and Union. The meeting has to be called by the union finance minister who heads the council,"" the counsel submitted.Acknowledging that the GST Council is a pan-India body and that convening a meeting may take time, the bench citing the severe air quality in Delhi and adjoining regions, directed that the council meet at the earliest and issued notice to the Centre on the petition.""However, taking into consideration the air quality situation in the state of Delhi and nearby areas, we find it appropriate to require the council to meet at the earliest,"" the bench added and issued notice to the Centre on the petition, as reported by PTI.The plea said that levying GST at the highest slab on air purifiers, now essential for ensuring minimally safe indoor air, makes them unaffordable for large sections of the population.“Imposition of GST at the highest slab upon air-purifiers, a device that has become indispensable for securing minimally safe indoor air, renders such equipment financially inaccessible to large segments of the population and thereby inflicts an arbitrary, unreasonable, and constitutionally impermissible burden,” the plea said.The hearing comes as Delhi continues to choke under toxic smog. Parts of the city, including ITO and India Gate, recorded ‘very poor’ air quality, with AQI levels crossing 350, according to CPCB data. GRAP Stage-IV measures have been enforced across Delhi-NCR.","The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the GST Council to meet at the earliest to consider lowering of GST on air purifiers.

'His bail like kaal for us': Unnao rape case survivor to move SC against suspension of Kuldeep Singh Sengar's jail term; seeks justice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/his-bail-like-kaal-for-us-unnao-rape-case-survivor-to-move-sc-against-suspension-of-kuldeep-singh-sengars-jail-term-seeks-justice/articleshow/126156559.cms,"Delhi HC Grants Bail To Kuldeep Sengar; Victim’s Sister Says ‘Put Us In Jail To Keep Us Safe’

NEW DELHI: The Unnao rape case survivor on Wednesday said that Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s bail and the Delhi high court decision is like “kaal (death)” for her family and said she will challenge the order in the Supreme Court.""HC decision like 'kaal (death)' for us, will challenge order in SC,"" the survivor told news agency PTI after Delhi high court on Tuesday granted bail to expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar and suspended his life sentence in the 2017 Unnao rape case.Delhi high court granted bail to Sengar while suspending his life sentence, holding that he cannot be kept in jail only on the basis of the threat perception of the victim in the Unnao rape case.While allowing Sengar’s application under Section 389 of the CrPC, the court said, “Kuldeep Singh Sengar can’t be kept in jail only because of the threat perception of the victim in Unnao Rape case,” and added that courts cannot deny bail merely out of apprehension that security agencies may fail in their duty.""At the same time, however, the argument of keeping the appellant (Sengar) in custody because of threat perception to the victim/ survivor, in the opinion of this court, is not a tenable argument to deny the benefit of section 389 CrPC to the appellant,"" the bench said in its 53-page verdict.The bench of Justices Subramonium Prasad and Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar observed that such an approach would undermine the work of security forces. “Such an observation or such a thought process would undermine the laudable work of our police/paramilitary forces,” the court said.Suspending Sengar’s sentence till the pendency of his appeal against the December 2019 trial court verdict, the high court noted that he has already spent about seven years and five months in prison and that continued incarceration would violate Article 21 of the Constitution. The appeal has been listed before the roster bench on January 16, 2026, subject to orders of the chief justice.The court imposed several conditions while granting bail, directing Sengar to furnish a personal bond of Rs 15 lakh with three sureties of the same amount. It ordered that all three sureties must be residents of Delhi and directed Sengar to stay in the national capital during the pendency of his appeal. He was also asked to deposit his passport with the trial court and to report to the local police station every Monday at 10 am.Sengar has been barred from entering within a five-kilometre radius of the survivor’s residence and from threatening or contacting her or her mother. “Violation of any of the conditions would lead to cancellation of bail,” the high court said. The court also said he should remain available to complete the remaining part of the sentence if found guilty.On the safety of the survivor, the court said it expects that she will continue to get CRPF cover and directed the deputy commissioner of police of the area where she is residing to personally ensure and supervise her protection during the pendency of the appeal.“The state is also providing for the accommodation of the victim. The Delhi Commission for Women is responsible for ensuring that the victim is provided sufficient accommodation and such arrangement is directed to be continued till further orders,” the bench said, adding that the survivor is free to approach the court if required.The high court noted that the Supreme Court had earlier transferred the trial from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi keeping in mind the survivor’s vulnerability and the custodial death of her father, for which Sengar has been convicted.Despite the suspension of sentence in the rape case, Sengar will continue to remain in jail as he is also serving a 10-year sentence in the custodial death case of the survivor’s father and has not been granted bail in that matter. His appeal in the custodial death case, in which he has sought suspension of sentence, is also pending.Reacting to the order, the survivor told PTI that she was not satisfied with the verdict.“I have small children. There is an elderly, differently-abled mother-in-law and my husband at home. The safety of my children is the biggest concern,” she said.She alleged lapses during the trial and withdrawal of security cover. “Usually, a verdict is pronounced within two or three days after the conclusion of arguments. But in this case, the decision came after three months. Even before the verdict, security for the family and witnesses was withdrawn,” she alleged.The survivor further said, “In the serious crime where my father was murdered and I was subjected to rape, the accused is granted bail after serving a few years in prison. This raises the question of what kind of justice this is.”Sengar was convicted for kidnapping and raping a minor in 2017. The rape case and other connected matters were transferred from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi on the directions of the Supreme Court on August 1, 2019.",Delhi high court granted bail to Kuldeep Singh Sengar while suspending his life sentence. Court said he cannot be kept in jail only on the basis of the threat perception of the victim in the Unnao rape case.

Tuberculosis: What are the causes, symptoms in adults and in children

NEW DELHI: India has recorded steep declines in malaria, tuberculosis, maternal and child deaths, signalling what the government calls a decisive, results-driven phase in the country’s public-health journey.Addressing the Advancing Public Health Outcomes Forum 2025 on Wednesday, Union health minister JP Nadda said the gains were based on sustained political commitment, strong scientific capacity and people’s participation, rather than isolated programmes.“Disease control and immunisation outcomes today are the result of institutional strength and Jan Bhagidari,” he said.Incidence of malaria has dropped by over 80%, with deaths down 78%, shifting India from a high-burden to a high-impact phase.Incidence of tuberculosis has fallen from 237 cases per lakh population in 2015 to 187 per lakh — a 21% decline, nearly double the global average. Maternal mortality has reduced from 130 per lakh live births in 2014 to 88 in 2025, while infant mortality has declined from 39 to 27 per 1,000 live births.Under-five and neonatal mortality rates have also fallen far faster in India than globally.At the forum, four national reports reviewed progress on malaria, tuberculosis, lymphatic filariasis and immunisation.While they show that sustained programmes have sharply reduced the disease burden across most regions, they warn that the final phase of elimination will be the most demanding.The malaria assessment found transmission persisting in tribal, forested and hard-to-reach areas, with emerging risks in some urban pockets.As cases fall, experts cautioned that asymptomatic infections could be missed unless surveillance remains strong.The lymphatic filariasis report flagged gaps in post-treatment districts, especially in urban slums, industrial belts and migrant settlements. Uneven drug uptake, weak follow-up and limited morbidity care could threaten the 2027 elimination target despite years of mass drug administration.On tuberculosis, expanded diagnostics, digital tracking & newer regimens have improved outcomes, but poverty, malnutrition, migration and co-morbidities continue to drive transmission. Disruptions in care for migrants & the growing burden of post-TB lung disease among survivors were highlighted as major concerns.The immunisation assessment pointed to strong childhood coverage but warned of problems beyond early life—gaps in adolescent and adult vaccination, data inconsistencies and the absence of a life-course immunisation strategy.Strengthening primary healthcare remains central to the government’s approach. Nadda reiterated the goal of one Ayushman Arogya Mandir for every 2,000 people, noting that over 30,000 centres have already achieved national quality certification.","India has recorded steep declines in malaria, tuberculosis, maternal and child deaths.

India Faces Global Safety Alert As WHO Warns Over 3 Toxic Cough Syrups After 19 Children Die In MP

BHOPAL: ""My son survived, but he returned to me without his sight,"" said Tikku Yaduvanshi (36), his voice breaking as he recalled the 116 days his five-year-old son had battled for life after consuming the toxic cough syrup Coldrif in Parasia town, in MP's Chhindwara district.""He cannot see, he cannot walk properly, and I cannot leave him even for a moment. How do I go back to work now?"" Tikku said.The boy is among the few children to survive the killer cough syrup tragedy that claimed the lives of 26 children across Chhindwara and Betul districts.After more than four months of hospitalisation across multiple cities, he was finally discharged from AIIMS Nagpur on Monday night - alive, but with severe, and possibly irreversible, damage.For Tikku, a former employee of a private finance company, survival has come at an unbearable cost. He has not received a salary for the past four months, defaulted on housing loan EMIs, sold his cattle, and mortgaged his wife's jewellery to fund treatment and sustain his family during the prolonged hospital stay in Nagpur.""We were four people staying there - my wife, two other family members and I - paying for food, rooms, everything, while our child was fighting for life.Govts and officials might come and go, what we have lived through in these four months cannot be put into words,"" Tikku said.His son's ordeal began on August 24, when Tikku first took him to paediatrician Dr Praveen Soni in Parasia. Two days later, as complications developed, he returned to the doctor.On September 1, Kunal was rushed to Nagpur and admitted to a private hospital. As his condition worsened, he was shifted to AIIMS Nagpur on September 11, where treatment continued for over three months. While the state govt has assured financial assistance towards medical expenses, Tikku said it barely scratches the surface. ""Whatever money we receive will go into repaying the loans we took for his treatment. It does not cover our stay, food, or the debts we piled up just to keep him alive,"" he said.Complete recovery remains uncertain. Doctors have not been able to say whether his son's vision will return.""I want the govt to tell me - will it bear the cost of his future treatment,"" he asked. ""I have heard there are better facilities for eyesight treatment in Chennai. My child did nothing wrong. At least give him a chance,"" he added. The Coldrif syrup tragedy has led to arrests, suspensions, and an SIT probe.Paediatrician Dr Praveen Soni, his wife Jyoti Soni, and the manufacturers of the syrup - Tamil Nadu-based Sresan Pharmaceuticals - have been named as accused. Yet, for families like these, accountability offers little comfort. ""My son survived death. Now we are just praying he can see the world one day, and that we are not left alone to fight this battle,"" Tikku said.","Five-year-old Kunal Yaduvanshi survived the killer cough syrup tragedy that claimed the lives of 26 children across Chhindwara and Betul districts.

KOLKATA: Foreign courts can hear divorce and maintenance proceedings of a marriage solemnised in India if one of the spouses resides in that country, the Calcutta high court has said while setting aside a lower court order putting an injunction on a UK district court order in favour of the wife.In its December 15 ruling, a division bench of justices Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya and Supratim Bhattacharya held that under the Hindu Marriage Act, it is specified a petition can be heard by ""district court with the local limits"" of the residence where a couple last resided.The bench clarified that though under a different section of the same law, ""district court"" means Indian courts and not foreign courts, ""taken in its true spirit and in a liberal perspective"", the UK family court can have jurisdiction if prima facie the wife resides there and at least ""the parties last resided together as spouses in the UK.""""It cannot be said outright that the judgment which might ultimately be passed in the divorce suit of the wife in the UK would be inconclusive in India,"" the judges said.The couple got married in Kolkata on December 15, 2018. The husband first filed for divorce on Sept 4, 2024, at Alipore court. On October 10, 2024, the wife moved the UK court for divorce and the next day for maintenance. She said she had been residing in the UK since 2015 on student and work visas with occasional visits to India and they last stayed as a married couple in the UK.On May 16, 2025, the UK family court directed the husband to pay maintenance. However, on Nov 1, Alipore district court put an injunction on that order saying the wife cannot proceed with her case in the UK.The Alipore court reasoned that the husband had moved the divorce suit first and held that the UK court had no jurisdiction in the case as the wife was not a permanent resident of the country. It said the maintenance amount granted by the UK court was ""onerous and oppressive"" as it exceeded the earnings of the husband.The woman challenged the order in the high court which heldeven if the pleas were filed by the wife later, the husband filed a response and adduced evidence in the UK court. ""Prima facie, it is not credible that the husband is not in a position to contest the wife's divorce proceedings and alimony application in UK"", the high court said.",Foreign courts can hear divorce and maintenance proceedings of a marriage solemnised in India if one of the spouses resides in that country.

Navy Chief Confirms India’S Third Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine Soon

NEW DELHI: India tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile called K-4, which is designed to hit targets 3,500-km away, from the nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday.There was no official word from the defence ministry on the missile test conducted off the coast of Visakhapatnam from the 6,000-tonne INS Arighaat, which is operated by the tri-service strategic forces command.Sources, however, confirmed the missile was the solid-fuelled K-4, which can carry a two-tonne nuclear payload and is critical for India to strengthen the sea leg of its nuclear weapons triad.""A comprehensive analysis will determine whether Tuesday's test actually met all laid down technical parameters and mission objectives or revealed some shortcomings. It usually takes several tests for ballistic missiles, especially those launched from submarines, to achieve full operational status,"" a source said.After multiple trials from undersea platforms in the shape of submersible pontoons over the last several years, the two-stage K-4 missile was tested for the first time from INS Arighaat in Nov last year.INS Arighaat, the country's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles (called SSBN in naval parlance), was commissioned on Aug 29 last year.Her forerunner INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018, can carry only the 750-km range K-15 missiles.India will commission its third SSBN as INS Aridhaman in the first quarter of 2026 and the fourth in 2027-28 under the secretive over Rs 90,000 crore ATV (advanced technology vessel) programme launched decades ago. These two SSBNs are slightly larger, with a displacement of 7,000 tonnes each, than the first two 6,000-tonne ones.There is also the plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs, with much more powerful 190 MW pressurised light-water reactors instead of the existing 83 MW ones on the first four submarines.India's existing SSBNs, of course, are less than half the size of the ones with the US, China and Russia. The operational deployment of K-4 missiles, which will be followed by the K-5 and K-6 missiles in the 5,000 to 6,000-km range class, will somewhat help India narrow the huge gap with countries like the US, Russia and China, which have a range of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).The first two legs of India's nuclear triad are much more robust, with the land-based ballistic missiles led by the Agni-5 with a strike range of over 5,000 km and fighters like Rafales, Sukhoi-30MKIs and Mirage-2000s capable of delivering nuclear gravity bombs.The SSBNs, however, impart India's deterrence posture with much more credibility because they are considered the most secure, survivable and potent platforms for retaliatory strikes in line with the country's ""no first-use"" policy.","India tested an intermediate-range ballistic missile called K-4 from the nuclear-powered submarine INS Arighaat in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday. There was no official word from the defence ministry on the missile test conducted off the coast of Visakhapatnam. The missile is designed to hit targets 3,500-km away and can carry a two-tonne nuclear payload.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126167307,imgsize-101174,width-400,resizemode-4/submarine-missile-launch.jpg"

ISRO’s Heaviest Launch Yet: Five Reasons Why BlueBird-2 Marks India’s Big Leap In Global Space Race

SRIHARIKOTA: Baahubali sent BlueBird to the heavens. India’s space ambitions gained new heights and heft. Isro capped 2025 with a flawless heavy-lift statement Wednesday, as its LVM3 rocket — nicknamed Baahubali — hurled the US communications satellite BlueBird Block-2 into low Earth orbit, the heaviest spacecraft ever launched from Indian soil.The lift-off came from the second launch pad at Sriharikota at 8.55 am, delayed by a minute to sidestep space debris. Fifteen minutes later, precision prevailed. The 6,100kg satellite was injected into a near-perfect circular orbit, marking another clean chapter for India’s human-rated launcher.The mission extended LVM3’s unbroken streak to nine consecutive successes — a milestone that sharpens confidence for the Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme and signals India’s arrival as a serious player in the global LEO communications market.Isro chairman V Narayanan called it a standout flight on multiple fronts. The launcher achieved orbital accuracy of less than 1.5km, placing BlueBird at 518.9km against a target of 520km — the best performance by an Indian rocket to date. “With nine consecutive successful LVM3 launches, our confidence in the Gaganyaan mission has significantly increased,” Narayanan said.Beyond mass and accuracy, the launch carried historical weight.It marked Isro’s 434th satellite deployment for 34 countries across 45 years, and the first back-to-back LVM3 mission, executed with a turnaround of just 52 days.Technological upgrades pushed the rocket further. Payload capability rose by more than 150kg after electro-hydraulic actuators were replaced with electro-mechanical systems to control the massive S200 booster motors. “With additional technologies, we have demonstrated that Isro is in a much better position for future missions, including Gaganyaan,” said mission director T Victor Joseph.The flight underscored rising commercial momentum. P Mohan, acting chairman and MD of Isro’s commercial arm NewSpace India Ltd, said interest in the launcher is accelerating. “There is interest for six to 10 LVM3 missions annually, with several global companies seeking up to six launches per year from 2026–27 onwards,” he said.Wednesday’s mission, designated LVM3-M6, was flown under a commercial agreement between NSIL and US-based AST & Science LLC. BlueBird Block-2 forms part of a global LEO constellation designed to deliver direct-to-mobile 4G and 5G connectivity.Shanti Gupta, chief operating officer of AST SpaceMobile, said the company aims to deploy 45 to 60 satellites by the end of 2026 for worldwide coverage and is in talks with space agencies across the globe, including Isro.Industry voices framed the launch as a strategic inflection point. Space Industry Association of India president Subba Rao said India now stands among a select group capable of reliably deploying heavy-class LEO payloads for next-generation telecom networks.“Its significance lies not just in launch success, but in what it signals about India’s industrial readiness, reliability, and ability to support constellations at scale over time,” he said.Indian Space Association director general Lt Gen (retd) AK Bhatt described the mission as a quantum leap. “It exemplifies Isro’s engineering excellence and operational maturity, enabling heavier payloads for global satellite constellations,” he said.“The mission strengthens India’s self-reliance in launch services and positions Isro as a preferred provider for international missions, while accelerating growth across the domestic space ecosystem.”As Baahubali faded into the morning sky, the message lingered on Earth: India is no longer testing the limits of heavy lift — it is defining them.","Isro caps 2025 with flawless heavy-lift statement as its LVM3 rocket hurled the US communications satellite BlueBird Block-2 into low Earth orbit.

Aravalli Hills Row: Why Definition Battle Could Decide Mining Water Security And AQI In North India

'For mines already in operation, states have to ensure compliance'

NEW DELHI: Amid all-round protests over Supreme Court's acceptance of a uniform definition of Aravali hills, the Union environment ministry on Wednesday sought to defuse the crisis by deciding to further expand prohibited areas and directed a central institution to identify additional areas/zones in the entire mountain range where mining should be prohibited, over and above the areas already identified for mining ban.At present, 0.2% of the total 1.4 lakh sq km area of Aravali is eligible for mining. The new direction on Wednesday means the prohibited areas may ultimately be extended even within this 0.2% area.""This exercise by the Centre would further enlarge the coverage of areas protected and prohibited from mining in the entire Aravalis, keeping in mind the local topography, ecology and biodiversity,"" said the ministry after issuing the direction.Besides asking the central institution, Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), to identify additional areas for a mining ban, the ministry also directed Aravali-range states for a ban on the grant of any new mining leases in the area.Though the ministry's direction is a reiteration of what the apex court ordered on Nov 20, it was issued to bring more clarity on the entire issue in the wake of public protests.This prohibition applies uniformly across the entire Aravali landscape and is intended to preserve the integrity of the range. The directions are aimed at safeguarding the Aravalis as a continuous geological ridge extending from Gujarat to the National Capital Region, and at stopping all unregulated mining activities,"" said the ministry.The apex court had in its judgment on Nov 20 clearly directed that ""no new mining leases shall be granted till the finalisation of the Management Plan for Sustainable Mining (MPSM)"" for the entire Aravalis.""Accordingly, ICFRE is directed to look into the entire Aravali landscape including its continuity as a geological ridge extending from Gujarat to Delhi while preparing MPSM and to identify all such land forms/zones where mining needs to be prohibited in addition to the areas which already stand prohibited for mining including the core/inviolate areas and the hills and ranges so that the same could also be conserved and protected,"" said the ministry's letter to chief secretaries of Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat.The Centre has also directed that for the mines already in operation, the state govts concerned shall ensure strict compliance with all environmental safeguards and in conformity with the Supreme Court's order. ""Ongoing mining activities are to be regulated stringently, with additional restrictions, to ensure environmental protection and adherence to sustainable mining practices,"" said the ministry.Clarifying a media report on the Supreme Court's Central Empowered Committee's (CEC) purported views of disapproving a new 100-metre definition threshold for mining prohibition in the Aravalis, sources in the ministry said such expert view was never presented before the apex court as part of the CEC's view as it was an individual expert member's comment in the context of protecting the mountain range.The official clarified that one of the CEC members, J R Bhatt, attended the deliberations on the subject on Oct 3, but no examination of the report, prepared by the ministry, had been done by the CEC.""Hence, the views attributed to the CEC in the affidavit filed by the ministry are, in fact, those of Bhatt and not of the CEC,"" said the official, underlining that the CEC is of the considered opinion that the 100-metre definition will be adopted in order to ensure the protection and conservation of the ecology of the Aravali Hills and its range.","At present, 0.2% of the total 1.4 lakh sq km area of Aravali is eligible for mining. The new direction on Wednesday means the prohibited areas may ultimately be extended. The directions are aimed at safeguarding the Aravalis as a continuous geological ridge.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126166549,imgsize-728958,width-400,resizemode-4/the-supreme-court-has-admitted-a-plea-challenging-the-union-environment-ministry39s-recommendation-to-define-aravali-hills-as-those-with-100m-elevation-for-mining.jpg"

'Best Time To Invest, Innovate And Make In India': PM Narendra Modi

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi's praise for ""transformative"" job creation in Karnataka led I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw Wednesday to assert that it was an acknowledgement of the success of PM Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' programme.He said on X, ""Thanks Rahul Gandhi for acknowledging the success of PM Modi's 'Make in India' programme. As you have noted, we are becoming a producer economy as we implement our PM's vision.""In a recent social media post, the LoP in Lok Sabha had cited a news report to highlight the hiring of 30,000 staff in 8-9 months, the fastest factor ramp-up seen in India so far, by Foxconn in the Congress-ruled Karnataka.Rahul had said, ""It is transformative job creation. What makes it even more powerful is that the unit is largely women-led, with around 80% women, most aged 19-24, and for many, this is their first job. Karnataka is setting an example by creating an ecosystem where manufacturing can grow at this scale and speed. This is India we must build: jobs with dignity, and opportunities for all.""Officials pointed out that it was during Covid that the Modi government, tapping into the widespread recognition to diversify supply chains, nudged Apple's vendors, including Foxconn, to shift significant parts of their manufacturing operations from China. The nudge often resembled a covert operation as Beijing sought to block reshoring. At the time, it was a BJP government in Karnataka and Centre's production linked incentives played a major role as it provided sops to mobile manufacturers. The government followed it up with incentives for electronic components.Since then Foxconn has bolstered its operations in the country with a large presence in Tamil Nadu and is also looking at facilities in UP.","I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw: ""Thanks Rahul Gandhi for acknowledging the success of PM Modi's 'Make in India' programme"" LoP in Lok Sabha had cited a news report to highlight the hiring of 30,000 staff in 8-9 months, the fastest factor ramp-up seen in India so far.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126166489,imgsize-610560,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-10.jpg"

ISRO’s Heaviest Launch Yet: Five Reasons Why BlueBird-2 Marks India’s Big Leap In Global Space Race

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday congratulated Isro after its ‘Bahubali’ rocket LVM-M6 successfully placed US’s new-generation BlueBird Block-2 communication satellite, weighing 6,100 kg, into orbit.It was the heaviest payload to be placed into the low earth orbit (LEO) in LVM3’s launch history -- the previous heaviest was the LVM3-M5 communication satellite 03, weighing about 4,400 kg, that was placed into the geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) on November 2.“A significant stride in India’s space sector. The successful LVM3-M6 launch, placing the heaviest satellite ever launched from Indian soil, the spacecraft of USA, BlueBird Block-2, into its intended orbit, marks a proud milestone in India's space journey,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.The mission marks the 6th operational flight of the LVM3 launch vehicle. It also represents a significant leap in telecommunications technology, as the US payload is designed to provide high-speed 4G and 5G connectivity directly to smartphones.BlueBird Block-2 is the second important US satellite launch from India this year after the Indo-US joint mission’s NISAR, the world’s costliest (around $1.5 billion) and most advanced Earth-imaging satellite.As of late Dec 2025, Isro has launched at least 234 satellites for the US.Since 2015, when India launched the first commercial US satellites on board PSLV-C30, American satellites make up the largest portion of the total 434 foreign satellites launched by Isro, contributing significantly to the nearly $143 million in foreign exchange revenue generated by these launches.Space minister Jitendra Singh also congratulated Isro on the successful launch. ""I think it is the moment of glory for the country. It has been possible because of the progress of the last 10 to 12 years (under the PM Narendra Modi-led government).Even though the American satellites were being launched from Sriharikota earlier as well, today's launch has demonstrated to the world that we have the capacity to launch a satellite as heavy as 6,000 kgs,"" he said.Placing a 6-tonne-class satellite into LEO is significant because payload mass has become a key indicator for constellation efficiency in the direct-to-device and hybrid satellite-terrestrial era. Heavier satellites enable higher payload consolidation, fewer orbital assets, simplified phasing, and lower per-user costs when serving mass-market connectivity.From an operator’s perspective, this reduces both capital intensity and operational complexity. India’s demonstrated ability to support such missions meaningfully alters how global satcom players model constellation architecture, insurance exposure, and launch diversification.Commenting on the broader significance, Subba Rao, president of Space Industry Association India, said: “This mission demonstrates that India is now part of the core commercial LEO deployment landscape. The importance lies not only in launch success, but in what it signals about India’s industrial readiness, reliability, and ability to support constellations at scale over time. That confidence is what global operators ultimately build programmes around. ”Several industrial units from the Indian private industry have contributed significantly to LVM3 rocket success.Ananth Technologies Pvt Ltd (ATL), a long-standing partner of the Indian Space Programme, said, 'It is proud to have contributed to this historic mission"". ""ATL has been closely associated with the LVM3 programme and has delivered critical flight hardware, avionics systems, electronics, and precision subsystems that play a vital role in mission success,"" a company statement said.","PM Narendra Modi congratulated Isro after its ‘Bahubali’ rocket LVM-M6 successfully placed US’s new-generation BlueBird Block-2 communication satellite.

PM Modi Flags Off Two Highways To Curb Congestion In Delhi-NCR

NEW DELHI: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Wednesday slapped an ""intention to termination notice"" - the final procedure before termination - on Roadways Solutions India Infra Ltd (RSIL) for failing to meet the construction target of a 35-km stretch of the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. The physical and financial progress on this stretch in Gujarat was barely 4.9% and 4.6%, respectively, of the target.The progress on two other stretches - 27 km and 25 km - being constructed by the company in the state is at 23% and 36%. The dismal pace of construction may push the revised deadline of the project beyond March 2028, sources said.Pune-based RSIL is an engineering and construction company that operates mainly in the roads and highways sector. The company had bagged the packages of the expressway in Gujarat in 2021.Suprisingly, NHAI had terminated the contract of RSIL for two stretches in March 2023 and then re-awarded them to RSIL in Nov 2023 after it again put in the lowest bid. TOI on Feb 14 had first reported how the slow progress on these three stretches, with a total length of 87 km in Gujarat, was delaying the over Rs 1 lakh crore project.In a letter to RSIL, NHAI said the ""intention to termination notice"" has been issued on account of contractor's ""absolute and continued non-performance"".It said, ""...despite the contractor having been granted repeated indulgences and more than adequate opportunities through the execution of three settlement agreements, the contractor has achieved a negligible financial progress of only 4.59% (after lapse of 16 months from the appointed date of Aug 31, 2024)"".The letter said that as per the originally envisaged timeline of 18 months commencing from Aug 31, 2024, the contractor ought to have achieved approximately 70% financial progress. Mentioning how little progress has been made even after 16 months conclusively establishes that completion of the Jujuwa-Gandeva section of the expressway by Nov 15, 2026 ""is wholly impossible"", it said.The highways authority claimed that despite granting repeated opportunities and its extended assistance to the contractor, it ""failed to demonstrate any improvement or to achieve the requisite progress"". It said that even after three settlement agreements, the contractor failed to meet targets. ""In the settlement agreements, it was specified that if it fails to achieve agreed milestones, NHAI will terminate the contract without any cure period notice. So, we have served the notice,"" said an official.Cure period notice is issued to a contractor to fix any breach in 60 days. NHAI said the communication may be treated as a ""15-day notice"", as per the contract agreement, and after the expiry of this period, the authority ""shall be entitled to terminate the contract agreement"". It has also said the incomplete three packages under RSIL are creating significant public inconvenience across multiple fronts. In the case of two other sections, NHAI is likely to give a cure period notice to RSIL.","Pune-based RSIL is an engineering and construction company that operates mainly in the roads and highways sector.

""We Are Not Safe..."" Unnao Rape Victim’s Mother Manhandled, Protest Stopped

NEW DELHI: Kuldeep Singh Sengar, former UP MLA convicted of raping a minor girl in Unnao in 2017, did not come under the definition of a public servant under the Pocso Act Delhi high court held in its Dec 23 order suspending his sentence.In a curious move, high court has decided the applicability of a stringent Pocso Act section that carries a minimum jail term of 20 years, which can be extended up to life, while hearing Sengar's plea for suspension of sentence, even as his appeal against the trial court ruling remains pending.A bench of Justices Subramonium Prasad and Harish V Shankar faulted the trial court for treating Kuldeep Sengar as a public servant and handing him jail for the ""remainder of life"", for the offence of ""aggravated penetrative sexual assault"" under section 5 of the Pocso Act.The bench concluded that the charge of ""aggravated penetrative sexual assault"" under the section was not applicable in the case of Sengar. Section 5 of the Pocso Act defines ""penetrative sexual assault"" against a minor as ""aggravated penetrative sexual assault"", if committed by persons holding positions of authority - including a public servant or police officer within their jurisdiction, members of the armed or security forces, or staff of hospitals or prisons.high court noted that Pocso Act did not define a public servant and that the trial court wrongly relied upon Prevention of Corruption Act to borrow the definition.""In view of specific inclusion of IPC, CrPC, JJ Act and IT Act in Section 2 of the Pocso Act, this court cannot take aid of the definition of 'public servant' from any other Act other than IPC, CrPC, JJ Act, and IT Act. Notably, CrPC, JJ Act, and IT Act do not provide for the definition of a public servant,"" high court observed, pointing out that MLA is not recognised as a public servant under any of these statutes. It held that ""same reasoning applies for his conviction under section 376(2)(b) of IPC"".Counsel for the survivor, opposing the suspension of sentence, argued that even if Sengar does not under come under definition of a 'public servant' within purview of Section 5(c) of the Pocso Act, he can still be sentenced to imprisonment for the remainder of his life.The bench, however, noted that since it was prima facie satisfied that ""that offence under Section 5 of Pocso Act is not attracted in present case"", survivor's contention ""that the investigation was compromised cannot be a ground not to suspend the sentence of the appellant, more so looking at the period of incarceration already undergone"".","Kuldeep Singh Sengar did not come under the definition of a public servant under the Pocso Act Delhi high court held in its Dec 23 order suspending his sentence.

Indian Travel Vlogger Anant Mittal Held In China, Comments On Arunachal Pradesh Trigger Detention

NEW DELHI: China now actively covets Arunachal Pradesh, much like it does Taiwan and other areas in the South and East China Seas, as part of its strategy to achieve ""great rejuvenation"" as a nation, while it continues to arm Pakistan with latest military hardware like multirole J-10C fighters, the latest US department of defence report says.""China's leadership has extended the term 'core interest' to cover Taiwan and China's sovereignty claims amid territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the Senkaku Islands, and the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh,"" the annual Pentagon report on China's military capabilities said Tuesday.TOI has repeatedly reported that China progressively upped the ante in the eastern sector (Sikkim, Arunachal) of the 3,488-km LAC after its People's Liberation Army (PLA) made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in the western sector in April-May 2020.Though troop disengagement between India and China from the two remaining immediate face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh took place in Oct last year, there is still no actual de-escalation on the ground with the rival armies remaining forward deployed for the sixth successive winter all along LAC.Indian officials say Arunachal, especially Tawang sector that China claims as ""South Tibet"", is ""heavily guarded"" with ""a very high density"" of troops and weapon systems to counter any threat.Taking note of the ongoing thaw in overall India-China ties, the Pentagon report says China ""probably seeks to capitalise on decreased tensions"" along LAC to stabilise bilateral relations and prevent the deepening of US-India ties, after the Modi-Xi meeting on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Oct last year.""However, India probably remains sceptical of China's actions and motives. Continued mutual distrust and other irritants alm-ost certainly limit the bilateral relationship,"" it added. The report largely dwells upon China's rapid and formidable development of its military capabilities across all domains, from land, air and sea to space, cyberspace and electronic warfare, which has ""made the US homeland increasingly vulnerable"".The PLA, for instance, has continued its ""massive nuclear expansion"" and is fully on track to have over 1,000 warheads by 2030 from the stockpile of around 600 at present. It also plans to have six more aircraft carriers by 2035 to add to its three existing ones.China has also steadily armed Pakistan to bog India down in South Asia. As of May this year, it had delivered 36 J-10C fighters to Pakistan, apart from the earlier four 054A/P multi-role frigates and other platforms.

NEW DELHI: Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 349 on Wednesday, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category, according to the Sameer app, as dense layer of toxic smog continued to blanket large parts of the national capital, including areas around India Gate.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed widespread pollution hotspots across the city. Mundka recorded an AQI of 385, followed by Okhla at 382, RK Puram at 376, Punjabi Bagh at 373, and Wazirpur at 372 — all categorised as very poor.The readings indicated a slight improvement from Tuesday morning, when Delhi’s AQI had touched 414, falling in the ‘severe’ category. However, air quality remained worse than Sunday evening’s AQI of 377, underlining a sharp deterioration over the last 48 hours.According to news agency PTI, several trains are running behind schedule due to dense fog in the region, causing inconvenience to passengers.A few flights have also been delayed due to foggy conditions.Meanwhile, Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said the ‘No PUC, No Fuel’ policy would continue in the national capital even after GRAP-IV restrictions are lifted, as part of sustained efforts to curb vehicular pollution.Addressing a press conference, Sirsa said enforcement had been tightened against errant pollution testing centres. “Under our ‘No PUC, No Fuel’ drive, we identified 12 Pollution Under Control Certificate (PUCC) centres involved in irregularities. They have been suspended and will be blacklisted,” he said.To check industrial emissions, Sirsa added that the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has issued 411 closure notices, while the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has sealed 400 polluting units so far.","Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 349 on Wednesday, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category, according to the Sameer app. Mundka recorded an AQI of 385, followed by Okhla at 382, RK Puram at 376, Punjabi Bagh at 373, and Wazirpur at 372.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126151184,imgsize-389352,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/air-quality-dips-to-very-poor-with-aqi-349.jpg"

Shane McMahon’s WWE legacy and wealth creation

Business ventures and Marissa Mazzola-McMahon’s role

Shane McMahon and Marissa Mazzola-McMahon, who both served as WWE Producer/Director, are worth a combined $650 million, the result of decades spent near one of sports entertainment’s most influential families and a carefully curated soon-to-branch portfolio beyond the ring. Shane, as a key McMahon heir, has had his financial profile associated with WWE's ascendance to a worldwide media conglomerate for decades, while Marissa's career has been largely away from the limelight.Their fortune, collectively, is uneven but complementary at best. The vast bulk of the couple's wealth originates from Shane, who owns most of the couple's cash, investments, and property, as Marissa’s professional income and personal assets serve to augment, not scale, the family nest-egg. Rumors in the financial, as well as the gossip and entertainment worlds, have put their collective net gross at around $205 million by the year 2025, but the numbers are tightly held secret from the outside world and media.Even hooks have different weights, and for Shane McMahon, his financial foundation came from WWE, where he served in various capacities as an executive, on-camera talent, and brand representative.He was in charge when WWE became a publicly traded, globally syndicating corporation, a transition that paid senior insiders in the form of salaries, bonuses and equity-linked pay. Shane also became recognized over the years for the insane, risk-taking, high impact, physical matches that elevated his brand and worth.Overall, Shane's net worth is often assumed to be around $200 million in the year 2025 as an individual. That number includes years of WWE and associated earnings, assets from the McMahon family estate, and WWE-affiliated corporate relationships. Although he was never as high on the control totem pole as his old man, Vince, his standing in the company meant he was around some significant cash decisions in WWE's most successful years.Shane McMahon has built up a portfolio of separate business interests away from the world of WWE, with a particular focus on technology, media, and emerging industries in the United States. He has been chairman and advisor to a number of companies, as part of the indication that he might be looking to diversify beyond wrestling-related income. They have not always been runaway headline-grabbers, but all together they build up his overall financial footprint and his long game for the long haul.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Less dramatic is the financial story of Marissa Mazzola-McMahon.

Torrie Wilson’s WWE legacy and long-term earnings

Justin Tupper’s business career and investment footprint

Torrie Wilson and Justin Tupper are often described as a low-key power couple of WWE, balancing a legacy sports-entertainment career with modern digital media leadership. While Wilson is a well-known name around the world in wrestling circles, Tupper has flown a bit under the radar in the business of sports and content platforms.Uniting as a couple, their 2025 net worth speaks to both prudent career choices, diversified income sources, and a life of relatively low pomp and circumstance. Instead of bombastic and excessive numbers and stories, their financial narrative thrives through longevity, strategy, and continual relevancy.Another notable entry on the list is Torrie Wilson, who racked up her wealth in the early 2000s, which is viewed as the peak of WWE's commercial success. Without a doubt, one of the most recognisable Divas in company history, the television contracts, pay-per-view bonuses, merchandise royalties, modelling opportunities, and other ventures outside of wrestling all accumulated over the years. She also snatched up mainstream magazine covers, including shots in fitness and lifestyle magazines, which only increased her earning power.Wilson continued his earnings through WWE Legends deals as well as convention and Hall of Fame appearances, even after walking away from full-time wrestling.However, in recent years, she has earned an income with social media partnerships and fitness brand collaborations. Her personal net worth by 2025 is estimated to be anywhere around $2 million, a number not so much created by in-ring work at that point but rather from the appropriate use of a well-maintained brand.Yet Justin Tupper’s earning power from a different professional world also adds immensely to the couple’s overall wealth. Tupper took advantage of early trends in direct-to-consumer sports media as the founder of Revolution Golf, a digital golf instruction and commerce platform. His company's being purchased and absorbed into a greater media universe was a seminal financial moment of his professional life.After the success, Tupper had moved into senior management positions in tech firms that serviced sports and entertainment firms, earning a salary and long-term incentives on an ongoing basis. His net worth is probably not public knowledge, but as a benchmark for startup executives at his level with founder exits, the assets are in the low-to-mid seven-figure range. His financial profile consists of business equity rather than salary to be reinvested, rather than being a random celebrity income.Also Read: Trish Stratus and Ron Fisico combined net worth in 2025: WWE legacy, fitness ventures, and family wealth","Torrie Wilson and Justin Tupper are a low-key power couple of WWE.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025.

How does the UAE get its water?

1. Desalination: Turning seawater into supply

2. Groundwater: An ancient but limited resource

3. Treated Wastewater: Recycling for a sustainable future

4. Water storage and importation

What About the Wadis? Another smart move





Planning for the Future: UAE Water Security Strategy 2036

21% reduction in total water demand

Increase the water productivity index to USD 110 per cubic metre

Reduce the water scarcity index by three degrees

95% reuse of treated wastewater

Ensure universal, affordable access to safe drinking water

Innovation amid scarcity







Known as one of the world’s most luxurious destinations, the United Arab Emirates is famous for its soaring skyscrapers, supercars, and extravagant lifestyle. Beyond this image of wealth and opulence, the country is also economically robust. With a GDP of $504 billion and a population of just 9.52 million, it ranks among the most stable economies globally, supported by strong financial infrastructure, high per capita income, and low unemployment. Yet, despite this prosperity, the UAE faces one of its biggest challenges: freshwater scarcity.Situated in the arid desert of the Arabian Peninsula, the country has no permanent rivers or natural lakes. Minimal rainfall and high evaporation mean it relies on rainwater from the Hajar Mountains, which feeds seasonal wadis and underwater gorges. While natural sources once met all water needs, today desalination provides the majority of supply, as rising urbanisation, population growth, climate change, and over-extraction of groundwater place increasing strain on this vital resource.According to the State of Energy Report 2015, 42% of the UAE’s water requirement is fulfilled through desalination, with nearly 70 major plants in operation. These facilities contribute to 14% of the world’s total desalinated water output, making the UAE one of the world’s top producers.Desalination methods used include: Reverse Osmosis (RO), Multiple-Effect Distillation (MED) and Multiple-Stage Flash (MSF).Between 2008 and 2012, water demand surged by 35.8%, intensifying the need for sustainable desalination. Today, the UAE is actively exploring renewable energy-powered desalination technologies to meet long-term needs.In some regions, ancient aquifers (underground water reserves) are still tapped. However, these are rapidly depleting due to over-extraction and are not viable as a permanent solution.The UAE has made significant strides in reusing wastewater. Treated water is redirected for irrigation, landscaping, and industrial applications helping to conserve valuable freshwater. The national goal is to safely reuse 95% of all treated wastewater.The UAE has invested heavily in large-scale reservoirs and emergency storage tanks to ensure water availability even during crises. Though not widely publicized, officials have acknowledged exploring water importation from neighboring regions to boost supply resilience.While the UAE has no permanent rivers, it is home to wadis, seasonal valleys or dry riverbeds that come alive during rare but intense rainfall. Much of this rain falls on the steep slopes of the Hajar Mountains, running off to collect in the wadi beds. Here, water forms temporary pools and streams, particularly in areas with underlying springs such as Wadi Wurayah, while also seeping into limestone and gravel aquifers to replenish underground water stores.These underground reserves are vital for agriculture and other human uses. Beyond their practical importance, wadis support local biodiversity and attract eco-tourism, with Wadi Shawka in Ras Al Khaimah standing out for its striking natural beauty and popular hiking trails. In a country defined by arid deserts, these seasonal waterways play a crucial role in sustaining both life and livelihoods.To ensure long-term sustainability, the UAE launched the Water Security Strategy 2036, developed with input from all key stakeholders involved in national water management. The strategy outlines bold targets:This strategy aligns with the National Water and Energy Demand Management Programme, which targets 40% efficiency improvements across the transport, industry, and construction sectors.The UAE’s success in managing water despite natural scarcity highlights its forward-thinking governance and engineering prowess. With climate change and population growth threatening water supplies globally, the UAE’s model offers valuable lessons for other arid nations.Although it may seem paradoxical, a nation without natural rivers has remarkably emerged as a leader in water security and urban sustainability. The UAE’s story is not just about thriving in the desert, it’s about how innovation and vision can transform scarcity into strength.","The United Arab Emirates has no permanent rivers or natural lakes.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s joinery from Manipal





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014.
