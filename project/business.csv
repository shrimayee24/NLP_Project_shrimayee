Russian Rama to Lankan Sita: All the world's a stage for Ramlila,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russian-rama-to-lankan-sita-all-the-worlds-a-stage-for-ramlila/articleshow/113996287.cms,"Russian Retellings:

Lanka Legends:

In Myanmar, it's ' Thiri Rama ,' in Thailand, ' Ramakien ,' and in Indonesia, ' Kakawin Ramayana .' From Russia to America, the Ramayana has taken on new names and faces, proving that this ancient Indian epic is more than just an exported tradition - it's a cultural remix. And it can just as easily don new costumes on stages worldwide.Baryshnikov Evengii, a 25-year-old theatre artist in Moscow who has been part of Russian Ramlila productions, says the characters of the Ramayana feel very familiar to him.""In the image of Rama, I see echoes of our Russian heroes such as Ilya Muromets, a brave, selfless warrior devoted to his people. Indian mythology and Russian folklore contain similar themes, such as the struggle between good and evil and love for the homeland,"" he says.Few know the Soviet Union held its first stage performance of Ramayana way back in 1960 at Moscow's Children Theatre. Gennady Mikhailovich Pechnikov, a renowned Russian actor, co-directed the Russian adaptation and portrayed Ram, holding this role for 40 years and earning international acclaim. It is said he became a life-long vegetarian to play Ram. After Pechnikov died in 2018, a Russian-Indian friendship society known as Disha has worked to revive cultural ties through performances of the 'Ramayana'. The 'Disha Ramlila' was shown in Ayodhya last year. ""Our productions are not more than 25 minutes long, depicting all episodes from the swayamvar to Ram's return from exile,"" says Rameshwar Singh, founder of Disha, who went from JNU to the Soviet Union in the 1980s to pursue his PhD in Russian but chose to stay, marrying a Russian artist and becoming a citizen.In Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname, the Ramlila remains a culturally and religiously significant event. The tradition was brought to the Caribbean by Indian indentured labour between 1838 and 1917. Indrani Rampersad, a fourth-generation Indian from Trinidad and a scholar of Hindu culture and Ramayana traditions in the indentured diaspora, differentiates between two styles of Ramlila - 'lokadharmi' and 'Natya'. The version performed in Trinidad and other Caribbean countries is primarily in the 'Lila' or lokadharmi style, which is a community-based, open-air form of storytelling rooted in Bhakti traditions incorporating elements of katha, kirtan, and bhajan.""Blacks and Muslims are also characters in some of these Ramlilas. But it is not approached as a drama. It is a sacred space within a sanctified space marked by bamboo fences, almost like a mandir. The audience stands outside the fence. The ritual element is very strong. It is not rich people staging a show for money. There are no tickets,"" explains Rampersad, who contrasts this with the Natya style prevalent in India's urban centres, where Ramlila is performed on proscenium stages. This theatrical style is influenced by British traditions. ""But for the diasporic community in the Caribbean, it is a way to preserve Indian cultural identity, where much like Ram in exile, it helps them to restore dharma (order) in their new lands,"" adds RampersadIn countries like Indonesia and Thailand, performances aren't restricted to Navratri. ""In places like Uluwatu Temple in Bali, the Ramayana is performed every day, drawing tourists from around the world. You won't find this anywhere in India,"" says Cokorda Putra, a lecturer at the Hindu University of Indonesia in Denpasar. Beyond his academic role, Putra is also a trained dancer, known for bringing to life characters such as Kumbhkaran and Ravana. ""I cherish this role of Ravana because it exudes authority and power - qualities that, as ordinary humans, we all aspire to,"" Putra says.The kingdom of Thailand's 'national book' is the Ramakien, a local adaptation of the Ramayana. The country's rulers, from the Chakri dynasty, are traditionally named 'Rama', showing strong cultural links to the ancient tale. The Thai version is a royal court tradition rather than a public festival. ""While the Indian Ramlila emphasises devotion to Rama, in Thailand, the Ramayana story has evolved into a classical form of entertainment, reserved for royal and public ceremonies,"" says Nareerat Phinitthanasarn, a lecturer at Thammasat University and a seasoned performer of Ramakien productions. Thai adaptations of the Ramayana, such as Khon and Lakhon, have long been seen as high art, enjoyed not only for their storytelling but also for their intricately choreographed movements. While Ramlila in India is often male-dominated, with men playing even female characters, Thailand has embraced gender equality in these performances. Female actors, including Phinitthanasarn, take on significant roles, including that of Rama himself.Although Ramlila is rare in Sri Lanka, where the majority of the population is Buddhist, govt-sponsored groups have performed in India. For them, Ravana is a revered figure rather than villain. Performances of the Ramayana often begin by portraying Ravana and his prosperous reign before his sister Surpanakha enters the scene with her bleeding nose. ""More than Sita, I'd much rather play Mandodari, Ravana's queen. Even though she's on stage for just 15 minutes, she's powerful, poised, and artistic. When Sita arrives, Mandodari doesn't lose her cool,"" says Kalpi Jayaratne from Colombo, who often plays 'Seetha'. Sri Lankan performances showcase Kandyan folk styles alongside South Indian dance forms like Bharatanatyam.Across cultures and continents, the performance of the ancient epic proves that it can be a vehicle for building new bridges. Bala Sankuratri, who has helped bring several international Ramlila troupes to India, sums it up: ""It is not just a retelling of a story. It is a cultural force that unites us all.""","In Myanmar, it's'Thiri Rama,' in Thailand,'Ramakien,' and in Indonesia,'Kakawin Ramayana.'

What is a Classical Language and how is it chosen?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-a-classical-language-and-how-is-it-chosen/articleshow/113994193.cms,"How is a language selected for ‘classical’ status?

High antiquity of (its) early texts/recorded history over a period of 1,500-2,000 years.



A body of ancient literature/texts which is considered a heritage by generations of speakers.



Knowledge texts, especially prose texts in addition to poetry, epigraphical and inscriptional evidence.



The 'Classical Language' and literature could be distinct from its current form or could be discontinuous with later forms of its offshoots.



The lder criterion that a language's ""literary tradition be original and not borrowed from another speech community"" has been dropped.

What changes for language after gaining ‘Classical’ status?

Two major annual international awards for scholars of eminence in classical Indian languages.



A Centre of Excellence for Studies in 'Classical Languages' has been established to support advanced research.



University Grants Commission (UGC) is requested to create professional Chairs in central universities to support the study of 'Classical Languages'.

How Marathi, Bengali, Assamese got this status

Is conferring this status also a political tool?

Was Marathi included with eye on Maharashtra polls?

Do such titles create language hierarchies?

The Union Cabinet on Thursday expanded the list of India's 'Classical Languages' to 11 by including Marathi , Pali, Prakrit, Assamese and Bengali in it. Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia were already members of this league. Tamil was the first to get 'classical' status in 2004, while Odia, the sixth, got it in 2014.""Classical Languages serve as a custodian of Bharat's profound and ancient cultural heritage, embodying the essence of each community's historical and cultural milestones,"" Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.The category of 'Classical Languages' was created on Oct 12, 2004, with Tamil being the only entry. In November that year, the ministry of culture created a Linguistic Experts Committee (LEC) under the Sahitya Akademi to examine the eligibility of other possible contenders. Sanskrit was declared a ' Classical Language ' in 2005, Telugu and Kannada in 2008, and Malayalam and Odia in 2013 and 2014, respectively.A govt press release says selection criteria for a 'Classical Language' have been revised twice since 2004, the last time in July this year. These are:The govt promotes the study and preservation of 'Classical Languages'.For example, in 2020, three central universities - Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, New Delhi; Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati; and Sri Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth, New Delhi - were established to promote Sanskrit. Likewise, the Central Institute of Classical Tamil was set up to facilitate the translation of ancient Tamil texts, promote research and offer courses for university students and language scholars of Tamil. Centres of excellence for studies in classical Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, and Odia were established under the Central Institute of Indian Languages in Mysuru.States with 'Classical Languages', such as Odisha and Tamil Nadu, are entitled to annual grants for the study, research and promotion of their languages.In July 2013, a committee headed by Prof Rangnath Pathare submitted a report to the Centre. Professor Hari Narke, coordinator of the 10-member committee that gathered evidence to show that Marathi is at least 2,300 years old, said, ""It is a wrong perception that Marathi is an offshoot of Sanskrit or that it is merely 800-1,000 years old."" Narke said the committee submitted 80 pieces of documentary evidence to show that Marathi is an original language.In 2023, the state higher education department of the West Bengal govt established the Institute of Language Studies and Research (ILSR) to advance knowledge in language studies, translation and cultural research. The institute gathered evidence for two years and prepared a draft that was submitted to the Centre. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee wrote to PM Modi in 2024, urging the acceptance of Bengali as a classical language.Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma on October 1 said his govt is in ""regular contact"" with Modi and the Centre to recognise Assamese as a 'Classical Language'. On his X handle, Sarma stressed why it should be granted 'Classical Language' status.Conferring 'classical' status on a language has political implications, particularly during the election season. Recognising the cultural heritage of a specific linguistic group allows parties to garner support in regions where language defines identity.Language has long been a significant tool in identity politics. For example, the UPA-led Centre accorded 'Classical Language' status to Tamil after the DMK-led alliance swept the 2004 state elections. DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi offered support to Manmohan Singh's UPA govt on condition that Tamil be granted the status of a 'Classical Language'.Five of the first six 'Classical Languages' - barring Sanskrit - were spoken in South India. This time, the states whose languages have been chosen form a belt from west to east: Maharashtra (Marathi), Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (Pali and Prakrit), West Bengal (Bengali), and Assam (Assamese).The first proposal to include Marathi in the list came from a Congress-led Maharashtra govt in 2013. The decision has come a decade later when BJP and its allies run both the Centre and the state. It's also timed very close to the state elections. Political observers say this decision can be used to seek votes in the name of Marathi asmita (Marathi pride).Rating languages can give rise to the perception that some languages are more prestigious or culturally significant than others, especially in a multilingual country like India. The Marathi versus non-Marathi political narrative in Maharashtra that has fuelled several elections is a classic case of language hierarchy in the state. Sentiments against Hindi and Gujarati are reinforced during the elections. Even down south, leaders of political parties in Tamil Nadu, including the late M Karunanidhi, criticised the Union govt's attempts to promote Sanskrit in schools by mandating the three-language formula.","The Union Cabinet on Thursday expanded the list of India's 'Classical Languages' to 11. Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia were already members of this league. Tamil was the first to get 'classical' status in 2004, while Odia got it in 2014.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113994229,imgsize-1257286,width-400,resizemode-4/113994229.jpg"

The special college council has now pronounced stringent punishment against 59 perpetrators on finding substantial proof of some of the charges.The students, barring six, have been barred from the campus for six months to one year depending on the nature of their misconduct.Six were let go with a warning. The council has categorised the 59 - 36 junior doctors and 23 students - against whom the probe was conducted, into three groups depending on the severity of misconduct.Students and junior doctors said reign of terror by the group began after Sandip Ghosh took charge as principal in 2021. While the name of house staff Asish Pandey appeared several times as far as threat culture is concerned, sources alleged that Sourav Paul, a senior resident at the radiotherapy department, was the one who would pull the strings.While Pandey is in CBI custody, Paul is also under scanner. Both are among the 10 who have been handed over the most stringent actions by the council. Expelled from the college and hostel, their names will also be forwarded to West Bengal Medical Council for re-evaluation of their registration. ""They not only decided who will get good marks and who will fail but also took bribes from juniors against seats for internships or house staff,"" an intern said.Ten of the 59 interns, house staff and senior residents of the hospital, who were charged on multiple counts, were expelled from the institute till further notice by the special college council, which held a meeting on Saturday.They were charged with threatening students, physical and mental torture, verbal abuse, sexual harassment, buying drugs and alcohol and performing obscene acts at the boys' hostel, among other offences.Names of those expelled have also been sent to West Bengal Medical Council for evaluation of their medical registration certificates.","Students and junior doctors said reign of terror by the group began after Sandip Ghosh took charge as principal in 2021.

exclusive interview

Excerpts:

This is your first official bilateral visit to India since you assumed office last year in November. After being on a roller coaster for the past 10 months, the relationship seems to have stabilised and things are looking up. What would you attribute this turnaround to?

What are the big takeaways you are looking at from this visit? Apart from the continued developmental support, is there any specific assistance you are expecting from India to tide over the current financial situation?

With the expulsion of Indian military personnel, you managed to have your way on a sensitive issue, fulfilling also one of your campaign promises. Are you looking to set limits on defence cooperation with India, given that some other agreements signed during your predecessor’s term are also said to be under review? What sort of role do you see India playing in boosting your defence capabilities and in ensuring peace, security and stability in this part of the Indo-Pacific?

During EAM Jaishankar’s visit, several new projects and initiatives were announced which, as you said, will boost local economy and contribute to the Maldives’ prosperity. You have acknowledged the restructuring of line of credit arrangement too. Are you satisfied with the progress in executing some of the big-ticket projects like the Greater Male Connectivity Project?

China continues to be the elephant in the room as far as India’s ties with Maldives are concerned. You are looking to expand your defence cooperation with China, while also boosting trade and investment ties. As you work with the Chinese, can India be sure that the Maldives won’t do anything that might undermine India’s security interests?

The Maldives will soon be implementing the FTA signed with China in 2017. What do you make of concerns that it might undermine Maldives’ economic sovereignty, given the considerable trade imbalance?

Not long ago, many people saw you also as one of the architects of the India Out campaign. Going by recent developments in the relationship, and the prevailing air of positivity, would you say we are seeing the return of what used to be known as Maldives’ India First policy? Or you think it’s important for the Maldives to reduce its dependence on India, despite the geographical proximity?

As the dramatic improvement in India-Maldives ties in recent months culminated in President Mohamed Muizzu’s first state visit to India that started Sunday, the president toldin anthat the Maldives would never do anything that undermines the security of India.Before his meeting with PM Narendra Modi on Monday, and amid concerns here over the strategically located neighbour’s growing ties with China, Muizzu said that while Male continues to enhance cooperation with other countries in various sectors, it remains committed to ensuring that its actions do not compromise the security and stability of the region.Muizzu said India is a valued partner and friend of the Maldives, and the relationship is built on mutual respect and shared interests. He also said the Maldives will continue to pursue strong and strategic ties with India and work jointly to ensure regional stability.While following a Maldives First policy , the president added, his country will continue to prioritise its longstanding and trusted relationship with India. “We are confident that our engagements with other nations will not undermine India’s security interests,” said the president, adding Maldives will continue to pursue strong and strategic relations with India.Maldives and India now have a better understanding of each other’s concerns and defence cooperation between them will always be a priority, said the president. He justified the expulsion of Indian troops though saying it reflected the will of the local people.Muizzu said recent developments reflect a positive trajectory in bilateral relations and it will be clear by the end of his maiden state visit that Male is committed to fostering a cooperative and mutually beneficial partnership.This is my first State Visit to India, and I am very happy to be making it, in my first year in office. I thank President of India, Her Excellency Droupadi Murmu and the Government for the kind invitation. As you know, I have already undertaken a visit to India, for the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister His Excellency Narendra Modi in June this year. I have also had the pleasure, soon after my inauguration in November, to meet the Prime Minister on the sidelines of COP28. You can agree, that’s far from being a roller coaster ride. This historic relationship is intertwined like the roots of a tree, built on centuries of exchanges and values shared. We have been working on preparing for this visit for a while and have come to mutual understanding and a convenient time. The relations between the Maldives and India have always been strong, and I am confident this visit will further strengthen it.As this is my first State Visit to India, I hope this demonstrates the commitment that both Governments have towards enhancing the relationship, and work towards a shared vision for development. India continues to be one of our largest trade and development partners. And I am confident that this will be a very successful trip. I am sure you will find those out soon enough, as the visit is just around the corner.As I said just now, India is one of our biggest development partners, and defence cooperation will always be a priority. In these globally challenging times, with regional wars threatening the security of all countries, it is vital to foster these collaborations, especially the security of Indian Ocean Region. And I can confidently say, Maldives and India now have a better understanding of each other’s priorities and concerns. What I did is what the people of Maldives asked from me. The recent changes reflect our efforts to address domestic priorities. Our review of past agreements is aimed at ensuring they align with our national interests and contribute positively to regional stability. As the world’s largest democracy, I believe that the people and Government of India, understand it.We are very happy with our relations with India, and it will only grow from strength to strength, especially following this visit. Greater Male’ connectivity project is one major project between our countries. We are pleased with the progress made on several key projects and initiatives announced during External Affairs Minister Jaishankar’s visit. These projects are vital for boosting our local economy and contributing to the Maldives’ prosperity. The line of credit arrangement has been a positive step, facilitating smoother execution of these projects. While there is always room for improvement, we are confident that with continued collaboration and support, significant advancements will be achieved, particularly with major projects like the Greater Male Connectivity Project.Maldives would never do anything that undermines the security of India. India is a valued partner and friend of the Maldives, and our relationship is built on mutual respect and shared interests. While we enhance our cooperation with other countries in various sectors, we remain committed to ensuring that our actions do not compromise the security and stability of our region. The Maldives will continue to prioritize its longstanding and trusted relationship with India, and we are confident that our engagements with other nations will not undermine India’s security interests.The Maldives values its economic partnerships and is committed to fostering growth and development through diverse international collaborations. We are mindful of maintaining our economic sovereignty and ensuring that our trade policies benefit the Maldivian people. We will continue to engage in transparent and balanced trade practices to address any concerns and uphold the economic interests of our nation.The Maldives values its relationship with India and acknowledges the importance of our geographical proximity and historical ties. Recent developments reflect a positive trajectory in our bilateral relations, and we are committed to fostering a cooperative and mutually beneficial partnership. I believe at the end of this trip it will be clear to all. While it is essential for the Maldives to diversify its international relations and reduce over-dependence on any single country, we remain dedicated to maintaining a strong and strategic partnership with India, ensuring that our policies serve the best interests of our nation and contribute to regional stability. In my inaugural speech in November 2017, I made it very clear. My policy is ‘Maldives First’ policy. For me, Maldives will always come first. But respect for our neighbors and friends is embedded in our DNA. Indians have always been welcome in the Maldives, Indians continue to prosper in the Maldives, and be safe and happy. Indians’ make a positive contribution to the Maldivian society. Indian tourists are welcome in the Maldives. And we look forward to enhancing this important characteristic of our partnership – people to people connections.",Maldives and India now have a better understanding of each other’s concerns and defence cooperation between them will always be a priority. Muizzu said the Maldives will continue to pursue strong and strategic ties with India. He justified the expulsion of Indian troops though saying it reflected the will of the local people.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113989337,imgsize-141212,width-400,resizemode-4/113989337.jpg"
Kamptee Road Flyover: Asia's Longest Double-Decker Flyover Inaugurated in Nagpur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/asias-longest-double-decker-flyover-inaugurated-in-nagpur/articleshow/113972502.cms,"Union minister Nitin Gadkari inaugurated Asia's longest double-decker flyover on Saturday, which also features the continent's first four-tier structure.

NAGPUR: In a groundbreaking moment for infrastructure, Union minister Nitin Gadkari inaugurated Asia's longest double-decker flyover on Saturday, which also features the continent's first four-tier structure. The engineering marvel near Gaddigodam Gurudwara on National Highway, integrates four different levels of transit, with a Metro line at the top, followed by a flyover, a railway track beneath it, and finally, a road at the base at a single location.The 5.6km double-decker Kamptee Road flyover from LIC Square to Automotive Square, constructed by MahaMetro and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) at a cost of Rs573 crore, now surpasses the earlier record held by Nagpur's 3.14km Wardha Road flyover.Both projects set benchmarks for double-decker flyover construction, but this latest achievement breaks new ground with its innovative four-tier configuration.Initiated in 2019, the project faced multiple challenges, including acquisition of private properties in the bustling Sadar area. Despite these obstacles, the flyover was completed, marking a significant milestone in urban transportation.Speaking at the inauguration, Gadkari highlighted the potential of adopting ultra-reinforced concrete technology, which is widely used in Singapore and Malaysia, for upcoming infrastructure projects. ""I have proposed this technology to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has given me the responsibility of using it in Parliament's Vista as well as in future Metro projects, which could reduce construction costs by 20%,"" he said.The flyover promises to drastically cut travel time, allowing motorists to cover 20km (Kamptee to Nagpur airport) in just 20 minutes. Gadkari also mentioned the demand from Sadar residents for a dedicated entry to the flyover, with MahaMetro already working on a design. Additionally, the road beneath the flyover leading to Kamptee is slated for concrete reconstruction, funded by the Central Road Fund (CRF).Gadkari praised MahaMetro, NHAI, and local officials, including collector Vipin Itankar and municipal commissioner Abhijeet Chaudhari, for their efforts in completing this ambitious project. He emphasized that NHAI has invested between Rs1,300 crore and Rs1,400 crore in Nagpur's three major flyovers – Kamptee Road, Wardha Road, and Pardi.The minister also lauded Nagpur Metro for setting a new benchmark in Metro construction, achieving costs of Rs350cr/kilometre, which is significantly lower than those in other Indian cities. Gadkari further announced plans for redeveloping Gaddigodam Market to facilitate smoother traffic flow in the area.This flyover stands as a testament to modern engineering, blending innovation and functionality to address the growing needs of urban transit.","The 5.6km double-decker Kamptee Road flyover from LIC Square to Automotive Square, constructed by MahaMetro and National Highway Authority of India at a cost of Rs573 crore.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Sunday addressed the widely discussed debate around the relevance of the United Nations and the need for the multilateral body to reinvent itself to stay in tune with the changing times.Choosing to give a business-like response, given the nature of the forum, the EAM quipped that the United Nations is ""like an old company, not entirely keeping up with the market but still occupying the space"".EAM Jaishankar said that although the UN remains in place, its inability to address major issues push countries around the world to look for alternative solutions.""There is a UN, howsoever sub-optimal, but when it doesn't step up on key issues, countries figure out own way of doing things,"" EAM said at the Kautilya Economic Conclave in the nation capital on Sunday.The minister also touched upon, what he suggested was ""inaction"" of the UN during the Covid-19 outbreak.""During Covid, countries either did their own thing or you had an initiative like Covax, which was done by a group of countries. When it comes to the big issues of the day, I think increasingly you find combinations of countries who come together and say, let's agree on this and let's go and do it,"" he said.Referring to the raging war in Europe and Middle East and UN's inability to stop it yet, Jaishankar said, ""Where is the UN on them, essentially a bystander?""""Increasingly there is a non-UN space,"" further he said.The EAM also raised the difficulty of resolving the region's challenges, especially with certain parties unwilling to recognise their roles in ongoing conflicts. He further pointed out the limitations in global political capacity, noting that some urgent issues are overshadowing others.""There is limited bandwidth in global politics , with some issues taking up most of the attention.""As the one year anniversary of the Israel conflict looms large over the Middle East, Jaishankar said, ""Tomorrow marks exactly one year since Israel... The IMEC is not dead, but the response we anticipated did not materialize.""""Last year's conflict showed that the risks are much higher than we had imagined.

What's on the agenda

Improving ties



NEW DELHI: Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.As per media reports in the Maldives , Muizzu, his wife Sajidha Mohamed, and a high-level delegation of Maldivian government officials traveled on a special flight arranged by the Indian government, a gesture reserved for such visits by Maldivian presidents.Muizzu will receive an official welcome on Monday.During his visit from October 6-10, Muizzu will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi , external affairs minister S Jaishankar and other top ministers to discuss various bilateral, regional, and international issues.The president's upcoming discussions are expected to lead to several agreements that could enhance bilateral cooperation.Muizzu has been criticised for pivoting his island nation sharply towards China, and eyebrows were raised in New Delhi after he decided to break tradition by not making India his first foreign visit after taking office in November last year. Instead, he initially visited Turkey and China - a significant diplomatic shift, particularly given that his administration has been perceived as pro-China and has previously campaigned on an ""India Out"" platform.This change in approach had raised concerns about the future of India-Maldives relations, which had become strained following Muizzu's election.However, ties between the two countries have been warming up with Muizzu publicly acknowledging India's importance, referring to it as ""one of the closest allies and invaluable partners"" of the Maldives. The Maldivian president's acknowledgment of India's role in providing aid during times of need also indicates a willingness to move past contentious rhetoric towards constructive engagement.This shift could pave the way for a more balanced approach that respects Maldivian sovereignty while recognising India's strategic interests in the region.Geopolitically, the Maldives is crucial for India's 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) initiative and its 'Neighbourhood First Policy'. The Maldives serves as a key maritime neighbor in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), making it strategically significant for India's national security interests.The president met EAM Jaishankar on Sunday evening shortly after landing in New Delhi.""Pleased to call on President Muizzu today at the start of his State Visit to India. Appreciate his commitment to enhance 🇮🇳 🇲🇻 relationship. Confident that his talks with PM Modi on Monday will give a new impetus to our friendly ties,"" the external affairs minister posted on X.Official talks and signing of agreements with Indian leadership are scheduled for Monday.President Muizzu will also meet with the Maldivian community living in India, on Sunday.He will also engage in business events in Mumbai and Bengaluru, highlighting the importance of economic ties between the two nations.The delegation accompanying president Muizzu includes foreign minister Dr Abdullah Khaleel, defense minister Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon, minister of homeland security and technology Ali Ihusaan, finance minister Moosa Zameer, health minister Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim, and economic development minister Mohamed Saeed.Other key officials joining the visit are attorney general Ahmed Usham, tourism minister Ibrahim Faisal, transport & civil aviation minister Mohamed Ameen, construction & infrastructure minister Dr Abdulla Muththalib, and chief of staff at the President's Office Abdulla Fayaz, alongside several senior officials.Muizzu last visited India in June to attend the swearing in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During the visit, the two leaders met and discussed strengthening bilateral relations between Maldives and India.The two leaders also met on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai in December last year.Relations between the two countries had deteriorated after two Maldivian deputy ministers made defamatory comments about PM Modi and India on social media, amid ongoing discussions about the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the Maldives.The two officials, Malsha Shareef and Mariyam Shiuna were suspended from their roles in the Ministry of Youth and later resigned on September 10 this year.Withdrawal of Indian military personnel was a key pledge of President Muizzu, and the transition was carried out peacefully, with civilians replacing Indian troops as per the agreement between the two governments.Muizzu's administration has since appeared committed to mending relations with India.","Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.

This, officials said, is ""almost taking a U-turn"" on what govt had approved in Dec 2019 as part of its efforts to end departmentalism within the railway bureaucracy.The latest move comes after the railways struggled to get enough fresh technical manpower through Indian Railway Management Service (IRMS) over the last two years.Railways has now sought to recruit 225 engineers through Civil Services Examination ( CSE ) 2025 for which applications will be invited.On Saturday, Centre's department of personnel and trainning (DoPT) approved ""in-principle"" the proposal to hire via CSE and Engineering Services Examination (ESE) ""considering the unique requirement of both technical and non-technical manpower"" in the ministry. DoPT decided on the issue within two days of railways sending the proposal on Thursday.Under IRMS, there was one exam and the eligibility criteria was the same for all applicants from both technical and non-technical backgrounds.Within hours of the go ahead, railways wrote to UPSC and department of telecom (DoT), mentioning that the latter being the nodal agency for ESE has notified the rules and has sought applications by Tuesday. It requested DoT and UPSC to include indent for 225 railway engineers by adding to existing notification and to extend the deadline for submission of applications.The new recruits will be called IRMS (Civil), IRMS (Mechanical), IRMS (Electrical), IRMS (S&T) and IRMS (Stores). Earlier the prefix for these services was Indian Railway.""The fresh move is nothing but going back to the old days.

IAF quietly shooting down 'Chinese spy balloons' at high altitudes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-quietly-shooting-down-chinese-spy-balloons-at-high-altitudes/articleshow/113993660.cms,"NEW DELHI: The IAF has quietly been practising shooting targets mimicking Chinese spy balloons at very high-altitudes, with the latest instance being of an omni-role Rafale fighter jet using an air-to-air missile to bring down such a target in the eastern sector a few months ago.The IAF began drawing up contingency plans for such an eventuality after a 200-foot-tall intelligence-gathering Chinese balloon flew over continental US for several days in Jan-Feb 2023 before it was finally shot down by an American F-22 Raptor using an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile.The US had shared information with India and other countries about the incident.""The IAF formulated TTPs (tactics, techniques and procedures) to handle such contingencies. It has been practising the capability to interject in such situations at different flight envelopes,"" a source told TOI.""Rafale's demonstration was at an altitude of over 55,000 feet, way over what had been practised earlier. The target balloon, with a payload, was relatively smaller than the Chinese one that violated US airspace,"" he added.The fifth-generation F-22 flying at an altitude of 58,000 feet, had launched the missile to hit the balloon at an altitude of well over 60,000 feet on Feb 4 last year.The IAF's 4.5-generation Rafale, which are armed with the 120-150-km range 'Meteor' and 70-km MICA air-to-air missiles among other weapons, in turn, went after the target that was flying at an altitude of over 55,000 feet.Chinese spy balloons, which are akin to huge unmanned airships and capable of sending ""burst transmissions"", are difficult to detect and intercept since they have low radar cross-sections and fly at very high altitudes.In early-2022, a high-altitude balloon-like object was spotted over the strategically located Andaman and Nicobar islands but nothing much could be done because India as yet does not deploy fighters on the archipelago on a permanent basis, though IAF fighters do operate from the islands on short-term detachments for exercises.China, of course, also regularly deploys its 'spy' vessels in the Bay of Bengal and southern India Ocean to track India's ballistic missile launches as well as map oceanographic and other data useful for navigation and submarine operations.The IAF has based its 36 Rafales at the Hasimara and Ambala airbases. Hasimara is close to the Sikkim-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction and the strategically-vulnerable Siliguri Corridor on the eastern front with China.",The IAF began drawing up contingency plans for such an eventuality after a 200-foot-tall intelligence-gathering Chinese balloon flew over continental US for several days in Jan-Feb 2023.

This occurred even as dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand, slightly improved, thanks to the surplus rain in Aug.However, even the Aug rain couldn't boost fecal coliform level, which, at its peak, was a staggering 4,900,000 MPN (most probable number)/100 ml.This is 1,959 times higher than the standard of 2,500 units and 9,800 times the desired limit of 500 units. This was the worst pollution in the river, in terms of fecal coliform, since Feb 2022, when the fecal level at Agra Canal (one of the stations at the river stretch in the city) had reached 6,300,000 units.The fecal level in the river was assessed by Delhi Pollution Control Committee for Sept, a report of which was released on Oct 4, with samples collected on Sept 4. The report comes at a time when certain stretches of the river are already showing heavy frothing, a visible proof of pollution when mixed pollutants like surfactants and phosphates are churned out to reveal their presence. DPCC doesn't test these parameters.Due to the surplus monsoon, which retreated on Oct 2 this year, Yamuna managed to have a good flow as additional water was released from upstream. This, however, improved the status of dissolved oxygen, which depicts the presence of life in the river, or potential, throughout its stretch. As per standards, BOD must not exceed 5 mg/l, and DO must not go below 5 mg/l, which is the standard for outdoor bathing. While BOD depicts the capacity of water to clean itself, as it is the amount of oxygen required for water to treat organic matter in it, fecal coliform represents the presence of untreated sewage in the water.According to the report, at its entry at Palla, the DO level was 8 mg/l, while the BOD was 3 mg/l, and the fecal level was 1,600 units-all within the standards. However, as the river traversed further, the pollution load increased. By the time the river reached Wazirabad, DO and FC were within standards; however, BOD had already breached the mark. As the river reached Nizamuddin, FC reached 1,100,000 units, worsening further to 3,500,000 units at Okhla, 1,100,000 units at Agra Canal, and 4,900,000 units at the city's exit after the confluence of Shahdara and Tughlakabad drains.","Fecal coliform level at its peak was 4,900,000 MPN (most probable number)/100 ml.

(Image credit: X/@VPIndia)

NEW DELHI: Vice president Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday slammed the ""anti-national"" narrative and said that the exercise of executive authority by either judiciary of legislature is not in consonance with democracy as also constitutional prescriptions .Without naming any party, Dhankhar said that the anti-national narrative is concerning to India and there is a need for concerted endeavours to influence the national mood so as to neutralise these pernicious forces.Addressing the felicitation ceremony of Karan Singh on completion of 75 years in public life, Dhankhar said, ""Executive governance is exclusive to the Executive, as are legislation to legislatures and verdicts to courts. Exercise of executive authority by either Judiciary of Legislature is not in consonance with democracy as also constitutional prescriptions. This is established position as the executive for governance is alone accountable and answerable to the legislature and courts respectively.""""Executive governance by the judiciary is jurisprudentially and jurisdictionally beyond constitutional sanctification. However, this aspect is engaging active attention of the people indicating in their perception umpteen such instances,"" he further added.At the facilitation ceremony, he also talked about Karan Singh and said that his journey in public service began the day he was born, and limiting his contributions to just 75 years would hardly capture the breadth of his legacy.Born in France, Karan witnessed and participated in history in a way few can claim. At the age of 16, he stood witness to the signing of the Instrument of Accession at a pivotal moment in the nation's history, not just observing but strengthening the very foundation of that historic document. At 18, he assumed the role of Regent, arriving in Srinagar from Delhi on June 20, 1949, welcomed by Sheikh Abdullah and his Cabinet at the airport. In that moment, he represented not just himself, but the strength and sovereignty of India during a critical juncture in our history.He said that Karan's decision to transition from the royal comforts as the constitutional head of state of J&K to electoral politics in 1967 was bold and visionary. In doing so, he achieved a historic milestone, becoming the youngest-ever member of the Union Cabinet at the age of 36 on March 13, 1967. This marked a turning point in his career and signaled the arrival of the country's youth, ready to take up the mantle of responsibility and shape the nation's future.""Dr Singh has long been a champion of inter-faith harmony, advocating for it at numerous public meetings and conferences, many of which are well documented. Over the years, he has become such a prominent figure in the realm of spirituality and philosophy that his name naturally arises whenever great thinkers are mentioned,"" Dhankhar said.The vice president further added, ""Speak of Vivekananda, and Dr Karan Singh comes to mind. Mention Aurobindo, and Dr Singh stands out as one of his most learned disciples. His vast body of work, comprising scores of books, reflects the depth of his intellectual pursuits. A true poet-philosopher, he has explored subjects as diverse as philosophy, spirituality, and the environment.""He also appreciated Karan for his role in conserving India's national animal, the tiger. Talking about India's development, Dhankhar said, ""Karan has witnessed the rise of the nation over seven decades, presently in an unprecedented economic upsurge and on an incremental developmental trajectory, well set to be a developed nation by 2047, if not earlier.

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday ruled out bilateral talks with Pakistan during his upcoming visit to the country for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ).Speaking at the Sardar Patel lecture on Governance, Jaishankar said that while India desires good relations with Pakistan, it cannot be achieved by disregarding the issue of cross-border terrorism and engaging in unrealistic expectations.""Like any neighbour, India would certainly like to have good relations with Pakistan, but that cannot happen by overlooking cross-border terrorism and indulging in wishful thinking. As the Sardar demonstrated, realism must be the foundation for policy. India's relationship with China is similarly an issue on which the Sardar Patel's instincts are on record, and they differ considerably from that of Prime Minister Nehru,"" Jaishankar said.Jaishankar also highlighted the differing views of Sardar Patel and former Prime Minister Nehru regarding India's relationship with China, citing their famous correspondence in 1950.In a press conference following the event, Jaishankar clarified that his upcoming visit to Pakistan for the SCO meeting will be a multilateral event, and he will not be discussing India-Pakistan relations ""I mean, I'm not going there to discuss India-Pakistan relations. I'm going there to be a good member of the SCO. But, you know, since I'm a courteous and civil person, I will behave myself, accordingly,"" he added.Jaishankar is scheduled to visit Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on October 15 and 16.The SCO, established in June 2001, is a Eurasian permanent intergovernmental international organisation consisting of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India, and China. Known as the ""alliance of the East,"" the SCO is the largest regional organisation in the world, covering three-fifths of the Eurasian continent and nearly half of the human population, representing around 42 per cent of the world's population and 20 percent of the global GDP.","Jaishankar is scheduled to visit Pakistan for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on October 15 and 16.

Back on old track: Govt gives nod for recruitment of Railway officers through engineering & civil services exams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/back-on-old-track-govt-gives-nod-for-recruitment-of-railway-officers-through-engineering-civil-services-exams/articleshow/113972540.cms,"NEW DELHI: The govt on Saturday gave the go ahead for recruitment of railway officers through Civil Services Examination (CSE) and Engineering Services Examination (ESE) after struggling to get enough fresh technical manpower through the IRMS, an integrated railway service that cabinet had approved in December 2019.Prior to the Cabinet approval of Indian Railway Management Service (IRMS), the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) used to carry out recruitment tests for railway officers through CSE and ESE.In an office memorandum, the personnel department (DoPT) on Saturday said that considering the railway ministry’s proposal of Thursday, it gave “in-principle approval” for recruitment through UPSC-CSE and UPSC-ESE “considering the unique requirement of both technical and non-technical manpower” in the ministry.Barely hours after the DoPT communication, the railway ministry on Saturday wrote to UPSC and the telecom department said now it has been decided that recruitment of IRMS would be made through CSE and ESE. It said that telecommunication being the nodal ministry for ESE has notified the rules and has sought applications by October 8. It requested the telecom ministry and UPSC to allow participation in the recruitment of 225 engineers by adding to existing notification.It proposed extending the deadline for submission of applications “in order to provide ample opportunity to the candidates for applying”. As per the letter, the new recruits will be called IRMS (Civil), IRMS (Mechanical), IRMS (Electrical), IRMS (S&T) and IRMS (Stores).Railway officials said that in a way this decision is nothing else than bringing back the old system. “The IRMS in railways is not working considering the functional requirement of manpower. Can a student with a history background be tasked to deal with laying of tracks? The govt has understood it. This is a positive move and good for railways,” said a senior official.Interestingly, while giving the “in-principle” approval for the new recruitment mechanism, the DoPT said, “The proposed scheme of recruitment shall not in any way, be in contravention to the decisions of cabinet December 24, 2019 (read merger of services to IRMS).”Railway officials, who had flagged flaws in the IRMS, said though in a way the integrated service will now be redundant, by putting this condition the govt has tried to avoid the embarrassment of how the earlier decision has not yielded the desired results.TOI has learnt that through UPSC-CSE recruitment of officers for accounts, personnel and traffic services would be made while UPSC-ESE would be the exam for recruiting employees for four engineering services -- civil, mechanical, signal, electrical and stores. The Railway Protection Force may be put under the home ministry considering this is a paramilitary force.It can be recalled that so far, no fresh officer recruited under the IRMS regime has joined work as the first batch is still undergoing training and railways isn’t funding enough takers as well.Sources said the Indian Railways had placed an indent for recruiting 150 personnel with the UPSC under the IRMS in 2022. But only 130 candidates were selected. While around 40 of them reported for training at LBSNAA at Mussoorie, the remaining opted for extra-ordinary leave (EOL). Those who reported at LBSNAA are undergoing the final phase of training at a railway institute in Lucknow.Though officials claim that successful candidates taking OEL is normal as they prepare for more exams and without salary, the second round of recruitment in 2023 has not found enough takers. While the railways had placed an indent for another 150 personnel under IRMS, barely 84 have been selected, sources said.The delay in appointment and lukewarm response have caused some shortage of manpower across zones, prompting the railways allowed re-engagement of retired junior railway officers as consultants on an ""exigency basis"" till Dec 2026 to address the staff crunch.In a recent letter, the Railway Board said that re-engagement of retired railway officers as consultants is aimed at addressing the challenges faced by “Zonal Railways due to vacant posts” and to ensure the continuity of operations and services.These consultants will be assigned responsibilities such as inspections, supervision and drawing. “They will be discharged immediately upon the joining of a selected candidate through UPSC or other departmental selection processes,” it said, indicating the delay in getting personnel under the IRMS regime.",Recruitment of railway officers to be done through Civil Services Examination (CSE) and Engineering Services examination (ESE) Personnel department (DoPT) gave “in-principle approval” for recruitment through UPSC-CSE.

"IT companies appraisal, hike cycles shift from June to September quarter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/it-companies-appraisal-hike-cycles-shift-from-june-to-september-quarter/articleshow/113996289.cms,"BENGALURU: The timing of salary increases within many IT companies has shifted from the traditional April-June period to the third quarter of the year, introducing a level of uncertainty as the process is now influenced by the demand outlook.Salary increases have become more unpredictable in recent years, with the frequency and timing of these raises varying significantly across industries and companies.The duration of time between wage hikes has also become less consistent, making it challenging for employees to anticipate when they might receive their next pay bump.Ravi Kumar, upon assuming the role of Cognizant CEO last year, implemented a one-time additional salary increase in April, just six months after the company's standard cycle. This measure was taken to address the high attrition rates experienced by Cognizant, which had previously provided a hike in Oct 2022. In the earnings press conference for the Sept quarter, CFO Jatin Dalal said that with the scope to improve utilisation and as attrition has fallen to desirable levels, the time of multiple hikes is over. Consequently, Cognizant implemented the annual pay increase in Aug this year.HCLTech also said in Aug this year that a firm decision had not been taken on salary increments this year after deferring the hike for some employees. Wipro , in the past, has rolled out raises in a staggered manner between April and Sept. Ray Wang, CEO of Constellation Research, said that sometimes, CFOs at the services firms do not have firm guidance on what the next four quarters will look like. All IT services firms - Indian as well as multinationals - have not hinted at a full recovery. They are still talking about green shoots in select areas but maintain that discretionary spending is yet to recover fully. Appraisals are being held back as both a risk mitigation measure and a cost saving one. ""The job market is loosening in the US, so employers have a little more leverage. However, in India, the job market is still tight, and GCCs are attracting talent due to these appraisal delays,"" Wang told TOI.Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services, in its pre-earnings report, said that margins for companies that defer wage hikes to the second half of the financial year will see an uptick in the Sept quarter. Margin pressures will show up in the second half for firms like HCLTech that haven't rolled out the annual hike this year. Earlier, IT services firms would roll out their hikes and promotions at the beginning of the financial year. The delay in the hike this year, as well as the previous year, is a testimony to the sluggish demand environment for the IT services industry.Sunil C, India country head at HR solutions firm Adecco, said that IT services companies often focus on short-term project outcomes rather than long-term gratification, leading to a skewed emphasis on immediate impact. ""This is especially true for high-demand niche skills and digital skills, where short-term performance metrics dominate the appraisal process. As a result, 8-12% of existing employees receive off-cycle hikes, while 30-40% remain stagnant without any salary adjustments. These factors collectively contribute to the current trends in wage hikes and promotions.""","The timing of salary increases within many IT companies has shifted from the traditional April-June period to the third quarter of the year.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

USCIS updates green card guidelines for those with extraordinary ability,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uscis-updates-green-card-guidelines-for-those-with-extraordinary-ability/articleshow/113944589.cms,"MUMBAI: The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its guidelines for the EB-1 category of visas (aka green cards), available to those who can ‘demonstrate’ extraordinary ability in their field of science, arts, education, business, or sports.Tired of being caught in a decades-long backlog for employment-linked categories of EB-2 (for workers with advanced degrees or specialized knowledge) or EB-3 (for skilled or professional workers) many Indians with a STEM background are exploring the EB-1A option (a sub category of EB-1).For instance, as per NFAP data, as of Nov 2, 2023, only 1.4 lakh Indians were in queue for a EB-1 green card , the numbers for EB-2 and EB-3 cumulative were over a millions.The updated guidance from USCIS focusses on the type of evidence to substantiate extraordinary ability that will be considered by USCIS when reviewing the EB-1 applications. A set number of criteria have to be met to succeed in obtaining this green card.USCIS now recognizes team awards. It also clarifies that past memberships in exclusive or prestigious groups in related fields will be accepted, there is also a relaxation in the conditions relating to publication and clarifications have been issued on exhibitions by the applicant.According to immigration attorneys these updates may broaden the eligibility criteria and aim to provide more transparency and assist petitioners in submitting accurate evidence. However, the exact impact remains to be seen.Awards are one of the ten evidentiary criteria available for EB-1 applicants, who must meet at three. The updated guidance states that team awards will be recognized for EB-1 applicants in categories of ‘lesser’ international and national awards and prizes. Tess Douglas, managing attorney at DGO Legal told TOI, “At the same time the guidance still says that the applicant must be named in the award. So, if a company receives an award for a project that the applicant worked on, it still will not be enough unless the applicant is named as a recipient of the award.” While past memberships in relevant associations will also be accepted. Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, points out that if the EB-1 application is not accompanied by any recent evidence, the length of time since membership could be a determining factor on whether the applicant has sustained his/her acclaim. Published material also helps an applicant substantiate his/her extraordinary ability. Here USCIS has removed the condition that the publication must demonstrate the value of the applicant’s work. Lastly, USCIS has clarified applications can include ‘comparable evidence’ for some non-artistic showcases or exhibitions.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) has updated its guidelines for the EB-1 category of visas (aka green cards) This category is available to those who can ‘demonstrate’ extraordinary ability in their field of science, arts, education, business or sports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113944585,imgsize-27930,width-400,resizemode-4/113944585.jpg"

In a statement shared with *Page Six*, Janice expressed her heartbreak over the accusations, claiming that her son was being judged unfairly.“It is heartbreaking to see my son judged not for the truth, but for a narrative created out of lies,” she stated, adding that her son deserves his day in court to prove his innocence.Janice also alluded to past incidents, acknowledging that Diddy has made mistakes, but maintained that these do not justify the current allegations against him.Diddy's legal team confirmed the authenticity of Janice's statement, which referenced surveillance footage from 2016 showing him allegedly assaulting ex-girlfriend Cassie. Despite this, Janice defended her son, saying that past mistakes do not equate to guilt in the present charges. She suggested that Diddy's decision to settle Cassie's lawsuit in 2023 had been misinterpreted as an admission of guilt by authorities.Meanwhile, attorney Tony Buzbee has revealed that 120 people, including minors, have come forward with sexual misconduct claims against Diddy. The allegations span from 1991 to the present, with Buzbee’s clients set to file lawsuits in New York and Los Angeles. Buzbee described the alleged abuses as occurring at events where victims were drugged and exploited.Combs’ lawyer, Erica Wolff, denied all allegations, describing the claims as false and defamatory.

Sheryl McCollum , the crime scene investigator who worked on Tupac Shakur ’s 1996 murder case , has suggested that Sean "" Diddy "" Combs could be connected to the rapper’s death and an earlier shooting in 1994. McCollum shared her thoughts during an interview with NewsNation, pointing to Combs' presence during key moments in Shakur’s violent history.McCollum highlighted the 1994 incident, where Shakur was shot five times during a robbery at New York’s Quad Studios.At the same time, Combs was in the building with around 40 people, all of whom remained unharmed.“This whole thing to me started in 1994 — the first time Tupac was shot,” McCollum said. “You ain’t gotta shoot somebody five times to take their jewellery and their money.” She added that it seemed suspicious that Combs and his group were untouched during the incident, saying, “How does that make sense to anybody that one person is going to be robbed and not the other 40? Who would have had more money and jewellery? Forty.”Shakur himself suspected foul play, openly accusing Combs, along with The Notorious B.I.G. and Bad Boy Records, of involvement in the 1994 shooting . Speaking to 'Vibe' magazine in 1995, he recalled the strange reaction of those present when he entered the studio, bleeding from his wounds: “Nobody approached me. I noticed that nobody would look at me.”Two years later, in 1996, Shakur was gunned down in a drive-by shooting after leaving a boxing match in Las Vegas. McCollum pointed out the similarities between the two attacks, noting that in both instances, Shakur was “trapped” — first in an elevator, then in a car — with no way to escape. She also noted the lack of video footage at both crime scenes, hinting that someone close to Shakur may have had prior knowledge of his location, according to Page Six.While Combs and Biggie Smalls denied involvement in Shakur’s murder, the theory has resurfaced as Shakur’s family considers filing a wrongful death lawsuit against Combs. This comes after Duane “Keefe D” Davis, who is currently charged with Shakur’s murder, suggested in a 2009 interview that Combs placed a $1 million bounty on the rapper’s life.Combs was arrested on September 16 at a Manhattan hotel and is facing charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. If convicted, he could face a life sentence. Currently held without release on a $50 million bond, Combs has yet to receive a trial date in the federal case.","Sheryl McCollum, the crime scene investigator who worked on Tupac Shakur ’s 1996 murder case, has suggested that Sean Combs could be connected to the rapper’s death and an earlier shooting in 1994. She highlighted the 1994 incident, where Shakur was shot five times during a robbery at New York's Quad Studios. At the same time, Combs was in the building with around 40 people, all of whom remained unharmed.
