While Modi was also expected to visit Saudi Arabia this month, that visit is now expected to take place next year because of a delay in finalization of dates.A reliable supplier of crude and LPG to India and home to a million-strong Indian community, Kuwait is the only Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) country Modi had not yet visited. Kuwait currently holds the GCC presidency. Kuwait foreign minister Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya had visited India earlier this month and met Modi to deliver him an invitation to visit the country.Recalling his meeting with Crown Prince of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah in September in New York, Modi had expressed satisfaction at the growing momentum in bilateral relations, according to an Indian readout. Modi discussed the situation in West Asia with the visiting foreign minister, expressing support for early return of peace, security and stability in the region. Kuwait had on December 1 hosted a summit of the 6-member GCC countries at which it had called for an immediate ceasefire and urged the international community to provide international protection for innocent civilians and to ensure ""the opening of safe corridors and the arrival of urgent humanitarian aid.""India too has repeatedly sought a ceasefire in Gaza and called for efforts to ensure that the conflict doesn’t spill over to other parts of West Asia.The visiting foreign minister and his counterpart S Jaishankar had signed an MoU for establishing a Joint Commission for Cooperation (JCC) at the level of foreign ministers, under which new joint working groups will be set up in areas like trade, investment, education, agriculture, technology, security and culture.""The JCC mechanism will act as an umbrella institutional mechanism to comprehensively review and monitor the entire gamut of our bilateral relations under the new Joint Working Groups and the existing ones in areas including Hydrocarbons, Health and Consular matters,"" said the Indian government.",PM Narendra Modi will visit Kuwait on December 21-22 for what will be the first visit by an Indian prime minister to the Gulf country in 43 years.

"J&J denied extension of patent on TB drug, to benefit patients",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jj-denied-extension-of-patent-on-tb-drug-to-benefit-patients/articleshow/116383276.cms,"New Delhi: In a move that will benefit tuberculosis patients, Indian Patent Office (IPO) has denied the US giant Johnson & Johnson's request to extend its patent on the life-saving TB drug Bedaquiline. This ruling potentially facilitates the entry of affordable versions of the long-acting injectable Bedaquiline over the next few years, improving access for millions of patients in India, and globally, patent experts told TOI.The cost of therapy for the injectable long-acting bedaquiline runs into hundreds of dollars, making it unaffordable for millions of patients in developing countries, including India, which are also tuberculosis hotspots. While tuberculosis drugs are supplied free of charge under the govt-run programme in India, the steep cost of treatment remains a significant challenge.With this decision, all three patent applications by Johnson & Johnson's pharma arm - Janssen - for Bedaquiline stand rejected by Indian Patent Office. Earlier in July, the company was denied a patent for a paediatric version of bedaquiline, a key treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis recommended by WHO. Last year, the company lost protection on the drug's primary patent.The present application filed by Johnson & Johnson's in 2020 seeking a patent for the long-acting injectable bedaquiline, primarily developed for tuberculosis preventive therapy, was opposed by patient groups - Delhi Network of Positive People, Ganesh Acharya and Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust.The patent was rejected on the grounds of lack of inventive step and novelty.Bedaquiline, the first drug approved to treat tuberculosis in 40 years, is hailed as a ""wonder drug"" due to its lower toxicity and greater effectiveness compared to traditional treatments that have been the standard for TB over the past five decades.","Indian Patent Office (IPO) has denied the US giant Johnson & Johnson's request to extend its patent on the life-saving TB drug Bedaquiline.

CHANDIGARH: Surprising fans during a live show in Chandigarh, singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh announced that he ""won't perform (live) in India until infrastructure for it is improved.""Stopping in the middle of a throbbing presentation on Saturday, he said, ""Instead of bothering us (artistes), improve your concert infrastructure or I will not perform in India... I want to say this to the administration. We do not have proper facilities for live shows here. It is a big revenue source. A lot of people work (on these events) and get employment due to it. So, please pay heed to it.""The statement was received by a fawning audience in the packed space with thunderous applause. Dosanjh also made it a point to say that it is not he who calls children to his recitals, but ""parents bring them"".Following Telangana's move some time ago, Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights had issued an advisory regarding ""maintaining noise level, not inviting kids to stage, and not singing songs promoting drugs, alcohol and violence"" during the performance.In a video that has now been shared widely on the social media, the singer, who has starred in films like ‘Chamkila’ and ‘Udta Punjab’, can be heard asking: “Will you stop me like this?”Dosanjh’s much-in-demand Dil-Luminati India tour , which kicked off in Delhi on Oct 26 and has drawn massive crowds in every city it has premiered, has had it rough with the administrations in various states across country. It has been fraught with challenges for the entertainer.Ahead of his concert in Hyderabad on Nov 15, Telangana govt issued a notice to Dosanjh asking him to “refrain from performing songs that promote alcohol, drugs, or violence”. It came after a professor from Chandigarh, Panditrao Dharennavar, filed a representation to authorities to not allow Dosanjh “sing such songs”. Accordingly, the singer at that time changed the lyrics of some of his songs, but criticised Telangana govt for restrictions imposed on him.His next in Ahmedabad saw him issue a challenge of his own. “If alcohol consumption is banned nationwide, I will no longer sing songs that mention it,” he had said.It was worse in Indore. Bajrang Dal and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) workers held a protest near the venue hours before the concert began. In response, Dosanjh dedicated his concert in the city to poet Rahat Indori, a resident of Indore who had died in 2020, and recited his lines: “If they oppose, let them; life is not at stake. This is just smoke, not the sky. Everybody’s blood (sacrifice) is mixed in this land’s soil, Hindustan is not anyone’s property.”","Singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh says he won't perform in India until infrastructure for it is improved.

Atul Subhash suicide case: Allahabad HC grants anticipatory bail to Nikita Singhania's uncle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/atul-subhash-suicide-case-allahabad-hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-nikita-singhanias-uncle/articleshow/116376569.cms,"Atul Subhash.

NEW DELHI: The Allahabad high court on Monday granted anticipatory bail to Sushil Singhania, the uncle of Nikita Singhania, in the suicide case of Artificial Intelligence engineer Atul Subhash. Justice Ashutosh Srivastava passed the order while hearing the bail application filed on behalf of Atul's wife, Nikita Singhania, and her in-laws.According to a Bengaluru Police official, Nikita Singhania was arrested in Gurugram, Haryana, while her mother, Nisha Singhania, and brother, Anurag Singhania, were arrested in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, for allegedly abetting Atul Subhash’s suicide. They were taken into custody on Saturday, brought to Bengaluru, and sent to judicial custody for 14 days after being presented in a local court.In the high court, senior counsel Manish Tiwary argued that while Nikita, Nisha, and Anurag had already been arrested, the anticipatory bail application was being pressed solely on behalf of Sushil Singhania.It was argued that the arrests were based on a suicide note and a video that had circulated online. The counsel submitted that Sushil Singhania, aged 69, suffers from chronic medical issues, is incapacitated, and could not have abetted the suicide.The counsel further argued that there is a difference between harassment and abetment, claiming that even if the suicide note is considered, the allegations suggest harassment rather than abetment. It was also submitted that Section 108, 3(5) of the BNS might not apply to the case.After hearing the arguments, the court ruled, “Considering the above, the court is of the opinion that applicant Sushil Singhania is entitled to get the privilege of pre-arrest (Transit) Anticipatory.”The court directed that if the applicant is arrested in connection with the case, he should be released on anticipatory bail until the police file a report under Section 173(2) of the CrPC. The applicant was asked to furnish a personal bond of ₹50,000 and two sureties of the same amount to the satisfaction of the magistrate or concerned court.The court also imposed conditions: the applicant must be available for police interrogation as required, must not influence witnesses, and cannot leave India without prior court permission. If the applicant has a passport, it must be submitted to the concerned SSP or SP.","The Allahabad high court granted anticipatory bail to Sushil Singhania, the uncle of Nikita Singhania.

Additionally, non-essential diesel light commercial vehicles meeting BS-IV or older standards registered outside Delhi are barred from entering the city.These restrictions mark an expansion from earlier regulations, which only applied to BS-III vehicles.Earlier on December 5, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) for Delhi-NCR revoked restrictive pollution control measures under stages 3 and 4 of the winter anti-pollution plan.

This development concerns India due to Sri Lanka's geographical proximity.Despite India's initial objections in August 2022, Sri Lanka eventually permitted Chinese vessels to dock for 'replenishment' at Hambantota.Meanwhile, Chinese surveillance vessels keep on patrolling the Indian Ocean region and using the Hambantota port.China secured a 99-year lease on Hambantota port after Sri Lanka struggled with loan repayments. The $1.7 billion project, with phase one completed in 2010, required annual payments of $100 million, which Colombo failed to meet.","Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Monday assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Sri Lanka would not permit its territory to be ""used in any way, in a manner that is detrimental to the interest of India"" The assurance came at a crucial point as China is intensifying its presence in the Indian Ocean region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116373305,imgsize-1196617,width-400,resizemode-4/116373305.jpg"

HYDERABAD: Indian students studying in Canada have reported receiving emails asking them to resubmit crucial documents such as study permits, visas and educational records, including marks and attendance.The request from Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), a government department that deals with foreign students, caused widespread panic among international students, many of whom hold visas with up to two years' validity.The development comes as IRCC tightens its policies to regulate the influx of international students, introducing stricter financial requirements and exploring potential caps on student admissions. ""I was a bit shocked when I received the email. My visa is valid until 2026, yet I was asked to submit all my documents again,"" said Avinash Kaushik, a postgraduate student from Hyderabad studying in Surrey, British Columbia. ""They even want proof of attendance, marks, where we are working part-time, etc.,"" he added.Last week, a similar surge in such emails was reported among students from Punjab. Some were even asked to visit IRCC offices in person to verify their credentials.

""Caps and financial requirements being introduced are a clear signal.

NEW DELHI: On the eve of, deposed Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Sunday called the interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus an ""undemocratic group"" that is ""secretly supporting anti-liberation extremist-communal forces.""In a statement to commemorate the defeat of Pakistani forces in Bangladesh’s Liberation War of 1971, Hasina dubbed Muhammad Yunus as a ""fascist"" seeking to stifle the spirit of the Liberation War and pro-liberation forces.The statement released by her party revolved around the role of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and the Awami League in the struggle that culminated in the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. Hasina took the opportunity to criticise Nobel laureate Yunus, who formed an interim government shortly after she stepped down and fled to India.""This undemocratic group, led by the fascist Yunus, has no responsibility towards the people,"" she said.""They are seizing power and obstructing all public welfare work,"" she added.Hasina slammed the Yunus-led administration, claiming that the people of Bangladesh were burdened by rising prices.""As this government is not democratically elected, it has no accountability to the people. Their main aim is to suppress the spirit of the Liberation War and the pro-liberation forces, silencing their voices,"" Hasina said.""The lack of sensitivity of the leaders of this government, including the fascist Yunus, towards the Liberation War and its history is evident in every step they take,"" she further said.Sheikh Hasina, who fled Bangladesh after massive student protests, accused the interim government of attempting to erase “progressive ideals,” the history and spirit of the Liberation War, and “all traces of the Great War of Liberation from national life.”In her statements after reaching India, Hasina has repeatedly accused Yunus of perpetrating “genocide” and failing to protect Hindus and other minorities. Yunus reportedly raised concerns about Hasina’s presence in India with Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri during a visit to Dhaka last week, claiming that the statements did not go well with the people of Bangladesh. Yunus and other high ranking leaders of the caretaker administration have sought Hasina’s extradition from India.","Sheikh Hasina calls interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus an ""undemocratic group"" Hasina says Yunus is seeking to stifle the spirit of the Liberation War and pro-liberation forces.

Setback for singer TM Krishna as SC says shouldn't be given MS Subbulakshmi award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/setback-for-singer-tm-krishna-as-sc-says-shouldnt-be-given-ms-subbulakshmi-award/articleshow/116370177.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said that Carnatic vocalist TM Krishna should not be recognised as the recipient of the MS Subbulakshmi award. It issued notices to Krishna, the Music Academy, and others on a plea filed by MS Subbulakshmi’s grandson, who challenged the use of the legendary singer’s name for the award, claiming it violated her will.The apex court on Sunday had declined to immediately intervene, stating that an appeal against the Madras high court’s order allowing the award could only be heard on Monday. Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna remarked, “The appeal will be heard on Monday, and the award could be taken back if the court ultimately finds any merit in the case.”Earlier, the Music Academy was granted relief when a division bench of the Madras high court stayed a single judge’s order restraining the academy from using Subbulakshmi’s name for the award. The bench of Justices S S Sundar and P Dhanabal observed, “From the plain reading of the contents of the Will, the testatrix did not want anybody to form or create or make any trust, foundation, or memorial of any kind including erecting of any statue or bust in her name or in her memory.”However, the bench rejected the interpretation that Subbulakshmi intended to forbid the conferment of awards in her name, stating, “Had it been the intention of the testatrix that no award shall be conferred on anyone in her name, that could have been expressed in simple language. An interpretation contrary to the plain language of the instrument is not permissible in law.”The court noted that during her lifetime, Subbulakshmi had acknowledged several works and awards instituted in her name, and such practices were not in dispute. It also highlighted that the plaintiff, her grandson, had not included other organisations that had instituted similar awards in her name, adding, “This court is unable to reject the contention or stand taken by appellants that the suit and the interlocutory application is not for a bona fide cause, but with an oblique motive against Krishna.”After the Madras high court on Friday allowed the Music Academy to proceed with the award, senior advocate N Venkataraman urgently mentioned the matter in the Supreme Court. The award ceremony took place on Sunday despite the pending appeal.","Supreme Court issues notices to Krishna, the Music Academy, and others on a plea filed by MS Subbulakshmi’s grandson.

Together, they raised three children - two daughters and a son. But as the years passed, differences began to surface, eroding the foundation of their relationship. By May 8, 2006, their lives had diverged and they began living apart.The husband filed for divorce, citing mental cruelty, but the Karnal family court rejected his petition in 2013. Unwilling to give up, he approached the high court, where his plea languished for 11 years before the court referred the case to its mediation and conciliation centre in Nov this year, offering a final opportunity for compromise.It was during this mediation process that a resolution was reached. The estranged couple, along with their grown-up children, agreed to dissolve the marriage. The husband committed to a remarkable alimony of Rs 3.07 crore.This sum was to be paid in a mix of demand drafts, cash, and gold and silver ornaments, reflecting the wealth accumulated over a lifetime. The land generated Rs 2.16 crore, while an additional Rs 50 lakh was paid in cash, earnings from his crops, including sugarcane. Gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 40 lakh were handed over to his former wife.The settlement marked a turning point. The agreement, signed on Nov 22, stipulated that the payment would serve as permanent alimony, closing all claims the wife or children might have had on the husband's properties.""Even after the death of the first party, the second and third party (wife and children) will not lay any claim over the estate,"" the agreement states, ensuring a clean slate for all involved.In its detailed order, the division bench of Justice Sudhir Singh and Justice Jasjit Singh Bedi formally dissolved the marriage, acknowledging the poignancy of the settlement.","Couple from Haryana's Karnal district has brought their 44-year-long marriage to a close.

"There's no proven drug yet to treat IPF, but there's hope",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/theres-no-proven-drug-yet-to-treat-ipf-but-theres-hope/articleshow/116383179.cms,"MUMBAI/DELHI: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the lung disease that claimed tabla maestro Zakir Hussain, is one of the most difficult conditions to treat because there is no proven medication. Specialists in Mumbai and Delhi whom TOI spoke to, said that two anti-fibrotic medications aimed at reducing the scarred lung tissues are the mainstay of IPF treatment . ""Most of our patients don't survive beyond three to four years after the diagnosis,"" said Dr Priti Meshram, who heads the respiratory medicine department at Maharashtra govt-run JJ Hospital in Byculla.Pulmonologist Dr Sujeet Rajan from Bhatia Hospital, Tardeo, though, said ongoing clinical trials for at least two compounds should help increase life expectancy a bit more. IPF is a condition in which lung tissues thicken and cause scarring. ""The scarred tissues impair oxygen transfer and make breathing increasingly difficult,"" said Dr Sourabh Pahuja from Amrita Hospital, Faridabad. It roughly affects 13-20 people per 1,00,000 people worldwide, said Dr Sandeep Nayar from BLK-Max Super Speciality Hospital, Delhi.One of the main problems with IPF in India is delayed diagnosis. The mean time between the appearance of symptoms and a diagnosis is between six months and one year in the West. ""In India, apart from the metro cities, the symptoms-to-diagnosis time is longer,"" said Dr Rajan. Given the high incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in India, it's likely the first diagnosis that a patient receives when he goes with the symptoms of coughing and breathlessness - that are common to both TB and IPF. ""Moreover, IPF shows up in most X-rays as a subtle shadow that is rarely considered worrisome,"" said Dr Rajan.Dr Randeep Guleria, former director of AIIMS who is with Medanta Gurgaon at present, told TOI the cause of IPF is not known, but recent studies suggest genetic and environmental factors play a role. ""Also, IPF is a disease that affects older people. As longevity is rising, so is the incidence of these diseases,"" Dr Guleria said. Dr Pahuja said mutations in the MUC5B gene, which produces a mucus protein crucial for lung health, significantly increases the risk, while Dr Nayar added smoking, viral infections, and gastroesophageal reflux disease could also be likely contributors.Dr Rajan said the incidence is growing worldwide, pointing to a link with rising air pollution. Despite the dismal picture, doctors said research should help in the near future. ""I just finished a trial for a new medicine that may be available in the next 12-18 months. Another potential medicine is on trial. Both have shown promising results in stabilising patients,"" said Dr Rajan.","IPF is a condition in which lung tissues thicken and cause scarring.

NEW DELHI: On his first visit to India, and amid growing Chinese security footprint in the region, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake assured PM Narendra Modi he won’t allow Lankan land to be used in a manner detrimental to India’s security interests.Modi said after the bilateral meeting with Dissanayake, who is in India for his first visit abroad as president, that the leaders agreed to finalise security and defence cooperation agreements, while acknowledging that their security interests are interconnected.Dissanayake’s remark, delivered at a joint press statement with Modi, is reassuring for India as the Marxist leader prepares to visit Beijing next month in a tough balancing act to keep ties stable with both India and China. Underlining the importance of mutual trust and transparency, both leaders agreed to prioritise each other’s security concerns.After the bilateral meeting, India and Sri Lanka also signed 2 MoUs, including one for avoidance of double taxation, and India announced grant assistance of $ 14.9 million for the signalling project of a railway section in Sri Lanka.The leaders discussed reconstruction and reconciliation efforts in Sri Lanka, with Modi expressing hope that Sri Lanka would fulfil the aspirations of the Tamil people, and its commitment towards fully implementing the Constitution of the country and conducting provincial council elections.Modi said in his media statement that he and Disanayaka were in full agreement that Indian and Lankan security interests were interconnected, and they had decided to quickly finalise a security cooperation agreement while also backing cooperation on hydrography. As they also agreed to ramp up defence cooperation, India and Sri Lanka will now explore the possibility of concluding a framework agreement on defence cooperation.“We believe that the Colombo Security Conclave is an important platform for regional peace, security and development. Under this umbrella, support shall be extended in the matters of maritime security, counter terrorism, cyber security, combating smuggling and organized crime, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,’’ said Modi, adding India shall stand as a trusted and reliable partner in the president’s efforts towards nation building. The Conclave, which also involves Mauritius and the Maldives, seeks to promote regional security by addressing transnational threats and challenges of common concern to the member-states.Asked about the contentious issue of Chinese research vessels berthing in Sri Lanka and whether this issue was raised with the president, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said India pointed to the importance and the sensitivity of its security concerns in that area and Dissanayake was “very upfront”in saying that he would ensure Sri Lankan territory isn’t used in a way that could impact India's security.The president also said in his remarks that Modi assured him India would work to protect Sri Lanka’s sovereignty and national integrity. He also raised the fishermen issue with Modi, seeking action against bottom trawling by Indian fishermen. Modi said he and Dissanayake agreed to adopt a humanitarian approach to the fishermen issue.“We have adopted a futuristic vision for our partnership. We have laid emphasis on investment-led growth and connectivity in our economic partnership. And have decided that physical, digital and energy connectivity shall be the key pillars of our partnership,’’ said Modi, adding that the leaders will work towards establishing electricity-grid connectivity and multi-product petroleum pipelines between both the nations.According to a joint statement, the leaders acknowledged the “positive and impactful” role of India’s development assistance to Sri Lanka, with Dissanayake appreciating India’s continued support for the implementation of projects despite the ongoing debt restructuring. “He further acknowledged India’s decision to extend grant assistance for projects that were originally undertaken through Lines of Credit, thereby reducing the debt burden of Sri Lanka,’’ said the statement, adding that the president acknowledged India’s crucial assistance in Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring process. “He further thanked the Government of India for extending financial assistance of $ 20.66 million to settle payments due from Sri Lanka for projects completed under existing Lines of Credit thereby significantly reducing the debt burden at a critical time,’’ it said.","Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake assured PM Narendra Modi he won’t allow Lankan land to be used in a manner detrimental to India’s security interests.

NEW DELHI: An “environment of fear, mistrust and division” prevails in India under the BJP govt, Congress MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi said on Monday while accusing the CBI of being an “uninvited guest”, entering houses and states without consent.While admitting that the Emergency was a “mistake” that lasted for 18 months, he said there seemed no time limit for the “undeclared emergency” in the country today.Participating in the debate on the Constitution in Rajya Sabha, Singhvi said, “That Emergency was a distortion, which the Constitution also supported. There were faults, but it ended. What is the time limit for this undeclared emergency which is there right now? What is the constitutional safeguard to end it, there is nothing, zero.”He accused the govt of working against the tenets of secularism and federalism. “The Constitution is under siege and pillars of democracy tremble as tyranny tiptoes into our temples of power, the sanctity of secularism is being shredded and federalism is fractured,” he added.On the trend of certain state govts bulldozing buildings, Singhvi said the Centre had glorified this so much that now CMs were competing with each other. He also attacked certain governors who, according to him, were working as super CMs and against the principle of cooperative federalism.Accusing the govt of misusing CBI, he said, “CBI, this unwanted and uninvited guest that enters all our houses. It enters a state without any consent, no general or special consent, and on puerile and very strange grounds.”He said all these are throttling federal structure while referring to the PM’s “phrase” of cooperative federalism.Taking a dig at the bureaucracy and media for playing to the tunes of govt. “The test which is paramount is servility and loyalty. HMV is the qualifying condition, not the old records which we love, it means his master's voice. Any independence is met with retribution, fear and transfer, etc. From a watchdog you made it into a lapdog,” he said.Earlier, JD(U) working president Sanjay Jha recalled the achievements of the JP movement and the atrocities of the Emergency. He also accused Congress of not taking necessary steps during the 1989 Bhagalpur riots which claimed 2,000 lives. “President’s rule was sought to be imposed in Bihar in 2005. Cabinet was convened at midnight and the orders were sent to the President who was in Moscow through fax,” Jha said.Before Jha's address, Congress MP and former minister Mukul Wasnik targeted the govt on issues of women welfare and asked till now no woman has become head of the BJP. “In RSS, which will complete 125 years, has anybody seen a woman becoming its head?” he asked, adding that leaders like Annie Besant to Sarojini Naidu had risen to the post of Congress president.",Congress MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi said there seemed no time limit for the ‘undeclared emergency’ in the country today.

NEW DELHI: States should gear up and lead in bringing reforms for ease of business, cutting red tapes, and reducing compliance burdens, to grab the opportunities of overseas investment coming to India due to changing global scenario, PM Narendra Modi told chief secretaries from states who were in Delhi for a three-day conference.The PM also told the top bureaucrats from states to prepare proper plans for development of tier -2 and tier-3 cities and towns, which are set to emerge as the major hub of economic activities, sources said. “Each such city has its own unique selling proposition (USP) and this must be harnessed while making development plans to attract investments. The PM’s focus was on creating more employment opportunities by getting higher investments and the states need to take lead,” said an official.Global investors are looking at India as a better destination for investment considering good returns compared to other nations, safe environment and huge domestic consumption propelled by the large middle class population. Industries are also looking at setting manufacturing units in India and to export to other countries.“The PM suggested to the chief secretaries that states hold thematic brainstorming sessions to prepare the plan for taking correct steps for growth and development.

NBA legend Scottie Pippen has gone from being one of the most renowned basketball players to a subject of ridicule thanks to his outrageous takes and beef with Grammy-winning rapper Future . Around 2015, rumors circulated suggesting that Scottie Pippen’s ex-wife, Larsa Pippen , was having an affair with Future. A year later, the couple filed for divorce, thus giving fans to the flame.Continue reading to learn more about the beef between Scottie Pippen and Future.Larsa Pippen and Future met towards the end of 2015, as revealed by Larsa herself, the two spoke for over seven hours during their first meeting. Shortly after they met, rumors circulated, alleging that Larsa was having an affair with Future. From here, it didn’t take long for the internet to make a laughing stock out of Scottie Pippen.Fans suggested that Future had a physical relationship with Scottie’s then-wife because he was denied an autograph by the Bulls legend when he was a child. A year after these rumors broke out, Scottie and Larsa filed for divorce. They reconciled and spent two more years together before filing for divorce again in 2018.After a lengthy procedure and settlement process, Scottie Pippen and Larsa Pippen’s divorce was finalized in 2021. Since then, Larsa has shed light on her relationship with Future. Here’s what she revealed during a conversation on“We were just two people that were trying to figure our way. I felt like I was stuck in a marriage that I wasn’t really happy in and he was trying to find his way too. It was just super organic and simple. It wasn’t like how you probably would think.”When talking about why their relationship didn’t work, Pippen mentioned that there was too much pressure because of Future’s busy wife. She mentioned that she would be better off dating someone who isn’t in the public eye as often. Larsa clearly didn’t practice what she preached as she went on to have a relationship with NBA star, Malik Beasley.However, for Scottie, the angst doesn’t end there. Future has continued to take digs at Scottie by mentioning Larsa in the lyrics of songs like “Rent Money,” “Federal Fed,” and “Thought It was Drought.”Larsa Pippen has also dated Marcus Jordan, who is the son of Michael Jordan, Scottie’s closest teammate during his time with the Bulls. The two met in 2019 but kept things platonic at the time. Following Pippen’s divorce in 2021, the two reconnected but didn’t make their relationship official till 2023.While Marcus Jordan and Larsa Pippen have since split, the simple fact that this relationship happened must not sit right with Scottie Pippen. For the longest time, Scottie has not been fond of his former teammate, Michael Jordan. So, he must’ve gone through a world of emotions when news about Larsa and Marcus Jordan’s relationship came out.No one can take away from what Scottie has accomplished on the basketball court. But, his life outside the NBA has been tumultuous, to say the least.","Larsa Pippen met rapper Future in 2015 and the two spoke for over seven hours during their first meeting.

"India’s richest men, Mukesh Ambani & Gautam Adani, drop out of elite $100 billion net worth club: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-richest-men-mukesh-ambani-gautam-adani-drop-out-of-elite-100-billion-net-worth-club-report/articleshow/116359954.cms,"Currently, both Mukesh Ambani and his contemporary Gautam Adani, are confronting various challenges.

India’s richest men, Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani , have seen their net worth drop below the $100 billion mark in the last few months. Currently, both Mukesh Ambani, who leads Reliance Industries Ltd, and his contemporary Gautam Adani, who established the Adani Group , are confronting various challenges affecting their commercial interests and personal wealth, according to a Bloomberg report.Ambani's ventures in energy and retail sectors have shown diminished performance, with investors expressing worries about debt levels. Meanwhile, Adani's business empire faces scrutiny following a US Department of Justice investigation, potentially affecting its access to funding and ability to secure contracts.Adani encountered fresh challenges in November when US prosecutors investigated alleged bribery, bringing unwanted attention. This followed his ongoing efforts to rebuild investor trust after Hindenburg Research published allegations of fraudulent practices at his company the previous year.Adani has rejected both accusations and remains determined to fight them. During a post-US allegations event, he emphasised the organisation's dedication to ""world-class regulatory compliance"" and stated that each challenge against the company ""only makes us stronger.""Also Read | Top 10 biggest wealth creating stocks: Reliance Industries tops list; Adani Green emerges as fastest wealth creator, says MOFSL report The allegations are expected to impact the group and its market value into the coming year.Gautam Adani's wealth reached its highest point at $122.3 billion in June, following efforts to strengthen finances after Hindenburg's accusations. These gains have since disappeared following US claims of his involvement in bribing Indian government officials, reducing his current worth to $82.1 billion, as per theBloomberg Billionaires Index .The decline in wealth isn't unique to him. Ambani, currently Asia's wealthiest individual, has also experienced a significant reduction in his fortune, albeit less publicly. His wealth peaked at approximately $120.8 billion in July, coinciding with his Anant Ambani’s lavish wedding celebrations.His flagship Reliance enterprise has faced challenges with declining energy sector earnings and reduced consumer spending in retail operations. As of December 13, his wealth stood at $96.7 billion.Also Read | ‘US Department of Justice has no business…’: Mark Mobius says US DOJ overstepped bounds on Adani case Both business leaders have now fallen from the centibillionaires category - individuals possessing wealth exceeding $100 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Ambani's strategy involves increasing focus on digital platforms, retail brands, and renewable energy to boost growth. However, retail operations show slower sales and profit growth, whilst digital competitors have gained market share in groceries and household items, particularly in India's major urban centres.The arrival of Elon Musk's Starlink in India's satellite broadband sector also poses a potential challenge to Jio Platforms Ltd's digital and telecom operations. Additionally, declining demand and Chinese exports are affecting the oil-to-chemicals division.""Reliance remains a strong wealth creator and each business has great value. But the pressure on the oil business has caused the stock to under perform,"" Kranthi Bathini, equity market strategist at Mumbai-based WealthMills Securities Pvt was quoted as saying by BloombergReliance's technological aspirations are evident in its collaboration with Walt Disney Co., forming an $8.5 billion media enterprise set to lead India's streaming sector. The company has also strengthened its alliance with Nvidia Corp., aiming to develop AI computing infrastructure in India.Both organisations face additional challenges in the upcoming year, particularly regarding Donald Trump's election implications and uncertainties surrounding Indian commercial prospects.""In the short term there are challenges, especially with Trump imposing tariffs that's going to make India's exports not that competitive,"" said V.K. Unni, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta.Nevertheless, India's wealthiest individuals continue to prosper, with the top twenty adding $67.3 billion since the year's beginning, according to Bloomberg's wealth index. Technology leader Shiv Nadar and Savitri Jindal, whose family manages Jindal Group, have accumulated $10.8 billion and $10.1 billion respectively.",Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani are facing various challenges.

'Surgery was painful': UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione's social media posts indicate about his health struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/surgery-was-painful-unitedhealthcare-ceo-killer-luigi-mangiones-social-media-posts-indicate-about-his-health-struggles/articleshow/116270935.cms,"Social media posts of Luigi Mangione , who was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, give an insight into his physical and mental health issues.Last year, following his spinal surgery for chronic back pain , he became an advocate for the procedure that positively transformed his life. He actively encouraged individuals facing similar conditions, to challenge medical professionals who suggested pain was inevitable.His Reddit posts discuss spondylolisthesis, a spinal condition where vertebral fractures cause misalignment. This can lead to severe pain when nerves are compressed.According to his social media posts, this condition, which can develop during childhood or through injury, began significantly affecting Mangione's life in recent years.Following his studies at the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained bachelor's and master's degrees, he was employed at TrueCar, a Santa Monica-based car-buying website until 2023. He resided in Hawaii beginning January 2022. His back condition deteriorated, partly due to a surfing incident during his six-month residence at Surfbreak, a ""co-living"" accommodation in Honolulu.According to Josiah Ryan, who speaks for Surfbreak's owner and founder R.J. Martin, Mangione increasingly voiced concerns about his pain. The condition affected his ability to participate in recreational activities and exercise, and he worried about its impact on potential romantic relationships.""That was definitely a theme in his time there,"" Ryan said. ""He wasn't a big complainer. So it wasn't like he was bringing it up constantly. But the people who knew him knew this was a significant part of his life.""In July 2023, Mangione shared on Reddit his decision to undergo surgery.""I got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20's and damaging my nerves while I waffled on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it,"" he wrote.His posts indicated the procedure was successful. His X account displayed what seemed to be an X-ray showing a metal rod and multiple screws inserted in his lower spine.""Surgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds,"" Mangione posted on Reddit in August 2023. ""Obviously will be awhile until I get into rigorous activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had anticipated.""In a post from July 2018, he discussed his academic challenges and thoughts of leaving university. However, he noted that ""staying in college has at least let me maintain some semblance of normality.""His final Reddit contribution was on May 17, with surrounding posts indicating stability and no apparent health complications. He appeared supportive of the surgical procedure he had undergone previously.In early April, he shared details about equipment chosen for an extended Asian backpacking adventure involving motorcycle travel, describing it as having ""the perfect balance between minimalism and practicality.""Later that month, he offered advice to another Reddit user experiencing back issues, suggesting persistent consultation with different surgeons and emphasising work inability if needed.""We live in a capitalist society,"" he wrote. ""I've found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it's impacting your quality of life.""However, his Reddit posts, did not contain direct criticism of health insurance industry profits. These sentiments apparently emerged later, as evidenced by a handwritten note discovered after his arrest for allegedly killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.The note mentions ""parasites"" within the healthcare system and criticises health insurers' influence and earnings, According to law enforcement officials. Upon his arrest in Pennsylvania, Mangione was heard shouting about an ""insult to the intelligence of the American people"" while being escorted into court by sheriff's deputies.Meanwhile, a senior New York City police official confirmed on Thursday to NBC New York that there was no evidence of Mangione ever having UnitedHealthcare insurance.Although the incident has led to questions about potential negative healthcare experiences, Mangione's 2023 post-surgery Reddit activity showed satisfaction with his treatment and relief from chronic pain. He advised others not to fear surgical complications and mentioned travelling to Asia for backpacking this year.Interestingly, the 26-year-old Ivy League alumnus appears to have ceased social media activity approximately six months ago, coinciding with his loss of contact with family and friends.Whilst his arrest has shocked his close circle, limited information exists about his recent physical and psychological wellbeing.Meanwhile, healthcare professionals acknowledge the complexities of treating back pain.""In the gross majority of treatments, surgery is when everything else has failed to provide relief,"" said Dr Jason Pittman, co-director of the Spine Centre at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. He said that doctors typically explore conservative treatments like physical therapy, injections or medications before considering surgery.Despite having health insurance, patients may face substantial surgical costs depending on deductibles and other variables, although Mangione's financial situation remains unclear.Dr Padma Gulur, a pain specialist at Duke Health, highlights that chronic back pain can substantially affect mental wellbeing.“If you have underlying mental health issues — anxiety, depression — your pain can be worse because you have way more suffering. But, the second aspect is pain can push you into anxiety and depression,” said Gulur.Additionally, details about Mangione's recent mental health remain unclear, though evidence suggests he was becoming increasingly isolated.Police reports indicate that his family filed a missing person report in San Francisco in November. During his time at university, Mangione had shared his struggles with cognitive issues and sleep disturbances on Reddit.",Luigi Mangione was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Of this, 53% or Rs 6.5 lakh crore of the write-offs were by public sector banks in the last five years (FY20-24), according to data provided by the government in response to Parliament queries.The loan write-offs by the banking sector peaked in FY19 at Rs 2.4 lakh crore, which followed an asset quality review that began in 2015. It fell to the lowest level of Rs 1.7 lakh crore in FY24 which was only 1% of total bank credit of around Rs 165 lakh crore outstanding at that time.

Such write-off does not result in waiver of liabilities of borrowers and therefore, it does not benefit the borrower and banks continue to pursue recovery actions initiated in these accounts.He added that the recovery methods include filing of a suit in civil courts or in debt recovery tribunals, action under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002, filing of cases in the National Company Law Tribunal under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, through negotiated settlement/ compromise, and through sale of NPAs.Goverment, in a separate statement, said that public sector banks in India recorded their highest-ever aggregate net profit of Rs 1.41 lakh crore in FY24. This was supported by an improvement in asset quality, with the gross NPAs ratio declining to 3.12% in Sept 2024.

Even Bill Gates will go bankrupt: Elon Musk



A deepfake video of Elon Musk endorsing a fake $20 million crypto giveaway is going viral, causing widespread confusion and concern. Sharing the video on X (formerly Twitter), DogeDesigner posted: “BREAKING: A deepfake of Elon Musk promoting a $20 million crypto giveaway is going viral.” The post further warned: “Elon Musk and his companies are NOT running any crypto giveaways. Don’t fall for scams! Stay safe.”In the video, Elon Musk can be seen saying “Here’s a surprise for everyone. I’ll be doing a $20 million crypto giveaway at Elon4u.com for one week starting on December 13.” He further adds “ If I am serious? Yes, go to Elon4u.com. It’s just a few quick steps that shouldn’t take longer than three minutes”.The Tesla CEO wrote on X that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates might go bankrupt if Tesla becomes “the world’s most valuable company by far,” reigniting the feud over Gates’ short position against the electric vehicle giant.

PUNE/MUMBAI: Discontent is brewing in the 11-day-old Mahayuti govt with several bigwigs among the alliance partners expressing disappointment at not getting cabinet berths .While senior politicians like Chhagan Bhujbal openly expressed disappointment over his omission in the new cabinet, other Mahayuti members, including former minister Tanaji Sawant , Vijay Shivtare, and Sadabhau Khot, are equally unhappy.Though some of these MLAs accepted the alliance’s decision, not all were happy. One of them is Shiv Sena’s Tanaji Sawant, who was the health minister in the Eknath Shinde-led govt. On the day of the oath-taking ceremony, Sawant reached Nagpur. After his name did not figure in the list of the ministers, he flew back to Pune and changed his profile picture on his social media account — from the party's symbol to Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray’s photograph.A supporter of Sawant from the Bhum Paranda constituency in Dharashiv said, “During the poll campaign, Shinde had promised to give Sawant a cabinet post if we worked for the party.”Shiv Sena’s Vijay Shivtare, who represents Purandar in the assembly, said, “I was very disappointed with the treatment I got from senior members of all three parties (BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP ) in Mahayuti. It is unfortunate that the cabinet ministers were selected on the basis of caste equation, and not on their potential.”Discontent is also brewing in the smaller Mahayuti allies as none of their representatives could make it to the cabinet. Speaking about the cabinet expansion, Rayat Kranti Sanghtna chief and MLC Sadabhau Khot said, “During the poll campaign, smaller parties worked tirelessly for the candidates of major parties. After the results, we were expecting some consideration for us in the cabinet. But they did not include my name for the cabinet.”Union minister of state and RPI chief Ramdas Athawale also said his party should have got some representation in the cabinet. “RPI has a big support base in the state’s rural parts. The major parties should have spared at least one minister’s post for our party,” Athawale said.Former cabinet minister and senior NCP member Dilip Walse Patil said, “Our alliance got a massive majority, but there is a limit on the number of MLAs for govt to include in the cabinet.”Shahuwadi MLA Vinay Kore, founder president of Jan Surajya Shakti Party, said, “I am more interested in knowing why the cabinet post was not given to me.”","Discontent is brewing in the 11-day-old Mahayuti govt with several bigwigs expressing disappointment at not getting cabinet berths.

A setback that sparked a new beginning

Embracing her roots, celebrating her achievements

Indian-origin Priyanka Naik from Staten Island is an award-winning chef and a former tech professional who has found success in the culinary world after switching careers from tech to food. Naik, who spent over a decade at X (formerly Twitter), Bloomberg, and Conde Nast, turned her passion for cooking into a full-time career after being laid off by X in 2022.Naik’s culinary story began in an unexpected place — technology. She reportedly built an impressive portfolio in the tech world. But despite her professional success, Naik’s heart always belonged in the kitchen. Naik, who comes from a vegetarian background, gained recognition in 2017 when she won Cooks vs Cons on Food Network.In 2022, after being laid off by X, Naik found herself at a crossroads. But instead of letting this setback define her, she saw it as the opportunity she needed to pursue her culinary dreams full-time.Before making the shift to full-time chef, Naik channeled her culinary creativity through her blog, ""Chef Priyanka."" She used social media to share her sustainable recipes , which caught the attention of high-profile figures, including Chrissy Teigen. Naik's commitment to sustainability and eco-friendly practices has helped her carve out a niche in the culinary world, particularly as a vegan chef.But Naik wasn’t interested in jumping on the viral bandwagon. She said, ""The algorithm may reward trendy recipes, but I’m not interested in just being a moment. I want to be part of a movement,"" as quoted by HT.Today, Naik's brand includes cookbook sales, social media partnerships, and her column, EcoKitchen, in The Washington Post. These efforts have secured her financial stability, and she now earns a six-figure income.Naik’s success is also deeply tied to her cultural identity. As a first-generation Indian American, her story resonates with many who feel the pull between cultural heritage and personal ambition.According to The Morning Rundown, Naik’s educational background in pre-med and economics led her into the media and tech industries, but her passion for food and her entrepreneurial spirit have ultimately shaped her career.Her achievements were recently recognized at the White House, where she was among over 600 prominent Indian Americans invited to the largest-ever Diwali celebration in October 2024. Reflecting on the achievement, Naik shared on Instagram, ""I didn’t graduate the top of my class at BU, I didn’t go to grad school, I’ve been laid off, I’ve been repeatedly rejected across multiple facets in my life working towards personal and professional goals, I’m a self-taught chef/writer/TV host—but I got invited to attend the official @whitehouse Diwali Celebration?""",Priyanka Naik is an award-winning chef and a former tech professional.

Why Canada's deputy PM Chrystia Freeland stepped down: Details from her resignation letter to Trudeau,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/why-canadas-deputy-pm-chrystia-freeland-stepped-down-details-from-her-resignation-letter-to-trudeau/articleshow/116383643.cms,"Why Canada’s deputy PM Chrystia Freeland resigned?

'There is a crisis of confidence in Trudeau'



Who is Dominic LeBlanc, appointed as new finance minister



Canada's deputy prime minister and finance minister Chrystia Freeland resigned on Monday following a disagreement with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over US President-elect Donald Trump's tariff threats.Freeland, who also left her role as finance minister, became the first cabinet member to openly dissent against Trudeau. As the first woman to serve as Canada’s finance minister, Freeland was seen as a potential successor to Trudeau.In her formal resignation letter to Trudeau, Freeland addressed Trump's proposed 25-percent import tariffs on Canadian goods, stating that ""Our country today faces a grave challenge.""She said that the country should take Trump's tariff threats ""extremely seriously."" Cautioning that they could escalate into a ""tariff war"" with the United States, she urged Ottawa to maintain its ""fiscal powder dry.""""The incoming administration in the United States is pursuing a policy of aggressive economic nationalism, including a threat of 25per cent tariffs. We need to take that threat extremely seriously. That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.""""That means eschewing costly political gimmicks, which we can ill afford,"" she said, seemingly criticising a recent sales tax holiday that opponents argued was expensive and intended to boost the ruling Liberals' declining political support.The 56-year-old deputy PM's resignation came just hours before she was scheduled to deliver an update on the nation’s finances, amid reports that the government was on track to surpass her deficit projections from last spring.Freeland's resignation letter continued that: ""On Friday, you told me you no longer want me to serve as your Finance Minister and offered me another position in the Cabinet. Upon reflection, I have concluded that the only honest and viable path is for me to resign from the Cabinet.""""For the past number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,"" she said.""To be effective, a Minister must speak on behalf of the Prime Minister and with his full confidence. In making your decision, you made clear that I no longer credibly enjoy that confidence and possess the authority that comes with it,"" she continued.The former journalist entered parliament in 2013 and was appointed to Trudeau's cabinet when the Liberals gained power two years afterwards. She managed crucial portfolios including trade and foreign affairs, whilst steering free trade talks with the EU and the US.Freeland emphasised her intentions to run for reelection in the country’s next parliamentary polls, expected by October 2025. ""I am committed to running again for my seat in Toronto in the next federal election,"" she added.Professor Lori Turnbull from Dalhousie University described the situation as ""a total disaster, stating that, ""It really shows that there is a crisis of confidence in Trudeau.""And makes it much harder for Trudeau to continue as prime minister,"" she added.Adding to Trudeau's difficulties, housing minister Sean Fraser submitted his resignation on Monday, describing Freeland as ""professional and supportive.""Freeland's resignation has sparked immediate speculation about her successor. Among the names being floated is former Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney, who currently serves as an economic advisor to Trudeau.However, Carney is not a sitting legislator, and Canadian tradition would require him to seek a seat in the House of Commons before assuming a cabinet role.At the close of the day, Dominic LeBlanc, who oversees public safety, was appointed as the new finance minister, coinciding with the country's announcement of a Can$62 billion (US$43.5 billion) shortfall -- approximately Can$22 billion above estimates -- attributed to ""unexpected expenses.""LeBlanc, 57, assumes responsibility for discussions with the Trump administration, committing to remain ""focused on the challenges"" ahead.LeBlanc, appointment also places him at the forefront of managing the ongoing economic challenges, including navigating the looming threat of US tariffs. He is a trusted confidant of Trudeau and has held multiple key cabinet positions since the Liberal Party's victory in 2015.","Chrystia Freeland, Canada's deputy PM and finance minister, resigned on Monday.

Gukesh to miss Rapid, Blitz Worlds

CHENNAI: The coveted trophy that once found a home in Chennai for many years courtesy Viswanathan Anand , is back to the unofficial 'chess capital of India', thanks to his mentee D Gukesh. Days after successfully carrying the hopes of billions of Indians, newly-crowned world chess champion D Gukesh gripped the glittering silverware with pride and care as he walked out to a hero's welcome at the Chennai International Airport on Monday morning.A mere glimpse of Gukesh was enough to put a beaming smile on the faces of those who turned up at the venue - office-bearers of various sporting organisations, fans, his Velammal schoolmates among others. The crowd immediately erupted in jubilation, with the Velammal students belting out chants of 'Gukesh, Gukesh, Gukesh' while holding specially-made placards for their young 'superstar'.Among the gathering was an ardent chess follower who had cycled all the way from Belgaum, Karnataka, to be a part of the celebration. Before being escorted to his car amidst chaos, Gukesh was garlanded and handed a bouquet by officials.After soaking in all the adulation, the teenage sensation stressed that he will not stop here and that there is a long road ahead. ""My goal has always been to become the best player in the world. Being the world champion is an important step towards the dream, but it is clear that there are a lot of strong players. I still have a lot of improvement to do,"" Gukesh said at a press conference organised by the Velammal Group.""Players like Magnus Carlsen keep motivating me to work harder. Although this is a very big achievement… I know that it has come at a very young age, but there is a long way to go. My goal is to keep enjoying chess and have a very long career. Hopefully, I will become the best player in the world one day,"" added the 18-year-old.In his journey to the peak, behind Gukesh was a technical team, including trainers and seconds who tried to hand him every bit of available advantage. ""They were working so hard for me. It was hard for them as they were working all night to help me prepare for the game. Each one has their own specialty. We tried to take the maximum out of them.""Gukesh confirmed that he will not compete in the World Rapid and Blitz Championships, scheduled in New York later this month. It is to be noted that Gukesh's name featured in the extended list of players, published by the FIDE earlier this month.""No, I will not be playing rapid and blitz,"" stated the Indian. While Gukesh indicated that he is set for a mini spell away from the board, his father Rajinikanth said that the Chennai boy does not generally prefer to take breaks. ""There are some top players who do not strain much. But when it comes to Gukesh, he likes playing games. He learns a lot from his wins and losses. Staying at home is not his style, he could become restless if I ask him to do it,"" said Rajinikanth, who accompanies Gukesh to tournaments.",World chess champion D Gukesh returns to Chennai for a hero's welcome.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
