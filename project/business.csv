Did you know that your hospital bill is likely to be heftier – and not less, as many believe – if you are paying for it yourself rather than through an insurance firm? A patient in Gurgaon discovered this to his horror recently and’s enquiries reveal that this is standard practice.When this patient, while being discharged after three days of treatment, decided to pay the bill from his pocket rather than wait for insurance approval, he found that the bill went up by about 27%.The hospital insisted that it was standard practice for the bill to be more if a patient paid directly. Too tired and sick to argue, the patient was forced to pay the higher amount.The 53-year-old patient, who was admitted in Fortis Hospital Gurgaon for suspected food poisoning with fever, severe dehydration and diarrhoea on April 14, was given a twin sharing room, for which he was charged Rs 8,400 per night, similar to the room tariff of a swanky hotel in Gurgaon for a single room, except that here, everything from nursing services, and linen and laundry to admission charges and bio-medical waste disposal was charged separate from the room rent.“They delayed informing my insurance company, though all details including policy number and aadhaar card were given at the time of admission. That delayed the approval process. The doctor informed me on April 16 evening that I would be discharged the next day. I got a message from my insurance company at 8.07 pm on April 16 that they had received the claim. If I was admitted at 9.30 pm on April 14, why did it take them two days to inform the insurance company? We waited the whole day till 7.30 pm on April 17 for insurance approval. Finally, tired of waiting when I offered to pay, they jacked up the bill,” complained the patient. Till April 27 the insurance company had not processed his reimbursement claim.’s enquiries revealed that it was indeed standard practice for hospitals to have discounted rates for insurance companies and higher charges for patients who chose to pay themselves. However, this is not revealed to patients and there is no board put up outside hospitals giving the difference in rates charged to insurance companies and direct patients. In many hospitals, the difference is about 10%. “It is bad enough that there should be a difference in the rates for patients paying directly and for insurance companies. To charge a patient 27% more is plain loot. If anything, the patient paying directly ought to be charged less as the hospital is getting the money right away instead of having to wait for the approval process and so much back and forth with the insurance company asking for several clarifications on the bill. In fact, in many smaller hospitals they charge the patient less if they pay directly,” explained a doctor. Several other doctors thatspoke to echoed his words.According to a TPA representative Anurag Goswami, insurance companies sign MoUs with hospitals to get negotiated rates. “To start with, they are seen as customers not patients. Our customers get the negotiated rates. If the customer goes directly, the amount will vary. We get the discounted rates because we bring them business/customers. These rates vary for different insurance companies. Sometimes, if a customer requests, they might get some discount. In the case of insurance through a bank, if there is any fraud you can complain to the RBI. In the case of an insurance company, you can complain to the IRDAI. If a private hospital does fraud, you cannot go anywhere because they have no governing authority. They know that. That is why they charge individual customers whatever they want,” said Goswami.In response to’s queries, Fortis Hospital, Gurgaon responded: “We initially offered hospital tariffs in accordance with our contractual obligations with Manipal Cigna insurance (Mediassist - TPA) for his hospital stay. However, due to multiple queries and delays in approval from the insurance side, the patient requested to settle the bill and seek reimbursement from the insurance company later. Consequently, as a normal industry-wide practice, standard hospital tariffs were applied, and the contractual discounts with Manipal Cigna were removed, resulting in an increase in the bill amount.”","A patient in Gurgaon discovered this to his horror recently and’s enquiries reveal that this is standard practice. “To charge a patient 27% more is plain loot.

The Indian Navy has also integrated the missile into its fleet for MiG-29K naval fighter jets.This weapon provides Indian fighter pilots with the capability to engage and eliminate targets such as communication centers or radar stations.The procurement of the Rampage missiles was a part of emergency powers granted by the defense ministry to the armed forces, following the 2020 standoff with China, aimed at ensuring the armed forces are equipped with critical weaponry and equipment.Compared to the Spice-2000s used in the 2019 Balakot air strikes, these missiles boast a longer range. The Indian Air Force has pursued the acquisition of multiple weapon systems, including long-range systems from both international and domestic vendors.Recent tests conducted by the Indian Air Force included the ROCKS or Crystal Maze-2 missile trials in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands territory, where the air-launched ballistic missile successfully hit its designated target approximately two weeks ago.The integration of Rampage missiles with Russian Su-30 aircraft will further enhance the Russian aircraft fleet, enabling the firing of multiple long-range air-to-ground missiles, including the BrahMos supersonic missiles with a strike range exceeding 400 kilometers.The Indian Air Force is further contemplating the possibility of producing Rampage missiles under the Make in India program and subsequently integrating them in the fleet.",Rampage long-range supersonic air-to-ground missiles capable of targeting objects approximately 250 kilometers away.

While the Vande Metro trains will ply on routes covering 100-250 kms, the Vande Bharat Sleeper trains will be deployed on routes covering over 1,000 km.According to officials, the Vande Metro trains would connect around 124 cities and some of the identified routes include Lucknow-Kanpur, Agra-Mathura, Delhi-Rewari, Bhubaneswar-Balasore and Tirupati-Chennai.Running on existing railway tracks, these AC trains will cater to the needs of passengers between large urban centres and satellite towns and will carry more passengers in the unreserved category.An official said, “These trains are oriented towards high acceleration with frequent stoppages. They will have 12 coaches each and large automatic doors with side seats. There will be more space for passengers to stand. If there is a requirement to carry more passengers, these trains can have 16 coaches as well.”On the roadmap to modernise the trains (rolling stock), the official said the national transporter is targeting to run 50 push-pull variant Amrit Bharat trains in the current fiscal, which will cater to the demand of long distance passengers at a very affordable price. The first such train was operated between Delhi and Ayodhya. These trains have one engine each in the front and back.The official added that in the near future, the Amrit Bharat trains will have a cone shaped nose and will appear similar to European trains. These will roll out by 2026. Railways has planned to deploy around 400 such trains in the near future.","Indian Railways will start the trial run of short distance Vande Metro trains in July.

Relief for lessors: Delhi high court directs DGCA to de-register 54 GoAir planes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/relief-for-lessors-delhi-high-court-directs-dgca-to-de-register-54-goair-planes/articleshow/109634391.cms,"NEW DELHI: The lessors of 54 aircraft to grounded-since-last May GoAir finally got relief on several counts from the Delhi high court on Friday which directed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) to de-register these planes within a maximum of five working days.The revival of GoAir under IBC is now an even tougher task as the lessors are learnt to be wooed by both Tata’s Air India and cash-rich IndiGo to get around 15 of the Airbus A320 family planes which could fairly quickly be made airworthy.Rest of the planes will have to wait to get replacement for their snag-ridden engines/spares from Pratt & Whitney, which has been unable to supply the same to IndiGo also for several months due to which the latter’s over 75 planes are grounded.Sources say Nishant Pitti-led consortium, which includes SpiceJet’s MD Ajay Singh (in his personal capacity), that has bid to revive GoAir under IBC, will also try to negotiate with the lessors for the 15 airworthy planes. Given a choice between AI/IndiGo and a consortium with a SpiceJet connection, it remains to be seen who will the lessors go with if indeed they decide to keep their planes in India.Delhi HC’s Justice Tara Vitasta Ganju on Friday allowed lessors to undertake maintenance on the long-grounded planes until the same are de-registered and exported in accordance with the Indian law. “The respondent DGCA and respondent Airport Authority of India (AAI) shall and assist the petitioner lessors and grant them access to the airports…” the court said.The resolution professional (RP) of GoAir and the airline have been restrained from accessing, entering or operating any of the planes; and also from removing, replacing accessories, spare parts, documents and records from the aircraft.Nitin Sarin, managing partner of law firm Sarin & Co who is an expert on aviation matters, said: “It is a big win for the lessors who have got no relief from NCLT which had extended the moratorium (on Go assets) further on the asking of the RP. The lessors had challenged the moratorium as they had terminated (lease) prior to the moratorium being granted.”Nishant Pitti said on X: “…We will review the details of the order once we receive the official document. Following this review, we will evaluate our position and consider any necessary adjustments to our proposed offer for GoAir. Our commitment remains to proceed in a manner that respects the legal process and aligns with our strategic objectives.”Sources say the Pitti-led consortium is keen to go ahead with the resolution process to be able to pursue the arbitration case between GoAir and PW in Singapore, with GoAir likely to get a significant amount from there as its collapse happened primarily due to almost half the airline’s being grounded for months on account of PW’s snag-ridden engines for Airbus A320 family of planes and its inability to give replacement engines in time. Whoever bags the airline will get the arbitration proceeds.Ajay Singh needs funds to keep SpiceJet afloat and could get a lifeline by being the operational arm of a revived GoAir.",The revival of GoAir under IBC is now an even tougher task as the lessors are learnt to be wooed by both Tata’s Air India and cash-rich IndiGo.

Yes, you read that right - that's the median salary of employees working at Meta.

The tech giant employs around 67,000 people globally.The median figure means half of Meta's made more than $379,000 last year, while the other half made less.Meta CEO took home $24.4 million last yearOut of Zuckerberg's $24.4 million payout, his official salary remained $1, a symbolic amount he has received for over a decade as his wealth has ballooned to $176 billion based on his Meta stock holdings.But that $24.4 million covered some pretty cushy perks, and is categorised as ""other compensation"" in Meta's filing. Around $9.4 million went towards personal security costs to protect Zuckerberg at his mansions and when he's gallivanting on private jets or yachts (the filing says $1 million covered his private air travel in 2023).Meta claims its CEO receives so much security because he's the human embodiment of the company at this point. ""Negative sentiment towards our company is directly associated with Mr. Zuckerberg,"" the filing stated. So, his protection ain't cheap!“We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg's role puts him in a unique position: he is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” the company wrote in the filing. “Mr. Zuckerberg is one of the most-recognized executives in the world, in large part as a result of the size of our user base and our continued exposure to global media, legislative, and regulatory attention.”While Zuckerberg's nominal $1 salary looks laughable next to the tens of millions in security and travel the company covers, his pay is just part of the picture.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public. Musk has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-96413764,imgsize-26192,width-400,resizemode-4/96413764.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Residents begin going through the rubble after tornadoes hammer parts of Nebraska and Iowa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/residents-begin-going-through-the-rubble-after-tornadoes-hammer-parts-of-nebraska-and-iowa/articleshow/109659040.cms,"NEW DELHI: Residents started searching through the debris on Saturday following a tornado that tore through suburban Omaha , Nebraska . The tornado destroyed homes and businesses as it traveled for miles across farmland and into residential areas, eventually hitting a town in Iowa .Many tornadoes were reported to have caused destruction in the Midwest on Friday.They led to a building collapsing with numerous people inside and the destruction and damage of at least 150 homes in Omaha.Dr. Lindsay Huse, the health director of Douglas County Health Department, stated that there were no fatalities reported and fewer than twenty-four people were treated at hospitals in the Omaha area.""Miraculous' she said, stressing that none of the city's injuries were serious. The neighboring communities each reported a few injuries.The damage from the tornado began on Friday afternoon close to Lincoln, Nebraska. A building in Lancaster County was struck, leading it to collapse with 70 individuals inside. Multiple individuals were trapped, but all were rescued, and the three injuries were reported as not life-threatening according to authorities.One or possibly two tornadoes then spent around an hour creeping toward Omaha, leaving behind damage consistent with an EF3 twister, with winds of 135 to 165 mph, said Chris Franks, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service's Omaha office.In the end, the tornado hit the Elkhorn neighborhood in western Omaha, which is a city with a population of 485,000 people and a metropolitan-area population of approximately 1 million.""We barely made it to the basement and then we heard the destruction going on upstairs,"" said James Stennis, who moved to the Elkhorn neighborhood about a year ago. ""Wow!""Firefighters worked late into the evening to ensure that no one was trapped. On Saturday morning, the noise of chainsaws could be heard in the area. Piles of lumber from the damaged homes were scattered around. The fences were knocked down, and the trees looked bare, with most of their branches gone.Staci Roe surveyed the damage to what was supposed to be her ""forever home,"" which was not even two years old. At the time of the tornado, they were at the airport to pick up a friend who was planning to stay overnight.""There was no home to come to,"" she said, describing ""utter dread' when she saw it for the first time.The power outages reached a peak of 10,000, but they had decreased to 4,300 by the morning.Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen and Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds spent Saturday inspecting the damage and organizing help for the affected communities. Formal assessments of the damage are still in progress, and the states intend to request assistance from the federal government.""It is an extraordinary miracle that we've had this kind of cell come through and no casualties, no loss of life,"" Pillen marveled at a news conference.Douglas County Sheriff Aaron Hanson pleaded with onlookers to remain at home. He mentioned that he and Pillen were caught in several traffic jams while observing the wreckage.""And that's because in large part there's a lot of looky-loos who are very curious,"" he said. Hanson mentioned that law enforcement will be present in large numbers to protect the damaged property.A second tornado passed over Eppley Airfield located on the eastern edge of Omaha. It destroyed four hangar buildings that housed 32 privately owned planes. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, and the passenger terminal remained unaffected. The airport has now reopened for operations. However, access to areas utilized by noncommercial pilots is restricted to allow the crew to clean up the aftermath, as stated in a news release by the airfield.Franks estimated that this tornado was a slightly less powerful EF2, with the ability to produce winds ranging from 111 to 135 miles per hour.""Strong tornadoes, rare tornadoes,"" he called the duo of twisters that hit the city.The storm moved into Iowa after reaching the airport and targeted the small town of Minden.Between forty to fifty houses were entirely demolished. Two injuries were reported but none were life-threatening, said Jeff Theulen, chief deputy of the Pottawattamie County Sheriff's Office, at a late Friday briefing.""It's heartbreaking to see these people who have lost houses, cars, essentially their life until they have to rebuild it,"" he said, urging people to stay away because of downed power lines.At the Minden United Church of Christ, which survived the storm and has now become a central point for assistance and support, there were plans to use 4-wheel-drive vehicles to deliver meals to those in need in the devastated areas of the town, according to Pastor Eric Biehl.""A lot of people are just kind of in shock,"" Biehl said. ""It's all overwhelming now.""Tammy Pavich, who stores equipment on the west edge of town, said she ""kind of breathed a sigh of relief' after the first round of tornadoes moved through Omaha. Then, she recalled, the storm ""hit Minden dead-on.""Todd Lehan, a lifelong resident of the town, said he took shelter in a windowless basement. ""It sounded like a vacuum cleaner on top of your house,"" he recalled.A suspected tornado damaged nearly 20 homes and injured one person just to the west of the Iowa town of Pleasant Hill.The damage was giving Nebraska football fans who were going to the spring game a hard time.""Be prepared for heavy traffic, buckle up and put the phone down,"" warned the Nebraska Department of Transportation.The National Weather Service was assessing the damage while the forecast for Saturday looked grim. Tornado watches were issued for areas in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Iowa. There was also a possibility of large hail. Due to the forecasts, some schools decided to cancel proms.""Tornadoes, perhaps significant tornadoes,"" were possible Saturday afternoon and evening, said weather service meteorologist Bruce Thoren in Norman, Oklahoma.","At least 150 homes destroyed in Omaha, Nebraska. No fatalities reported and fewer than twenty-four people treated at hospitals. Storm moved into Iowa after reaching the airport and targeted the small town of Minden.

"'Divest from Israel': Columbia, Harvard say no to student demands",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/divest-from-israel-columbia-harvard-say-no-to-student-demands/articleshow/109645691.cms,"A cause celebre is ringing out across Harvard Yard, Columbia’s South Lawn, Yale’s Beinecke Plaza and UC Berkeley’s Sproul Plaza: Disclose and divest.And university students say they won’t stop protesting against Israel until that demand is met.“We’re willing to risk suspension, expulsion and arrest, and I think that that will put pressure,” said Malak Afaneh, a law student at University of California, Berkeley, and a protest organizer.She and her fellow pro-Palestinian demonstrators want universities to cut their investments in everything tied to Israel and weapons that fuel the war in Gaza. That means funds run by BlackRock, Google as well as Amazon’s cloud service, Lockheed Martin and even Airbnb.It’s a long-shot demand — university administrators and lawmakers have for decades rejected the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement against Israel, viewing it as antisemitic because it calls into question the legitimacy of the Jewish state and singles out the policies of one country.It’s fiercely opposed by many donors and alumni, and what’s more, acting on the BDS concept is discouraged by laws in more than half of US states, including New York and California. That’s unlikely to change anytime soon.“I have consistently opposed all forms of antisemitism, including discrimination against and demonization of the people of Israel through the BDS movement ,” said California Assembly Democratic Caucus Chair Rick Chavez Zbur. “I would strongly oppose any attempts to change laws protecting against such discrimination.”Yet it’s gaining proponents, especially among students at elite universities since Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel and sparked the conflict in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.They’re chanting on college grounds, waving Palestinian flags, wearing keffiyehs and beating drums. Encampments have sprouted on campuses, including at Harvard where about 30 tents currently stand in front of the John Harvard statue, according to the Harvard Crimson.Some protesters, including at Columbia and Berkeley, have threatened Jewish students and expressed support for Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the US.All that has left universities struggling to balance the right to free speech with the need for maintaining order and ensuring the safety of students. But on the question of divestment, they are unmoved.Harvard, which has the largest US endowment at almost $51 billion, made clear this month it “opposes calls for a policy of boycotting Israel and its academic institutions.” Brown refused to acknowledge BDS demands while students led an eight-day hunger strike. Yale this week wouldn’t even consider a proposal to divest from weapons makers and instead police rounded up protesters outside of the Schwarzman Center, arresting more than 40 students.BDS supporters take inspiration from the drive to isolate South Africa during the apartheid era — including actions taken at the time by Columbia, Michigan State and California universities — and recent pushes for colleges to address fossil fuel holdings.This time at Michigan State, where groups of students are camped in tents in People’s Park, there’s no appetite for severing ties with Israel.“Divestment would conflict with stewarding the institution’s financial health, would increase investment risks, and limit returns and jeopardize the assurance resources will continue to be available now and for future generations,” said Sandy Pierce, chair of Michigan State University’s board, speaking earlier this month at a Board of Trustees meeting.Columbia in February declined a proposal to withdraw financial support from Israel, months before students set up tents on the Morningside Heights campus and created a standoff with the university that resulted in more than 100 arrests.Ray Guerrero, 27, who’s studying for a masters in public health, helped pen the divestment proposal for the Columbia University Apartheid Divest coalition. The group has a litany of demands, including cutting ties to Israeli academic institutions, defunding public safety and reparations for the indigenous people of New York. Guerrero understands the goals are lofty for the immediate term, but stresses the main focus for now is disclosure and divestment around Columbia’s $13.6 billion endowment.Layla Saliba, a 24-year-old studying for a masters in social work, is part of CUAD’s research team, which she said has been studying the school’s financial disclosures, including its tax forms and 13Fs disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission.“We were only able to get about 0.6% of their investments as public information,” she said.The latest 13F discloses just $47 million of its holdings, with the vast majority stock in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. That leaves billions of dollars undisclosed.“That’s really concerning because our endowment, yes, it’s funded by benefactors, it’s funded by donors, but a portion of that is also funded with our tuition dollars,” Saliba said. “And we feel that as students, we need to have more transparency on that.”Universities say the protesters’ claims aren’t accurate.The University of California, which opposes any boycott of Israel, said in a statement that tuition fees are not used for investments. College endowments are almost always funded with donations and investment gains. What’s more, they fund financial aid for students and other operating expenses such as teacher salaries.And the challenge isn’t just ideological. Endowments typically don’t hold large concentrations of single stocks as they used to decades ago, when activists targeted companies operating in South Africa.Endowments have long relied on external managers, including private equity firms and hedge funds. Almost 700 institutions hold about $840 billion in endowment assets. They also use ETFs, index funds or mutual funds that pool hundreds of stocks and bonds.With private equity, a school’s money may be locked up for several years, without an option to withdraw, while hedge fund managers can rapidly move in and out of securities without disclosing their trades to investors.“These active strategies are not buying stocks to hold on for the long term,” said Philip Zecher, chief investment officer of Michigan State University’s $4 billion fund. “They’re looking to make money off trading. It’s not like your grandmother buying AT&T stock and sitting on it for 50 years.”The fight against fossil fuel investment, a cause championed by students for decades, also shows how hard it can be to implement divestment. Universities largely haven’t switched strategies to sell holdings, which are frequently tied up in long-term private equity funds, even as they’ve committed to policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on campuses.Despite the setbacks and opposition, some pro-Palestine protesters are undeterred.“It seems like a no for now, but students will keep pushing,” said Lumisa Bista, a junior studying astrophysics at Yale, who was among protesters at the university who slept overnight at Beinecke Plaza this week. “I’ll keep pushing.”","Protesters want universities to cut investments in everything tied to Israel and weapons that fuel the war in Gaza. It’s a long-shot demand — university administrators and lawmakers have for decades rejected the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement against Israel.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109645710,imgsize-183966,width-400,resizemode-4/109645710.jpg"

In a statement that underscores the change in corporate America, Garcetti said, ""The old joke was you could not become a CEO in the US if you are Indian, now the joke is you cannot become a CEO in America if you are not Indian, whether it is Google, Microsoft or Starbucks, people have come and made a big difference.""During an interview at the American Center, the envoy highlighted the US's commitment to fostering people-to-people ties, particularly through educational exchanges, which he described as having the potential to ""last a lifetime."" Garcetti revealed that the US mission in India is gearing up to handle an increased number of student visa applications this year, reflecting a continuing trend of rising interest among Indian students in American education.Further commenting on the visa process, Garcetti recalled President Joe Biden's directive to reduce visa wait times for Indians, saying, ""He did! It is the first time, I think in American history that a President has told an ambassador—get those visas waiting time down."" The ambassador also noted the enthusiastic support for this initiative among Americans who are keen on strengthening ties with India.Highlighting the depth of the educational ties, Garcetti noted, ""I think nothing ties our countries and our people together, more than our exchange students."" He elaborated on the profound impact of these exchanges, explaining how they facilitate mutual understanding and respect between the two nations.The ambassador also touched on the logistical challenges of reducing visa wait times but framed these challenges as positive indicators of the strong desire among Indians to engage with the US. Last year, the US issued a record 140,000 student visas to Indian applicants, the highest in the world, demonstrating the significant demand and the successful efforts of US consular services to meet these needs.Garcetti’s comments were made during a pre-departure orientation for Indian students at the American Center, highlighting the ongoing commitment to fostering educational exchanges that build long-lasting relationships between India and the United States.","US ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, has emphasized the remarkable success of Indian immigrants in the United States.

US court upholds R Kelly child pornography conviction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-court-upholds-r-kelly-child-pornography-conviction/articleshow/109645742.cms,"WASHINGTON: A US federal appeals court has upheld R Kelly's 20-year prison sentence over child pornography and other crimes, rejecting the R&B singer's defense that the case was filed too late.Kelly was sentenced in February last year but his lawyers argued the statute of limitations had passed by the time he was charged, a defense the Chicago court rejected on Friday.""For years, Robert Sylvester Kelly abused underage girls.

Kelly "" movement, which encouraged boycotting his music.It wasn't until January 2019, when a Lifetime docuseries once again aired the allegations, that a sea change began.His label dropped him and as outrage boiled over, fresh legal action brewed: prosecutors levelled state charges against him after which federal prosecutors in both Illinois and New York indicted Kelly.","US appeals court upholds R Kelly's 20-year prison sentence over child pornography.

Govt had taken strong objection to the developments and summoned the senior-most diplomat in UK high commission in London and demanded an explanation on the absence of security.The high commission was attacked by a group of 50 persons, who committed criminal trespass, disrespected the Indian flag, damaged public property and caused injuries to officials at the high commission.The attack was allegedly organised by Gurcharan Singh, Dal Khalsa, UK; Avtar Singh Khanda of KLF, Jasvir Singh and their associates, both Indian and foreign nationals, who were identified during the probe.An NIA team visited the UK in May 2023 to probe the attack. Subsequently, a crowdsourcing of information was also carried out to identify and collect information about the UK-based entities and individuals involved in the incident, based on which the agency identified many of the attackers. Around a dozen lookout circulars were issued, and a manhunt was initiated.Last August, NIA had raided 31 locations in Punjab and Haryana to “unravel and unearth full contours of the conspiracy” behind the March attack. In Oct, UK’s Metropolitan Police had arrested a suspect, whose identity was not revealed, and was later released on bail.NIA had earlier said it was leaving no stone unturned to pinpoint culpability in the London attack and arrest the perpetrators, their associates and their supporters, based in India and abroad.

Diana who was born on July 1, 1961, making her 17 years and ten months old filled her date of birth as July 1, 1960, making her 18 years and ten months old.It is believed that Diana filled incorrectly to look older and more mature to get a job quicker or receive more pay.As BBC quoted Andrew Stowe, from Auctioneum Ltd who said, ""Our client had always been told that this was done deliberately, so that Diana would appear older and therefore more likely to secure a job with the agency, or at least a higher rate of pay,"" he said.""It could, of course, just be a simple oversight."" The document is thought to be Princess Diana's first official work contract to undertake various short-term jobs as a nanny, mother's help and child career.

Spanish PM's supporters turn out and beg him to stay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/spanish-pms-supporters-turn-out-and-beg-him-to-stay/articleshow/109651805.cms,"'Pedro stay'

MADRID: Thousands of supporters of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez rallied at the headquarters of his Socialist party imploring him not to step down over a graft investigation against his wife.The 52-year-old, who has been in office since 2018, stunned Spain on Wednesday when he put his resignation on the line after a Madrid court opened a preliminary investigation into suspected influence peddling and corruption against his spouse Begona Gomez.Sanchez said he would suspend all public duties until he announces his decision on Monday. The normally hyperactive premier has since remained out of sight and silent.According to Madrid city authorities, the crowd rallying on Saturday to beg Sanchez to stay on numbered around 12,500.Supporters held up placards saying ""Spain needs you"", ""Pedro don't abandon us', and shouted slogans such as ""Pedro leader"".""I hope that Sanchez will say on Monday that he will stay,"" said Sara Dominguez, a consultant in her 30's, adding that his government had ""taken good steps for women, the LGBT community and minorities"".Jose Maria Diez, a 44-year-old government official who came from Valladolid in northern Spain to express his support, said there was a real possibility that the far-right could take power if Sanchez quit.""This will mean a step backwards for our rights and liberties,"" he warned.Inside the party headquarters, there were similar passionate appeals.""Pedro stay. We are together and together we can ... take the country forward, Spain can't step back,"" said Budget Minister Maria Jesus Montero, the government number two.""Today all democrats, all progressives, are summoned to Madrid against a pack whose only aim is to overthrow a democratic and legitimate government,"" said Felix Bolanos, Minister of the Presidency, Justice and Parliamentary Relations.At one point, Socialist leaders took to the streets to thank those gathered. ""They won't succeed,"" government spokeswoman Pilar Alegria told the crowd.The court opened the investigation into Sanchez's wife in response to a complaint from anti-corruption pressure group Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), whose leader is linked to the far right.The group, which has presented a litany of unsuccessful lawsuits against politicians in the past, said on Wednesday its complaint was based on media reports and could not vouch for their veracity.While the court did not give details of the case, online news site El Confidencial said it focused on links Gomez had to Spanish tourism group Globalia when carrier Air Europa was in talks with the government to secure a huge bailout.The airline sought the bailout after it was badly hit by plunging paseenger numbers during the Covid-19 crisis.At the time, Gomez was running IE Africa Centre, a foundation linked to Madrid's Instituto de Empresa (IE) business school, which had signed a sponsorship agreement with Globalia in 2020.Spain's public prosecutors office on Thursday requested the dismissal of the investigation, which Sanchez said was part of a campaign of ""harassment"" against him and his wife waged by ""media heavily influenced by the right and far right"".If Sanchez decides to remain in office, he could choose to file a confidence motion in parliament to show that he and his minority government are still supported by a majority of lawmakers.If he resigns, an early election could be called from July -- a year after the last one -- with or without Sanchez at the helm of the Socialist party.The right-wing opposition has accused the prime minister of being irresponsible for putting the country on hold while he mulls his decision.""It's very clear to us that this is all a tactic... We know Pedro Sanchez and things with him always turn out like a soap opera,"" Cuca Gamarra, the number two of the main opposition conservative Popular Party, said on Friday.""He is making us all wait and the country is at a standstill,"" she added.",Thousands of supporters of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez rally at the headquarters of his Socialist party.

But to have the necessary means against it, economic growth is needed, he said.","The German economy was the weakest among its large euro zone peers last year.

Why Russia and Iran can dodge Western sanctions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/why-russia-and-iran-can-dodge-western-sanctions/articleshow/109646572.cms,"Central Asia: Russia's new trading hub

Sanctions galore, to little effect

What's the alternative?

Iran knows it, China knows it and apparently, so does the US government: despite existing sanctions against the oil industry of the Islamic Republic, oil from Iran is being shipped to China in record volumes.Javier Blas, an opinion columnist who covers energy and commodities for Bloomberg, recently described how Iranian oil ends up in China.""If you believe the Chinese government, the country doesn't import any oil from Iran.Zero. Not a barrel. Instead, it imports lots of Malaysian crude. So much that, according to official Chinese customs data, it somehow buys more than twice as much Malaysian oil as Malaysia actually produces.""By rebranding Iranian oil, Malaysia became China's fourth-largest foreign oil supplier last year, behind Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iraq.For many years, Iran has used the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a hub for circumventing sanctions. Dubai, one of the seven emirates of the UAE, is the gateway of banned goods other than oil that enter Iran. Tehran has long modified its supply chains so that virtually everything embargoed by the United States or the European Union can be obtained through trading and financial hubs like Dubai.Following Western sanctions over its war in Ukraine, Russia has had to establish similar trade routes to ensure a steady supply of vital goods for its economy.The former Soviet republics in Central Asia have been proving ideal for circumventing the embargoes, because countries like Kazakhstan or Kyrgyzstan are part of a customs union with Moscow. Moreover, the vast distances — Kazakhstan alone shares a border with Russia of more than 7,500 kilometers (4,660 miles) — make sanctions control virtually impossible.Due to Russia's sanctions-busting strategy, Armenia, for example, saw imports of German cars and components rise by almost 1000% last year.Russia is the most embargoed country globally, according to the latest data provided by Castellum.AI, a global sanctions-tracking database.However, the Russian economy is far from collapsing. It posted strong growth of 3.6% last year, and the Kremlin is expecting the 2024 growth rate to be ""at the same level,"" according to Finance Minister Anton Siluanov.The International Monetary Fund shares the Russians' growth expectations, setting the rate of GDP expansion at 3.2%, and noting that high state spending and investments related to the war against Ukraine would be driving growth. Strong revenue from oil exports would continue to support Moscow's finances, it said.Russia is subject to more than 5,000 different targeted sanctions — more than have been imposed on Iran, Venezuela, Myanmar and Cuba combined. They are targeted at politicians and officials in Putin's government, as well as at Russian oligarchs, large companies, financial institutions and the military-industrial complex.Financial sanctions have restricted Russian banks' access to international financial markets, excluding them from the crucially important SWIFT banking system, which powers most international money and security transfers.Additionally, the Russian central bank is denied access to its vast reserves located in G7 countries.The catch is that only sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council are legally binding for all countries of the world. And there are indeed several countries like India, Brazil and China that have not adhered to these sanctions.So, why are Western nations still imposing sanctions they cannot enforce?""If no sanctions were imposed, it would almost be like tacit support. Or as if one were not responding to this [Russia's] illegal attack,"" said Christian von Soest, sanctions expert at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies.Author of the 2023 book titled ""Sanctions: Powerful Weapon or Helpless Maneuver?"", von Soest told DW that the US and Europe needed to ""sharpen their measures to force Russia and Iran to change their behavior.""According to a report by US business daily The Wall Street Journal, Washington is planning to target several Chinese banks to ensure Western sanctions bite. US President Joe Biden's administration wants to exclude Beijing from the global financial system in order to stop the flow of finance funding the Russian war machinery, the newspaper reported, citing anonymous sources.In the EU, a so-called sanctions envoy — David O'Sullivan from Ireland — was named in January last year to engage in diplomatic efforts to enforce the bloc's sanctions regime.""His task is also to travel to the post-Soviet states neighboring Russia, for example, and persuade governments there to enforce the sanctions more rigorously,"" von Soest told DW.""The general problem has been recognized that there are ways for both Russia and Iran to circumvent the sanctions,"" he said, adding that now one has to see what the various measures bring.Some impact is already being felt: in Turkey, for example, where a US threat to impose sanctions on financial firms doing business with Russia has led to a steep decline in Turkey's exports to Russia, which had boomed last year.","Despite existing sanctions against the oil industry of the Islamic Republic, oil from Iran is being shipped to China in record volumes.

Germany is keen to step up ties with India in areas ranging from arms sales and joint production of advanced military hardware to military interoperability in the Indo-Pacific, where China has been making aggressive moves.German ambassador Philipp Ackermann, in an interview to TOI last month, had said, “We’ve earlier been very hesitant. Now, there is political will in Germany to increase defence cooperation with India through military visits, exercises, co-production & other areas, including new ones like cyber.”","German govt recently approved a request by the National Security Guards to buy spare parts and accessories for its MP5 submachine guns.
