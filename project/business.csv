"Pension isn't charity but a legal right, shouldn't be delayed even by a day: HC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pension-isnt-charity-but-a-legal-right-shouldnt-be-delayed-even-by-a-day-hc/articleshow/121399704.cms,"HC: Any delay in pension against principles of equity & justice

KOLKATA: Pension is not ""an act of charity"" but a legal right of employees, Calcutta high court said while reprimanding Hooghly Chinsurah municipality for blaming technological lapses for a delay in releasing the pension of 148 people who retired as Group D workers. The court said the employees earned the right by putting in years of service.Justice Gaurang Kanth said, ""Pension and other retiral benefits, once earned by an employee after rendering long and continuous service ought not be delayed even by a single day. Delay in such cases causes undue hardship to the retired employees who depend on these dues for their sustenance.""He made the observation while hearing a petitioner's case who, along with 147 others, was employed in 1991-92.The posts — coolie, dome, methor, trailorman and jharuyali — were later clubbed under one umbrella post of ‘conservancy worker’. All of them were treated as permanent employees and were to receive monthly pension. However, following the petitioner’s retirement in 2023, her pension and other benefits were not released.In 2021, Bengal municipalities adapted an e-pension portal. Data for this comes from an integrated online salary management system — Urban Local Bodies Human Resource Management System — introduced in August 2017.Despite change in names of traditional posts, retired employees didn’t feature on the portal. Directorate of local bodies submitted in court that the municipality failed to provide details of all Group D employees. Hence, pension and retiral benefits had not been released.Court directed the municipality to submit all documents to the directorate within a week and the latter redesignate the employees within two weeks. Justice Kanth said any undue delay in disbursement of pension, “especially if occasioned by technological shortcomings or administrative lapses, is impermissible and contrary to the principles of equity, justice, and good governance”.","Calcutta high court reprimanded Hooghly Chinsurah municipality for blaming technological lapses for a delay in releasing the pension of 148 people who retired as Group D workers.

'Vikas overflowing': Congress taunts Centre over Delhi airport canopy collapse amid rain- video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vikas-overflowing-congress-taunts-centre-over-delhi-airport-canopy-collapse-amid-rain-in-video/articleshow/121394607.cms,"Congress taunts Centre over Delhi Airport canopy collapse amid rain

Kerala Hit by Earliest Monsoon Since 2009 | IMD Predicts Above-Normal Rainfall for 2025

NEW DELHI: A video showing rainwater overflowing from a canopy at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport after a heavy downpour has sparked a political row, with the Congress taking a direct swipe at the BJP government over infrastructure quality.The incident occurred early Sunday as the National Capital Region was battered by rain, thunderstorms, and gusty winds.The Kerala unit of the Congress shared the video on social media platform X, sarcastically commenting, ""Vikas overflows in Delhi airport after a drizzle.""The video showed water collecting in the middle of a sloped canopy before eventually spilling over, soaking the surrounding area.In a separate post, the party criticised the waterlogging near Terminal 3 of IGI Airport that disrupted travel, saying, “This G20 infra built at inflated cost joins the long list of crumbling 'Modi-quality' constructions.”As seen in the video, the canopy collapse happened due to the design's bowl-like structure, which allowed water to pool in the centre. As the pressure mounted, the tensile fabric failed to hold the accumulated water, leading to a dramatic overflow.As per ANI, the heavy rains led to the diversion of 49 flights, including 17 international flights, between 11.30 pm and 4 am. In a passenger advisory issued at 6.50 am, Delhi airport said, “Passengers are advised to check their flight status regularly and stay in touch with airline staff for updates.”Visuals from other parts of Delhi, including Moti Bagh and Minto Road, showed widespread waterlogging. A car was seen submerged at Minto Road, while traffic snarls were reported at several key junctions including Dhaula Kuan.The IMD had issued a red alert for Delhi and surrounding areas, predicting thunderstorms, lightning, and wind speeds up to 100 km/h.Also read: IMD issues warning as pre-monsoon showers hit Delhi, Kolkata, Goa & other cities The incident comes nearly a year after a roof collapse at Terminal 1 of the Delhi airport during similar weather conditions, which left one person dead and several injured.

We should be able to defend ourselves. No one should be able to conquer us—not even if multiple powers come together.”The magazine noted that this conversation took place before Operation Sindoor at the Organiser-Panchjanya office, ahead of the RSS's Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha scheduled for March 21–23.Bhagwat reiterated, “A virtuous person is not safe just because of his virtues. Hence, virtues should be combined with strength. Mere brute power can be directionless, leading to blatant violence. Therefore, power should be combined with righteousness.”When asked about global human rights defenders’ concern for Hindus facing oppression in neighbouring countries, Bhagwat suggested that support would only come when Hindus demonstrate strength.“As Hindu society and Bharat are intertwined, the glory of Hindu society will bring glory to Bharat. Such a strong Hindu society can present a model for including the people of Bharat who no longer consider themselves Hindus—as they, too, were once Hindus.”“If Hindu society in Bharat becomes strong, then automatically Hindus will gain strength globally,” he asserted.Bhagwat acknowledged that efforts to strengthen Hindu society are underway, noting that progress is “slow but steady.”“Slowly but surely, the situation is evolving,” he said, adding, “This time, the way anguish over atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh has been expressed is unprecedented. Even local Hindus (in Bangladesh) now say — ‘We won’t flee. We’ll stay and fight for our rights.’”","RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat reiterates need to unify Hindu society and build Bharat into a formidable military and economic power. “We have no option but to be powerful, as we have been witnessing the wickedness of the evil forces on all our borders,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121395780,imgsize-1133227,width-400,resizemode-4/121395780.jpg"

Sensitive ecosystem at risk

NEW DELHI: The Kerala government on Sunday declared a statewide emergency after a Liberian container ship, MSC ELSA 3, carrying 640 containers, including 13 with hazardous cargo, capsized and sank off the state’s coast, triggering fears of a major ecological disaster.Following a high-level meeting chaired by chief secretary A Jayathilak, Kerala issued a statewide alert, warning coastal districts of potential environmental damage.Fishermen have been asked to stay ashore, and the public has been told not to touch or approach any drifting containers or oil slicks that may wash ashore. “Maintain a minimum distance of 200 metres and inform the emergency number 112,” read the official note.All 24 crew members aboard were rescued, 21 by the Indian Coast Guard and 3 by Indian Navy’s INS Sujata.According to Navy PRO Athul Pillai, the final three were rescued on Sunday morning after the vessel became too dangerous to remain aboard. “If they stayed put more, it was a danger for them,” he said, adding the rescue was carried out amid high winds and floating debris.As per PTI, the ship had 84.44 MT of diesel and 367.1 MT of furnace oil in its tanks.Some of this has already begun leaking into the sea. The fuel is drifting at around 3 km per hour, raising fears it may reach Kerala’s sensitive coastline.The Indian Coast Guard confirmed a “significant oil leak” and has deployed ICGS Saksham, Samarth, and a Dornier aircraft with oil dispersants to contain the spill.According to ANI, the vessel was carrying 12 containers of calcium carbide, a substance that reacts violently with seawater, producing highly flammable acetylene gas. This cargo poses a serious risk to marine life and coastal communities.The Coast Guard, leading pollution response efforts, is operating under the National Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan, directly overseen by its director general.Surveillance aircraft with advanced oil spill mapping technology are conducting assessments. “We are fully geared to respond to the emerging scenario,” the ICG said.The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) warned that oil films or debris may appear along coastal areas. “There is a possibility that the containers and the oil can reach the state's coast,” said KSDMA member secretary Sekhar Kuriakose, as quoted by TOI. Locals have been urged to report any sightings to police.Before the ship sank, salvage operations were being planned, but the situation deteriorated rapidly.The vessel, which had departed Vizhinjam on May 23 and was en route to Kochi, began listing dangerously on May 24 afternoon.A Defence PRO confirmed some containers had already fallen into the sea by Saturday evening.The Kerala coast is home to rich biodiversity and is a key tourist destination. Authorities are bracing for the worst-case scenario, especially for districts like Thrissur, Kochi, and Alappuzha, which could face the brunt of the pollution.Authorities continue to monitor the situation closely as containment operations intensify.","The Liberian container ship, MSC ELSA 3, carrying 640 containers, including 13 with hazardous cargo, capsized and sank off the state's coast.

NEW DELHI: Citing 'made in India' defence equipment playing a decisive role in precision strikes under Operation Sindoor , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday expressed gratitude to the country's engineers and technicians, and urged people to take a pledge to prioritise products made in the country and boost the ""self-reliant India"" resolve.""Our soldiers destroyed terror bases; it was their indomitable courage, along with the power of weapons, equipment and technology made in India. It also included the resolve of ' Atmanirbhar Bharat ',"" Modi said in the 122nd edition of 'Mann Ki Baat'.The sweat of our engineers, our technicians, in fact, that of everyone... is involved in this victory,” PM said in his monthly radio talk, which he opened with remarks on the success of Operation Sindoor, lauding the valour of the armed forces.During his recent Adampur airbase visit, Modi had said in the last decade, the world’s best technologies had entered the country’s forces and India now not only fought with conventional weapons but also with drones, data and precision technology.Operation Sindoor witnessed extensive use of ‘made in India’ products as Indian forces, without crossing the Line of Control, struck terror infrastructure and eliminated multiple threats. Whether in drone warfare, layered air defence or electronic warfare, the operation marked a milestone in India’s journey towards technological self-reliance in military operations. Effective deployment of made in India BrahMos missile was cited as another key factor in Operation Sindoor.Modi said the entire country was filled with anger and was united against terrorism. He said, “Operation Sindoor is not just a military mission; it is a reflection of the country’s resolve, courage and a transforming India, infusing the nation with a sense of patriotism. It has deeply influenced people, with many families making it a part of their lives.” He cited examples of thousands of people participating in ‘Tiranga Yatra’, marching to honour the country’s armed forces.Modi praised the precision and accuracy with which the forces destroyed terrorist hideouts across the border and called it remarkable. “Operation Sindoor has instilled new confidence and enthusiasm in the global fight against terrorism,” he added. The PM said renewed energy was visible in the country regarding ‘Vocal for Local’. He cited the remarks of a parent, who said, “We will now buy toys only made in India for our children. Patriotism will start from childhood.”“Some families have taken a pledge, we will spend our next vacation in some beautiful place in the country. Many young persons have taken a pledge to ‘Wed in India’... that they will get married in the country itself. Someone also said, ‘now whatever gift we will give, it will be made by an Indian artisan’,” he added.","Modi: Operation Sindoor is a reflection of the country’s resolve, courage and a transforming India.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan considers India an ""existential threat"" and will continue to pursue efforts to modernise its military and develop its battlefield or tactical nuclear weapons to offset New Delhi's conventional military advantage, the US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) has said.In its 'World Threat Assessment' report, which notes India's Operation Sindoor to strike terror hubs in Pakistan and the subsequent escalation in hostilities, the DIA says PM Modi's defence priorities will ""probably focus"" on demonstrating global leadership, countering China, and enhancing India's military power. ""India views China as primary adversary and Pakistan more as an ancillary security problem to be managed, despite cross-border attacks in mid-May by both militaries,"" the report said.China has played a big role in facilitating a proliferation nexus to help Pakistan and North Korea to steadily boost their nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals over the years.Global estimates say India and Pakistan have around 170 N-warheads each, with Islamabad also frequently brandishing its short-range Nasr (Hatf-IX) and other missiles as a counter to New Delhi's conventional military superiority, as earlier reported by TOI.The report says China's nuclear stockpile has probably crossed 600 operational warheads. ""We estimate China will have over 1,000 operational warheads by 2030, much of which will be deployed at higher readiness levels for faster response times,"" it said.Pakistan is modernising its nuclear arsenal and maintaining the security of its nuclear material, and command and control structures. “Pakistan almost certainly procures WMD (weapons of mass destruction)-applicable goods from foreign suppliers and intermediaries,” the report says.Early on May 10, India had struck nine airbases in Pakistan in what constituted some clear strategic messaging before the understanding on ceasing hostilities came into effect in the evening. In particular, the deep precision hits on the Nur Khan and Sargodha airbases rattled Pakistan. Nur Khan in Rawalpindi is located close to the headquarters of Pakistan’s Strategic Plans Division that handles the country’s nuclear arsenal, as was then reported by TOI.The DIA report says Pakistan “primarily is a recipient” of Beijing’s “economic and military largesse”, and its forces conduct multiple military exercises with Chinese forces every year.“ Foreign material and technology supporting Pakistan’s WMD programmes are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China, and sometimes are transhipped through Hong Kong, Singapore, Turkiye, and the UAE,” it says.The report says India is giving priority to advancing its bilateral, trilateral and quadrilateral defence partnerships in the Indian Ocean Region and Indo-Pacific through exercises, training, arms sales and information sharing to counter China’s influence and boost its global leadership role.India will almost certainly continue promoting its ‘Made in India’ initiative this year to build its domestic defence industry, mitigate supply chain concerns, and modernise its military, it says.In 2024, India conducted a test of its nuclear-capable Agni-I Prime medium-range ballistic missile and the Agni-V multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle (multiple warheads on a single missile). “India also commissioned its second nuclear-powered submarine (INS Arighaat) to strengthen its nuclear triad and bolster its ability to deter adversaries,” it says.Referring to troop disengagement in Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh in Oct last year, the report says it “did not resolve the long-standing dispute about border demarcation but reduced some tension still lingering” since the Galwan clash in 2020.","Pakistan considers India an ""existential threat"" and will continue to pursue efforts to modernise its military and develop its battlefield or tactical nuclear weapons.

"With Rs 44,000 crore, India to revive minesweepers plan amid China threat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-rs-44000-crore-india-to-revive-minesweepers-plan-amid-china-threat/articleshow/121399040.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has revived its long-pending case for the indigenous construction of 12 specialized warships to detect, track and destroy underwater mines laid by enemy forces to choke harbours and ports, disrupt shipping and maritime trade.Defence ministry sources say the procurement case for the 12 advanced minesweepers or mine countermeasure vessels (MCMVs) for the Navy, at an estimated cost of around Rs 44,000 crore, will soon be placed before the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council for the grant of “acceptance of necessity (AoN)”.The “open tender” or RFP (request for proposal) will then be issued for Indian shipyards to submit their techno-commercial bids. “It will take at least 7-8 years, if not more, for the first MCMV to roll out after the contract is inked,” a source said.The MCMVs are crucial in the backdrop of Chinese nuclear and conventional submarines, which can quietly lay mines, regularly coming to the Indian Ocean Region. Pakistan, too, is rapidly adding to its underwater combat fleet, with eight new Yuan-class diesel-electric submarines to be delivered by China.The Indian Navy, alarmingly, does not have a single MCMV at present, with its earlier six Karwar-class and two Pondicherry class of minesweepers having progressively retired several years ago.The force is making do with “clip-on mine countermeasure suites” mounted on some ships to plug the critical capability gap when it needs 24 MCMVs to guard the country’s 7,516-km long coastline with 13 major ports and over 200 minor ones.Both state and non-state actors can choke harbours and ports by planting underwater mines, which are cheap and relatively easy to use, to blow up warships, merchant vessels and tankers.The acquisition case for 12 MCMVs had begun way back in July 2005, which eventually led to Goa Shipyard tying up with South Korea firm Kangnam to build the specialized vessels. The negotiations, however, remained deadlocked on the costs, technology transfer and build strategy. The Rs 32,000 crore project was finally scrapped by the MoD in 2017-2018.With a displacement of around 900-1,000 tonne, the MCMVs have non-magnetic hulls and high-definition sonars, acoustic and magnetic sweeps to detect marooned and drifting mines. The vessels then use remote-controlled systems like small underwater vehicles to detonate the mines at safe distances.The over 130-warship Navy, of course, played a silent but crucial role during Operation Sindoor earlier this month in dissuading Pakistan from escalating hostilities by forward deploying its aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, warships and submarines in the northern Arabian Sea.The force currently has 60 warships and vessels under construction in Indian shipyards, while it will also commission its second 3,900-tonne multi-role frigate built in Russia as INS Tamal at Kaliningrad next month.It also has the initial approval or AoNs for another 31 warships, including seven new-generation frigates, eight corvettes and six stealth diesel-electric submarines. The MCMVs will add to the numbers.The Navy, however, will reach a force-level of just about 160 warships by 2030, given the slow pace of construction in Indian shipyards as well as the progressive decommissioning of older warships, as earlier reported by TOI.","The procurement case for the 12 advanced minesweepers or mine countermeasure vessels (MCMVs) for the Navy will soon be placed before the defence acquisitions council.

During that conversation, Putin had agreed with Modi on the need for an “uncompromising” fight against terrorism and also stressed that the perpetrators and their backers had to be brought to justice.NSA Ajit Doval is also expected to visit Moscow next month for the 13th international meeting of high representatives for security issues on May 27-29 for which Russia has invited more than 150 countries.While Modi had twice visited Russia last year – first for the annual summit and later for BRICS – Putin’s upcoming visit will be his first to India since the Russia-Ukraine war broke out in February 2022. The summit this year will provide an opportunity for the leaders to review defence and security cooperation, facilitation of mutual energy security, ongoing cooperation to ramp up bilateral trade to $ 100 billion by 2030 and use of national currencies for bilateral settlement.India wants to increase its supplies of goods to Russia for a more balanced trade relationship.The Modi-Putin summit was expected to take place early this year but Putin has remained preoccupied with the Ukraine war and ongoing international efforts to broker peace. The annual bilateral summit is the highest institutionalized dialogue mechanism between India and Russia, something which both sides attach great importance to even as the leaders meet regularly on the margins of multilateral summits like BRICS and SCO.The BRICS summit will be held in Brazil in July this year, and China will host the SCO event in late August or early September. However, while Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected at the BRICS summit, there’s uncertainty about Putin’s participation.

""Students there have achieved 95% results in Class 10th exams, and in Class 12th results, Dantewada has secured sixth position in the entire state,"" he said, celebrating educational success in a region long overshadowed by conflict.His remarks came days after a top Maoist leader, Basavaraju, was killed in an encounter in Chhattisgarh - seen as a key moment in the continuing push to restore peace. Yet, beyond the security lens, Modi chose to emphasise everyday development as the true sign of change. ""This is not just a sign of development, but also of rising confidence,"" he said, referring to how residents of Katejhari village in Gadchiroli celebrated the launch of their first-ever bus service with drums and joy.""This is a new chapter of change in areas previously trapped in fear,"" he added.Modi underlined how tribal children were now exploring science labs and competing in large events like Bastar Olympics. ""Children of these areas are doing wonders in every field. These students are not only progressing in academics, but also showing interest in science and playing with full enthusiasm,"" he said.He also drew attention to youth taking pride in their heritage by learning traditional skills. ""Many youths have started making musical instruments and decorative items used in local festivals,"" he said, noting that such activities preserve culture while offering new economic opportunities. ""Young people of these areas are also getting involved in skill development,"" he added. Local training centres are increasingly offering courses that align with community livelihoods, helping youth turn their skills into sustainable incomes.In an example of health awareness, Modi spoke about the use of ""sugar boards"" in schools. These boards list the sugar content in popular foods and beverages to help children make informed dietary choices. ""Children are getting motivated to consume sugar in a balanced way,"" he said.

Repeated droughts, driven in part by declining rainfall linked to climate change, had turned their lands barren. Water sources dried up, crippling agriculture and animal husbandry, the lifeblood of their livelihood.With no other way to survive, many men were forced into dacoity, hiding in jungles and risking their lives every day to evade police. Karauli's average annual rainfall dropped from 722.1mm (1951-2000) to 563.94mm (2001-2011), according to govt data. But in the 2010s, something remarkable happened. The women, weary of fear and despair, resolved to reclaim their lives. They convinced their husbands to come out of the jungles and give up arms.Together, they began reviving old, dried-up ponds and constructing new pokhars (water bodies) with the help of Tarun Bharat Sangh (TBS), an Alwar-based NGO dedicated to water conservation since 1975. ""I would have been dead by now.She convinced me to come back and start farming again,"" recalled Jagdish, Sampatti's husband, now 58, who surrendered his weapons and chose peace.Pooling every penny earned over the years by selling milk, they built a pokhar at the base of a hill near their village, Alampur, in 2015-16. When the rains came, the pokhar was filled and for the first time in years, their family had enough water to sustain them for a longer period. ""Now, we grow mustard, wheat, pearl millet and vegetables,"" says Sampatti, sitting proudly on the pokhar's embankment. She even rents it out for water chestnut cultivation, earning about Rs 1 lakh each season.Over the years, TBS and the local community have together built 16 such pokhars in the forest surrounding the village and around 500 across district, each capturing runoff from the slopes, preventing droughts and floods. Karauli, once among Rajasthan's worst-hit dacoit areas, witnessed a transformation.The district is part of Chambal region, which extends across Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. It has historically been notorious for dacoity due to its rugged terrain, ravines and forests that provided hideouts for dacoits.""With community-led conservation efforts, stability is returning,"" said Karauli SP Brijesh Jyoti Upadhyay. He said rainfall in the region is erratic and leads to periods of both water scarcity and intense short-term downpours. ""Karauli faces droughts during dry times and flash floods when it rains heavily, like last year, when the monsoon brought over 1,900 mm of rain.""Sumit Dookia, an associate professor at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University & a native of Rajasthan, said the rocky terrain makes water run off quickly and stops it from soaking into the ground. ""With all this going on, smart water management is really important.""The wave of conservation in Karauli has transformed Serni, once a seasonal river, into a perennial one. Just a decade ago, the river would run dry after Diwali, leaving people desperate for water. ""Now, it holds water even at the peak of summer, thanks to around 150 water harvesting structures constructed along its entire length and breadth. The groundwater level has risen to just 5 to 10 feet below the surface,"" said TBS' Ranveer Singh.Forty years ago, he said, the river flowed all year round, but overuse and climate change had left it dry. With no options left, some men migrated to cities in search of work while others turned to mining or dacoity. ""Illegal mining exposed them to lethal silica dust, causing silicosis, a painful and incurable lung disease. Many did not live past 40,"" said Rajendra Singh, a Magsaysay Award and Stockholm Water Prize-winning water conservationist who leads TBS. A 2013 study by National Institute of Miners' Health found that 74% of surveyed sandstone workers in Karauli suffered from silicosis.Now, on a scorching May afternoon, water shimmers in Karauli's ponds and pokhars. Serni river flows gently, with children splashing and cattle grazing along its banks. ""A decade ago, no one would have imagined this. But our women made this possible!"" said Ranveer.","Until about 15 years ago, women in Rajasthan's Karauli district lived in constant fear, dreading the day their husbands might not return home.

If the spill spreads, it may harm marine productivity, especially during the monsoon - a critical period for pelagic fish breeding and growth. This could have lasting consequences for fisheries,"" George said.Monsoon typically supports high marine productivity, George said, adding that much will depend on how the ship's leakage can be contained. To examine the impact, CMFRI will conduct field surveys, collect samples, and track the spill's movement.A study on the long-term impact of the very low sulfur fuel oil spill (VLSFO) from the site of Wakashio, a ship which sank off Mauritius in July 2020, shows contaminated sediments and mangroves. The study was published in Elsevier's Marine Pollution Bulletin recently, three years after the sinking. This was the world's first major spill of VLSFO since a global sulfur cap took effect from January 2020.Chemical analysis in March 2023 of sediment samples collected from mangroves close to the site of Wakashio's sinking confirmed biodegradation. The researchers have concluded that the mangroves differed in their sensitivity to oil, resulting in the more tolerant species obtaining a competitive advantage to recolonise other systems.In such cases, it is crucial to know locations of the spilled oil and monitor such sites with health checks on mangroves and associated plants and animals.","The sinking of MSC ELSA 3 container ship in the Arabian Sea off Kochi's coast on Saturday will have serious ecological impact on marine and coastal ecosystems.

Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang blasts Biden-era AI chip export policy.

iPhone's US manufacturing remains unlikely

A big Wall Street analyst predicts Apple could manufacture up to 65% of its iPhones in India by fall 2025, as the tech giant navigates mounting pressure from President Trump to shift production away from the the country. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who maintains a $270 price target and Outperform rating on Apple stock, called the Trump administration's 90-day tariff pause ""a dream scenario"" for the company. By this fall, Ives believes Apple ""could manufacture 60% to 65% of its smartphones in India,"" citing his ""high level of confidence"" that the iPhone maker is accelerating its manufacturing transfer to the South Asian country.The prediction comes amid escalating tensions between Apple and the Trump administration over the company's India operations.

Chaos in the cabin: Viral video captures terrifying moments



Pilot declares emergency, ensures safe landing

Severe weather in Delhi-NCR disrupted air travel

Cyclonic system behind the storm

No injuries, but a frightening Experience

In a harrowing mid-air episode on May 21, 2025, IndiGo flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar encountered a violent hailstorm that left the aircraft’s nose visibly damaged. The Airbus A321, carrying 227 passengers, was battered by sudden turbulence that sparked panic in the cabin. A now-viral video from inside the aircraft captured terrified passengers, including children, screaming as the plane shook intensely and lightning flashed outside. The pilot declared an emergency but managed to land the aircraft safely in Srinagar around 6:30 PM. Thankfully, no injuries were reported, and the aircraft has since been grounded for inspection. Experts believe such extreme weather encounters are likely to increase due to climate change. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is expected to review flight route protocols.Although IndiGo did not initially confirm the extent of the damage, viral photos have revealed that the aircraft's nose cone suffered significant structural damage. The damage is consistent with impact from large hailstones during the flight’s traversal of the storm system. The aircraft has since been grounded at Srinagar Airport for thorough inspection and repairs. The nose cone, which houses sensitive radar equipment, is a crucial part of flight navigation. Repairs could take several days, delaying the aircraft’s return to active service.The footage, widely circulated on social media, shows passengers in a state of fear and confusion as the aircraft shudders violently mid-air. Screams and cries from children dominate the audio, while flashes of lightning are visible through the windows. The cabin crew is seen attempting to maintain calm and ensure passenger safety as the aircraft fights through the intense weather. Several passengers have since shared their traumatic experiences online, seeking support. Psychological counselling is being recommended for those who were most affected.According to airline officials, the pilot of flight 6E 2142 reported an emergency to Srinagar Air Traffic Control upon encountering the hailstorm. Despite the hazardous conditions, the flight landed safely at approximately 6:30 PM. IndiGo stated that all protocols were followed and that the airport team attended to passengers' needs upon arrival.The incident coincided with a powerful storm that swept across Delhi-NCR on Wednesday evening, with wind speeds reaching up to 79 kmph. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported 12.2 mm of rainfall at Safdarjung between 5:30 PM and 8:30 PM. The sudden weather shift disrupted flight operations at Delhi Airport, left Metro services stranded, and caused chaos across the region.IMD attributed the turbulent weather to a cyclonic circulation over Haryana, embedded in a larger trough extending from Punjab to Bangladesh. Moisture influx from both the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal intensified the system, resulting in hailstorms and gusty winds across northern India.While there were no physical injuries reported among the 227 passengers, many described the experience as deeply unsettling. Trinamool Congress MPs, who were reportedly on board, later referred to the incident as a ""near-death experience."" IndiGo emphasized that customer well-being was prioritised upon landing. The incident has reignited calls for enhanced in-flight safety education and emergency drills. Passengers expressed gratitude for the crew’s professionalism during the ordeal.This incident serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictability of weather patterns and the challenges faced by pilots and crew during extreme conditions. While no one was harmed, the mental toll and the visible damage to the aircraft highlight the seriousness of such mid-air encounters.","IndiGo flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar encountered a violent hailstorm that left the aircraft’s nose visibly damaged.

MrBeast’s early life and how his career started

YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson , also known as MrBeast, has reportedly joined the ranks of billionaires, with Celebrity Net Worth estimating his net worth at $1 billion. This makes the 27-year-old content creator the eighth youngest billionaire globally, and the only one under 30 who built his wealth without inheritance. MrBeast began his YouTube career as a teenager, posting videos from his North Carolina home. His initial viral success came in 2017 with ""I Counted to 100,000,"" a video that took 44 hours to film and has since accumulated over 31 million views. Since then, he has gained recognition on the platform for his challenges, large-scale giveaways, and philanthropic content.In 2024, MrBeast was identified as a leading creator on the Forbes Top Creators list. While Forbes had previously estimated his net worth at $85 million, court documents from a 2024 lawsuit related to his food brand revealed his earnings were $223 million in 2023 and were projected to reach $700 million in 2024.His business ventures include Beast Burger , a delivery-only fast-food chain launched in 2020 that reportedly earned $2.3 million per month, though he later sued due to quality concerns. MrBeast also founded Feastables , a chocolate bar company that generated over $10 million in its initial months.Additionally, he co-created Juice Funds, a $2 million fund with Creative Juice that invests up to $250,000 in emerging creators. In the crypto and tech space, MrBeast holds Bitcoin and several CryptoPunks NFTs and is involved with platforms like Coinbase, Refinable, and the XCAD Network, which helps creators monetise videos with NFTs.His philanthropic efforts are equally extensive, as he established Beast Philanthropy, a nonprofit supporting large-scale charitable projects. MrBeast has donated over 100 cars, given away $1 million in a single video, and helped raise $20 million to plant trees through Team Trees.In 2023, he faced criticism for funding cataract surgeries for 1,000 blind individuals. In response, MrBeast reiterated his commitment, stating, “I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.”He made a similar pledge in 2019, outlining his life’s goal as ""make a bunch of money, and then give it all away while doing as much good as possible.""MrBeast's achievements have earned him various industry accolades, including a nomination for Vlogger of the Year at the Shorty Awards in 2019 and wins for Breakout Creator and 2020 YouTuber of the Year.His journey from counting to 100,000 on camera to building a multi-billion-dollar empire showcases a blend of creativity and generosity. MrBeast's career trajectory began in 2012 when, at just 13 years old, he started uploading videos under the username ""MrBeast6000.""His early content included gaming videos, often featuring Minecraft and Call of Duty, as well as videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers. He also created reaction videos and funny compilations, showcasing his willingness to experiment with different formats.By mid-2016, his main channel on YouTube had fewer than 30,000 subscribers, but his persistence led him to drop out of college later that year to pursue YouTube full-time.His growth accelerated through diverse real-world formats, including challenges, vlogs, and absurd tasks like watching paint dry for an hour or attempting to break glass with a hundred megaphones. He gained initial popularity with his ""Worst Intros on YouTube"" series.MrBeast is known for reinvesting nearly all his video earnings back into creating new content, allowing for increasingly ambitious productions. In 2021, he was the fastest-growing creator on YouTube, adding 37 million subscribers in one year.He has also expanded his content globally by launching separate channels for dubbed videos in over 10 languages, including Spanish, French, and Arabic, leading to substantial international viewership. His main channel became the most-subscribed on YouTube in June 2024.In related news, MrBeast shared an invitation to Indian cricketer Virat Kohli. Shared on X during the Indian Premier League (IPL), the post rapidly went viral, accumulating nearly 600K views, a testament to Kohli's universal recognition. “@imVkohli Hey! Anyway I could get you in a video? 👀” he said in a post on X.","Jimmy Donaldson, also known as MrBeast, has reportedly joined the ranks of billionaires, with Celebrity Net Worth estimating his net worth at $1 billion.

"Tech layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike reshape workforce",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-layoffs-2025-over-61000-jobs-cut-as-microsoft-google-amazon-and-crowdstrike-reshape-workforce/articleshow/121359700.cms,"Tech layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike reshape workforce

Tech Layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut across more than 130 companies



Key stats (as of May 2025):

Total layoffs: 61,300+ employees

Companies involved: 130+

Sectors affected: Cloud computing, advertising, HR, devices, software engineering, sales

Microsoft: Streamlining leadership, prioritising engineers

Why Microsoft made the cuts:

Restructuring leadership layers to promote a flatter hierarchy

Investing more in engineering and product development

Optimizing global workforce by reducing duplication of roles

Google: Quiet workforce shifts behind the scenes

Strategic workforce realignment:

Focused layoffs across revenue-generating units

Elimination of redundant roles tied to aging product lines

A shift towards automation and generative AI technologies in advertising and consumer search

Amazon: Scaling back devices and emerging tech divisions

Behind Amazon’s cuts:

A realignment of priorities in consumer devices

Slower growth and usage rates of Alexa and Kindle platforms

Budget reallocation to cloud computing (AWS) and logistics optimization

CrowdStrike: Cutting 5% to focus on profitability

CrowdStrike’s layoff strategy:

Streamlining customer success and non-core support roles

Enhancing operating efficiency with AI-based threat detection tools

Reinvesting in international market expansion and enterprise sales

IBM: AI replaces jobs, but also creates new ones

IBM’s AI-driven workforce transition:

Use of AI automation in HR, reducing the need for traditional roles

Reinvestment in high-growth areas like quantum computing and hybrid cloud

Emphasis on reskilling and upskilling internal employees

Why are these layoffs happening? The 3 core reasons



1. Macroeconomic volatility

Global economic conditions remain unstable. Geopolitical tensions, high interest rates, and inflationary pressures have compelled tech companies to cut costs and bolster margins.

2. Post-pandemic growth corrections

During the COVID-19 pandemic, tech companies saw unprecedented growth and scaled their teams rapidly. As demand normalizes, many are right-sizing their workforces to match slower, more sustainable growth trajectories.

3. The AI revolution

Perhaps the most transformative factor is the rise of artificial intelligence. Tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot have already replaced or reduced the need for certain roles in coding, content creation, customer service, and HR. Companies are now prioritizing automation over expansion, leading to widespread redundancy across job functions that once required large teams.

What it means for the future of tech work

Emerging trends:

Fewer administrative layers, more direct reporting structures

Higher demand for AI literacy, even in non-technical roles

Greater reliance on contractors and fractional talent

Emphasis on remote and flexible work, with fewer full-time hires

Tech layoffs are defining the trajectory of the technology sector in 2025 — not solely due to innovation, but because of the sweeping workforce restructuring taking place across the industry. From global giants like Microsoft , Google , and Amazon to specialized cybersecurity firms such as CrowdStrike , companies are reducing headcounts in significant numbers. As of mid-May, more than 61,000 tech jobs have been cut across over 130 companies, according to data from Layoffs.fyi. Unlike previous downturns driven by financial collapses or market crashes, this wave is propelled by three powerful forces: slowing post-pandemic revenue growth, persistent global economic uncertainty, and, most notably, the rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in core business operations.These layoffs signal a broader transformation in how tech firms are responding to modern pressures. Rather than merely cutting costs, many are strategically reorganizing their internal structures, accelerating AI-driven automation, and reallocating resources toward long-term innovation and profitability.According to the data from Layoffs.fri, as of May 2025, over 61,000 workers have been laid off in the tech industry — a continuation of a trend that began in 2022 and escalated dramatically in 2023. Companies are now more strategic in their announcements, often avoiding large headlines by issuing smaller, staggered job cuts throughout the year. Still, the cumulative effect has created deep uncertainty among tech professionals worldwide.The layoffs are not restricted to startups or mid-size firms; the biggest names in tech — Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike — are among the most significant contributors to this tally. Let’s examine how each is navigating this reshuffling of talent and operations.In one of the largest individual cuts of the year, Microsoft laid off 6,000 employees, with nearly 2,000 roles eliminated in Washington state alone. This marked the company’s most substantial layoff since 2023. The job reductions span several business units, including support, administration, and middle management.According to an internal memo, the company is making these changes to “improve clarity of decision-making and better align teams with strategic priorities.” The layoff announcement also came with news of increased investment in AI-powered enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure.While Google hasn't made a single large-scale layoff announcement in 2025, it has been silently trimming its workforce across multiple departments. In May alone, 200 employees were laid off from its Global Business Organization (GBO) — a team that handles advertising sales and partner engagement. These cuts follow earlier reductions in the Pixel hardware team, Android division, Chrome operations, and Google Cloud.Google’s restructuring is part of a broader initiative to recalibrate its business model in the face of AI-led disruption in search and advertising, two of its most lucrative verticals. Rather than hiring aggressively, the company is being more selective, favoring AI talent over traditional business development roles.Amazon announced in April that it would cut around 100 jobs in its Devices and Services division, which includes Alexa, Kindle, and Zoox — its autonomous vehicle subsidiary.Amazon has long treated its devices division as an innovation lab. However, as pressure mounts to deliver profitability in every business line, the company is scaling back on experimental divisions and concentrating on proven revenue drivers like AWS and Prime logistics.Even high-growth cybersecurity companies aren’t immune. CrowdStrike announced layoffs impacting 5% of its global workforce, citing a shift towards long-term profitability amid rising costs and market volatility.CrowdStrike's decision is especially noteworthy as cybersecurity remains one of the fastest-growing segments of the tech industry. Yet even here, automation and AI are allowing firms to do more with fewer people, reducing the need for large support teams.IBM represents a hybrid approach to workforce management in the age of AI. While the company laid off several hundred employees, mostly from HR and administrative roles, it also announced new hiring plans focused on engineering, programming, and enterprise sales.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has been vocal about the company’s “AI-first” strategy, noting that while automation will eliminate certain roles, it will also create new demand for technical talent, especially in sectors where human insight remains essential.While the specifics vary by company, the underlying causes of the 2025 tech layoffs can be traced to three interwoven trends:The 2025 layoff wave is more than just a cost-cutting exercise — it is a strategic rebalancing of what work looks like in the digital economy. The shift isn’t just about reducing headcount; it’s about reshaping the types of roles that matter most.","Tech layoffs are defining the trajectory of the technology sector in 2025.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk warns ‘Government is wasting $100 million per year on…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-government-is-wasting-about-100-million-per-year-on/articleshow/121343315.cms,"“Government is wasting about $100 million per year on unused phone lines!”

Xbox and PlayStation Price Hikes Explained

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the US federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines. Musk quoted a post by DOGE aka the Department of Government Efficiency which revealed that nearly 20% of the phone lines at a federal agency were unused. DOGE shared a post on X that reads “Unused phone lines! Of the 1048 @USOPM phone lines, 198 (19%) were either unused or duplicated.”It further added: “OPM (Office of Personnel Management) cancelled these lines (took 1 hour), resulting in ~$100k/yr in savings. Since OPM is ~0.1% of the federal government, this suggests that ~$100M/yr is wasted on unused lines”.The tech billionaire responded to the post, statingThe revelation could have broader implications for telecom providers supplying services to federal agencies. According to a 2023 Washington Post report, only 2% of U.S. adults use landlines exclusively. As legacy landline usage continues to decline—the cost and necessity of maintaining unused infrastructure is under increasing scrutiny.In 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed regulations that had previously required telecom providers to run copper landline connections to every home. The move marked a significant shift toward modernizing telecommunications infrastructure in favor of wireless and fiber-optic networks.According to a report, Verizon Communications Inc. remains the dominant landline service provider in the Northeastern United States, maintaining a strong regional presence even as overall landline use continues to decline nationwide.In a related news, Musk shared a 15-second clip of the US Vice President in conversation with Joe Rogan, where Vance said “You can say a lot of things about Elon Musk, but you can't say he's a dumb**s”. The two burst into laughter, as Rogan quipped, “You get dunked on by one of the smartest guys alive.”Musk shared the clip on his X timeline, responding with, ""Lmao,"" short for (Laughing My A** Off).",Tesla CEO Elon Musk highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the US federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.
