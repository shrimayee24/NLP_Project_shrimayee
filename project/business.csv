‘GST Bachat Utsav’ Kicks Off: Modi Unveils Reforms for Middle Class, Farmers

(Inputs from agencies)

KOLKATA/T'PURAM: Bengal and Kerala welcomed lower GST rates for easing costs to households but warned that states will shoulder crippling losses in revenue, accusing Centre of passing the burden while taking credit.Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said Monday her state would forfeit Rs 20,000 crore because of the decision, though she backed it for the sake of consumers. ""How will I run the state in such a condition?"" she asked after inaugurating a Durga Puja in Kolkata. ""No compensation was given to states on account of lowered GST rates, the money was simply cut from our GST share.""""I will place the truth before the people, take out ads to make sure they know the loss we suffered. This is no credit to central govt,"" she said. Banerjee reminded that she was the first to demand insurance be exempt from GST and pointed to anomalies: ""Many life-saving medicines and small items had GST. There was GST on jeere (cumin) but not on heere (diamond)."" Banerjee demanded whether Delhi would return funds withheld for 100 days' work, Awas Yojana, roads, Jal Swapno and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.Trinamool national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee sharpened the attack.""PM Modi yesterday said 'GST Bachat Utsav'. Was it 'GST Loot Utsav' since 2017?"" he asked.In Kerala, finance minister KN Balagopal warned of a ""substantial fall"" in revenues. He estimated Kerala's potential loss at between Rs 50,000 crore and Rs 2 lakh crore, directly affecting social security pensions, salaries and development projects. ""States have no alternative avenues to raise such revenue. With 41% of overall state income coming from GST, the impact will be severe if this loss materialises,"" he said, accusing Delhi of pushing reforms without appropriate study. Balagopal cautioned that companies might not pass on the benefit. ""Even Union ministers admitted this concern,"" he said.","Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee said her state would forfeit Rs 20,000 crore because of the decision.

NEW DELHI: Number of polluted river stretches in country has shown a consistent decline from 351 in 2018 to 311 in 2022 and further to 296 in 2025, shows an assessment report of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) released Monday.Two or more polluted locations identified on a river in a continuous sequence are defined as Polluted River Stretch (PRS). Stretches where biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) exceeds 3mg/l are identified as polluted stretches. BOD beyond prescribed levels affects health of aquatic life. A stretch where BOD concentration exceeds 30mg/l is categorised as most polluted stretch.The 2025 assessment, based on river water quality data of 2022 and 2023 at 2,116 locations on rivers across country, shows 37 of 296 PRS were classified as most polluted. This number, however, has dropped from 46 in 2022. These 37 stretches were identified across 14 states, with five each in TN, UP and Uttarakhand; four in Gujarat; and three in Karnataka.Yamuna's stretch from Palla to Asgarpur in Delhi, Sabarmati in Ahmedabad, Chambal's stretch from Nagda to Gandhisagar dam in MP, & stretches of Tungabadhra and Sarabanga in Karnataka and TN, respectively, were among most notable PRS during the assessment period.Jhelum in J&K; Ganga, Ramrekha and Sikrahna in Bihar; Hasdeo and Mahanadi in Chhattisgarh; Sal and Mapusa in Goa; Cauvery and Tungabhadra in Karnataka; Periyar in Kerala; and Amba & Savitri in Maharashtra are among prominent rivers where PRS were seen to have deteriorated in water quality.The report, at the same time, observed improvement in water quality in 220 stretches that were identified as PRS in 2018. ""Of the 220 PRS, 149 river stretches are not identified as polluted stretches due to compliance with BOD criterion,"" said the report.","Number of polluted river stretches in country has shown a consistent decline from 351 in 2018 to 311 in 2022.

NEW DELHI: The country is set to get an apex empowered agency for preparation of comprehensive transport strategies for all modes of transport and end-to-end mobility . The proposed Integrated Transport Authority comprising planning heads of all related ministries will also carry out monitoring to ensure timely project completion. The proposal is likely to be placed before the Cabinet soon as govt focuses on accelerating transport infrastructure development to enable faster movement of people and goods, and reduce logistics costs.At present, there is a National Project Group under department for promotion of industry and internal trade that evaluates large-scale projects, but it only has an advisory role. Officials said a group of secretaries has recommended the need for an authority similar to those in the US, the UK, Germany, Australia and Japan to handle all transport-related issues. However, they also cautioned the new agency must not become just another bureaucratic layer for going through presentations.","The proposed Integrated Transport Authority comprising planning heads of all related ministries will also carry out monitoring to ensure timely project completion.

Read Sridhar Vembu’s complete post here



I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the Partition of India in order to explain the current H-1B situation. He mentioned the stories of his Sindhi friends whose families were forced to leave everything but they eventually thrived after starting over again.“I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time.

He said that India today offer multiple opportunities as compared to that in the past. He also adds that those willing to take this leap will ultimately benefit from it.The hike in the visa fees could lead to reverse migration of skilled professionals, strengthening its domestic tech and startup ecosystem.

Poll Should the Supreme Court mandate the release of the flight data recorder information? Yes, for transparency. No, for confidentiality.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday raised serious concerns over the AAIB preliminary report on the June 12 Air India Crash , calling certain aspects ""irresponsible."" A bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh issued notice to Centre and the director general of civil aviation (DGCA) on a plea seeking an independent, fair and expeditious probe.The bench examined the July 12 preliminary report, which suggested lapses on the part of pilots in the Boeing 787-8 aircraft operating flight AI171.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who is representing the aviation safety NGO, Safety Matters Foundation led by Captain Amit Singh (FRAeS), contended that three members of the probe panel were from the aviation regulator, raising potential conflict-of-interest concerns.He also urged the court to order the release of the flight data recorder (FDR) information to clarify the cause of the accident.The plea highlighted that AAIB's preliminary report attributed the accident to the fuel cutoff switches being moved from ""run"" to ""cutoff,"" effectively implying pilot error.The plea also alleged that the report withholds critical information, including the full Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) output, complete Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) transcripts with time stamps and Electronic Aircraft Fault Recording (EAFR) data.Supreme Court stressed the issues of confidentiality, privacy and dignity while acknowledging the need for a final report. It warned that releasing certain details could be exploited by rival airlines, but clarified that its notices were limited to ensuring a free, fair, and independent investigation.","The Supreme Court on Monday raised serious concerns over the AAIB preliminary report on the June 12 Air India Crash.

Opposition Slams PM Modi for Skipping H-1B, Foreign Policy in ‘Old’ GST Speech

NEW DELHI: Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut on Monday expressed surprise over Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s decision to advance his usual national address from 8 pm to 5 pm on Sunday.Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Raut suggested that the timing adjustment may have been intended to allow BJP workers to watch the India vs Pakistan cricket match without disruption. He also called the prime minister’s usual 8 pm address a “standard time to mislead people.”Raut said, “The Prime Minister addressed the nation at 5 pm, which surprised everyone. His usual time is 8 pm — that’s the standard time to mislead people.”He added that the timing change appeared to be due to the India-Pakistan cricket match, as BJP workers reportedly wanted to watch it without any interruption from the Prime Minister’s address.According to Raut, the party allegedly informed the prime minister to schedule the address for 5 pm, allowing workers to follow the match — what he described as “a display of patriotism.”""BJP workers wanted to watch the India-Pakistan match, so the time was changed-- what a display of patriotism!,"" he said.During his address, PM Modi urged citizens to adopt Swadeshi practices and prioritize Made in India products, coinciding with the rollout of the new Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms from September 22, the first day of Shardiya Navaratri.He said, “We need to make every home a symbol of Swadeshi... every shop should be adorned with Swadeshi products.” PM Modi called the GST reforms a “Bachat Utsav” and appealed to people to purchase products made in India, highlighting the hard work of the country’s youth.The prime minister emphasised that the reforms reflect the Union Government’s “Nagrik Devo Bhava” principle and will result in substantial savings for the public.Emphasising self-reliance as the path to a developed India, PM Modi noted that the GST rate reduction would directly benefit small businesses and MSMEs.The timing of Prime Minister Modi’s address coincided with the India vs Pakistan Super Four match in the 2025 Asia Cup.

Poll Should teachers in India receive a minimum salary guarantee regardless of their employment status? Yes, every teacher deserves a minimum salary. No, salaries should depend on the institution's funding.

(Reporting by Abdul Qadir in Gaya, BK Mishra in Patna, Saeed Khan and Bharat Yagnik in Ahmedabad, Rahul Singh in Meerut, Isha Jain in Lucknow, & Mohd Dilshad in Agra)

In 1983, Md Aftab Alam was hired as a regular college lecturer — on paper. Forty-one years later, he’s still waiting for his first salary. The appointment letter, issued by Sanjay Gandhi Mahila College in Gaya, promised pay and service conditions on par with university faculty. What followed was four decades of unpaid teaching, no employee ID, no pension — just a man showing up to class every day with a PhD and no payslip. “I taught, I evaluated papers, I invigilated exams,” he said. “But officially, it’s as if I was never there.” His only proof is a fading sheet of paper from 1983 and a lifetime of unacknowledged labour.Last month, in a sharply worded verdict, India's Supreme Court ruled that 18 assistant professors in Gujarat — hired on contract and paid far less than their regular colleagues — had been denied basic constitutional protections. The bench, led by Justice Abhay S Oka, invoked a line familiar to nearly every Indian classroom: “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshwara.” The words, the court said, mean little if teachers are paid a pittance. Md Aftab Alam and thousands of teachers like him would know.The truth is harder than what the verdict suggests: in places far from Gujarat, and in classrooms that do not appear in affidavits, teachers still work for Rs 3,000 a month.Or Rs 1,000. Or nothing at all.Alam lives in a rented two-room flat in Gaya (Bihar), where the plaster peels and the only reliable light comes from a window that faces the street. Every morning, he folds his PhD certificate back into a drawer, picks up the same well-thumbed books he has taught from for years, and steps out toward a college that never recognised him as its own. His wife, Shamsun Nisa, said the only income now comes from occasional evaluation and invigilation work during university exams. And a little bit of private tuition. Just enough to get by, sometimes with financial help from friends and relatives. “People think he’s too broken to teach. But he still reads. He still steps out in the morning dressed for work.”He began teaching English there in 1983, just after completing his master’s from Magadh University. Though formally hired under university-approved terms, the college denied him regular employee status. “When I asked for a salary,” he said, “they told me I was just a part-time teacher.” Magadh University, in response to an RTI application, confirmed that Alam had indeed been appointed as regular faculty. In July 2023, the state’s higher education director directed the university registrar to take necessary action. Nothing changed. “I couldn’t afford lawyers,” Alam said. “Sometimes I couldn’t afford two meals a day.”India’s education system — vast, decentralised, often romanticised — rests on people like Alam. People who carry attendance registers without knowing whether they’ll be compensated for it. People who prepare lectures, invigilate exams, sign logbooks, evaluate answer sheets, and still have to take private tuition just to afford a sack of rice. Alam is not the only one.The numbers alone tell a story that’s difficult to look away from. There are more than 10,000 teachers in 220 unaided affiliated degree colleges across Bihar. At Banwari College, commerce lecturer Deepak Kumar Singh teaches every day. His salary last year was Rs 9,000. In 2022–23, it was Rs 21,000. Before that, for four consecutive years, he received nothing. “No holidays, no leave. We come, we teach,” he said. “We mark attendance on the biometric machine like everyone else. ” The biometric scanner at the entrance does not care whether its data leads to a pay slip.Others never got even that far. Shankar Bhagat, who taught ancient Indian history in the same college, died of liver cirrhosis without treatment. Another colleague, Mukesh Kumar Mishra, is battling cancer in Muzaffarpur. His salary wasn’t enough to even consider a private hospital. “These are PhD holders,” said Arun Gautam, a senior teacher and media-in-charge of the Federation of Affiliated Degree College Teachers’ Associations of Bihar. “They teach because that’s all they know how to do. But the state hasn’t paid unaided colleges in eight years.”This neglect, over time, has ossified into routine. A 2013 policy promised performance-based grants to unaided institutions — linking funding to student outcomes. But funds were never consistently released. Today, teachers are paid, if at all, from the internal revenues of their colleges: exam fees, certificate charges, hostel deposits. Many have no formal employment letters. Some earn barely Rs 1,500 a month.In Gujarat, the disparities played out on official contracts — but the outcome was no less punishing. Between 2008 and 2014, over 450 engineers were hired as assistant professors on fixed-term contracts. Some were placed in govt engineering colleges, others in polytechnics. They were paid Rs 30,000 or Rs 25,000, and told their tenure would end once Gujarat Public Service Commission filled the sanctioned posts.Naitik Gor was among them. He joined a govt polytechnic institute in 2013. He taught 32 hours a week — nearly double the regular load — and took on the full slate of responsibilities: practicals, examinations, even election duties. “There were no vacations, no earned leave. Same job, same responsibilities, half the pay,” he said. In 2020, he walked away from academia and took a position at a private firm in Ahmedabad. “Teaching was never supposed to feel like charity.”In 2018, more than 300 contractual faculty like him went to Gujarat high court. They argued that the disparity in pay violated Articles 14, 15, 16 and 19 of the Constitution. In 2023, a single-judge bench agreed, calling it a “crying shame” that qualified lecturers, appointed by due process, were still kept on ad hoc contracts. The state appealed. Two division benches rejected its argument. A third overturned the decision. The matter reached Supreme Court.The apex court has now ruled in the petitioners’ favour. Gujarat govt has been ordered to pay arrears with 8% interest from 2015, and to align these teachers with the pay scale of regular assistant professors. But much of the damage is already done. Gor said most of the original petitioners had left teaching. “We waited years for that verdict. When it finally came, only 44 of us were still in the classroom.”The erosion is not just economic — it is emotional, generational, institutional. Siksha Mitras — guest teachers recruited in large numbers in the early 2000s — were briefly regularised in 2015, drawing salaries of Rs 50,000. Two years later, the decision was reversed. Their salaries dropped back to Rs 10,000. “We were promoted, then demoted,” said Meenu Goswami, a Siksha Mitra in Bulandshahr, UP, who lives with a leg disability. “We’ve been doing the same work as govt teachers who earn Rs 65,000 or more. But they said we don’t deserve it.” She recounted at least a dozen suicides among demoted teachers in her district. “Some had loans, others lost homes. The salary cut killed them.”Shaily Sharma spent five years teaching at a small school in Amroha. She holds a postgraduate degree and a BEd. By 2015, she had become principal. Her salary was Rs 4,500 a month. “I loved the work,” she said. “But love doesn’t pay rent.” She left teaching in 2016. She hasn’t returned.Teachers in Lucknow’s top-tier schools — the ones with tall gates and English-medium boards — might earn Rs 60,000 or more. But those are few. Most private school teachers, even at well-known institutions, are paid Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000. “Even the fancy schools don't offer more,” said Atul Srivastava, president of the Association of Private Schools, UP. “Fees are low, CSR support is absent, govt help is negligible. Everyone wants good teachers, but no one wants to pay them.”The longer-term effects are showing across Uttar Pradesh. Since 2021, there has been no recruitment of govt school teachers. Thousands of schools now run entirely on guest faculty. “There’s no pipeline anymore,” said Dinesh Sharma, president of the Uttar Pradesh Primary Teachers’ Association. “People are migrating to other states — Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh. They’ve given up hope here.”The National Education Policy 2020 promised to restore dignity to the teaching profession. It called for better pay, regularisation, and a clear career path. In theory, it still does. In hundreds and thousands of classrooms in the country, though, it's cruel fiction. Ask Aftab Alam, who still walks to the college, notes in hand, and still dresses like a teacher. One with empty pockets and lost youth.","In 1983, Md Aftab Alam was hired as a regular college lecturer — on paper. Forty-one years later, he’s still waiting for his first salary. Alam is not the only one. There are more than 10,000 teachers in 220 unaided affiliated degree colleges across Bihar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124033063,imgsize-250872,width-400,resizemode-4/appointed-ignored-unpaid-meet-indias-invisible-teachers.jpg"

Khalistani Outfit Threatens To 'Siege' Indian Consulate In Vancouver; Targets New Envoy

Gosal allegedly planned violence at Indian consulates in Canada

Inderjit Singh Gosal, who took over Canada's Khalistan referendum campaign after Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing, is learned to have been arrested by Canadian police. Gosal is also the Canada coordinator for terror group Sikhs for Justice and has links with Babbar Khalsa International, also a designated terror outfit.The action comes shortly after India's national security adviser Ajit Doval and his Canadian counterpart, Nathalie Drouin, held talks in Delhi last week.The arrest - made on multiple firearms charges - signals a shift from Canada's previous approach.Gosal was also an accused in the case of violence at the temple in the Greater Toronto Area last year but was let off after a brief detention. Ties nosedived after the killing of Nijjar, a wanted terrorist, as former Canadian PM Justin Trudeau accused Indian agencies of masterminding it. In Oct last year, India said it was pulling out its high commissioner and five other diplomats due to Ottawa's attempt to link them to the Nijjar case. It also expelled many Canadian diplomats.Gosal came to the forefront of anti-India activities in Canada and campaigned aggressively for Khalistan referendum. Multiple instances of confrontations were reported as pro-Khalistan activists sought to get other Sikhs to sign off on their secessionist agenda.Gosal even acted as one of the personal security officers to SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannu during his visits to Canada. He was also allegedly involved in the planning of the violence at Indian consulate establishments in Canada.A few months ago, he had revealed that Canadian police had asked him to be ""careful"" against a possible hit. Canadian police had also subsequently claimed that Gosal was among the 13 citizens of the country who were targets of criminal violence aimed at pro-Khalistan elements. ""As a result of being the organiser of Khalistan referendum, I am facing an imminent threat to my life from the agents and proxies of the govt of India but I have to continue. .."" he told a Canadian new website.","Inderjit Singh Gosal took over Canada's Khalistan referendum campaign after Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court sought on Monday responses from DGCA, Aircraft Accidents Investigation Bureau and the Centre on steps taken to conduct an independent, impartial and expeditious probe into the crash of Air India's June 12 London-bound flight.The court told PIL petitioner NGO 'Safety Matters Foundation' that its demand to make public details of the flight data recorder could have serious consequences for relatives of the pilots.All passengers and crew, barring one, were killed in the crash. ""We have seen how one single sentence from the preliminary inquiry report was plucked out by western and Indian media to lay the blame on pilot error. Such selective reporting causes immense agony... Confidentiality of the investigations should be maintained till the submission of the final report,"" Justice Surya Kant said.Appearing for the NGO, Prashant Bhushan said even after more than 100 days, people do not know the exact cause of the crash, even as experts are of the opinion that electrical system failure of the Boeing aircraft cut off fuel supply to the engine. ""Releasing FDR data would enable independent experts to analyse it and help reach a logical conclusion,"" he said.The bench of Justices Surya Kant and N K Singh said selective release would enable all these experts to sit in podcasts and give their opinion, running many parallel theories. Bhushan then questioned the fairness of the investigation, saying the five-member probe team included three DGCA officers, which could also be under scrutiny for not carrying out regular safety checks on aircraft under the airlines.The NGO said, ""The preliminary report is incomplete, selective, and lacking in transparency, thereby undermining credibility of the investigative process and the trust of the travelling public. By withholding critical data, omitting safety recommendations, disregarding documented technical anomalies, and prematurely attributing blame to the pilots, the respondent has created a skewed narrative that fails to serve the preventive purpose of an air accident investigation. ""On August 8, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi had refused to entertain a petition seeking safety audit of every aircraft of Air India and rebuked the petitioner for seeking the audit of only one airline and not all airlines.""It was a very unfortunate incident.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation at 5pm on Sunday, the PMO confirmed earlier in the day.The PMO did not disclose the topic of the address.With Navratri beginning and GST reforms set to take effect from Monday, the PM's address on the eve of these events is expected to focus on the economic changes.He may also highlight his recent appeals to use ""Swadeshi"" products, promoting an 'Atmanirbhar' India in response to Donald Trump’s 50% tariff on India.Over his more than ten years in office, PM Modi has often addressed the nation to announce major decisions, from demonetisation to military operations. These speeches have served to inform citizens, explain government initiatives, and highlight major national milestones.On this day, PM Modi addressed the nation to announce the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. He said the move was aimed at tackling corruption, black money, and terrorism. The old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes were declared invalid and ceased to be legal tender immediately.Following India’s successful test of an anti-satellite missile, PM Modi praised the country in a televised address. He said, ""In the journey of every nation there are moments that bring utmost pride and have a historic impact on generations to come.One such moment is today."" The operation made India one of the few countries capable of space-based missile defence.After Parliament passed the resolution to revoke Article 370 and reorganize Jammu & Kashmir into two Union Territories, PM addressed the nation. He highlighted that the special status of Jammu & Kashmir had long been a pending promise of the BJP, and the move would bring greater integration, development, and governance to the region.PM Modi frequently addressed the nation during the pandemic:On Guru Nanak Jayanti, PM Modi addressed the nation to announce the repeal of the three contentious farm laws, following almost a year of farmers’ protests. He urged farmers to return home, saying, ""I urge farmers to return home to their families and let's start afresh.""After India’s counter-terror action in response to the Pahalgam attack, PM Modi addressed the nation after Operation Sindoor. He strongly condemned the attack, saluted the Indian Armed Forces for their valour, and said the operation was “an answer to Pakistan’s terrorism.” He dedicated the success to “every mother and sister of our country.”","Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation at 5pm on Sunday.

Companies relying on skilled or semi-skilled labor from these countries are facing delays in recruitment.



B. Remittance and economic fallout

Many workers from Bangladesh, Sudan, and Cameroon, among others, send critical remittances home to support families.

The visa suspension disrupts this income flow, impacting local economies in already vulnerable regions.



C. Tourism sector slowdown

Tour operators, airlines, and hospitality providers targeting African and South Asian tourists have had to adjust itineraries and marketing strategies.

Prospective visitors now face indefinite delays, adding uncertainty to travel planning.

In a sweeping immigration update, the United Arab Emirates has temporarily halted the issuance of tourist and work visas for citizens of nine countries spanning Africa and Asia. Though no official confirmation has been publicly released, an internal immigration circular signals a significant policy shift — one with far-reaching economic, diplomatic, and humanitarian consequences. The 2026 UAE visa ban reflects evolving concerns over security, health, and migration governance.According to a confidential immigration circular accessed by multiple outlets, the UAE has imposed a temporary suspension on new visa applications from the following countries:Citizens of these nine nations are barred from applying for both tourist visas and work permits in the UAE as of 2026. The policy remains in effect until further notice, with no announced timeline for reassessment or reversal.It's important to emphasize that this is a visa ban, not a travel ban. Nationals of the listed countries who already hold valid UAE visas are not affected and can continue residing or working in the UAE legally.While the UAE government has not released an official explanation, sources and analysts have pointed to several contributing factors behind this decision:The most cited rationale in unofficial reports is national security. The UAE has previously enacted similar measures in response to concerns about:The suspension is described by insiders as a preventive measure to shield the country from potential risks associated with fraudulent or unverified entries.Tense or complex bilateral relations between the UAE and some of the affected nations may also be influencing the visa policy. Past instances suggest that immigration policies are sometimes used to manage or reflect broader diplomatic positions.Residual COVID-19 protocols appear to remain part of the UAE’s visa review process. The pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in cross-border health management. Analysts point to concerns over:These health considerations may continue to shape immigration policy well into the post-pandemic era.The visa freeze also aligns with efforts to streamline documentation, improve identity verification, and digitize the visa process. The UAE is reportedly working to overhaul its immigration systems to reduce paperwork inconsistencies and identity fraud.The UAE’s visa ban has triggered a chain reaction across multiple sectors:Though indefinite, the UAE visa ban is not permanent. Once lifted, nationals from the listed countries will regain access to the UAE visa application process via:The standard visa requirements will then apply, including:Authorities and businesses across affected countries are awaiting further clarification from the UAE.

NEW DELHI: Days after US President announced an exorbitant fee hike in H-1B visa fees, the White House is mulling exempting for physicians from the new fees, news agency Bloomberg reported on Monday.""The Proclamation allows for potential exemptions, which can include physicians and medical residents,"" Bloomberg quoted White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers saying in an email.This comes after Trump issued a new presidential proclamation titled ""Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers"" that introduces a major overhaul to the H-1B visa programme, imposing a steep $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, raising fresh questions about whether this is a much-needed correction or a potentially crippling blow to America's tech talent pipeline.The new fee took effect came in effect on 12.01 am on September 21, 2025, prompting immigration attorneys and companies to advise H-1B holders or their families currently outside the US to return immediately or risk being stranded.The fee increase represents a massive jump from the current $2,000–5,000 range, sparking concerns over its impact on startups, small businesses, and Indian IT professionals.Earlier, the government expressed serious concern over a raise in the H-1B visa fee, calling it a potential disruption for skilled Indian professionals and their families in the United States.In an official statement, the spokesperson said the full implications are being studied, noting that Indian industry has already put out an initial analysis clarifying some perceptions related to the H-1B program.“Industry in both India and the US has a stake in innovation and creativity and can be expected to consult on the best path forward,” the statement said.It highlighted that talent mobility has contributed enormously to technology development, innovation, economic growth, competitiveness, and wealth creation in both countries.“Policymakers will therefore assess recent steps taking into account mutual benefits, which include strong people-to-people ties between the two countries,” the spokesperson added.","The White House is mulling exempting for physicians from the new fees.

NEW DELHI: Pauline Crowther Ann, an 85-year-old British woman who lived in the quaint House No. 7 on Jantar Mantar Lane, was reported dead at a city hospital on July 30. At the time, the death was attributed to a possible fall at home. A month and a half later, her autopsy report indicates that she actually died of strangulation, leaving the high-profile neighbourhood in shock. Delhi Police has filed a case of murder based on the postmortem report at the Connaught Place police station. The investigators led by Devesh Mahla, DCP (New Delhi), have drawn a blank till now. The British High Commission has been informed about the death of the elderly woman.Delhi Police have requested the formation of a medical board to analyse the autopsy report and conduct further investigation even as the forensic analysis of the viscera, etc., is awaited.According to police, the deceased, Pauline Crowther Ann, was discovered unconscious by her housemaid. She alerted other family members, among them Ann’s son, his wife and their child. The cops who visited the spot said there was some blood at the spot and it was surmised that she had died after falling down.The last rites were conducted and the family also held a prayer meeting on Aug 10. None of Ann’s relatives had felt or expressed anything suspicious in the case.When contacted by TOI, the family refused to comment. “The cops are probing the case,” said a family member.After interviews with the family, police learnt that the deceased frequently travelled between the UK and India after the death of her husband, an Indian national. “She had been in Delhi for the past onetwo months. On the day of the incident, she was found unconscious in her room. We received a phone call from her relatives,” said a police officer.Police are trying to determine the motive for Ann’s murder and are scrutinising her acquaintances to ascertain if someone known to her carried out the crime. The entry to the house does not make it impossible for someone to enter without being noticed.The front portion has an office of a political party and sees a lot of movement. The cops, however, said that the possibility of an outsider committing the crime was bleak because there were no signs of a forced entry. CCTV footage is being scrutinised.","Pauline Crowther Ann, 85, was reported dead at a city hospital on July 30. At the time, the death was attributed to a possible fall at home.

Short-term pain, long-term reset





NEW DELHI: Indian IT companies are preparing to cushion the impact of the US administration’s steep hike in H-1B visa fees, with analysts saying the blow, while sharp, is unlikely to be fatal for the sector.On September 19, President Donald Trump signed an executive order raising the fee for new H-1B applications to $100,000, a staggering jump from the current $1,500. The move is expected to squeeze firms that rely on sending tech talent to the US, though many have already reduced their dependence on such visas.A report by Nuvama said most Indian IT companies are unlikely to pay the new fee. With median H-1B salaries in the $80,000–120,000 range, adding another $100,000 would make these roles uneconomical.Instead, companies are expected to pivot. “We believe Indian IT companies shall mitigate this impact by higher nearshoring/offshoring and/or hiring local talent,” the report noted.Analysts expect multiple workarounds:While near-term financial and operational pressure is unavoidable, Nuvama predicts the sector will eventually absorb the shock. “Over the medium to long term, the situation is likely to stabilise as the sector companies discover more ways to do business efficiently,” the report said.The executive order, however, signals a tougher environment ahead for Indian IT, which will now need to rethink its staffing models even more aggressively.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order raising the fee for new H-1B applications to $100,000.

MUMBAI: A private jet carrying passengers from Ahmedabad quietly scripted aviation history this weekend, becoming the first aircraft to officially land at the long-awaited Navi Mumbai airport.The jet, operating under a Non-Scheduled Operator Permit (charter), touched down at 10:20am on Saturday and flew back to Ahmedabad past noon the next day, completing the first-ever runway operation at the greenfield airport.Though an IndiGo Airbus 320 aircraft landed on the Navi Mumbai main runway 26 in Dec 2024, it was a validation flight mandated to test the airport's navigation systems.Prior to this, a symbolic touchdown took place in October, when an IAF Airbus C-295, a tactical airlifter, touched down on the main runway without using the airport's ground-based navigation aids.""The Airports Authority of India (AAI) on September 19 granted approval for the landing of a non-scheduled aircraft, marked 'passengers flight' at Navi Mumbai,"" said a source.To accommodate this arrival and departure, AAI cancelled its earlier notice (NOTAM to pilots, airlines) about Navi Mumbai runway's closure till 11:59pm, Sept 20.A new NOTAM was issued on Friday, which announced that the Navi Mumbai airport runway was open from 8:30am to 11am on Saturday and another three hours on Sunday.The private jet, a Pilatus PC-24 (VT-APV), took off from Ahmedabad at 9am to head south, overfly the Gulf of Khambhat, and then the Arabian Sea, from where it turned east to cross into Mumbai over Bandra and Sion, flying south of the busy city airport.It came south of the new Navi Mumbai airport, from where it turned north and then west to carry out an approach on runway 28 and land at 10:20 am. It departed Navi Mumbai airport at 12:40am on Sunday and took the land route to Ahmedabad.Over the weekend, the flight also landed on X, with @hiravaero posting a clip of the landing captured by Sandeep Pilania, a plane spotter. Industry experts pointed out that the new Navi Mumbai airport has other firsts still to come. The most awaited among these will be the first scheduled commercial airline flight.While PM Modi is set to inaugurate the airport and its terminal building on September 30, the commissioning of the airport, after the security sweeping and other procedures, is likely to take a few more months.But the landing or take-off of the first airline flight carrying fare-paying passengers will be the most significant milestone, as it would signal the start of a major capacity boost for Mumbai's overstretched airport infrastructure.","The jet, operating under a Non-Scheduled Operator Permit (charter), touched down at 10:20am on Saturday and flew back to Ahmedabad past noon the next day.

Support for skilled immigration

Criticism of the system



The $100,000 visa fee controversy





Elon Musk’s position on the H-1B visa programme reflects a complex interplay of personal experience, corporate imperatives, and public statements that often appear contradictory. Musk himself entered the United States on an H-1B visa, a fact he credits with enabling his entrepreneurial journey and the growth of companies such as Tesla and SpaceX. While he openly praises the programme for attracting critical talent from across the globe, he has also criticised its systemic flaws, calling it “broken” and advocating for reforms such as higher salary thresholds and additional regulatory fees. The recent hike of H-1B visa fees to $100,000 has brought renewed scrutiny to Musk’s nuanced stance, highlighting the tension between supporting skilled immigration and addressing perceived inefficiencies within the system.Elon Musk’s own experience as an H-1B visa holder provides him with a unique perspective on the programme. He has frequently emphasised that the visa enabled him to work legally in the United States and to build his companies with access to top-tier talent.Musk often cites the role of H-1B holders in helping scale Tesla, SpaceX, and other ventures, pointing to engineers and executives who were instrumental in advancing technology, production, and innovation. His personal journey illustrates the potential benefits of skilled immigration, while simultaneously informing his calls for reform. Musk’s dual perspective as a former visa holder and CEO of high-tech enterprises makes his stance particularly influential in ongoing debates about immigration policy.Despite his criticism of certain aspects of the H-1B system, Musk remains a staunch advocate for attracting skilled international talent. He credits the programme with helping to fill critical gaps in sectors such as engineering, software development, and aerospace design, where domestic talent alone may not be sufficient to meet demand. Musk’s companies have relied on H-1B holders to maintain competitiveness in the global market, innovate at pace, and support large-scale production and research projects. His support underscores the broader economic argument that skilled immigration is essential for maintaining the United States’ leadership in high-tech industries and sustaining long-term innovation.At the same time, Musk has repeatedly criticised the H-1B programme for allowing potential misuse and creating incentives that may disadvantage domestic workers. He has argued that low salary thresholds and insufficient regulatory oversight can lead to exploitation of foreign labour and reduced opportunities for American employees. Musk has proposed reforms including significantly higher minimum salaries for visa holders and annual maintenance fees, which he believes would ensure that the programme genuinely serves highly skilled professionals rather than providing a cost-saving mechanism for companies. His critique highlights the tension between maintaining access to critical talent and protecting domestic labour markets.The recent U.S. government decision to increase H-1B visa fees to $100,000 has reignited debate about the programme’s affordability and accessibility. For companies reliant on foreign talent, including many of Musk’s ventures, the fee represents a substantial increase in operational costs. The policy has prompted questions about whether smaller companies and startups might struggle to compete for skilled workers, potentially slowing innovation. Musk’s nuanced stance demonstrates the balancing act between advocating for the continued flow of skilled international talent and supporting regulatory measures designed to address system abuses and ensure fairness.Elon Musk’s approach to the H-1B visa programme illustrates the inherent tension between personal experience, corporate requirements, and systemic reform. As a former H-1B holder, he recognises the immense value of skilled immigration in fostering innovation and economic growth. Simultaneously, his critiques and reform proposals reflect a desire to make the system fairer, more accountable, and sustainable for both foreign talent and domestic labour markets. Musk’s unique position as an entrepreneur, former visa holder, and public commentator places him at the centre of one of the most contentious debates in U.S. immigration policy.","Elon Musk’s position on the H-1B visa programme reflects a complex interplay of personal experience, corporate imperatives, and public statements that often appear contradictory.

Goldman Sachs has given new advice to workers with H1-B visas. This comes after President Donald Trump announced that companies must now pay $100,000 every year for each foreign worker on an H1-B visa. The new rule has forced big tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to tell their visa workers to stay in America or come back before Sunday's deadline. Banks like JPMorgan have given the same warning. Goldman Sachs, which is the world's biggest investment bank, has told its H1-B workers to contact Fragomen if they have questions.

This new fee is expected to disproportionately affect Indian nationals, who receive the majority of H-1B visas.

“The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.

Take a big step back and FUCK YOURSELF in the face. I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,”

Why it matters now





The recent H-1B visa fees hike announced by US President Donald Trump created an atmosphere of chaos. The massive hike in the H-1B visa fees rattled the tech industry. Many of the tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Amazon asked the professionals on H-1B visa to return to the US by September 21. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. Many on the popular beneficiaries of the visa system have not yet voiced their opinion on this new change. However, amidst this visa fee hike an old post of Tesla CEO Elon Musk has surfaced online. In the post being shared online Musk can be seen speaking in favour of the H-1B visa system.In a fiery exchange on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Musk has credited the visa program for allowing his journey and also for powering America’s tech dominance.Musk wrote.Musk also went ahead and vowed to ‘go to war’ in order to defend the system against its critics. He argued that the skilled immigrants were important to US innovation and competitiveness.wrote Elon Musk.The resurfacing of this old post by Elon Musk comes at a crucial time for Indian professionals in the US, who make up nearly three-quarters of H-1B recipients. With the new $100,000 fee, the economics of hiring foreign talent have been upended, sparking fears of layoffs, relocations, and a potential reverse migration back to India.Musk’s past words — contrasting with his more recent criticisms of the program as “broken” — highlight the tensions between business needs, political rhetoric, and immigration realities.","The recent H-1B visa fees hike announced by US President Donald Trump created an atmosphere of chaos.

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus is facing mounting pressure after a 13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and caused 600 triple-zero calls to fail across multiple states. The September 19 network failure has prompted government investigations and renewed calls for accountability from the embattled telco.The outage primarily affected South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory, with some impact also recorded in far western New South Wales near the SA border, according to Reuters reporting. CEO Stephen Rue confirmed that established processes were not followed during a network firewall upgrade that began at 12:30 AM Thursday and lasted until approximately 1:30 PM (local time).Four deaths have been linked to the incident, though South Australian police later clarified that an eight-week-old boy's death in Gawler West was ""unlikely"" to have been caused by the outage delay. A 68-year-old Adelaide woman and two men aged 74 and 49 in Perth remain connected to the emergency services failure.The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) reported that Optus received multiple customer complaints about the triple-zero failure as early as 9 AM Thursday, with five customers contacting the call center about the outage.However, these concerns were not properly escalated, and government authorities weren't informed until after the issue was resolved.Communications Minister Anika Wells expressed ""unbelievable disappointment"" that Australia was ""here again so quickly,"" referencing a similar 2023 incident. The Australian Media and Communications Authority (ACMA) chair Nerida O'Loughlin revealed her agency wasn't notified until more than 10 hours after the outage began, contrary to standard protocols.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years. The company was fined A$12 million in 2023 for failing to provide emergency call services to thousands during a nationwide outage and subsequently failing to conduct required welfare checks.The telecommunications giant, owned by Singapore Telecommunications, has faced a series of crises including a 2022 cyberattack affecting 9.5 million Australians and the 2023 outage that led to former CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin's resignation. Current CEO Stephen Rue took over in November 2024.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking from New York, declined to say whether Rue should resign but indicated the government has ""action at its disposal"" pending investigation results. ACMA has launched a formal investigation, with Optus potentially facing fines exceeding $10 million and additional penalties.The company has promised full cooperation with all investigations while conducting its own internal review, with results to be made public.",13-hour emergency services outage led to four deaths and 600 triple-zero calls to fail.

Impact of H-1B fee hike on US tech and economy





The H-1B visa, introduced by the United States in 1990, has long been a pathway for highly skilled professionals from across the globe to contribute to America’s technology sector. Many of today’s tech leaders, including Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella, entered the US through this programme, allowing them to innovate, lead companies, and create global impact. These visas have been instrumental in building Silicon Valley and advancing AI, cloud computing, and consumer technology. With the recent $100,000 fee imposed on new H-1B applicants, it’s more important than ever to recognise the pivotal role these H-1B holders have played in shaping the US tech ecosystem.Musk initially entered the US on a J-1 exchange visa and later obtained an H-1B to pursue academic training and business ventures. He has been central to the success of SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, and X Corp, employing thousands of engineers and professionals globally. Musk credits the H-1B programme for enabling him and other highly talented individuals to create groundbreaking technologies, from reusable rockets to mass-market electric vehicles.His advocacy for skilled immigration highlights the importance of global talent in driving innovation and maintaining America’s leadership in tech.Pichai came to the US as an international student before transitioning to an H-1B visa, which allowed him to join Google in product management roles. Over the years, he rose to become CEO of Alphabet, overseeing key innovations in AI, Google Cloud, and hardware like Pixel phones and Nest devices. Pichai’s leadership has guided Google through major technological shifts, expanding AI research, cloud services, and consumer applications, positioning Google as a global technology leader.Nadella moved to the US in the early 1990s and obtained an H-1B visa to work at Microsoft. Rising through the ranks, he became CEO in 2014, leading Microsoft’s transformation through cloud computing, AI, and enterprise solutions. Nadella emphasises the critical role of skilled immigrants in fostering innovation and growth, highlighting that many of Microsoft’s most transformative projects have been driven by talent brought to the US through H-1B.Srinivas arrived in the US as a student and leveraged his H-1B visa to work in AI research. He later founded Perplexity AI, a company valued at $9 billion, offering cutting-edge AI solutions globally. His journey highlights the link between skilled immigration and leadership in next-generation technology.Yuan, a Chinese immigrant, faced multiple visa rejections before securing his H-1B to enter the US. He founded Zoom, which became an essential tool for global communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting millions of remote workers, schools, and enterprises. Yuan’s story demonstrates how H-1B visas enable entrepreneurs to build companies that have a global impact.Bansal came to the US on an H-1B visa in 2000 and founded AppDynamics, a software monitoring company. AppDynamics grew rapidly and was acquired for $3.7 billion, creating significant employment opportunities and boosting the tech ecosystem. Bansal’s entrepreneurial success underscores the value H-1B holders bring to innovation and economic growth.H-1B holders have been vital in founding, running, and scaling technology companies, filling high-skilled roles, driving innovation, and creating trillions in market value. Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Indian-origin firms like TCS rely on these visas to access global talent that fuels growth and competitiveness in the tech industry. These skilled professionals are often the backbone of innovation hubs and help maintain the US’s global leadership in technology. Their contributions extend beyond tech, impacting research, education, and economic growth nationwide.The recent $100,000 fee for new H-1B applications has caused global concern, with tech leaders warning that such measures could limit access to skilled talent and slow innovation. Despite these hurdles, H-1B holders continue to demonstrate their vital role in shaping America’s technology landscape, proving that skilled immigrants remain essential to the country’s innovation and economic strength.","The H-1B visa, introduced by the United States in 1990, has long been a pathway for highly skilled professionals from across the globe.

US government to shutdown by September 30? White House blames Democrats; Donald Trump calls for a chat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-government-to-shutdown-by-september-30-white-house-blames-democrats-donald-trump-calls-for-a-chat/articleshow/124060304.cms,"Trump's talk-it-out move



'Radical Left insanity'



Why are Dems' demands?







With just days remaining before the fiscal year ends on September 30, the US government faces the looming threat of a shutdown. Donald Trump is set to meet with Democratic leaders on Thursday, who are pushing to preserve key healthcare programs as part of any funding deal before the deadline.The White House has already pointed fingers at Democrats, while Trump aims to chat to avert a crisis. ""Democrats are to be blamed if the US government shuts down,"" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.The US president agreed to meet Sen Chuck Schumer and Rep Hakeem Jeffries, however, he expressed no hopes from the meeting.“I’d love to meet with them, but I don’t think it’s going to have any impact,” AP quoted Trump saying.Trump and congressional leaders have a narrow window to begin negotiations as the government approaches a critical funding deadline, with federal money set to run out at the end of the fiscal year on Tuesday, September 30.Congress remains deadlocked, failing to pass funding legislation to keep the government running. A House-approved Republican plan to fund the government into November failed in the Senate, while a Democratic proposal to increase healthcare funding also did not pass.In a statement on Tuesday, White House categorically called out the Democrats threatening a shutdown over what it called a ""radical Left insanity.""""Radical Left Democrats are barreling the country toward a government shutdown if they don’t get their ~$1.5 trillion wish list of demands,"" it said in a statement.""The party of open borders, violent crime, and transgender for everybody is now jeopardizing military pay, critical care for veterans, firefighter pay, disaster relief funding, and many more programs on which Americans rely — while President Donald J Trump and Republicans are committed to keeping the government open with a clean funding extension,"" it added.Democrats are blocking the funding bill because they want to protect key healthcare programs. Their proposal seeks to extend enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year and reverse Medicaid cuts included in earlier Republican tax and spending legislation.Republicans consider reversing the Medicaid cuts unacceptable, although they are open to discussing the health insurance subsidies later, creating the current impasse.","The US government faces the looming threat of a shutdown on September 30.

Mixed signals from Federal Reserve



Currency and commodity markets







Asian share markets looked set to extend recent gains on Tuesday, driven by strong investor optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) and tech stocks, while bets on further US interest rate cuts pushed gold to fresh record levels.Wall Street had reached another record after Nvidia announced it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, with the first data centre equipment expected in the second half of 2026.""With US tech/AI currently in red-hot form, we'd need to see something leftfield to derail the upbeat flows that are the driving force of Oracle, Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, and some of the US hardware plays,"" said Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone, as quoted by Reuters.Weston noted that the seemingly inexorable rise in tech has been attracting money from momentum funds and options traders, becoming almost self-fulfilling. Investors are also hedging their exposure to equities by buying gold, which hit a fresh record of $3,755.47 per ounce, up nearly 9% so far this month.The tech rally has boosted chip sectors across Asia. South Korean stocks rose 0.2%, having surged almost 9% this month, while Taiwan climbed nearly 7%.Japan’s Nikkei was closed for a holiday but has risen 6.5% in September. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3%, up 5.5% for the month. Chinese blue chips edged up 0.1%.European equities have generally lagged behind the tech surge. EUROSTOXX 50 futures gained 0.1%, FTSE futures rose 0.1%, and DAX futures added 0.2%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were largely unchanged after reaching new peaks overnight.Equities globally have been underpinned by expectations of further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve following last week's easing. Futures indicate roughly a 90% chance of a quarter-point cut in October and a 75% probability of another cut in December.Markets remain dovish despite mixed messaging from the Fed. Speaking on Monday, new Fed Governor Stephen Miran, handpicked by US President Donald Trump, argued for sharply lower rates, while three colleagues stressed the need for caution on inflation. Fed chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak later Tuesday on the economic outlook and policy.Treasuries have also been supported by expectations of lower short-term rates, even as markets brace for a large government and corporate debt issuance this week: $69 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday, followed by $70 billion in five-year notes and $44 billion in seven-year paper. Investors are also watching the September 30 US government funding deadline.In currencies, the dollar eased after three consecutive sessions of gains. The euro remained steady at $1.1809, rebounding from a $1.1726 low on Monday, while the dollar slipped to 147.68 yen from a high of 148.37. Sweden’s crown held at 9.3497 per dollar ahead of a central bank meeting, where futures imply about a one-in-three chance of a rate cut.Oil prices were restrained as concerns of oversupply outweighed geopolitical tensions in Russia and the Middle East.

‘Important for CFO forums to become strategic platforms’





India is navigating fresh uncertainty after the U.S. recently raised tariffs on Indian goods from 25% to 50%. While the immediate impact of this hike hits key export sectors, industry leaders say the move underscores the need for resilience and strategic adaptation for India when it comes to global trade.Shreyas Kumar M, Group CFO & DTO, Narayana Nethralaya Eye Hospital, says, “The tariff seems to be more of a pressurising tactic to push a more favourable Free Trade Agreement between the two nations, which is clearly understood by the Indian authorities.” He added that sufficient front-loading of export goods has already been done and he is hopeful that, by the time they are consumed, normalcy will have returned.“The jump in tariffs from 25% to 50% forces Indian businesses to rethink export strategies and cost structures. It’s a short-term setback but a long-term opportunity—what looks like a challenge today could spark a stronger global trade position tomorrow,” said Gautam Sharma, Group CFO, Brainbees Solutions Ltd. “This move is also a reminder of the importance of Atma Nirbhar Bharat—building self-reliance, strengthening domestic manufacturing, and creating global-quality products.For CFOs, it means managing today’s risks while investing in the resilience that will keep Indian businesses future-ready, whatever global trade rules bring,” he added.Sandeep V Dandekar, Author, Mentor and Data Centre Industry Expert, echoed the sentiment, stressing the need for honest decision-making in such testing times.“We need to cut through the clutter, politics, and optics, and focus on India’s SWOT in this situation—making both tough and soft decisions. Soft, to help affected sectors survive the jolts, and tough, to courageously address weaknesses and threats while maximising our strengths and opportunities,” he said, adding, “It won’t be easy, but countries that have emerged stronger did so by handling such challenges well. India has the potential to turn this downside into a sustainable upside and, a few years from now, look back on it as a blessing in disguise”Nrupesh Mastakar, Global Head of Controlling Capability Centers, Hitachi Energy, pointed out how the situation could accelerate India’s domestic momentum. He said, ““The US tariff war has pushed Indian engineering companies to focus more on the domestic market. This shift is supported by the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which streamlines the tax system, lowers costs, and makes local manufacturing more competitive. As a result, domestic consumption is rising, giving a significant boost to the ‘Make in India’ movement.”Razum Rajan, Group Managing Director of Competitors View, emphasises the importance of executive dialogue during such turbulent times. “Forums like the CFO Story Club play a crucial role in providing these spaces,” he said, highlighting the upcoming CFO Story Club event in Mumbai on September 25 as an example. “With so much at stake, CFOs and decision-makers need platforms where they can have meaningful discussions on global disruptions. At the CFO Story Club, we consistently see strong engagement on issues such as tariff wars, currency risk, and trade diversification—because navigating the future effectively requires smarter, collaborative thinking,” he added.","India is navigating fresh uncertainty after the U.S. recently raised tariffs on Indian goods from 25% to 50%.
