"In counter to Yunus's remark, PM Modi says Northeast integral to Bimstec",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-counter-to-yunuss-remark-pm-modi-says-northeast-integral-to-bimstec/articleshow/119956816.cms,"Modi to meet Yunus today, claim top Bangladesh officials

As he departed for Thailand to participate in the 6th Bimstec summit, PM Narendra Modi asserted India's Northeast lies at the heart of the inter-regional group, underlining the primacy of the northeastern states in the region, days after Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said in China the ""7 sisters"" are landlocked with no way of reaching the ocean. Modi's remark came ahead of a likely bilateral meeting between the two on Friday on the summit's margins.Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.Modi was seated between Yunus and Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli. An Indian govt source speaking on condition of anonymity said the meeting, as sought by Dhaka, is ""in the works"". Senior officials in Dhaka were quoted as saying that the leaders would meet on Friday afternoon, shortly after the Bimstec summit. The meeting, if it happens, would be the first between the leaders since the interim govt took charge in Bangladesh in Aug 2025.Separately, in a Bimstec ministerial, Jaishankar said that the North-East had emerged as a connectivity hub for the Bimstec and the completion of the India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway will connect the region all the way to the Pacific Ocean. This, he said, would be a veritable game-changer.Yunus's office had clarified on Wednesday that his remarks about India's North-East had been made with ""honest intentions"" but were interpreted wrongly. The fact that he was speaking in China, while inviting Beijing to take advantage of Bangladesh's geographical location, raised eyebrows in India.Modi had last week written to Yunus on Bangladesh National Day, extending his felicitations and underlining the significance of working together on the basis of mutual sensitivity to each other's interests and concerns. India also remains concerned about the law-and-order situation in Bangladesh, and the threat to minorities amid increasing radicalisation in the country.According to govt sources, bilateral meetings are likely also with Nepal PM K P Sharma Oli and Myanmar junta chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who is undertaking a rare visit abroad amid the civil war in the country for Bimstec.In his departure statement, Modi also said that Bimstec has emerged as a significant forum for promoting regional development, connectivity and economic progress in the Bay of Bengal region. ""I look forward to meeting the leaders of the Bimstec countries and engaging productively to further strengthen our collaboration with the interest of our people in mind,"" said Modi.Bimstec or the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation is an inter-regional grouping comprising five South Asian countries and two Asean states, lying in the littoral and adjacent areas of the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh will take over as the chair of Bimstec at the Bangkok summit.At the last summit in Colombo in 2022, the leaders adopted the Bimstec Charter, completing its transition from a grouping to a regional organisation. With Saarc now non-functional because of the lack of any diplomatic engagement between India and Pakistan, the Indian govt has pushed Bimstec as an alternative for regional trade, connectivity and security. Addressing the Colombo summit, Modi had also called for expediti ng ongoing talks for a Bimstec free trade agreement (FTA) that would enhance mutual trade.The PM will also visit Sri Lanka from Bangkok. ""This follows the highly successful visit of President Dissanayaka to India last Dec. We will have the opportunity to review progress made on the joint vision of fostering partnerships for a shared future and provide further guidance to realise our shared objectives,"" he said in his departure statement.","Modi and Yunus came face to face for the first time at the dinner hosted by Thailand PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra.

NEW DELHI: SC on Friday agreed to examine the contrasting arguments of Hindu and Muslim sides on applicability of the Places of Worship Act , 1991, which freezes the religious character of structures as it existed on Aug 15, 1947, to Mathura's Shahi Idgah-Srikrishna Janmasthan , protected under the ASI Act.The Muslim side said Allahabad HC's decision to club all 15 suits filed by Hindu sides, claiming right of worship over the entire disputed land, was wrong and went against the provisions of the PoW (Special Provisions) Act, 1991.The bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan, said HC's decision to bunch the suits filed by Hindu sides ""prima facie appears to be correct"", a reiteration of the view it had taken during the hearing on Jan 10.The Muslim side was represented by advocate Tasneem Ahmadi. Ahmadi said the PoW (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 barred high court from entertaining any suit that intended to change the religious character of the structure to one other than what it was on Aug 15, 1947. For the Hindu side, advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain said since the Idgah was a protected monument under ASI Act, it would not come under the ambit of PoW Act. When Ahmadi protested Jain's stand, the bench said, ""If you take defence under the 1991 Act, they are entitled to counter it by arguing the Act is not applicable to the structure.""The bench said that it had on Dec 12 barred courts from passing any interim order in suits relating to temple-mosque disputes and asked courts not to entertain any fresh suit for reclamation of temples which were converted into mosques during Islamic rule, including disputes relating to Varanasi's Gyanvapi-Kashi Viswanath and Mathura's Shahi Idgah-Srikrishna Janmasthan. The bench on Dec 12 also directed, ""In pending suits, trial courts will not pass any effective and final order including orders for survey till the next date of hearing.""Allahabad HC had on Aug 1 last year ruled that suits were not barred by any provisions of Waqf Act, PoW Act, Specific Relief Act, Limitation Act or Civil Procedure Code.

India urges BRICS nations to unite on mobilising $1.3 trillion annually to achieve climate action goals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-urges-brics-nations-to-unite-on-mobilising-1-3-trillion-annually-to-achieve-climate-action-goals/articleshow/119952936.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday called on the BRICS group of nations to unite on the 'Baku to Belem Roadmap' to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 for achieving climate action goals. The group, which earlier comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, now has 11 countries as its members, collectively negotiating for climate governance at multilateral forums, including the UN climate conference.India pitched for a collaborative approach to achieve the climate action goals—nationally determined contributions—at the 11th BRICS Environment Ministers’ Meeting in Brasilia, Brazil. The 30th session of the UN climate conference (COP30) will be held in Belem, Brazil, in November.Articulating the country’s stand, the Indian team led by Amandeep Garg, Additional Secretary in the Environment Ministry, urged the BRICS partners to strengthen climate financing mechanisms to meet global sustainability commitments effectively. They highlighted the urgent need for developed nations to fulfil their commitments, noting that the proposed $300 billion per year by 2035 under the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance is far below the required $1.3 trillion.With BRICS nations facing common environmental challenges such as desertification, pollution, and biodiversity loss, India stressed the importance of collective action and shared responsibility. The country also reiterated its leadership in conservation and sustainability, mentioning initiatives such as the International Big Cat Alliance, a global effort for wildlife conservation.Reaffirming its commitment to working collaboratively with BRICS partners to drive transformative change in climate action, environmental cooperation, and sustainable development , India, during its participation, urged all 11 nations to join global sustainability initiatives like the International Solar Alliance, Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT), and Global Biofuel Alliance to accelerate collective climate action.BRICS nations collectively account for 47% of the world’s population and contribute 36% of global GDP. Six countries that joined the group in the past year include Egypt, Ethiopia, UAE, Iran, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia.On energy security, India reiterated commitments made in the BRICS New Delhi Declaration (2021), which promotes a diversified energy mix, including fossil fuels, hydrogen, nuclear, and renewables.“A Just Transition must acknowledge the diverse economic realities of nations. Each country has a unique development pathway, and the provision of adequate means of implementation—in finance, technology, and capacity-building—is essential to ensuring that no nation or community is left behind in this transition. As BRICS nations, we must strengthen our engagements in multilateral forums, championing the interests of developing economies and advocating for a fair and equitable transition,” said India’s statement issued at the meeting.","India called on the BRICS group of nations to unite on the 'Baku to Belem Roadmap' to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 for achieving climate action goals.

Annamalai says not in race for Tamil Nadu chief post: Is BJP setting stage for AIADMK tie-up?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/annamalai-says-not-in-race-for-tamil-nadu-chief-post-is-bjp-setting-stage-for-aiadmk-tie-up/articleshow/119987341.cms,"Annamalai and Edappadi K Palaniswami, Union home minister Amit Shah (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Has the BJP signalled a shift in its politics in Tamil Nadu? State BJP president K Annamalai , whose aggressive brand of politics helped popularise the lotus in Tamil Nadu, on Friday said he was not in the race for the post of the next state unit chief.""I am not in the race for the post of the new state president. I am not ready for any quarrel (related to the next chief and whether he has any preference for any particular leader) and I am not in the race,"" Annamalai said when asked about the issue.Annamalai's announcement, which comes days after AIADMK general secretary and Tamil Nadu leader of opposition Edappadi K Palaniswami ( EPS ) met Union home minister Amit Shah, gives credence to reports that the BJP may be exploring an alliance with its former partner for the assembly elections in the state due next year.Amit Shah-EPS meeting last month sparked intense political speculation about a possible revival of the AIADMK-BJP alliance in the state. However, reports claimed that AIADMK had put Annamalai's ouster as state party chief a precondition for any possible tie-up.The AIADMK and BJP were alliance partners in the 2021 state elections, during which the saffron party won four seats. However, the relationship between the two parties suffered after Annamalai made a controversial reference to late AIADMK supremo and former chief minister J Jayalalithaa's conviction in a corruption case.Senior AIADMK leaders accused Annamalai of disrespecting the alliance's spirit and failing to recognise the AIADMK's leadership within the state coalition.In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the two parties fought separately, forming independent alliances and both suffered in the process as the DMK-led coalition swept all seats in Tamil Nadu.With chief minister M K Stalin already in election mode for the assembly polls next year, perhaps both the BJP and the AIADMK realise the importance of coming together. EPS has announced that for his party the DMK was the ""sole enemy"" and he was ready to join hands with any like-minded party for an alliance.However, the big question is: Can AIADMK treat BJP as like-minded party given the issues that the saffron party has pushed for in the recent past - the three-language formula, the Waqf Bill. Will the AIADMK gain from this alliance? Also, will this tieup take away from the BJP all the gains it had made in the last few years under Annamalai who projected BJP as an alternative to the state parties?Political analysts feel that BJP's stand on the three-language formula and the passage of the Waqf Bill may make the AIADMK nervous about the possible electoral fallout.""The BJP's agenda on delimitation, Neet, language policy, Waqf Bill makes the saffron party a difficult partner in Tamil Nadu for any regional party, says Vijaya Sankar, senior journalist and political analyst.He feels the BJP and AIADMK will have to woo other parties and make a grand coalition if it wants to challenge the DMK-led front, which, according to him has already got a head-start thanks to some smart moves made by chief minister M K Stalin.""All existing political players would be keenly watching the moves of actor-turned-politician Vijay. He is the unknown factor in the next elections and it remains to be seen who suffers due to his presence in the political arena,"" says Vijaya Sankar.Elections in Tamil Nadu are still a year away. The BJP may have to tone down the issues it has been raking up in the state if it wants a coalition. But one thing is certain, if the BJP-AIADMK coalition indeed happens, Annamalai will perhaps be the biggest loser.",State BJP president K Annamalai said he was not in the race for the post of the next state unit chief. His announcement comes days after AIADMK general secretary and Tamil Nadu leader of opposition Edappadi K Palaniswami ( EPS ) met Union home minister Amit Shah.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119988284,imgsize-1097978,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-25.jpg"

Poll Do you think the Waqf Amendment Bill will positively impact the community? No Yes

NEW DELHI: The leaders of Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal United or JD(U) went on a resigning spree over their disagreement with the party's support for the passage of the contentious Waqf Amendment Bill in the Parliament.Not one or two but at least five leaders submitted their resignations as the bill was passed, first in Lok Sabha and then the Rajya Sabha on Thursday and Friday, respectively.The latest to resign from the party was Nadeem Akhtar, his resignation follows that of four other leaders, including JD(U) leader Raju Nayyar, Tabrez Siddiqui Alig, Mohammad Shahnawaz Malik, and Mohammed Kasim Ansari.While Nadeem, Raju, and Tabrez resigned on Friday, Shahnawaz and Mohammaed Kasim Ansari submitted their resignation on Thursday.Raju Nayyar wrote in his resignation, ""I resign from JD(U) after the Waqf Amendment Bill is passed and supported in the Lok Sabha.""He went on to express his deep disappointment with the party, stating, ""I am deeply hurt by the JD(U) voting in favour of this black law, which oppresses Muslims.""""I resign from the post of former state secretary of JD(U) youth and primary membership of the party. I request to send a letter to the Honorable CM Nitish Kumar and relieve me from all responsibilities,"" he added.Meanwhile, Independent MP from Purnia, Pappu Yadav, claimed that the Bihar chief minister and the JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar was not in a good mental state and that he was no longer in control of his party. ""Nitish Kumar ji's mental state is not very good at present. In his party, 90 per cent of the leaders are against SC/ST but aligned to the BJP. After 5 PM on the day voting takes place in Bihar, the BJP will no longer need Nitish Kumar.. JD(U) is not in the hands of Nitish ji now,"" Yadav said while talking to the news agency ANI.In a letter to JDU national president and Bihar chief minister, Tabrez Siddiqui Alig conveyed strong disappointment, accusing the party of ""betraying the trust of the Muslim community.""Meanwhile, Shahnawaz Malik wrote in his letter, ""Millions of Indian Muslims like us firmly believed that you stood for a truly secular ideology. That belief now stands shattered.""“Millions of Indian Muslims like us had unwavering faith that you are the flag bearer of a purely secular ideology. But now, this belief has been shattered. Millions of dedicated Indian Muslims and activists like us are deeply shocked by JDU's stand regarding the Waqf Bill Amendment Act 2024,” reads the letter written by Shah Nawaz Malik.Moreover, Ansari wrote that the Waqf Bill was “against Indian Muslims” and could not be accepted “under any circumstances.”“This bill violates many fundamental rights of the Constitution. Through this bill, Indian Muslims are being humiliated and insulted. Neither you nor your party realises this. I regret that I gave many years of my life to the party,” he wrote.However, JD(U) national spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad responded to Ansari and Malik's resignations, saying that neither Ansari, from East Champaran, nor Malik, from Jamui, were officially part of the party.Ansari, in a letter shared on social media, identified himself as the medical cell president of JD(U) in East Champaran and claimed he was a candidate from the Dhaka assembly seat. However, JD(U) did not contest that seat in the 2020 elections. The Dhaka seat was won by BJP’s Pawan Jaiswal, a JD(U) ally.Speaking to the news agency PTI, Prasad said, ""I wonder what to say about things. I have been associated with the party for a long time. I say with full responsibility that neither person has been a part of our rank and file.""He also said, ""We admit that some genuine members of our party, like national general secretary Ghulam Rasool Baliyawi, are not very happy with the passage of the Bill. Their grievances will be dealt with at the appropriate level. But those who are coming up with the claim of resignation from the party were never members in the first place.""Earlier on Thursday, Baliyawi and Syed Afzal Abbas, who heads the Bihar Shia Waqf Board, also shared concerns about the Bill. They said that several suggestions made by Muslim leaders during meetings with the Joint Parliamentary Committee were not included. However, they did not criticise the party’s support for the Bill.Parliament approved the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025 in the early hours of Friday after a detailed discussion in the Rajya Sabha. The Bill passed in the Rajya Sabha with 128 members voting in favour and 95 against. It had been earlier cleared in the Lok Sabha, where 288 MPs supported it and 232 voted against the bill.The Waqf Bill issue is expected to remain active in Bihar until the state assembly elections later this year.Recently, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) held a protest in Patna, asking Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and NDA allies like Chirag Paswan to stop the Bill.Nitish Kumar has said he follows the ideas of Jayaprakash Narayan and Ram Manohar Lohia and often talks about his record on supporting secular values, even while being a BJP ally since the 1990s.At a recent event also attended by Union home minister Amit Shah, he mentioned his government’s work for minorities and criticised the RJD, which was in power for 15 years, for failing to prevent Hindu-Muslim clashes despite getting Muslim votes.The RJD, Congress, and Left parties are expected to raise the Waqf Bill issue during the election campaign to criticise the JD(U) and try to gain the support of Muslim voters for the Mahagathbandhan alliance.","Leaders of Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal United or JD(U) went on a resigning spree over their disagreement with the party's support for the passage of the contentious Waqf Amendment Bill.

NEW DELHI: The legal and political battle over the Waqf Amendment Bill , 2025 has reached the Supreme Court, with AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi joining Congress MP Mohammad Jawed in challenging the bill’s constitutional validity.Both leaders have alleged that the proposed amendments infringe on the fundamental rights of Muslims and introduce discriminatory state control over Islamic religious endowments.The petitions, filed through advocate Anas Tanwir, come even before the Bill has received Presidential assent.It was passed by both Houses of Parliament amid sharp opposition.Jawed, a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee that reviewed the bill, argued that the amendments violate Articles 14, 25, 26, 29, and 300A of the Constitution, which relate to equality, religious freedom, minority rights, and property. He said the bill introduces arbitrary restrictions, including one based on the duration of religious practice, which could prevent recent converts from dedicating property under waqf — a condition he said is alien to Islamic law, reported Bar and Bench.Another contentious change flagged in the petition is the proposed inclusion of non-Muslim members in Waqf Boards and the Central Waqf Council. “This selective intervention lacks any reasonable justification and constitutes an arbitrary classification,” the plea mentioned, noting that similar interference is absent in the governance of Hindu or Sikh religious trusts.Speaking to the media, Jawed said, “Several people in India will file this petition, several parties will do this... In the Parliament, everyone in the Opposition said that this is unconstitutional... How can you snatch away our right? If you have numbers, it doesn’t mean you get passed anything you want and do something unlawful.”AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi has also called the Bill a “brazen violation” of the Muslim community’s rights.During the debate in Parliament, he tore a copy of the legislation, comparing his act to Mahatma Gandhi’s civil disobedience in South Africa. “Like Gandhi, I am also tearing up this law. This is unconstitutional. The BJP wants to create divisiveness in this country in the name of temples and mosques,” he said.He also urged the government to consider the 10 amendments he proposed during the debate, warning that the Bill would curtail Muslim rights.The Waqf Amendment Bill seeks to revise the Waqf Act, 1995, which governs religious endowments under Islamic law in India. It defines the roles of Waqf Boards, Tribunals, and administrative structures overseeing waqf properties. While the government says the amendments are aimed at better regulation and transparency, critics argue the bill introduces state interference not applied to other religious institutions and undermines community autonomy.","AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi joins Congress MP Mohammad Jawed in challenging the bill's constitutional validity.

Tyeb Mehta's bull run continues: 2nd priciest Indian painting at 61.8cr,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tyeb-mehtas-bull-run-continues-2nd-priciest-indian-painting-at-61-8cr/articleshow/119957048.cms,"His work is worth crores, but Tyeb struggled most of his life

The bull run seems to be truly on in the Indian market, and who better to capture its animal spirits than Tyeb Mehta, the celebrated modernist who made the bull his enduring motif?Less than a fortnight after a work by his contemporary M F Husain joined the Rs 100-crore club, Mehta's 'Trussed Bull' (1956) went for Rs 61.8 crore ($7.27 million), becoming the second most expensive Indian painting sold at auction globally. It is now tied with Amrita Sher-Gil 's 'The Story Teller', which sold for the same price in 2023. Mehta's powerful image of a shackled and subjugated bull went for nearly nine times its higher estimate at a Saffronart auction in Mumbai on Wednesday.This is not the first time Mehta, who lived in Mumbai most of his life and passed away in 2009, has raised the bar for Indian art. In 2002, his triptych, 'Celebration', from The Times of India's collection, made history as the first modern Indian artwork to sell for over a crore (Rs 1.5 crore at Christie's).It was a Tyeb work again ('Mahishasura') which crossed the $1m mark for the first time in 2005. Now, he has set another benchmark for Indian art. Wednesday's auction was also a benchmark for homegrown auction house Saffronart, which celebrated its 25th anniversary with an auction that raked in a record-breaking $25 million. ""It's a global record for an Indian art auction . It shows the strength of the art market when other asset classes are struggling,"" said Dinesh Vazirani, Saffronart CEO and co-founder. ""It's even more meaningful because it is Mehta's centenary year.""The proceeds will go to the Mehta family since the work was from their collection. For most of his life, the artist lived in a cramped one-room apartment that was studio by day and bedroom at night. It was only in the 1990s that he and his wife Sakina could afford to move into a two-bedroom place in Lokhandwala. ""Like many other artist wives of that period, Sakina supported him. She used to work as a teacher,"" said Kishore Singh, senior VP at DAG (formerly Delhi Art Gallery).His work now goes for sums that are as jaw-dropping as his pregnant Kali and avenging yet tender Durga but to talk of Mehta purely in terms of zeroes does no justice to the man and the ideals he lived by. ""The power of painting was far more important to him than the prices it commanded,"" said Singh, narrating an anecdote from Delhi gallerist Arun Vadehra who was close to Mehta. ""Arun used to have one of his paintings hanging in his office. One day, Mehta took it away, only to replace it later with another work. When Arun asked, he said he had ripped the earlier painting because he wasn't happy with it. Tyeb may not have been very prolific but he stayed true to his art.""Mehta's strong imagery was always rooted in his life, with his canvases charting the tumult around him - the horrors of Partition, the struggles of a newly independent India and the violence of the 1992 Bombay riots. In an interview, he recounted his memories of Partition. ""At the time, I was living on Mohammed Ali Road, which was virtually a Muslim ghetto. I remember watching a young man being slaughtered in the street below my window. The crowd beat him to death, smashed his head with stones."" Those images haunted him for life, as did the sight of bullocks being led to slaughter at an abattoir in Bombay. The bull, Mehta later said, was important to him on many levels. ""The way they tie up the animal's legs and fling it on the floor of the slaughterhouse before butchering it... you feel something very vital has been lost. The trussed bull also seemed representative of the national condition... the mass of humanity unable to channel or direct its tremendous energies...""In the winter of his life, Mehta's vision was impaired. ""Those primary colours that he used so much was because his sight was affected,"" explained Singh. But he continued to paint, a perfectionist till the end.","Tyeb Mehta's 'Trussed Bull' is the second most expensive Indian painting sold at auction globally. It is now tied with Amrita Sher-Gil's 'The Story Teller', which sold for the same price in 2023. His work charted the tumult of Partition, the struggles of a newly independent India and violence of the 1992 Bombay riots.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119957060,imgsize-949702,width-400,resizemode-4/Tyeb-Mehta.jpg"

NEW DELHI: A unique argument - if the medicine for treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is cheaper in Pakistan and China, why can't it be similarly priced to help those suffering from this rare disorder - persuaded Supreme Court Friday to seek response from Centre and global pharma giant Roche, the drug manufacturer.Appearing for Seba, 24, from Kerala, advocate Anand Grover told a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna, & Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan that Hoffman Roche, which manufactures the patented oral medicine Risdiplam (Evrysdi), is selling the drug cheap in Pakistan and China.

The bench issued notice to Roche to get its response and asked Centre to place its stand on making the drug to treat SMA cheaper in India. Understanding the urgency involved in the case, a quick decision on which will help save many SMA patients from certain death in near future, the bench posted the matter for further hearing next week.""In India, there may be thousands of families where patients are affected with this disease. Due to lack of infrastructure , the ailment is left undetected,"" Grover said, seeking urgent intervention of SC which could save thousands of patients.","In India, a bottle of Risdiplam costs Rs 6.2 lakh, whereas in Pakistan it is around Rs 41,000 per bottle and in China Rs 44,692.

SRINAGAR: A Srinagar court Friday ordered four men — convicted of drinking and creating public nuisance — to perform community service at Sufi shrine Makhdoom Sahib and clean a govt girls’ higher secondary school.While sentencing the accused — who had pleaded guilty to the charges — additional judicial magistrate Zirgham Hamid observed that the four were poor and the sole bread-earners of their families; imprisonment would disrupt their daily routine. In contrast, community service is seen as a way to integrate offenders back into society, allowing them to make amends for their actions through constructive contributions, the judge said, adding: ""This approach also reflects a more humane and progressive view of justice, recognising the potential for positive change in every individual.""The community service is to be carried out from 8am to 11am on April 5 and 6 at the Sufi shrine in Srinagar’s old city, which not only serves as a religious place but is also a hub of cultural and social activities, hosting events and festivals that bring the community together, the judge said. The cleaning of the school in Nowhatta (also part of the old city) is to be conducted from 9am to 12pm on April 7 and 8, the court ruled.On April 1, 2025, a complaint was filed at Nowhatta police station alleging that the four men — Manzoor Ahmad Malla, Javid Ahmad Qureshi, Parveez Ahmad Monchi and Shabir Ahmad Sheikh — were causing annoyance and abusing the general public at the main road in Nowhatta’s Sheikh Colony.A police party found the four in an inebriated state, creating a nuisance. Later, their medical examination proved that they were drunk.When produced before the court, the accused said they wanted to “confess their guilt” and sought a lenient view, pleading “they are very poor labourers and don’t have money to pay a fine”. While the court told them that they were not bound to plead guilty, they insisted that their decision was not induced by fear, pressure or undue influence but was voluntary.","A Srinagar court Friday ordered four men to perform community service at Sufi shrine Makhdoom Sahib and clean a govt girls’ higher secondary school.

The tit-for-tat escalation comes just a day after Trump warned Americans might feel “some pain” from his trade strategy, comparing the economic disruption to surgery.“For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.The US jobs report provided a brief pause to the carnage. Employers added more jobs than expected in March, reinforcing hopes that the US economy remains resilient. But analysts warned the data is backward-looking and does little to address forward risks.“Markets are now focused on what comes next. This is no longer about how strong the US was—it’s about whether it can withstand a trade war-induced slowdown,” said Rick Rieder, Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income at BlackRock.Some of the sharpest losses were among US companies exposed to China. DuPont fell nearly 17% after China’s regulators launched an anti-trust probe into its Chinese subsidiary. GE Healthcare, which gets 14% of its revenue from China, sank 13.3%. United Airlines, heavily reliant on Asia-Pacific routes, dropped 12.6%.On his social media platform Truth Social, Trump dismissed China’s move: “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!”Bond markets also flashed red. The 10-year Treasury yield slid to 3.90%, down from 4.06% the previous day, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to cut interest rates to cushion the blow.But with tariffs driving up prices, the Fed could face a tightrope: lower rates may ease economic pressure but risk stoking inflation, leaving US households squeezed by rising costs.Abroad, the damage was widespread. Germany’s DAX index fell 5.2%, France’s CAC 40 lost 4.6%, and Japan’s Nikkei shed 2.8%.Vietnam and the European Union have both signaled intentions to negotiate with the US, but for now, the world’s two largest economies remain locked in economic combat — and markets are running scared.","The S&P 500 nosedived 5% in morning trading, on track for its worst day since the pandemic crash in 2020.

4 signs that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce already have marriage plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/4-signs-that-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-already-have-marriage-plans/articleshow/119991299.cms,"Fans believe Taylor and Travis have already talked about marriage. Source: X

Have Taylor and Travis already planned their life after marriage?

They are househunting together

Their loved ones encourage their relationship

They socialise and celebrate with their married friends

They are comfortable talking about each other

Engagement rumours about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have been swirling around for months now. The celebrity couple have been together since 2023 and have checked off some serious relationship milestones together. They are often seen spending time with each other's families and making vacation plans with each other. However, has Travis already asked Taylor the big question? Although there's no confirmation from their end, many fans believe Taylor and Travis have already talked about marriage and have made plans for their life together.It's evident that their families and friends are mighty impressed with their relationship. And Taylor has made millions for the NFL which has enhanced the spotlight on Travis and his career and has catapulted him to superstardom. But marriage is of course a different conversation. So, why do Taylor and Travis's fans think they already have marriage plans? Here are a few reasons to consider.Celebrity couples don't go house-hunting unless they have picked a hearth where they want to spend most of their days or at least a few months every year. Following a warm weekend escape in Montana, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift are reportedly searching for a secluded retreat as they recently browsed properties in Montana. Maybe they want a holiday home near the mountains or a vacation pad to party with their friends. But fans no doubt consider this a significant development in their relationship especially since Taylor is quite serious about her real estate picks and has been quite futuristic about most of her residential properties.This is an interesting contrast compared to Taylor's last relationships. It's no secret that Taylor's close friends and even her publicist weren't fans of her ex-fiance Joe Alwyn. The same goes for celebrities like Tom Hiddleston and Calvin Harris, who did enjoy being seen with Taylor as it helped them make headlines. But Taylor's family and friends were reportedly sceptical about them since they did not really make an effort to make it work with Taylor.Travis however has worn his heart on the sleeve from Day 1. Not only has he hyped her up at her concerts, but is also conscious about the fact that Taylor is more famous than him. It's clear that Taylor's friends and family members especially her mom Donna are already fans of the pairing which goes a long way in Taylor's books.While most couples wait a few months to mix up their social circles, Taylor and Travis were pretty quick to blend their friend groups. Not only did Travis meet and impress Taylor's friends, but Taylor has partied with Travis's colleagues and their significant others and has even developed a rapport with his coaching team.Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid had once revealed that Taylor Swift made homemade pop tarts for the offensive linemen. Their friend groups and family members have celebrated significant milestones together be it birthdays or anniversaries. Since most of their friends are already married it makes sense that they would mingle with married couples if they were serious about marrying each other.Fans have long speculated that Taylor and Travis are both serious about each other since their teams never instructed the press to not ask them about each other. though they have been private about their relationship, they have always tactfully answered each question about their romance. Although in the past year they both gushed about each other during interviews.""When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” Taylor said in an interview. “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”",Fans believe Taylor and Travis have already talked about marriage.

But the court has postponed their plea, indicating that the issue will be heard only after the current investigation is complete.While that was happening, another defendant in the scandal, Apoorva Mukhija, known as The Rebel Kid, has made a radical move by wiping clean her Instagram account.As per a NDTV report, the Supreme Court has declined to give away the passports of Ranveer Allahbadia and Ashish Chanchlani on the grounds that it might jeopardize the probe if they were allowed to go abroad. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta updated the court that the plea could be re-heard within two weeks when the probe reaches a conclusive point.Ranveer Allahbadia, in his plea, argued that without his passport, he is unable to travel for his international shows, which is significantly affecting his livelihood. However, the court remained firm in its decision, stating that the investigation must take precedence. Similarly, Ashish Chanchlani’s plea to retrieve his passport was also rejected.Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had given Ranveer go-ahead to restart his podcasts but had also asked him to uphold ""morality and decency"" in them.

"Bombay High Court: Software engineer salary dropped from Rs 5.5 lakh to Rs 20,000? Bombay HC calls it ‘unbelievable’, fines him Rs 1 lakh for not paying wife, kid maintenance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-fines-techie-1-lakh-for-not-paying-wife-kid-maintenance/articleshow/119914560.cms,"<p>Bombay High Court<br></p>

MUMBAI: Bombay high court imposed a Rs 1 lakh cost on a man who made a ""systematic attempt"" to ensure that any order to pay maintenance to his wife and minor daughter could not be executed. The amount is to be paid to the wife within four weeks.""It is unbelievable that the petitioner, who is a software engineer working as a ‘software developer' and was getting Rs 65 lakh per annum, ie, a salary of Rs 5.5 lakh per month, is now getting a salary of Rs 20,000 per month,"" said Justice Madhav Jamdar on March 19.The couple married in April 2016. The husband filed for divorce in Sept 2020 before the civil judge senior division (CJSD).In Sept 2022, CJSD directed him to pay Rs 30,000 maintenance to his wife and daughter and the EMI of the flat. In May 2024, CJSD refused to recall his order.Before HC, his advocate Naina Sharma argued that he got a job with effect from Aug 2, 2021, on Rs 65 lakh annual compensation.He met with an accident four days after joining, was on two months' medical leave, and resumed service in Oct 2021. Due to his accident, he could not work, and he resigned in Feb 2022. He took up a job paying Rs 20,000 monthly rendering it exceedingly difficult for him to comply with maintenance and EMI payment obligations.Agreeing with the wife's advocate Amol Jagtap, Justice Jamdar said in the husband's review petition there was no mention of his accident or in his petition filed in Aug 2024 in HC. It was mentioned for the first time in his Feb 12 reply to the wife's contempt petition before CJSD. His reason for resigning the earlier job ""is totally different"" and not due to the alleged accident.Justice Jamdar said till Nov 2023, the husband represented, even after his alleged accident and resignation of the job due to it, on a matrimonial site that he earns Rs 35-50 lakh annually. Between Feb 2021 and Jan 2022, he transferred Rs 34 lakh to his mother and brother. ""Thus, it is clear that a systematic attempt is made by the petitioner to ensure that even if any order is passed by the court granting maintenance, it will be impossible for the wife to execute the same. It is significant to note that the petitioner-husband is not even ready to pay maintenance to the daughter who is presently eight years old,"" he added.Justice Jamdar said the petitioner has approached high court with ""unclean hands and with a totally false case"". Dismissing the petition, he said there is substance in the wife's contention that even assuming the accident happened, ""the petitioner's work has not been affected due to the accident"".","Bombay high court imposed a Rs 1 lakh cost on a man who made a ""systematic attempt"" to ensure that any order to pay maintenance to his wife and minor daughter could not be executed.

BOKARO: Bokaro Steel Plant (BSL) operations were severely disrupted on Friday following violent protests and a citywide shutdown triggered by the death of a displaced youth during a clash with CISF forces at the BSL Administrative Gate on Thursday. The incident occurred during a demonstration by the Visthapith Apprentice Sangh (VAS).On Friday morning, BSL management issued an urgent appeal to protesters, urging them to lift the blockade. They highlighted the critical nature of the plant, describing it as a thermo-sensitive facility with complex gas pipeline networks requiring constant monitoring under strict safety protocols.The protests, which began on Thursday night, paralysed both public life and plant operations. Protesters blocked key roads and attempted a citywide shutdown. Violence broke out in various locations, including Dundibagh, where protesters set fire to a shop and a vehicle.

Asteroid 2024 YR4's growing threat to the Moon



James Webb Space Telescope confirms near-zero threat from asteroid 2024 YR4



Impacts of asteroid on the Moon



Ongoing monitoring of asteroid 2024 YR4



Also Read |

The asteroid 2024 YR4 , once dreaded to be a ""city-killer,"" is not now regarded as a major menace to Earth anymore. Although the possibility of it colliding with our planet is reduced significantly now, recent findings indicate a probability of a meager chance to collide with the Moon in the near future.2024 YR4, which was found in December of 2024, was first a cause of concern because it was quite large, almost the size of a football field. When it was found, NASA 's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies placed a 3% chance that the asteroid might hit Earth in 2032. This probability was soon scaled down to much lower odds, 0.28%, in a matter of weeks after detection.In spite of the reduced chances of an Earth impact, asteroid 2024 YR4 has created fresh fears of a collision with the Moon. The asteroid, according to astronomer Andrew Rivkin, as seen by New Scientist, now has a 2% chance of hitting the Moon on December 22, 2032. This is marginally greater than the 1.7% chance previously estimated by NASA in February.Although the danger is still small, the potential for a lunar collision remains at the forefront of scientists' minds. NASA initially reported the 1.7% risk earlier this year, but continuous observations and calculations have indicated a marginal increase in the chances of impact with the Moon.As research and observation went on, the James Webb Space Telescope was instrumental in further tracking the asteroid. In late March, observations by the Webb telescope assured that the asteroid 2024 YR4 now poses a near-zero threat to Earth. The information gathered by this powerful observatory further reinforced the conclusion that the asteroid will not impact our planet in the near future.The James Webb Space Telescope will be observing 2024 YR4 once more in May 2025. The capabilities of the telescope are unmatched, and it can observe faint and distant objects within the universe. It gives wonderful data to NASA and foreign space agencies. This constant observation will still sharpen our knowledge of the course of the asteroid, especially as it travels toward the outer solar system.Although the possibility of collision with Earth is low, the impact on theMoon is not yet known. NASA suggests that asteroid impacts have, over billions of years, sculpted the surface of the Moon, producing craters and leaving an everlasting impression on the landscape. The American Museum of Natural History is adamant that impacts like these occurred far more commonly in the far past but now become very rare with time and, therefore, give rise to a ""relatively peaceful present.""The specific impact of an encounter with an asteroid of 2024 YR4's diameter is unknown. Earlier assessments have indicated that an impact on Earth would have ""truly catastrophic"" implications, though the impact would be localized, not inducing global climate shifts. Still, it would be an event of unimaginable scale, one that would bring widespread devastation in the local region of impact.Though tiny risks are present, researchers and space agencies are still tracking the path of 2024 YR4 closely. Though the chances of an impact on Earth have been virtually ruled out, the remote possibility of a collision with the Moon is a reminder of the need for continued caution in observing and monitoring near-Earth objects. As technology continues to evolve and we learn more about these cosmic dangers, the hope is that we can guarantee a peaceful future, untroubled by devastating asteroid impacts.","Asteroid 2024 YR4 now has a 2% chance of hitting the Moon on December 22, 2032.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's $23 million DC mansion is the third-most expensive house buy in Donald Trump's Home State,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebook-founder-mark-zuckerberg-makes-the-third-most-expensive-house-buy-in-donald-trumps-home-state/articleshow/119946535.cms,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg

Meta confirms: ‘Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC…’

Jeff Bezos, former Google CEO and other tech moguls who have brought houses in Washington

Jeff Bezos purchased a $23 million Kalorama mansion in 2016.

Peter Thiel bought a $13 million beaux-arts residence in 2021.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

PayPal co-founder David Sacks, now a White House advisor, purchased a $10.3 million Northwest DC penthouse.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

Are Trump's reciprocal tariffs bad for China? DeepSeek says...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/are-trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-bad-for-china-deepseek-says-/articleshow/119981002.cms,"DeepSeek

DeepSeek says ‘No external factors can hinder China's progress’

China has always been committed to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, adhering to the multilateral trading system, and promoting the construction of an open world economy. The Chinese government has the capability and wisdom to respond to various challenges in international trade, safeguard the interests of the nation and its people, and promote the healthy and stable development of the economy. China's development achievements are the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the concerted efforts of people of all ethnic groups across the country. No external factors can hinder China's progress and the improvement of its people's lives. China will continue to deepen reforms, expand openness, and work with other countries around the world to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

DeepSeek’s reply to “retaliatory actions that China can take against Trump's tariffs?""

China has a range of policy tools and strategic options to respond to reciprocal tariffs imposed by the U.S., ensuring the protection of its national interests while maintaining stability in global trade. Possible measures include:

1. Reciprocal Tariffs on U.S. Goods

•⁠ ⁠China could impose *targeted tariffs* on key U.S. exports such as *agricultural products (soybeans, pork), aircraft, automobiles, and energy products*.

•⁠ ⁠This would pressure politically sensitive U.S. industries, influencing domestic sentiment in key electoral states.

2. Export Controls on Critical Materials

•⁠ ⁠China dominates global supply chains in *rare earth metals* (used in electronics, defense, and green tech).

•⁠ ⁠Restrictions on rare earth exports could disrupt U.S. manufacturing, similar to measures taken in past trade disputes.

3. Non-Tariff Barriers & Regulatory Measures

•⁠ ⁠*Stricter inspections* on U.S. imports (food safety, customs delays).

•⁠ ⁠*Anti-dumping & anti-subsidy investigations* against U.S. products.

•⁠ ⁠*Preferential treatment* for non-U.S. companies in government procurement.

4. Diversifying Trade Partners (Reducing U.S. Dependence)

•⁠ ⁠*Strengthening trade with the EU, ASEAN, Africa, and Latin America* through new agreements.

•⁠ ⁠*Accelerating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)* to deepen Asia-Pacific trade ties.

5. Currency & Financial Measures

•⁠ ⁠*Allowing the yuan to depreciate* to make Chinese exports more competitive.

•⁠ ⁠*Dumping U.S. Treasury bonds* (though this is a double-edged sword).

6. Legal & WTO Challenges

•⁠ ⁠*Filing complaints at the WTO* against U.S. tariffs, as done in previous trade wars.

•⁠ ⁠*Forming alliances with other affected countries* to jointly oppose U.S. protectionism.

7. Domestic Stimulus & Self-Reliance

•⁠ ⁠*Boosting domestic consumption* to offset export losses.

•⁠ ⁠*Accelerating tech independence* (e.g., semiconductor self-sufficiency via policies like ""Made in China 2025"").

Conclusion

China has a *strategic, multi-layered approach* to counter U.S. tariffs, combining retaliatory measures with long-term economic resilience strategies. The goal is not just short-term retaliation but also reducing dependency on the U.S. market while strengthening global alliances.

US President Donald Trump ’s recent tariff announcements have reignited concerns about a potential trade war, particularly with China. The new tariffs, imposing a 54% rate on Chinese imports, threaten to disrupt numerous sectors, with technology supply chains facing significant impact. The Trump administration justifies the tariffs as a means to safeguard American industries and rectify trade imbalances, but critics express concerns about rising consumer prices and global economic instability.We asked DeepSeek , China's biggest AI disrupter in recent times, about the impact of Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on the country, and the response was pretty neutral.When asked, “Are Tump’s reciprocal tariffs bad for China?”, DeepSeek highlighted a “mutually beneficial strategy”.On the question, “What China can do to reciprocate the reciprocal Tariffs announced by Donald Trump?”, DeepSeek replied highlighting that China possesses a diverse toolkit to counteract US tariffs, encompassing both retaliatory actions and long-term strategic adjustments aimed at protecting China's national interests and maintain global trade stability.It explained the response in 7 points. Here’s what DeepSeek said:Last year, China announced a ban on the export of key minerals to the US, a move that could significantly impact the US technology manufacturing sector. According to a Reuters report, China's export ban includes minerals such as gallium, germanium, and others.These minerals are essential components in a wide range of technologies, including semiconductors, infrared technology, fiber optic cables, solar cells, military applications (e.g., ammunition, nuclear weapons). Gallium and germanium are crucial for semiconductors, while germanium also plays a role in infrared technology, fiber optic cables, and solar cells.","DeepSeek says ‘No external factors can hinder China's progress’ China has always been committed to a mutually beneficial and win-win strategy of opening up, adhering to the multilateral trading system. The Chinese government has the capability and wisdom to respond to various challenges in international trade.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119980971,imgsize-223712,width-400,resizemode-4/DeepSeek.jpg"

Telangana govt u-turn after protest

HYDERABAD: Facing mounting pressure from student groups, activists, and green warriors, the Telangana government has called off its earlier decision to auction 400 acres at Kancha Gachibowli. The plan now is more ambitious: convert the full 2,000-acre stretch—including land occupied by the University of Hyderabad (UoH)—into what it claims would be “one of the world’s largest eco parks”.The state’s decision followed the Supreme Court’s suo motu intervention that stalled all ongoing activity, including tree-felling on the site. The central government also stepped in, seeking clarification on the state’s proposal to auction land adjacent to the central university.Eco park dream: Rs 1,000 crore and a move to ‘Future City’As per government sources, the revised plan involves relocating UoH to a new “Future City” on Hyderabad’s outskirts. The university will be allotted 100 acres there, along with an investment of Rs 1,000 crore to set up a new campus.The envisioned eco park, designed to rival some of the world’s largest urban green spaces, will feature tall observatories, walking trails, wildlife zones, butterfly gardens, open-air gyms, and even a turtle park. Authorities plan to use a “micro-ecosystem” model to conserve biodiversity, study soil profiles, and plant diverse tree species.Global experts, governing council to lead designOfficials said the project would involve consultations with environmental experts from across the globe. “We would like to bring in specialists from around the world,” an official told TOI. “An expert committee will study similar parks worldwide before drafting a master plan.”To ensure transparency and scientific rigor, the government plans to form a governing council of environmental scientists, academics, student representatives, and conservationists to oversee the park’s development.‘Land already damaged, relocation not a fair deal’: studentsStudent protests had earlier highlighted extensive deforestation in the Kancha Gachibowli area, citing recent tree-cutting activity that had already left a visible ecological impact.Despite the government’s announcement, UoH officials said they had not been officially approached. “If we receive any such offer, it will be placed before the executive council, which will take the decision,” a senior university official said.Student leaders, meanwhile, remained defiant. UoH Students’ Union President Umesh Ambedkar said: “Why can’t they let things be as they are? We are fighting a battle for our land and university and we will not let it go so easily.”He also criticised the offer of 100 acres in return for more than 1,600 acres, calling it an unfair deal.","The Telangana government has called off its earlier decision to auction 400 acres at Kancha Gachibowli.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.
