The changes have been made only for paneer supplied in pre-packaged and labelled form. Paneer is an Indian cottage cheese. This is mostly produced in the small scale sector. The measure is intended to promote Indian cottage cheese.Admission to other sporting events, including recognised sporting events, where the ticket price is not more than Rs 500 continues to be exempt, and if the ticket price is more than Rs 500, it continues to be taxed at the standard rate of 18%.","GST Council has approved sweeping rate cuts across key sectors.

If one of them shows weakness, his political career will be over. So that influences his behaviour.”Tensions will, however, eventually ease, according to the Russian President. “Ultimately, things will be sorted out, everything will take its place, and we will see normal political dialogue again,” he said.Meanwhile, Russia is stepping up fertiliser supplies to India this year and both sides will sign a pact for Arctic cooperation next year.",Vladimir Putin has cautioned the United States against trying to strong-arm India and China with tariffs and sanctions.

PM Modi Hails GST Reforms As 'Double Dhamaka Of Happiness Before Diwali', Slams Cong-Era Taxes

June phone call that changed the tone: Report



Operation Sindoor and the ceasefire claim



Tariff tantrums: From trade tariffs to a 50% wall





Tianjin optics: Putin’s limousine and Xi’s warm handshake



Oil at the centre of geopolitics



The China Plus One dilemma



Hedging, not aligning



A sinking boat or a reset ahead?



NEW DELHI: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi stood beside Donald Trump at Houston’s Howdy Modi event in 2019, it was more than just a diaspora spectacle. It was the visible embodiment of a strategic bet -- that personal chemistry between leaders could fast-track an alignment between the world’s largest democracy and its oldest.That narrative survived Trump’s turbulent first term and carried into his second, when PM Modi returned to Washington on 13 February 2025 for an official working visit that produced warm optics and a joint statement.But from there on, relations between the White House and Lok Kalyan Marg followed a deteriorating trajectory. The so-called ""ceasefire"" episode during Operation Sindoor, followed by Trump’s boastful claims of brokering a ceasefire in South Asia, dented trust. The rupture deepened with Washington’s tariff barrage on Indian exports and energy imports. What began as a handshake friendship risked descending into a transactional cold shoulder.By late summer 2025, Delhi and Washington were left to manage what diplomats called “the sinking boat of trade.” The tariff chapter is expected to hit Indian businesses hard, and Donald Trump’s demands for visible loyalty irritated policymakers in New Delhi.However, after the RIC (Russia–India–China) display at Tianjin during the SCO summit on 1 September 2025, there were signs that Trump’s tariff tantrums were moderating -- a signal that both capitals may still be looking for a revival, even as Delhi hedges with Moscow and Beijing.The first major rupture came on 17 June 2025, in a phone call between PM Modi and Trump. According to a report by The New York Times, Trump repeatedly claimed credit for de-escalating a flare-up between India and Pakistan -- a claim PM Modi did not endorse. Trump allegedly asked PM Modi to “acknowledge” his role publicly and even floated the idea of support for a Nobel Peace Prize. PM Modi’s refusal hardened Trump’s mood.The phone call was never officially confirmed in detail, but Indian officials hinted that “unnecessary self-congratulation” had strained the dialogue. For analysts, it marked the point where the personal rapport between the two leaders began to fray.The backdrop to that phone call was Operation Sindoor, India’s limited but high-visibility military action along the western frontier in early June 2025. New Delhi framed the operation as a targeted counter-terror response, but Trump publicly suggested the US had pressured both India and Pakistan into restraint -- an assertion dismissed in Delhi as exaggerated.Trump’s claim of having “secured a ceasefire” created domestic political unease for PM Modi. Critics accused him of allowing India’s sovereignty to be undermined by Washington’s narrative. While Indian officials tried to downplay the rhetoric, the perception that Trump was using South Asia for self-promotion lingered.Dr Ashok Sharma, Visiting Fellow at the University of New South Wales Canberra at the Australian Defence Force Academy, speaking to Times of India, noted that “Donald Trump, in his first term, was not as blunt in his dealings with India, but in his current tenure he appears far more unpredictable and has moved away from the traditional Republican stance on New Delhi. Some experts even describe this shift as a ‘reverse Nixon’ move against India. ”What followed was harsher and measurable: tariffs. On 27 August 2025, Washington slapped Indian goods with up to 50% tariffs, citing unfair trade practices and New Delhi’s refusal to scale back Russian oil imports. The move stunned Indian exporters and undercut years of lobbying by US businesses who had invested in India as a “China Plus One” base.Indian officials called the decision “unjustified,” pointing out that India’s trade surplus with the US was far smaller than China’s and that Indian companies were still major buyers of American goods. More sensitive still was Washington’s explicit linking of tariffs to India’s Russian crude purchases. New Delhi defended its buying spree as an energy security necessity.The tariffs threatened a chilling effect: Industries ranging from textiles and pharmaceuticals to steel and IT services saw immediate cost spikes. Analysts warned that the penalties risked unravelling one of the few bipartisan achievements in US foreign policy -- strengthening ties with India to balance China.As Sharma explained, “Trump’s bluntness stems from India’s recent resistance to Washington’s attempts to dictate terms, seen in the Operation Sindoor episode and the ongoing tariff disputes. His aggressive posture has now expanded into a broader offensive against Brics nations, signalling a recalibration of US foreign policy priorities.”The SCO summit in Tianjin on September 1 provided the clearest demonstration of how Delhi was recalibrating. PM Modi held bilateral meetings with both Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, emphasising long-term ties and regional cooperation.The images that dominated television screens back home in India were not of a wary handshake with Xi, but of PM Modi riding with Putin in his Aurus limousine after the summit -- a gesture of camaraderie choreographed for the cameras.Indian officials framed the meetings as pragmatic diplomacy. But the symbolism was unavoidable; after weeks of bruising tariffs from Washington, New Delhi was visibly embracing Moscow and engaging China in a multilateral setting.Energy has been the unspoken driver of this shift. Since 2022, when sanctions pushed Russian crude out of Western markets, India and China have emerged as Moscow’s top buyers. By mid-2025, discounted Russian oil accounted for nearly 40% of India’s crude imports. That cushion allowed Delhi to contain domestic inflation and keep refineries humming.For Washington, those purchases looked like undermining sanctions. For Delhi, they were a non-negotiable necessity. “We will buy where our people’s needs are met,” India’s petroleum minister told reporters in August 2025. The clash of perspectives turned energy into a wedge -- one that Russia and China exploited to court India more closely.For global business, the fallout has been stark. The “China Plus One” strategy -- moving some production away from China into other markets like India, Vietnam or Mexico took a hit as US tariffs made Indian exports less competitive. Companies that had invested in India expecting favourable access to the US market suddenly faced higher costs and uncertainty.Some Indian economists warned that the tariff shock could slow manufacturing growth just as India was positioning itself as a global alternative to Chinese supply chains. “If the US is unpredictable on tariffs, investors will think twice,” said one Mumbai-based economist.Sharma underlined that “foreign policy always depends on reliability as much as interests, and by tightening trade while demanding alignment, Washington exposed its unpredictability. For Indian policymakers, the message was clear: overreliance on the US carried risks. By alienating India, Washington achieved the opposite of its aim, nudging New Delhi and Beijing toward dialogue.”Despite the warmth in Tianjin, India’s strategy is not a wholesale pivot to Russia and China. Security tensions with Beijing remain unresolved after the 2020 Galwan clashes, and mistrust along the Line of Actual Control lingers. Defence cooperation with the US from intelligence sharing to the Quad partnership continues in parallel.What has changed is India’s willingness to publicly hedge. In September 2025, that hedge was displayed in three acts: Trump’s June 17 call; Washington’s 27 August tariffs; and PM Modi’s 1 September SCO appearances. Together they showed how quickly personal frictions and trade measures can spill into the strategic domain.The story of PM Modi and Trump in 2025 is not just about two personalities falling out. It is a case study in how transactionalism can undermine strategic trust. What began as the much-touted “bromance” of Houston now looks like a fragile arrangement tested by ego, tariffs and oil.Whether Delhi and Washington can patch the “sinking boat of trade” remains to be seen. With signs that Trump’s tariff fury is easing after Tianjin, there may be space for a reset. But the episode has left its mark; India is more willing than before to be seen with Moscow and Beijing, and Washington has learned that economic coercion can backfire in Asia’s most important swing state.","Relations between India and the U.S. have deteriorated in recent years. The first major rupture came on 17 June 2025, in a phone call between PM Modi and Trump. The rupture deepened with Washington’s tariff barrage on Indian exports and energy imports. However, after the RIC (Russia–India–China) display at Tianjin during the SCO summit on 1 September 2025, there were signs that Trump's tariffs were moderating.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123703793,imgsize-1214542,width-400,resizemode-4/qw-79.jpg"
Rural India's total fertility rate dips to replacement rate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rural-indias-total-fertility-rate-dips-to-replacement-rate/articleshow/123706269.cms,"AI Image used for representative purpose

Infant mortality rate posts 1-pt decline

NEW DELHI: Highlighting that Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the country has further declined to reach 1.9 in 2023 against 2.0 in the previous year and stays well below the replacement level fertility of 2.1 births per woman, the latest Sample Registration System (SRS) Statistical report 2023 shows TFR for rural India for the first time touched 2.1 - the replacement rate, where one generation replaces itself, leading to population stability.Rates above replacement rate 2.1 suggest population growth, and the rates below that level indicate a declining population and a potential ageing population. Nationally, India's TFR touched replacement level in 2019 and was at 2.0 since 2020. TFR represents the average number of children born to a woman during her reproductive years.As per SRS report, Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR) for 2023 is estimated at 0.9, which means that on average, each woman in India is having one daughter who survives to reproductive age and has children of her own. Rural GRR (1.0) was slightly higher than urban GRR (0.7), which suggests that women in rural areas are having more daughters than women in urban areas.GRR is a refined measure of fertility that accounts for future mothers and measures the average number of female children a woman is expected to give birth during her entire reproductive span conforming to the age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) for a given year, if there is no mortality.GRR values for major states/UTs range from 0.6 in Delhi, Bengal and TN to 1.3 in Bihar.TFR for rural areas was 2.2 in 2022 and 1.6 for urban. Going by TFR for 2023, at present, a rural woman would have about one child more than an urban woman having a TFR of 1.5 on an average.As far as states go, Bihar had highest TFR among bigger states/UTs at 2.8, followed by UP (2.6), MP (2.4) and and Rajasthan (2.3). Delhi records the lowest TFR at 1.2, followed by TN and Bengal at 1.3 each.Maharashtra stands at 1.4, while Andhra, J&K, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, and Telangana each have a TFR of 1.5. TFR in urban areas was generally lower than in rural areas across all major states/UTs in India, except Kerala and TN.\The SRSReport 2023 shows that infant mortality rate (IMR) registered a one-point decline from 26 per 1,000 live births in 2022 at the national level. Among bigger states, maximum IMR was observed at 37 each in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, & minimum at five in Kerala and three in Manipur. However, the report noted that despite this decline, one in every 40 infants at the national level die within one year of life — one in every 36 infants in rural areas and one in every 56 infants in urban areas. The report highlighted that the decline in IMR from 32 in 2018 to 25 in 2023, marks a decline of seven points over past five years and an annual average decline of about 1.4 points. The corresponding decline in rural IMR has been eight points (36 in 2018 to 28 in 2023) against a decline of five points in urban IMR (23 in 2018 to 18 in 2023). IMR for both genders have shown a decline during 2018-23. With regard to Under-5 Mortality Rate (U5MR), in 2023, the country saw a decline of one point (29 in 2023 against 30 in 2022). There has been a decline of one point in female U5MR and no changes has been observed in male U5MR during the corresponding period.","India's Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the country has further declined to reach 1.9 in 2023 against 2.0 in the previous year. TFR represents the average number of children born to a woman during her reproductive years.

HAL to deliver first two Tejas Mark-1A jets next month but contingent on weapon trials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hal-to-deliver-first-two-tejas-mark-1a-jets-next-month-but-contingent-on-weapon-trials/articleshow/123701568.cms,"HAL Battles US Delays, But Delivers Tejas Mk1A Fighter Jets To IAF With ₹67,000 Cr Boost Coming

NEW DELHI: Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) hopes to finally deliver the first two `improved’ Tejas Mark-1A fighters to the IAF next month after a long delay, but it will be contingent on the single-engine indigenous jet completing its weapon firing trials.The firing trials of Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles and laser-guided bombs, which will also demonstrate proper integration with the Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system of the Tejas Mark-1A fighter, are scheduled later this month. “Software modifications have been made after a previous test failed,” a source at the defence PSU said.The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-404 engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, as well as weapons and radar integration issues are the main reasons behind the excruciatingly slow pace of production of the Tejas Mark-1A jets.“GE has delivered two engines so far. It has promised to deliver 10 more engines by March next year, and then 20 every year thereafter,” the source said.The IAF is keeping its fingers crossed. The force has so far got only 38 of the first 40 Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010.It is yet to get the first Tejas Mark-1A jet of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021. All the 83 jets, incidentally, were to be delivered in the Feb 2024-Feb 2028 timeframe. The PM-led cabinet committee on security (CCS) approved the acquisition of another 97 of the jets for Rs 66,500 crore on Aug 19, as was then reported by TOI.Air Chief Marshal A P Singh has publicly criticised HAL for the delays, noting that IAF was “very badly off in numbers” and needs to induct at least 40 fighters every year to stay combat ready.The IAF will go down to its lowest-ever figure of 29 fighter squadrons after retirement of the 36 old MiG-21s still in service on Sept 26. This when the force is authorized 42.5 combat squadrons to tackle the twin challenge from China and Pakistan.","The firing trials of Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles and laser- guided bombs are scheduled later this month.

""We have taken note of seriousness of the situation. Videos of flash floods show large numbers of logs being swept down and is a prima facie indicator of illegal cutting down of trees in the hills,"" he said.Turning to solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was present in the courtroom for another case, the CJI told the law officer to take note of the serious problem and illegal felling of trees. Mehta said he would get in touch with the secretary in MoEF&CC and request him to discuss the issue with environment secretaries of the states concerned.""We have interfered with nature so much that it is now giving back,"" Mehta said. The CJI agreed and said time has come to take drastic steps to preserve whatever we have and strictly adhere to the path of sustainable development.Rana, in her PIL, alleged that failure of environmental authorities to preserve the pristine ecology of the Himalayan region, flagrant violation of the hill road construction code, and encroachment of water channels and water bodies constitute the cocktail of reasons for the vicissitudes of nature to wreak havoc through unprecedented rains.The petitioner sought ""formation of a SIT involving experts to find out the reasons for these disasters, determine responsibilities of officials, suggest measures to help protect the ecology of Himalayan States"" and keep their population safe from disasters.","Supreme Court decides to investigate allegations made through a PIL.

AIIMS finds Lady Hardinge panel wrongly disqualified disabled candidates,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aiims-finds-lady-hardinge-panel-wrongly-disqualified-disabled-candidates/articleshow/123676736.cms,"Representative photo

AIIMS experts have found that senior doctors of Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC) wrongly certified two hearing impaired NEET-qualified students as ineligible for reservation for persons with disabilities (PWD). Despite their Unique Disability ID stating that the percentage of disability of the two candidates was 63% and 50%, the three-member LHMC board certified them as 14% and 2% respectively.An AIIMS board was constituted on the Delhi High Court’s direction after the two students filed against the certification. After conducting a battery of tests, the AIIMS experts certified the two candidates’ disability level as 66.5% and 43.13%. This incident has raised questions about other candidates who might have been disqualified by the same board, but who could not afford to approach the court.Based on the AIIMS report, the court ordered that the two candidates be allowed to participate in the second round of counselling for MBBS admission. Wrong certification by the LHMC doctors led to them missing the first round of counselling.Disability rights activists have demanded an enquiry into the certification process in LHMC and against the doctors who wrongly certified the students.The LHMC medical board consisted of Prof Dr A Chakravati and assistant professors Dr Pallika Kumar and Dr Raman Kumar.Unique disability ID, issued by designated health authorities, was launched as asingle document of identification and verification of the disabled for availing various benefits in future. Only those whose disability level is 40% or above are eligible for the 5% disability quota seats in MBBS admission.“Much uproar is raised over fake disability certificates, but who questions the doctors on three-member medical boards who arbitrarily assign percentages? With clearly gazetted assessment guidelines in place, how can 50-60% suddenly shrink to 2% or 14%? These are not mere mistakes, but grave blunders that crush students’ careers and amount to medical negligence,” said Dr Satendra Singh, a founder member of Doctors with Disabilities: Agents of Change, India’s largest network of health professionals with disabilities. Dr Singh demanded that accountability be fixed for this negligence.The candidates were evaluated clinically and audiologically through five different tests. The first two (Pure Tone Audiometry and Speech audiometry) are subjective hearing tests as response depends upon the cooperation of the patients.However, the next three (Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry or BERA/ABR, otoacoustic emission and impedance audiometry) are objective hearing test that do not require the cooperation of the patient and therefore are being utilized with an increased frequency for detecting malingering or to determine if a candidate is feigning a higher level of hearing loss. BERA, which is the test that provides clinching evidence, is available in most physiology and ENT departments in Delhi hospitals."," AIIMS experts found that senior doctors of Lady Hardinge Medical College wrongly certified two hearing impaired NEET-qualified students as ineligible for reservation for persons with disabilities (PWD) Despite their Unique Disability ID stating that the percentage of disability of the two candidates was 63% and 50%, the three-member LHMC board certified them as 14% and 2% respectively.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123676742,imgsize-52044,width-400,resizemode-4/disability.jpg"

The bench allowed an appeal filed by Union govt, holding that a renunciation certificate from Pakistan is indispensable and cannot be replaced by other documents.""The Citizenship Act, 1955, does not recognise dual citizenship,"" the court said. ""An individual can be treated as an Indian citizen only if recognised exclusively by the Indian state, without competing claims from any other country.""The case dates back to 2008 when the women's father Muhamed Maroof returned to India from Pakistan with govt permission.

NEW DELHI: Rain-battered north India just experienced its wettest two-week period in at least the past 14 years, available IMD records since 2012 reveal. From Aug 22 to Sept 4, the region logged nearly 3x of normal rainfall, triggering extreme weather fury in nearly all parts of the region - including cloudbursts on the Vaishno Devi route in J&K, worst-in-decades floods in Punjab, the third highest recorded levels of the Yamuna in Delhi and widespread landslides in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.North India recorded 205.3mm of rain in these 14 days against a normal of 73.1mm, accounting for 35% of the region's usual quota for the entire four-month monsoon season. The intense spell has put the region on course to registering its wettest monsoon in 37 years since 1988.North India, a region meteorologically known as northwest India, has received 691.7mm of rain in the monsoon season (since June 1) so far, nearly 37% higher than normal. Even if the region gets normal rainfall for rest of the season, which ends on Sept 30, the total is likely to cross 750mm. That will put this season's rainfall as second-highest in north India in last 50 years, behind 813.5mm recorded in 1988 and ahead of 737mm logged in 1994.During the past two weeks of weather fury, the region's total monsoon rainfall surplus climbed steeply from 11.6% on Aug 22 to nearly 37% on Thursday. Across a large region such as north India, the mean daily rainfall to sustain such high levels for two weeks is rare. So, what caused this prolonged spell of intense rain?""This period saw a rare instance of back-to-back spells of two-system interactions, that is, a 'western disturbance' bringing moist wind flows from regions close to the Mediterranean Sea converging with monsoon winds from the east.The first such interaction took place from Aug 23 to 27, and then another one began on Aug 29 and is expected to last till Friday,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, IMD chief.Such interactions are known to unleash very heavy rainfall and cloudbursts in the western Himalayan states, the most devastating example being Kedarnath deluge in June 2013. While such two-system convergences are uncommon in the peak monsoon period of July-Aug, back-to-back occurrences are extremely rare.Except for east UP, the two-week spell caused extreme rain in all sub-divisions of northwest India. Punjab was most heavily impacted, logging 388% surplus rain in the first week and 454% in the second. In the past week ending Sept 3, the subdivision of Haryana, Delhi and Chandigarh recorded 325% excess rainfall, Himachal Pradesh 314%, west Rajasthan 285%, J&K 240% and Uttarakhand 190%.","North India recorded 205.3mm of rain in these 14 days against a normal of 73.1mm.

NEW DELHI: India and Singapore announced a new road map for their comprehensive strategic partnership aimed at advancing cooperation in a range of areas like economic cooperation, skill development, digitalisation, connectivity, sustainability, healthcare, people-to-people contacts and defence and security, as PM Narendra Modi held talks with his visiting counterpart Lawrence Wong.Announcing the road map, Modi said India's ties with Singapore go far beyond diplomacy.""This is a partnership with purpose, rooted in shared values, guided by mutual interests, and driven by a common vision for peace, progress and prosperity,"" he said while thanking Singapore also for its support to India on the issue of cross-border terrorism and the Pahalgam attack.He said both sides had charted a detailed road map for the future of the partnership. ""Our cooperation will not remain confined to traditional areas. In keeping with the needs of changing times, advanced manufacturing, green shipping, skilling, civil nuclear energy, and urban water management will also emerge as focus points of our collaboration,"" he said, adding that to further accelerate bilateral trade, a time-bound review will be undertaken of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, as well as the Free Trade Agreement with Asean.The two countries also signed five agreements in areas like space, digitalisation, civil aviation and space. They also agreed to explore civil nuclear cooperation.The leaders backed the growth of India's semiconductor industry and ecosystem, including through cooperation under the India-Singapore Semiconductor Policy Dialogue, facilitating partnerships with Singapore companies and advancing resilient semiconductor supply chains, said a joint statement. Modi said the Semiconductor Ecosystem Partnership Agreement, concluded last year, had given a new impetus to research and development.There was a lot of focus on expanding defence and security cooperation as the leaders backed continued exchanges, including regular meetings between the defence ministers, and continued military cooperation and exchanges through joint army, naval and air force exercises in various formats. They also agreed to deepen technology cooperation in emerging areas such as quantum computing, AI, automation and unmanned vessels.According to the joint statement, Singapore acknowledged with appreciation India's interest in the Malacca Straits Patrol, a maritime security initiative involving Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore.""Singapore is a vital pillar of our Act East Policy. Together, we will continue to advance cooperation with Asean and carry forward our joint vision for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region,"" said Modi, adding both countries share common concerns regarding terrorism and believe that it is the duty of all nations that value humanity to unite in the fight against this menace.The joint statement reaffirmed strong commitment to combat terrorism, including cross-border terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, and reiterated zero-tolerance to terrorism. It said both countries will strengthen cooperation to fight against global and regional terrorism and terror organizations, including those proscribed by the UNSC 1267 Sanctions Committee and against terror financing, through bilateral mechanisms, FATF and other multilateral platforms.","India and Singapore announce a new road map for their comprehensive strategic partnership.

NEW DELHI/GUWAHATI: Days before PM Modi is due to visit Manipur, two key peace deals - one with the Kuki-Zo Council for opening the arterial Imphal-Dimapur National Highway 2 for the movement of commuters and goods, and the second with two Kuki umbrella militant outfits for renewal of the suspension of operations (SoO), while maintaining the territorial integrity of Manipur - have been finalised.A meeting among the representatives of the ministry of home affairs, govt of Manipur, Kuki National Organisation (KNO) and United People's Front (UPF) here on Thursday led to the signing of a tripartite SoO among them. Though the SoO was in force since 2008, it could not be renewed after Feb 2024 due to the ongoing ethnic tension. Importantly, the agreement inked on Thursday hints at the start of a tripartite, political dialogue with KNO and UPF to pave the way for ""a negotiated political settlement under the Constitution in a time-bound manner"".The latest, yearlong extension of SoO comes with renegotiated terms - KNO and UPF have agreed to the relocation of seven designated camps to less vulnerable areas, reduction in number of camps, relocation of weapons to nearest CRPF or BSF camps, physical verification of cadres to delist foreign nationals, and payment of 'remuneration' to cadres via direct benefit transfer.A joint monitoring group will closely watch the enforcement of ground rules, and violations dealt with firmly, said MHA. The revised ground rules for SoO endorse the need to work on a negotiated solution to bring lasting peace and stability to the state.""KNO and UPF as well as their constituents shall completely abjure the path of violence and abide by the Constitution of India, the laws of the land, and the territorial integrity of Manipur,"" the SoO agreement states.Experts described the peace pacts as a ""milestone"" in efforts to establish peace in Manipur. A reaffirmation of the state's territorial integrity signals a retreat from their demand for a separate administration, said officials. However, the Kuki Zo Council, in a clarification issued later, said it hopes for ""a political dialogue for a 'separate administration' under the Constitution of India"".Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh played down the importance of Thursday's development. In a post on X, he said, ""SoO first came into force on Aug 1, 2005. It was subsequently formalised on Aug 22, 2008. It was allowed to lapse in Feb 2024. If anything, state BJP leaders had been critical of SoO. It was the Congress that created the breakthrough in the first place.""The MHA statement on Thursday said talks between its senior officials and Kuki-Zo Council led the latter to decide on opening NH-2 for unrestricted movement of human and goods traffic. KZC has given a commitment to cooperate with security forces deployed by the govt of India to maintain peace along NH-2.Sources in the Manipur govt said the central forces will remain deployed in adequate numbers in the buffer zones. A senior IPS officer told TOI that it may take some time before the ethnic tensions are sorted and all, including Meiteis, are able to move freely in buffer zones.Over 260 persons have died and more than 60,000 displaced since ethnic violence broke out in Manipur in May 2023.","Kuki groups agree to deposit arms, delist foreign nationals.

India's GST Big Reset Is Logical, Transparent, And Not About Trump Tariffs: Says Sanjeev Sanyal

Consumer Goods (FMCG)

Consumer Durables

Hotels and Air Travel

Insurance

Car Dealers

What Happens Next





NEW DELHI: With the govt announcing sweeping GST rate reductions on nearly 400 goods and services, companies across sectors are working to adjust prices and pass on the benefits to consumers by the Sept 22 implementation date.TOI spoke to companies and industry experts to understand how different sectors plan to pass on the GST cuts.Under the GST framework, tax is applied at multiple stages of production and distribution. Companies claim input tax credit (ITC) on GST paid for inputs. However, once goods are manufactured and invoiced, the applicable GST is locked in - based on the rate at the time of sale.This means goods already dispatched to dealers before Sept 22 carry price tags that reflect the old tax rate. Adjusting those prices midstream requires coordination across manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.""Trade promotions and schemes may need recalibration. Distributors might seek credit adjustments for inventory purchased at higher GST rates. Companies also need to update ERP systems, billing software, and point-of-sale terminals,"" said Naveen Malpani, partner and consumer industry leader at Grant Thornton Bharat.While large retail chains can adapt quickly thanks to integrated technology platforms, smaller stores and traditional kirana retailers may face difficulties updating systems in time, he added.The govt has made it clear the objective is to benefit the end consumer. ""This reform has been implemented with a consumer-centric lens. GST, being embedded in the price paid by the consumer, is being recalibrated to deliver that benefit directly,"" said MS Mani, partner at Deloitte India.Here's a sector-by-sector snapshot:In the fast-moving consumer goods segment, strategy depends on product pricing. For fixed-price packs (for example, Rs 5 or Rs 10 namkeens and biscuits), companies are expected to increase grammage rather than cut prices, to retain the psychological price point.For other items such as shampoos, soaps, and toothpaste, revised stickers will be placed once the new rates come into force. Pricing differences on old inventory will be adjusted through the credit note system between manufacturers, distributors, and retailers - ensuring that frontline sellers aren't burdened.White goods companies - selling TVs, ACs, refrigerators, and washing machines - are optimistic about the changes. The GST on these items drops from 28% to 18%, and firms are expecting a demand boost ahead of the festival season.Many companies had proactively assured dealers they would bear the losses on unsold inventory billed under old rates. For example, an air conditioner billed at Rs 20,000 earlier attracted Rs 5,600 GST (28%). Under the revised rate, the tax drops to Rs 3,600. To avoid a Rs 2,000 hit per unit post-Sept 22, some manufacturers are willing to compensate.Hotel room rates belowRs 7,500 a night will attract 5% GST, down from 12%. However, only customers opting to pay at check-in will benefit. If the room was paid for in advance, the service is treated as already rendered under earlier rates - even if the stay is after Sept 22.Similarly, GST on premium economy, business and first class air tickets is being increased from 12% to 18%. Tickets paid for before Sept 22 will continue under old rates.Health and life insurance policies purchased by individuals will now be fully exempt from GST. This translates into an 18% notional savings for consumers. However, insurers have raised concerns. As input tax credit on goods and services used by them - such as printing, IT, transport - has been withdrawn, they may no longer be able to offset those costs.Some insurers are considering value-adds (for instance, enhanced room eligibility or personal accident cover) when an existing policy is renewed, instead of cutting premiums. Govt officials are nudging industry to ensure benefits by way of lower premiums reaching policyholders. While many insurers may initially pass on benefits, they are also evaluating adjustments in future pricing.This segment is an outlier - facing significant temporary distress because of anticipated GST cuts. Several car dealers have flagged losses due to high inventory levels built up after PM Narendra Modi's Aug 15 announcement that rate cuts were being considered.Now, with cess structures revised, dealers fear steep losses on unsold vehicles. For instance, a car previously taxed at 50% (28% GST + 22% cess) will now attract 40% tax - but with dealers already paying the cess on old stock, they can't claim refunds. They will also have to pay 12% additional GST on some models, leaving them staring at a hit.Manufacturers in the auto sector have not universally committed to protecting dealers. Some have offered partial support, but many dealers feel exposed. Industry bodies are in discussions with the govt seeking relief.From updating billing software and reprinting stickers to issuing credit notes and managing dealer expectations, businesses are navigating complex operational challenges. Govt, meanwhile, will monitor compliance to ensure that the benefits of tax cuts are passed on.","Companies across sectors are working to adjust prices and pass on the benefits to consumers.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders. The meeting focused on artificial intelligence and investments in the United States.More than a dozen CEOs attended the event, including Bill Gates, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai. Trump, seated between first lady Melania Trump and Zuckerberg, asked each executive to share how much their companies were investing in America.One conspicuous absence was Elon Musk. The Tesla and SpaceX chief, once among Trump’s closest industry allies, has distanced himself in recent months following clashes over space policy and government contracts.Five Indian-origin executives — including Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Sundar Pichai (Google), Sanjay Mehrotra (Micron), Vivek Ranadive (TIBCO) and Shyam Sankar (Palantir) — were at the table. Their presence underscored the growing clout of Indian Americans in Silicon Valley and Washington, even as Trump moved to crack down on immigration.Trump brushed aside the significance of Friday’s jobs report, arguing that the “real economic numbers” will only be visible a year from now.He also downplayed current gains as being mostly construction-related and promised that the US would soon witness job growth “like our country has never seen before.”When asked if he planned to speak with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Trump confirmed, “I will be, yeah. We’re having a very good dialogue.” The remark came as Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on with no ceasefire in sight. Trump added that resolving the conflict had turned out to be “a bit tougher” than he initially expected, despite his claimed success in settling seven other wars.Sundar Pichai thanked Trump, telling him, “I’m glad it’s over” after a US judge threw out a landmark case that sought to break up Google’s Chrome browser. The ruling sparked a surge in Alphabet’s market value, which crossed $2.5 trillion this week. For Pichai, the dinner was a chance to reset ties with an administration that had frequently accused Google of bias.Bill Gates openly praised Trump’s Covid-19 vaccine initiative, calling it a model for rapid medical innovation. He said Microsoft was committed to helping the US government in disease research and listed ongoing projects on HIV, polio and sickle cell. Gates’ comments were made just hours after RFK Jr’s contentious hearing over vaccine policy.Trump said he did not watch health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s Senate testimony but heard he performed “very well.” Calling Kennedy a “very good person” who “means very well,” Trump noted he appreciates his different ideas, even if they are contentious. The hearing itself was marked by heated clashes over Kennedy’s sweeping health care and vaccine policy changes.","US president Donald Trump hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders.

Sydney Sweeney’s viral denim campaign set the tone for American Eagle’s comeback

Travis Kelce’s timing with Taylor Swift spotlight amplified American Eagle’s momentum



American Eagle’s latest financial surge is proof that celebrity influence can reshape an entire brand’s future. In 2025, the clothing retailer posted a remarkable 25% stock jump after its second-quarter earnings, and executives credited the success directly to the star-driven campaigns led by actress Sydney Sweeney and NFL star Travis Kelce.Sydney Sweeney, best known for her role in Euphoria, became the centerpiece of American Eagle’s summer campaign with the tagline “Sydney has great jeans.” The cheeky play on words worked brilliantly—her branded denim line sold out within days, with some pieces disappearing in less than 24 hours.Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told investors, “Sydney Sweeney sells great jeans,” framing the collaboration as not just a product push but a “brand and business reset.”The campaign dominated social platforms like TikTok, seeped into late-night comedy skits, and even caught the attention of former President Donald Trump, who called the ads “fantastic.” The buzz, however, came with controversy, sparking culture-war debates online about the objectification of celebrities in marketing.But for American Eagle, the results spoke for themselves—billions of impressions and a sudden return to cultural relevance.Hot on the heels of Sweeney’s viral success, American Eagle launched its men’s line campaign with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Fresh from his engagement to Taylor Swift, Kelce brought a wave of media attention that no marketing budget could buy. His playful post, “Rockin’ AE’s new fits—comfort meets style, let’s go!” was shared widely, and Swift’s fanbase amplified the campaign, driving millions of organic impressions.Also Read: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s big day may not include Chiefs teammate after sexist comments ignites outrage Together, Sweeney and Kelce generated an estimated 40 billion impressions for the brand.

Donald Trump recently slammed Europe and other nations for imposing Digital Tax on American technology companies. In a post on Truth Social, Trump threatened to impose “substantial” tariffs on any country that enacts Digital Taxes. Now a report in Bloomberg claims that Trump's threat came after Meta Platforms Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mark Zuckerberg raised concerns about these levies during a White House meeting with the US President. Meta generates the vast majority of its revenue through advertising targeted at Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp users.Trump added in the post that he would put all countries with such taxes “on notice” and would also impose export restrictions on US semiconductors.The President’s comments have reignited a long-running feud with US trading partners, one that started long before last week’s meeting with Mark Zuckerberg. US officials have pressed the matter in trade talks with other nations and the European Union, arguing that digital taxes unfairly impact US tech companies such as Meta, Amazon.com Inc. and Google owner Alphabet Inc.During the meeting, which reportedly took place at the White House, the two men discussed digital taxes and the broader threat of what they consider European regulatory overreach. Meta, which makes most of its money from targeted advertising on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, is directly impacted by these taxes, which are imposed on the revenue tech companies generate from users in a specific country.The private White House meeting is the latest sign of a changed dynamic between Zuckerberg and Trump, who once called the Meta CEO a “criminal.” The two have been mending their relationship since Trump's return to power. Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly made several visits to the White House and Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, and his company also contributed $1 million to Trump’s inauguration.The two have discussed topics ranging from artificial intelligence to European regulation of Big Tech. Trump publicly acknowledged the improved relationship on Tuesday during a Cabinet meeting when he held up a graphic given to him by Zuckerberg, showing the scale of a new Meta data center in rural Louisiana. Trump expressed awe at the project, stating he was told it would cost $50 billion.While the meeting with Zuckerberg appears to have directly preceded Trump's recent comments, the president's opposition to digital taxes is not new. His administration has consistently pressed other nations and the European Union on the issue, arguing that the taxes unfairly target U.S. tech companies.Nations that currently have digital services taxes include France, Italy, Austria, Spain and the UK.","Donald Trump recently slammed Europe and other nations for imposing Digital Tax on American technology companies.

Population collapse: Elon Musk’s ongoing concern



A global warning by Tesla CEO Elon Musk



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has one again stirred debate over global population decline . Musk recently responded to a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) involving a Pakistani man’s inflammatory comment towards a Danish man. The post shared consists of a video in which a Pakistani man was seen claiming that Danes will soon be ‘exterminated’ in their own country and replaced by Pakistanis . Musk has now responded to the video claiming that the Maths of the Pakistani man is correct.In the video shared a Pakistani man can be seen arguing with a Danish man surrounded by cops. The Pakistani man said, “We shall stay sitting on your hearts for the rest of life man, we have got 5 children and you have only 1 and 2.”“In the next 10-15 years there will be more Pakistanis than Danes in this country,” added the Pakistani.The Pakistani further stated “Danes are just 5 million and soon you will be exterminated. Look at Swedes, look at Norwegians, look at Finnish. We are in millions.”Another Pakistani man present in the same video said, “I got married and I am also having 5 kids tomorrow. So, go and give birth to more children man.”Replying to this video shared on X, Elon Musk replied that the Maths of the Pakistani man is correct. “His math is correct,” wrote Musk.Elon Musk’s comment aligns with his repeated assertions that population collapse—not overpopulation—is the real existential threat to civilization. Musk earlier argued that declining birth rates could lead to economic stagnation, labour shortages, and even civilizational decline if not addressed. “Most people still think the world is overpopulated,” Musk said in earlier interviews. “It’s actually the opposite.”Japan has been the focal point for population collapse, but Elon Musk’s warning also applies to other nations such as South Korea, Italy and parts of Eastern Europe as they are also facing similar trends. This issue of population collapse has also sparked the interests of pro-natalist policies, immigration reform, and even the role of AI and robotics in offsetting labor gaps.Recently, Elon Musk issued a stark warning about Japan. In a post on microblogging platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the tech billionaire wrote: “Japan will lose almost a million people this year.” In the post, Musk said that this demographic was set in motion half a century ago adding that the population decline in the country “has nothing to do with AI.” “AI is the only hope for turning this around,” the tech CEO further stated.Elon Musk was responding to an X post that said: “Japan's population falling with 900,000 more deaths than births in 2024”.Recently, a report claimed that Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg if he was willing to help him finance $97.4 billion to take over ChatGPT maker OpenAI.","Elon Musk responded to a video shared on X (formerly known as Twitter) involving a Pakistani man’s inflammatory comment towards a Danish man.

GST rate cut: Impact on ACs, dishwashers



The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council has approved a two-tier rate structure of 5% and 18%. Announcing the new GST reforms, union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said “We've reduced the slabs. There shall be only two slabs, and we are also addressing the issues of compensation cess”. The revised rates will take effect from September 22, bringing relief across a wide range of goods. Under the GST rate cut , most consumer electronics—such as air conditioners and televisions—will shift from the old 28% slab down to 18% GST. Similarly, the price of dishwashers, refrigerators, and washing machines will also see a price cut. Here’s a close look at revised tax rates across different categoriesFor the mobile phone category, the government has decided to keep the default tax slab. Currently, a GST of 18% is charged on mobile phones which will continue to remain the same. This means that there will be no reduction in the price of smartphones.Similarly, GST on laptops remain unchanged at 18%.The government has also slashed GST rates on TVs which has now been moved to 18% tax slab from the current 28%. As per the official press release, following items have been moved from 285 to 18% slab:Under the latest GST reforms, the government has reduced GST from 28% to 18% on air-conditioning machines and dishwashing machines.

Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22





Life Insurance Council, a forum for stakeholders in the sector, has requested the GST Council and the finance ministry to reduce GST on agents’ commissions from 18% to zero. The request comes after GST on premiums and reinsurance were brought down to zero.The council feels that if agents’ commissions continue to attract 18% GST, life insurance companies would lose out on a significant amount of input tax credit (ITC), which would impact the bottom line of these firms. Kamlesh Rao, chairperson of Insurance Awareness Committee (IAC-Life) of the council, said it would send its representation in this regard.Earlier, the council had sought a cut in GST on reinsurance and agents’ commissions, along with on premiums, primarily in protection products, such as term insurance. The GST Council, however, has reduced GST on savings products, such as unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs) and endowment policies, along with term policies for individuals.GST on group insurance was not reduced. According to Rao, the GST cut would benefit term policies the most as these policies earlier attracted 18% GST. In savings-oriented products, GST was already low. Ra added that he was optimistic of term products expanding following the GST cut.","GST on premiums and reinsurance were brought down to zero.

MUMBAI: The reduction in health insurance premiums is unlikely to match the 18% GST cut as insurers are expected to pass some of the costs arising from input taxes to customers.While health insurance has seen the biggest drop in GST — from 18% to zero — the loss of input tax credit means insurers may either pass on some of the costs to customers and distributors or absorb them as lower margins. According to the CEO of an insurance company, the cost of health insurance is likely to fall by around 11% if insurers account for the loss of input tax credit. “Those who were paying Rs 118 will end up paying around Rs 107,” he said.For the life insurance industry, the waiver of GST on plans with a savings component has come as a surprise, as many had expected it would apply only to pure life insurance, or term policies. For life insurance companies, costs would increase for insurers because of the unrecovered tax on inputs, said the CEO of a life insurance company. “For at-par policies, if the costs are not passed on, it might impact the bonuses,” he said. For non-life companies, the biggest boost is likely to come from higher automobile sales, as nearly 40% of their premiums come from motor insurance.“We are closely analysing the implications concerning the input tax credit. While it is anticipated that there will be lowering of the premiums due to lowering of the taxes, we are yet to understand the extent of this reduction as this will also depend upon availability of the input tax credit, which will become clearer over the coming days,” said Samir Shah, executive director and CFO, HDFC Ergo General Insurance.The GST waiver may also make individual policies cheaper than group covers, which will continue to be taxed at 18%. Buyers of some group covers may find it more economical to shift members to individual policies.“To ensure that the full intent of this policy is realised for customers, clarity on the treatment of insurers’ input tax credits and transitional arrangements will be essential. ACKO remains committed to working constructively with govt and industry peers to enable a smooth and transparent implementation,” said Animesh Das, MD & CEO of ACKO General Insurance",Insurers are expected to pass some of the costs arising from input taxes to customers.

GUWAHATI: India’s North-East — at the southern edge of the Himalayas, in the shadow of China — may be sitting on top of a vast, untapped treasure trove of minerals and rare earth elements (REE), estimated to be in excess of 70 million tonnes.The finding — in a recent report by Geological Survey of India (GSI), which carried out explorations — may hold immense promise for India’s clean energy ambitions, digital infrastructure and defence manufacturing. It also holds the potential of catapulting the North-East into a regional economic powerhouse.According to the GSI report, five of the North-Eastern states — Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Manipur and Nagaland — are rich in REE and mineral reserves, including of graphite, vanadium, lithium and cobalt, which are crucial for the manufacture of batteries, semiconductors and advanced alloys.This isn’t just economic opportunity; it’s a geopolitical pivot, say experts. Currently, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Australia and Chile lead global critical mineral production, whereas China dominates REE refining.If the North-East emerges as a mineral and REE hotspot, India would be positioned as a strategic counterweight, with supply chains diversified and domestic resilience bolstered amid shifting global dynamics.However, some warn against excess optimism. “The beneficiation (increasing concentration of valuable minerals within an ore) of these minerals... is not only tricky but will not be economically viable,” says Dhiraj Banerjee, professor emeritus of Delhi University’s geology department. “The cost will be several times more than it would take to import.”GSI has flagged what could become India’s first lithium brine prospect in Arunachal Pradesh, right at China’s doorsteps, along with Nagaland and Assam.Lithium brine refers to the salty underground water containing dissolved lithium salts that is used as a source to extract lithium, considered the holy grail for batteries.The lithium brine discovery may not immediately shake global markets, but it signals a strategic shift with long-term implications for supply chains, pricing dynamics, and geopolitical leverage, having the potential to challenge the dominance of the “Lithium Triangle” (Chile, Argentina, Bolivia) and Australia’s hard rock mines.“These occurrences merit further exploration, especially given India’s dependency on lithium imports,” GSI notes in its report.Among the standout discoveries are 13.8 million tonnes of vanadium reserves in Arunachal Pradesh, marking India’s first major find of this alloying element, and graphite deposits exceeding 17.9 million tonnes, suitable for lithium-ion battery production. REE anomalies (deviations in the concentration of certain REEs) have been identified across Arunachal, Assam and Meghalaya, with Assam alone holding 28.6 million tonnes.“Almost every district in the state has minerals deposits,” says Tassar Talar, Arunachal’s geology and mining department director. “Wherever you go, there are mineral deposits. We have given prospecting licences to more than 20 mining companies, but mining is yet to start.” He feels the state could be “India’s richest state” once all the Meghalaya Meghalaya minerals are extracted.Arunachal has also emerged as India’s most significant domestic source of natural flake graphite, with 24.8 million tonnes of it confirmed. These deposits are not just abundant — they’re highquality, making them ideal for lithiumion battery anodes, lubricants, and advanced composites.Co-occurring with graphite is vanadium, a critical alloying element used in aerospace and vanadium redox flow batteries — a scalable solution for grid-level energy storage.In Pakke Kessang district, near the Pakke Tiger Reserve, lies Lodoso, a biodi- Manipur versity hotspot and mineral powerhouse. Beneath its subtropical forests, GSI has delineated 2.2 million tonnes of REEs, including significant concentrations of neodymium — vital for permanent magnets in EVs and wind turbines.Jashora Alkaline Complex in Assam’s Karbi Anglong has emerged as a standout player, with 28.6 million tonnes of REEs. Meghalaya’s Sung Valley, straddling West Jaintia and East Khasi Hills, is home to an ultramafic-alkaline-carbonatite complex with potential for laterite-hosted REE extraction.The Sung Valley, located approximately 45km east of Shillong and home to Muskut village and Mawiong Sung village, highlights the potential for laterite-hosted REE extraction, according to the GSI report.The West Khasi Hills have also shown promise of lateritic bauxite deposits enriched with iron and titanium. Some bauxite caps have returned anomalous REE values, offering a rare opportunity for dual-commodity extraction: industrial and strategic minerals from a single resource.Nickel and cobalt, tucked within the ophiolite belts of Nagaland and Manipur, have also drawn attention. Found as trace elements in lateritised ultramafic rocks, these metals demand sophisticated beneficiation, but the payoff could be transformative for India’s battery supply chain.One of the most promising sites is the Mollen-Washello area in Nagaland’s Phek district, near the Indo-Myanmar border. Here, the nickel-cobalt-chromium suite has positioned Nagaland as a high-potential state for future critical mineral exploration.Despite its mineral wealth, the North-East’s development has long been constrained by difficult terrain, ecological sensitivity, limited infrastructure and socio-political complexities. But change may finally be underway.“In recent years, the exploration mandate has assumed greater national urgency with India’s aspiration to become Atmanirbhar,” writes Asit Saha, GSI’s director-general, in the ministry of mines’ handbook.Already, seven out of 38 exploration blocks handed over to state governments have been successfully auctioned to bidders. As global supply chains face disruption and resource nationalism rises, the North-East offers a path to diversification and resilience. It’s not just about mining — it’s about strategic autonomy, clean energy leadership and geopolitical leverage.Rare Earth Elements (REEs) are a group of 17 chemically similar metallic elements. These elements are dispersed in the Earth’s crust, making them difficult and costly to extract and refine","India’s North-East may be sitting on top of a vast, untapped treasure trove of minerals and rare earth elements (REE), estimated to be in excess of 70 million tonnes.

As govt prepared for the first major rejig of GST rates since its launch eight years ago, investors on Dalal Street followed the classic stock market strategy of ‘buy on expectations, sell on news’.In the run up to the announcement, stocks of several companies that investors expected would benefit from the GST rate changes, had rallied. But after the actual rejig was announced, the initial euphoria soon gave way to a flat closing for benchmark indices, including the stocks of most of the rate-cut beneficiaries.On Thursday, sensex opened the session up nearly 900 points but gave up most of the gains by the day’s closing and ended just 150 points (0.2%) up at 80,718 points.“In-line outcome of GST rationalisation (move) and the ongoing tariff threats from the US exerted a negative impact on the market (on Thursday),” said Vinod Nair of Geojit Investments. As the negative impacts of the US tariff-related issues start affecting the Indian economy , “the GST rate cut is expected to significantly boost domestic consumption demand, countering the adverse effects of (India’s) diminished export competitiveness”, Nair said.Among the sectoral indices, BSE’s auto index closed 0.7% higher while the consumer discretionary index closed a marginal 0.2% higher. The consumer durables index was barely changed over Wednesday’s close. This, despite most companies from these sectors being perceived to be the major beneficiaries from the GST rejig, effective Sept 22.On Thursday, after several sessions of strong selling, net outflow by foreign funds from the stock market was relatively muted at Rs 106 crore. Domestic funds, on the other hand, were net buyers at Rs 2,233 crore, BSE data showed.The day’s session, despite the gains for leading indices, left investors poorer by Rs 1.5 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 451 lakh crore.In the commodities space, the two precious metals — gold and silver — witnessed some fall in prices, mainly due to profit-taking after about a week’s rally to new all-time high levels.On Friday, the US is scheduled to announce the nonfarm payroll data. In case this also shows some weakness compared to earlier months’, the chances of a cut in interest rate in the US would rise. That in turn could lead to increase demand and higher prices for precious metals, analysts said.","Sensex opened the session up nearly 900 points but gave up most of the gains by the day’s closing and ended just 150 points (0.2%) up at 80,718 points.

Encroachments spread everywhere:

62 hectares taken under legal residential schemes (Madanpur Khadar, Commonwealth Games Village).

Nearly 980 hectares encroached by unauthorised colonies and JJ clusters.

About 340 hectares eaten up by transport projects.

PM Modi Hails GST Reforms As 'Double Dhamaka Of Happiness Before Diwali', Slams Cong-Era Taxes





BENGALURU: In a move to lower costs and remove longstanding ambiguities, the GST Council simplified the tax structure for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Commercial drones now attract 5% GST, while military drones, flight motion simulators, high-performance batteries and communication equipment, such as software-defined radios have been fully exempted. At the same time, GST on aircraft for personal use was raised from 28% to 40%.Industry executives said the decision recognises drones as both an economic opportunity and a strategic necessity and is expected to accelerate adoption across agriculture, logistics, surveillance, and defence.“Earlier, the lack of clarity on whether drones with cameras attracted 5%, 18%, or even 28% GST often led to disputes and compliance risks,” said Smit Shah, president of the Drone Federation of India. “The new structure removes harassment, eliminates cost arbitrage between firms, and levels the field. With revenues of around Rs 2,500 crore in FY25 and about $500 million invested in over 600 startups, the sector is positioned for sharper growth. ”For operators like Garuda Aerospace, the rationalisation directly impacts pricing and recurring revenues. “Since Garuda recently entered defence sales, the 0% GST is very welcome. But more important is batteries, main consumable for agri drones, are now exempt. We have our own BIScertified battery unit, and this allows us to pass on cost benefits to customers, while strengthening profitability,” said founder and CEO Agnishwar Jayaprakash.“The long-term impact will enable manufacturers to develop cutting-edge technology, expand defence contracts, and deliver cost-effective drones,” said Ankit Mehta, co-founder and CEO of listed player ideaForge.","Commercial drones now attract 5% GST, while military drones, flight motion simulators, high-performance batteries and communication equipment have been fully exempted.

GST revamp: Grocery bills won’t hurt your budget,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-revamp-grocery-bills-wont-hurt-your-budget/articleshow/123710625.cms,"AI image





MUMBAI: Come Navratri and your grocery bills will drop—that large pack of namkeen, noodles, chocolate or your favourite ice-cream will cost you less.This is because consumer goods companies will pass on the 7%-13% tax benefit incurred through GST cuts in two ways—by reducing prices of large packs and increasing grammage of small packs.While the range of price cuts will vary across categories and for companies, a lot will also depend on how competition is strategising, firms have started to plan their pricing moves internally.A host of FMCG players including Amul, Mondelez, Godrej Consumer (GCPL), Colgate and Kellanova said that they will pass on the benefit of reduced GST rates to consumers.“We have 600 SKUs across our businesses that will benefit from GST reductions and we have started planning pricing strategies. This is a good opportunity for us to see spike in demand,” Jayen Mehta, MD at Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) which owns Amul told TOI .Mehta said that for dairy categories such as UHT milk, butter, ghee and paneer, full benefits can be passed on to consumers given that the size of the packs are not very small. Mayank Shah, vice-president at Parle Products added that the full benefit will be passed on as per the anti-profiteering provisions; only the mode of doing it might vary.Overall in FMCG, there could be an average price reduction of about 10% for consumers, said Dhairyashil Patil, national president at The All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF).In India, consumption growth has been slow and uneven for the past several quarters—blame weak demand in urban markets where inflation hit consumers had cut back on purchases.Alongside tax breaks and interest rate reductions, the GST boost will put more money in hands of the middle class consumers, bolstering FMCG volume growth.“Urban consumers who represent 30% of the population but account for nearly 70% of packaged goods consumption will particularly feel this positive impact,” said Tarun Arora, CEO & whole-time director at Zydues Wellness.","A host of FMCG players including Amul, Mondelez, Godrej Consumer (GCPL), Colgate and Kellanova said that they will pass on the benefit of reduced GST rates to consumers.
