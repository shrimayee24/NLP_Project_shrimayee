"'Bedsheets unchanged, toilets inaccessible': Tejashwi Yadav flags crisis at Bihar govt hospital; calls it 'double jungle raj'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bedsheets-unchanged-toilets-inaccessible-tejashwi-flags-crisis-at-bihar-govt-hospital-calls-it-double-jungle-raj/articleshow/123878070.cms,"Photo/screengrab

NEW DELHI: Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Sunday accused the NDA government in Bihar of presiding over a collapse in public healthcare after inspecting Purnea’s Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH).He pointed to patients sharing beds, toilets unfit for use, and bedsheets not changed for weeks, calling the situation a sign of ""double jungle raj"" under the ruling alliance. His remarks came a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled visit to the state.Tejashwi visited GMCH on Saturday night and shared visuals of his inspection on X. He wrote, ""Last night, a surprise inspection was conducted at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Purnea. Watch a glimpse of the deplorable state of the healthcare system under 20 years of NDA in the video.""He highlighted the absence of an ICU, non-functional trauma and cardiology departments, and unclean toilets. He also said multiple patients were being made to share single beds. ""This is a medical college and hospital, but there is no ICU here. The trauma centre is not operational. There is no cardiology department, i.e.,no heart disease department. Three patients are made to lie on a single bed. Bedsheets of patients are not changed even after 15-20 days. The toilets for patients with orthopaedic issues and those requiring disability-related surgeries are two feet high. There is absolutely no cleanliness,"" he wrote.The RJD leader claimed that only 55 nurses were working at the hospital in three shifts, against a sanctioned strength of 255. He alleged that 80% of doctors’ posts were vacant, with just four OT assistants for the entire hospital. He added that several departments were closed, professors existed ""only in name,"" and medical interns had not been paid for six months.""GMCH is a Medical College Hospital, but out of the sanctioned 255 nurse posts, only 55 nurses are working, and that too in three shifts. This means only 18 nurses are on duty at a time. If some are on leave, the number is even lower. 80 per cent of the doctor posts at GMCH are vacant. There is not a single permanent dresser at GMCH. The entire college and hospital have only four OT assistants. Many of the 23 departments are closed. Professors and assistant professors are present only in name. Medical interns have not received their salaries for 6 months,"" he stated.Yadav also alleged corruption in the construction of hospital buildings and the purchase of medical equipment. He said poor staffing and lack of facilities were forcing around 10,000 patients in Purnea to seek private treatment daily. ""The corrupt ministers and officials of the NDA government spend thousands of crores of rupees just to build structures, eating commissions in corruption, but they do not appoint doctors, healthcare workers, lab technicians, dressers, assistants, etc. They purchase medical equipment worth thousands of crores for commissions but do not hire technicians to operate them,"" he said.Ahead of PM Modi’s visit, Tejashwi took a dig at the Centre and the state government, referring to them as “double jungle raj.” He said, ""Tomorrow, Prime Minister Modi ji is coming to Purnea in Seemanchal to shower rhetoric. Despite occupying such a high position, will he not see the massive shortcomings of his 20 years of governance in Bihar and 11 years at the centre under the double-engine government before indulging in petty and small talk?""He added, ""Prime Minister Modi ji will surely give a sermon on the corruption, unemployment, poverty, failures of the NDA government, looting of the poor in the name of treatment, and the deplorable state of education and healthcare systems, as well as the double jungle raj of the double-engine government in Bihar over the past 20 years.""Calling on the PM to visit GMCH with CM Nitish Kumar, he said, “Prime Minister ji, please do visit this medical college in Purnea tomorrow and make sure to bring along the Chief Minister from 2005 onwards; otherwise, he will say, was there anything before 2005?”The Prime Minister is scheduled to inaugurate the Purnea Airport on September 15 and address a public rally at Shishabari village, where people from Purnia, Katihar, Araria, and Kishanganj districts are expected to attend.","Tejashwi Yadav visited Purnea’s Government Medical College and Hospital.

"Projects, not politics: PM Modi resets Manipur pitch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/projects-not-politics-pm-modi-resets-manipur-pitch/articleshow/123878116.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Modi's visit to Manipur Saturday - his first since the 2023 outbreak of ethnic violence - was always expected to be a high-visbility affair with high stakes. It lived up to the billing, with Modi reaching out to Meiteis and Kukis by emphasising well being of both the communities - parties to the dispute that shattered the peace and derailed development in the state.Modi promised to be partner and amplified the intent by laying foundation stones for projects totalling Rs 7,000-7,300 crore and announced targeted health, connectivity and education investments. The moves deliberately designed to reach ""the last mile"" and create economic anchors for social order. His speech in Churachandpur mixed soft appeals for peace with a sales pitch for growth - salute to local resilience, pledges on roads, rail and health, and promises to resettle displaced families.The PM's absence during the peak of the violence had drawn repeated attacks from the opposition, who accused him of ""turning his back on Manipur"" while lives were lost and thousands displaced. Modi, sources say, had a different calculus in mind. He asked authorities to fix law and order in a state with a porous border and awash with firearms, and prepare the ground for his message of development.Saluting Manipur as the ""land of courage and fortitude,"" Modi framed development as the antidote to despair.The PM also underlined that peace is a prerequisite for growth. ""Dialogue, respect and mutual understanding are key,"" he said, noting that earlier accords in the North-East had ended long standing disputes. By tying Manipur's healing to India's broader economic rise, Modi sought to recast the state as a frontier of opportunity rather than conflict.The opposition is not going to relent on criticism, but Modi govt seems to have reckoned that funds for development and presence of large number of central boots would help it prevail in battle of narratives.",Modi reaches out to Meiteis and Kukis by emphasising well being of both the communities.

Saving the tiniest lives: The story behind Kerala's surprising infant mortality feat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/saving-the-tiniest-lives-the-story-behind-keralas-surprising-infant-mortality-feat/articleshow/123877904.cms,"The latest Sample Registration System (SRS) report has highlighted a striking milestone for Kerala - the state had achieved an infant mortality rate (IMR) of 5, a figure lower than even the US (5.6). This achievement is all the more remarkable because for over two decades, between 1995 and 2015, Kerala's IMR stubbornly refused to fall below 12-15. Breaking free of that stagnation took persistence, innovation, and a rare partnership between the state govt and the paediatrician community.Infant mortality rate refers to the number of infant deaths under one year of age per 1,000 live births. Even at an IMR of 12, Kerala was well ahead of the rest of the country. However, while India's IMR fell from roughly 75 to 37 in the same two decades, showing remarkable progress, Kerala's IMR barely budged. This made the state govt take a hard look at what was holding Kerala back.The contrast became sharper because maternal mortality had steadily declined. Kerala's maternal mortality ratio (MMR) fell from 150 in the mid-1990s to 61 in 2011-13. In the latest report, its MMR is 30. Rajeev Sadanandan, who was then with the department of health and family welfare in Kerala, credits this success to a confidential review of maternal deaths started by Kerala Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (KFOG) in 2002.""They used to publish a fabulous report every three years called 'Why Our Mothers Die'. Every maternal death review was seen as a learning exercise and not a fault-finding exercise. This provided a very clear evidence-based template to reduce maternal deaths,"" explains Sadanandan.Like mother, like childWhen Sadanandan returned to the health department in 2011, he urged the Kerala branch of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) to adopt a similar approach for infant mortality. According to the then president of IAP's Kerala branch, Dr Sachidananda Kamath, the association decided to take up the challenge of bringing down Kerala's IMR to single digits.""With the help of the National Rural Health Mission and Kerala govt, IAP reviewed infant deaths in four districts,"" says Dr Kamath. ""We found that prematurity and congenital anomalies together accounted for more than 60% of infant deaths. We suggested interventions such as increasing the level of care and tackling deaths from heart diseases. Boosting neonatal care improved the survival of 28-week-old babies and even newborns weighing 900 gm were able to live. ""However, congenital anomalies, which accounted for almost 30% of infant deaths, were more challenging to tackle as they required access to highly skilled surgeons, medical infrastructure and financial resources. ""We decided to focus on congenital heart diseases, which is a significant proportion of congenital anomalies in infants,"" says Sadanandan, who served as the health secretary for 11 years.With leadership provided by paediatric cardiologist Dr Raman Krishna Kumar and foetal cardiologist Dr Balu Vaidyanathan in Amritha Hospital, Kochi, the govt launched Hridyam, the first ever population-level programme to address congenital heart diseases in a low-middle-income country. Its web-based application launched in 2017 serves as a registry where any physician in Kerala could add the name of a suspected case of congenital heart disease. Once listed, a paediatric cardiologist would review the online record within 24 hours and classify the case according to urgency. In case there was insufficient information, the cardiologist could direct the District Early Intervention Center at the local level to get further tests done. Patient registrations have risen steadily since launch.""A lot of deaths happen even before the child reaches the hospital or gets a diagnosis. Hridyam sought to minimise this attrition by ensuring timely screening and referral. Since this involved screening babies, the collateral benefit of screening was that other conditions such as respiratory conditions got picked up. Pulse oximeter screening within 24-48 hours of birth could identify babies who were sick or who could die. This way, we were able to save a lot of babies,"" says Dr Krishna Kumar. For this to work, hundreds of paediatricians, obstetricians and sonographers had to be trained to enhance their diagnostic skills. Private and public paediatric cardiac programmes that could be referral centres were identified and empanelled, even as the public sector capacity in three institutions was expanded.Neonatal transport networks were also strengthened, but risks during transit remained. This is where foetal echocardiography came in. ""Kerala's newborn registry study showed that many babies died before reaching a centre to get surgery. A mother's womb is the safest transport for a baby. So, the answer was to do foetal echo diagnosis during the mid-trimester scan, which is mandatory for all pregnancies. If a critical heart defect is suspected, the mother is referred to a person trained in foetal echocardiography. If that confirms a critical defect, the mother can be referred to a high-end centre for delivery so that the baby can be taken for emergency surgery soon after birth. It significantly improves the chances of survival,"" explains Dr Vaidyanathan. These measures, combined with Kerala's robust primary healthcare and female literacy, helped cut IMR to 5.Audit modelDeath audits also played a pivotal role. But since neither doctors nor hospitals like to do them, how did the medical community adopt it? Dr VP Paily, one of the founders of KFOG, says confidentiality was key, with neither the identity of the patient nor that of the doctor or hospital revealed to assessors. ""We only studied the circumstances of the death, the treatment given and whether it was preventable. There were some doubts initially, but once we gained the trust of the obstetricians, it was fine. This was important because 70% of births in Kerala happen in the private sector,"" said Dr Paily. The govt, meanwhile, was happy to get robust data without spending any money. This model is now seen as a cornerstone of Kerala's health gains.Still, experts warn of challenges ahead. Former IAP national president Dr Kamath notes that while Kerala is ahead of the US, there are several developed countries that have done better. Italy, Singapore, Japan, Korea, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Slovenia, Estonia and the Czech Republic have the lowest IMR of 2. ""Within Kerala, there are pockets where the IMR is much higher than 5. We need special strategies for tribal and vulnerable populations. We need to find out why prematurity is high in Kerala. We must take care of adolescent girls - our future mothers - and focus on their nutrition, exercise and the rise of non-communicable diseases among them. We need a good strategy to bring it down further.""Others caution against over-celebration. ""All this about Kerala's IMR being lower than the US is a bit misleading,"" says Sadanandan. ""SRS is at best an estimate, unlike the US which has an excellent statistical system. What matters is that we've managed to sustain single-digit IMR.""","Infant mortality rate refers to the number of infant deaths under one year of age per 1,000 live births. For over two decades, between 1995 and 2015, Kerala's IMR stubbornly refused to fall below 12-15. Kerala's maternal mortality ratio (MMR) fell from 150 in the mid-1990s to 61 in 2011-13.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123878007,imgsize-55218,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"
"Mohalla to Madison Square, meet the new wave of Muslim comics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mohalla-to-madison-square-meet-the-new-wave-of-muslim-comics/articleshow/123877900.cms,"Mohalla to Madison Square, meet the new wave of Muslim comics

They say Muslims are the most unemployed. Others claim Muslims are the most backward. Still others insist Muslims are the most uneducated. But judging by the sheer number of mushrooming eateries in Muslim areas, it seems that Muslims are simply the most hungry. ""That is a joke by Rehman Khan, born and raised in ""Mumbai's most too much place"" Kurla. His ""tandoori-roasted, biryani-laced, full-spice"" set 'Miyan Bhai Khana and Kurla' has racked up nearly three lakh views on YouTube. Fluent in street swagger and Bambaiya-laced slang, the now-Powai-based comic recalls the casual confidence of local boys who once approached him for a selfie saying: ""Chal Rehman bhai ko famous karke aate hain (let's make Rehman bhai famous). "" Legendary late comic Raju Srivastav too praised Rehman's grasp of language: ""How did you get the nuanceso right?""Indore-bred comedian Zakir Khan may have capped his blockbuster career with a sold-out show at Madison Square Garden in New York, but there is also a new wave of Muslim comics finding laughs in gullies and mohallas. From biryani to backstreet banter, they mine food obsessions and neighbourhood stereotypes while walking the tightrope of identityand scrutiny.Do not ask Haseeb Khan where he is from. Once, an uncle made that mistake. When Haseeb said ""MP"", the man's eyes lit up. ""Where in MP?"" he pressed. ""Bhopal,"" Haseeb replied. The uncle hugged him. ""Where in Bhopal,"" he asked. Haseeb stopped short of saying Jahangirabad - afraid the man might kiss him next.""Why can't people believe two people can hail from the same city?"" he wonders in his set 'Mein Karachi Se Hoon', which has earned him over one crore views on YouTube, apart from fans on both sides of the border. With over 4 lakh followers on Instagram spanning Lucknow to London, the Bhopal-born engineering dropout aka @a_sad_comic - who is sometimes mistaken for standup comic Zakir Khan's brother - has become a face of a small yet significant wave.Yet behind that laughter lies a quiet tension. ""There was a time when I used to perform and watch political comedy,"" says Rehman. ""Now I've stopped watching the news,"" he says, half-joking. A year ago, he found two of his corporate shows in a state that he does not name cancelled suddenly because of his political jokes. ""I have toned down my material a lot. It is suffocating and a bit sad,"" admits Rehman, who envies the freedom comics abroad enjoy.In India, political satire remains a minefield. Junagadh-born Munawar Faruqui's brushes with FIRs and controversy have underscored how fragile a minority comic's voice can be. ""There is always a fear of being targeted, especially in North India,"" says Adel Rehman, who hails from Arrah near Patna. His viral video 'Bihar' (2.8 lakh views) skewers stereotypes: ""Comedians smoke and drink after shows. In Bihar, they go home and study for UPSC"". Adel -who faced hecklers in Gurugram on two occasions - has now shifted base to Bengaluru, partly to be able to speak his mind.""I have been denied homes here too because of my identity but I find the city more open,"" says Adel, who runs comedy venues in Bengaluru. ""Jokes are jokes. They are not meant to offend. For instance, I do a lot of jokes on my dead father, both onstage and off it. It's not disrespect, it's how you cope with grief.""While A-listers can afford lawyers, many comics - who hail from tier 2 and 3 towns - cannot, he says. ""Going to jail is the last thing but there are other personal costs - threats, family members getting hassled, venues being ransacked, brands stepping away, and boycott culture,"" says Adel, who thinks twice before posting his sets online. ""I have also stopped reading the comments,"" he says.Ask him about the ratio of Muslim voices in standup and Adel quips: ""Just like in the Parliament, the representation is low."" It's rarer still to find Muslim women comics within this minority. Apart from established Mumbai comics such as Sumaira Shaikh (""I love gangsters. You are like, you are from Dongri. Of course, you don't like poets"") and Urooj Ashfaq, emerging voices include Delhi's Daahab Chishti, who grew up in a mohalla in Uttam Nagar, observing the ""nau sebarah shows""of gossiping aunties, a kirana store owner named Pappu uncle with capacious khatas (credit accounts) and his grandma who'd sit on a chatai, serving as the ""CCTV"" of the street. ""A mohalla,"" Chishti says in 'Ladke', which has nearly six lakh views, ""is an L-shaped gully which collects funds from residents to erect gates at both ends and calls itself a society.""In 2021, a severe bout of Covid landed her in an ICU for four months.'Alive' - her first special - was mostly about surviving, about what happens when yourlungs fight to remember breath. ""People are not comfortable with the ideaof joking about death,"" says Chishti, who cut out many bits from the show though she aches for a poignant special in the vein of Zakir Khan's 'Tathastu', an ode to his late grandfather.Daahab also feels the weight of identity in every joke she considers posting. ""Hundred percent, there is censorship,"" she says. ""I am a woman. I am a Muslim. I am a comedian - enough fodder for a news channel for a month,"" laughs Daahab, who has a set about Muslim identity that she will never post. If she does, she says it will either go viral or get her family into intense trouble or both. ""I have been given a new lease of life. I want to value it,"" deadpans Daahab.Recently, at an event in Islam Gymkhana in Mumbai, Rehman noticed the audience gravitate toward the buffet counter as soon as he began his set. ""I said, Assalam Walekum, mere bhooke musalmanon (greetings, my hungry brethren). They didn't like it,"" he says. On another occasion, when he joked about Muslims who were not getting vaccinated, members of the community said: ""Why are you spoiling our reputation?""While Rehman finds solace in a friend's refrain, ""Yeh gaali nahin, dua hai"" (these aren't abuses but blessings), he too, like Daahab, has learned to wrap political jokes in ""malmal"": not naming parties, using allegory, using subtext. In one of his sets, he gives his girlfriend a lotus on Valentine's Day.As for Daahab, she takes a friend - who has suddenly lost his voice - to a doctor in one of her routines. The doctor diagnoses him with Stage 2 Apolitical Syndrome: ""First, it takes away your spine, then your voice, then your mind and then the nation gets screwed over.""","There is a new wave of Muslim comics finding laughs in gullies and mohallas.

’s book has quietly sparked a revolution in water conservation across villages — one pond at a time

Why It Still Matters

What do you call a book that was first published without the author’s name on the cover, which has no copyright and encourages the reader to use it for free in any form, inspires common people to spend money from their own pockets and translate it, can be read in at least nine languages, including Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, and also in Braille, has been broadcast by at least 20 radio stations with over two lakh copies published, has almost become a holy book for water warriors and, yet, remains largely unknown to the educated public.Anupam Mishra’s ‘Aaj Bhi Khare Hain Talab (The Ponds Are Still Relevant)’ wasn’t launched in a farmhouse or nominated for major literary awards. But the book has become a movement. Spread over a frugal 119 pages, it reveals how ponds and lakes were fundamental to life and livelihoods across the country, and how their construction, preservation, and regeneration was embedded in community fabric — guided both by science and deeper philosophical values.First published by the Gandhi Peace Foundation in Hindi in 1993, the book continues to find fresh readers in new languages and forms. This year, it has been made accessible online in a disabled-friendly e-text, says Kailash Pande of Delhi Blind School.Ramon Magsaysay award recipient Rajendra Singh says that at a time when headlines rapidly shift from drought to flood, the book remains as relevant as ever. “The change in weather patterns is an outcome of climate change and global warming.The book shows how to adapt to and mitigate the current crisis,” says Singh, whose NGO Tarun Bharat Sangh also shaped Mishra’s early ideas.Aaj Bhi… was born out of Mishra’s extensive travels as a seeker and surveyor of India’s interiors in the 1980s. Mishra spoke less, listened more. A Gandhian by belief and environmentalist in action, he discovered a tradition of water-saving techniques in arid Rajasthan. In areas he couldn’t visit, Mishra sought the aid of friends and fellow travellers, naming each of them in the book. “The book harnessed indigenous water wisdom scattered across the country,” says social activist and old-time colleague Rakesh Dewan.At the turn of the 20th century, India had 11-12 lakh ponds, the book says. Mishra referenced the 1907 gazetteer to show that the princely state of Rewa in north-eastern Madhya Pradesh had 5,000 ponds. Early 20th century Madras Presidency was home to 53,000 ponds. Who would believe that in the early 20th century, Delhi had 350 ponds, as a 1930 map illustrates. Dewan says that officers posted to Jabalpur during the British Raj were advised not to bring fans because the ponds there ensured a cool weather.The book also details the craft of building ponds and devotes a chapter to their anonymous creators. Mishra illustrates how, for centuries, communities such as the Odhs, the Gonds, and the Ramnamis had dedicatedly constructed ponds. Such acts often cut across the caste spectrum. Building ponds was also part of the financial system. “Those who built ponds in the kingdom of Gond rajas got a tax break. This tradition was strong in Sambalpur region,” he writes.Digging ponds was among the punishments meted out by the caste panchayats of Bundelkhand. Ponds permeate every sinew of life.Many found the book addictive. Some finished it in one go and keep revisiting it. “People were mesmerised,” says Bhopal-based journalist Shabbir Qadri, who translated the book into Urdu and distributed it for free at madrasas and panchayats.Mishra, who passed away in 2016, would build a personal relationship with his readers. “I correspond with about 3,000-odd readers. The idea is to create awareness and build a movement through the book. You cannot do that without forming a long-standing relationship with them,” he told this reporter in 2004.One such reader was Surendra Bansal, then a freelance graphic designer in Punjab’s Malerkotla. He learnt about the book from a piece by journalist Prabhas Joshi in ‘Jansatta’ newspaper. “I read that article four times and wrote to Anupam-ji,” he says. “I didn’t have the address, so I just wrote, Anupam Mishra, Delhi”. Miraculously, the letter reached its destination. Mishra sent him two of his books with a hand-written note in his signature style.Bansal read the book and, then, translated it into Gurmukhi. He published it by selling off his prized cacti collection for Rs 11,000. “When Anupam-ji came to know about it, he first scolded me. Then he wept,” remembers Bansal, who now works for Haryana govt’s PR department. He has published five editions of the book in Gurmukhi. And he hasn’t stopped. Bansal regularly scans Punjabi magazines and sends free copies of the book to those he believes might be interested in water conservation. “I also distribute it to youth clubs and village libraries,” he says. Bansal has given away 6,200 copies so far.The book has also been used to groom community leaders. Aaj Bhi… was introduced as part of the syllabus in Chitrakoot’s Mahatma Gandhi Gramin Vishwavidyalaya. “It was taught to graduate students in 313 centres in a leadership course,” says retired civil servant B Rajagopal Naidu. The book was also part of the Hindi syllabus for graduates in Mumbai University between 2017 and 2019.Rajendra Singh, known as the ‘Waterman of India’, says Aaj Bhi… made a deep impact in MP and Rajasthan. Naidu, whose tenure as DM of Sagar in MP during 2002-04 was marked by a host of water management initiatives, says the book helped mobilise people and build awareness around check dams, and small drinking water ponds.He also remembers how the clean-up of Sagar’s sprawling Lakha Banjara lake got stuck due to a funds crunch. Help came in an unusual way. Film lyricist and Congress politician Vithalbhai Patel, who had penned the 1973 hit Bobby’s famous song, ‘Jhooth Bole Kawwa Kate’, went around every morning to the town’s different wards, asking people to donate Re 1 for the talab. The amount raised helped restore a huge portion of the lake.Such examples abound. Singh of Tarun Bharat Sangh, which constructed at least 7,500 ponds, says that dozens of initiatives were undertaken in Jodhpur and Barmer districts. “A sarpanch from Bikaner’s Nakhoda village called me after reading the book seeking help to build ponds,” he recalls.Chhatar Singh, a master of desert water conservation in Jaisalmer district, restored about 500 ponds, beris , and wells. A beri is a shallow well that harvests rainwater.“Reading the book I felt my forefathers were talking to me. It was written in a way that inspired action,” says Chhatar, who was also impressed by Mishra’s book, ‘Rajasthan Ki Rajat Boondein (The Silver Drops Of Rajasthan)’. He explains Mishra’s approach: “If you had any doubts about building ponds, Anupamji would organise a gathering. He knew the answer, but would let the answer emerge from us.”Eastern Rajasthan’s Lapodia village is a famous conservation success story. Its head Laxman Singh read Aaj bhi… and encouraged fellow villagers to do so too. Impressed by its message of reviving traditional methods, they undertook a textbook application of rainwater harvesting and water management techniques to transform a sun-dried area into a village of three fecund ponds — Dev Sagar, Phool Sagar, and Anna Sagar, with a 300 bigha meadow.Laxman Singh says Mishra visited Lapodia twice every year for 30 years. “He was our guide and guru. Pehle woh insaan taiyar karte thhey, phir dharti (First, he readied people, then the land),” Laxman told this reporter in 2016. When the book’s Braille edition came out around 2009, Mishra visited Delhi Blind School, inspiring students to perform shramdan, or voluntary labour, recalls Pande.Academic Annie Montaut, who has translated ‘Rajasthan Ki Rajat Boondein’ into French, writes how even prisoners of a French jail could relate to Mishra’s lecture on water conservation. Some recalled their own childhood in Morocco. “I was surprised by the reaction, he wasn’t. Anupam-ji told me that he had learnt a lot from the uneducated,” she wrote in Hindi to Mishra’s wife, Manjushree, for an upcoming book in tribute to her husband.It is almost a cliché that a book can change your world. Mishra’s slim volume certainly reaffirms that adage. With global water shortage now an impending reality, the book’s significance has magnified in recent years. Today Aaj Bhi… is to water conservationists what Das Capital is to Marxists. A ratna of Bharat, Mishra never received even a Padmashri. But his book continues to usher in a silent revolution, one pond at a time.","Anupam Mishra’s ‘Aaj Bhi Khare Hain Talab (The Ponds Are Still Relevant) has become a movement.

Earlier, the Ahmednagar district was renamed as Ahilyanagar district, PTI reported.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , who had pursued the matter, thanked Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw for granting the approval.Chief inmister Devendra Fadnavis and deputy chief minister Eknath Shinde were also involved in the efforts, a statement from Pawar’s office said.Last month, Pawar had written to Vaishnaw urging that the station be renamed to align with the city’s new name.“This long-pending demand has now been fulfilled. The renaming holds special significance as we are celebrating the 300th birth anniversary year of Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar,” Pawar said.Several organisations and citizens had been demanding that the railway station’s name be changed after the city was renamed Ahilyanagar.Pawar also said efforts are underway to rename Aurangabad railway station as Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar railway station.Earlier, a similar thing was done by Karnataka government but that didn't go well with Fadnavis.

PM Modi Appeals For Peace And Unity In His Speech During First Visit To Manipur Since 2023 Violence

What is the ‘PM Neem corridor’



NEW DELHI: Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on Sunday, a special 2.6-km corridor lined with Neem saplings has been prepared in Numaligarh, Assam’s Golaghat district.PM Modi will pass through the ‘PM Neem Corridor’ on his way to the Numaligarh Refinery , where he is scheduled to inaugurate a bamboo-based ethanol plant worth over Rs 5,000 crore.“On September 14, as the Hon'ble Prime Minister makes his way to the venue in Golaghat, he will be welcomed through the PM Neem Corridor - a 2.6km corridor planted with neem saplings,” Assam’s chief minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, said through a post on X.“A Green Tribute to India's biggest green warrior - Adarniya @narendramodi ji,” he added.During his visit, the Prime Minister will also lay the foundation stone for the Petro Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit, which is designed to produce 360 KTPA of propylene.Later on Sunday, he is scheduled to address a public rally at the Numaligarh Tanker Stand, marking the second day of his two-day visit to Assam.A “Neem Corridor” has been created by planting around 700 neem trees along both sides of a newly constructed 2-km road stretching from Letekujan, where a helipad has been built for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to the event venue near Numaligarh Refinery Limited in Golaghat district.The initiative, led by Khumtai MLA Mrinal Saikia, saw the chief minister also plant a seed during his visit last week to review preparations for the PM’s visit.Saikia, who has taken personal responsibility for nurturing the plants until they mature, said neem was chosen for its natural air-purifying properties and environmental benefits. “Neem improves air quality by removing toxins and offers a host of health, agricultural, and ecological advantages,” he said.“To honour the PM, who deeply values nature and greenery, I decided to plant neem trees along the entire 2-km stretch from the helipad to the venue,” Saikia added. He also mentioned that neem trees help stabilise soil and act as mosquito repellents, reducing disease risks. “Neem is a cornerstone of Ayurvedic medicine, often referred to as nature’s pharmacy. Every part of the tree — leaves, bark, seeds, roots — is used in home remedies and contributes to overall health and hygiene,” he said.Modi’s visit to the state, originally planned for September 8, was rescheduled to September 13 due to the vice-presidential elections.PM Modi arrived in Guwahati on Saturday for a two-day visit to Assam, during which he will attend a special tribute to legendary singer Bhupen Hazarika, officials said, as cited by PTI.On Sunday, he is scheduled to inaugurate and lay the foundation stones for projects totaling over Rs 19,000 crore.","PM Modi will pass through the ‘PM Neem Corridor’ on his way to the Numaligarh Refinery.

Stanford Meets India: Notes from a Country in Motion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stanford-meets-india-notes-from-a-country-in-motion/articleshow/123822979.cms,"The trip's postcard moment

daulat ki chaat

India 1: the top 100 million, global in outlook, on Netflix and credit cards.

India 2: the aspiring middle, mobile-first, leapfrogging basic infrastructure.

India 3: rural, cash-driven, still outside the formal economy.

.

On the first morning in Delhi, the jet lag sat heavy in the lobby of Shangri-La. Stanford MBAs were trying their best to be awake, sipping tea beneath chandeliers, eyes still foggy from the 16-hour flight. There were seventeen first-years (or “MBA1s”), four second-years (MBA2s), plus their professor, Yossi Feinberg, and staff advisor Ming Chu. All came to India for the Global Study Trip, a Stanford Business School tradition in which students visit countries and immerse themselves in its business fabric.The objective this time was growth and innovation in India, something that sounded clean on paper, the sort of thing you’d write on a syllabus. In reality, though, India is a place that resists syllabi. The country offers you contradictions in every direction: QR codes on street-side coconut stalls, ministers talking about Mars missions, Bollywood stars who double as entrepreneurs, investors who cite the Ramayana to define leadership. For the students, the week would be less about learning what India “is” and more about getting comfortable with the fact that it can be many things at once.The first to meet them was Gaurav Dalmia, investor, essayist, philosopher. He greeted the group in his home and reached backward in time. India, he said, had been prosperous for most of history, before the West discovered more efficient ways to organize capital and trade. Its resurgence now would not look like China’s rocket-fuel sprint. “India compounds,” he told them. “Six to seven percent a year. It feels slow, boring even. But compounding has its own magic.”The students were inspired, though still recovering from the jet lag. They had read about India’s GDP figures before, but Dalmia’s framing was different. Not hockey sticks but patience. And then he opened a copy of the Ramayana and read aloud the qualities of an ideal leader: grateful, truthful, versatile, patient, slow to anger, free of envy, yet terrifying when provoked. A few students looked up, surprised. Was this an epic poem or a CEO job description? Dalmia smiled. “Indian philosophy is not abstract,” he said. “It is applied leadership.”The group left buzzing, trying to reconcile what they’d heard with the India outside the windows, with horns blaring, construction cranes looming, roadside tea vendors serving to crowds that never seemed to thin.The evening brought Puneet Dalmia of Dalmia Bharat, whose cement plants have built many of the highways the students drove on. He spoke of India’s four “I’s”: Intent, Ideas, Independence, Individuals. Intent is what the state must set; ideas are the spark of entrepreneurs; independence is the freedom to act without capture; and individuals (the people) are the multiplier.But he also quoted from ancient texts and Harvard research, toggling between scriptures and slides. Happiness, he said, cannot be measured only in stock prices or steel output. “We are building not just an economy,” he said, “but a society. Growth must be judged by its impact on human dignity.”It was early in the trip, but already the students noticed a pattern: Indian business leaders often spoke in two registers, one of GDP, capital markets, and tech; another of values, philosophy, and family. In Silicon Valley, that combination might sound like posturing. Here, it felt woven into the operating system.The evening was unlike anything the students had experienced. Thanks to Dalmia, Indian Accent, normally tucked away in a sleek Delhi hotel, had been transported inside the Red Fort. Servers carried outunder Mughal arches, blue cheese naan in the shadow of ramparts where emperors once surveyed their kingdom. It was haute cuisine against a backdrop of empire. When the plates were cleared, the courtyard darkened, and the sandstone walls came alive with the sound-and-light show: Shah Jahan commissioning the fort, the British seizing it, Nehru’s voice declaring independence in 1947.The next day, Sanjeev Bikhchandani sat down with the delegation and told his story about building Naukri. During MBA placement season, Bikhchandani noticed: “Talent is scarce, and markets don’t lie.” He began photographing public placement records and selling the data as a survey. That instinct (observe behavior, package insight) became Naukri.com, India’s first big internet success.His lessons amazed the delegation with unusual force: ‘Clunky but dense’ beats ‘slick but sparse’. Customer insight beats capital. In downturns, when others cut, spend more. “Be frugal in bubbles, bold in busts,” he told them.Agra was the trip’s postcard moment. The buses pulled up at 10AM, and suddenly the Taj Mahal was no longer a photograph in a textbook but a living presence. Students wandered its marble terraces in awe, tracing inlay work with their fingers, staring at the perfect symmetry that somehow still felt human. Some tried to capture it on their phones, only to realize no lens could hold the shimmer of white stone against a pale morning sky.Later, the group regrouped for lunch at the Oberoi Amarvilas, where every dining-room window frames the monument like a painting. Between courses, heads kept drifting toward the view, as if the Taj were a third guest at the table. By afternoon, India reminded them of its unpredictability: a sudden downpour sent the delegation running into a makeshift roadside restaurant, plastic chairs and steaming chai serving as impromptu refuge. When the rain eased, they climbed back into their buses, damp but elated. It was the kind of day that felt both choreographed and accidental: iconic grandeur, sudden chaos, and the luck of experiencing both in a single sweep.In Mumbai, they met Manish Kejriwal, private equity veteran at Kedaara. Unlike the spreadsheets they were used to at Stanford, Kejriwal described investing as anthropology. Triangulate character, not just numbers. Build dissent into your firm so the junior analyst feels safe disagreeing with the partner. “We have an obligation to dissent,” he said.He spoke of India not as one market but as a mosaic of states, families, informal networks. His preference was for shovels over gold mines: workflow software and data services.At The Times of India offices, Sivakumar Sundaram and his colleagues put together an insightful session using interactive polls and a live thinking session. “There isn’t one India,” Sundaram said. “There are three.”The categories weren’t neat, but he explained the country better than a GDP figure.Later, Cyril Shroff, India’s most famous corporate lawyer, met the students in his Peninsula Towers office. His firm, once boutique, now has sixty percent women. He spoke of India’s legal system as both bottleneck and backbone: slow courts, yes, but a structure that undergirds growth.More striking was his framing of India’s independence. The country, he said, had moved from importing regulation to exporting it: Aadhaar as a model for digital identity, UPI for payments. “A lawyer won’t be replaced by AI, but by an AI-enabled lawyer.” In Silicon Valley, AI was usually pitched as disruption. Here, it was augmentation.Kunal Shah’s talk moved the group. The founder of CRED spoke less like a startup CEO and more like a philosopher. “India is a low-trust market,” he said. “That’s why super-apps make sense here. That’s why if you don’t buy a billboard, you don’t exist.”He shared some specific, unique facts: 37 GB of mobile data per Indian per month, but only 20M consumers drive 80% of online GMV. YouTube earns just $3 per Indian user annually. “India is the world’s largest MAU farm,” he said, “but not the world’s best ARPU market.”He spoke of status as the true currency: uniforms over paychecks, weddings as theater, caste layered into speech. “You can underpay people if you give them status,” he joked. He warned that subsidies dull ambition, that ambition comes from hunger, and that AI risks making people mentally lazy. “The tool that makes you atrophy is also the gym,” he said, cryptically. Many loved his candor but no one forgot it.An interesting setting came with Piyush Goyal, India’s Minister of Commerce. In a wood-paneled room, he began by congratulating Stanford, after which he pivoted to geopolitics.India, he said, has a habit of turning crises into opportunities. Buying discounted Russian oil when the West sanctioned it. Launching a Mars mission for $50M. Remaining “multi-aligned” instead of non-aligned: friends with Washington, Moscow, and Tel Aviv all at once.On AI, he said that “the human mind will remain supreme.” On trade, he was clear that every country makes its choices. On culture, he urged students to witness Ganesh Chaturthi in Mumbai. “Religion here binds people, creates mass fervor, unites the country,” he said.Not all sessions were with businessfolk and ministers. At a nonprofit panel hosted by Melody Mortazavi and Sanjiv Kaura, the students heard from Melody, Sanjiv, the alumni of Teach India, and more changemakers. One of the alumni had gone from Domino’s store manager to retail executive. Another described education as emancipation.For many in the delegation, these stories carried as much weight as the macroeconomics. They put faces to the abstractions of “India 2” and “India 3.”Through it all, Yossi played the role of quiet provocateur. On buses and over breakfasts, he asked questions that unsettled neat conclusions. If India has the cheapest data in the world, why does it have one of the lowest female labor participation rates? If it can build UPI for street vendors, why are courts so slow? If it can send a probe to Mars, why do so few Indians have access to credit?By the end, the trip felt less like a syllabus and more like a kaleidoscope. From Dalmia’s compounding to Bikhchandani’s salary surveys, from Shroff’s AI lawyers to Shah’s philosophy of status, from Goyal’s geopolitics to Teach India’s alumni, the delegation had been shown many Indias.On the final evening, standing on the balcony in Malabar Hill, the students looked out over the city as drums from Ganesh processions echoed through the streets. Someone remarked, “We came looking for lessons in growth. What we found were lessons in resilience, trust, and contradictions.”The reflections were about how the trip itself felt. “We’ve been treated like family everywhere we’ve gone,” said David Pantera, marveling at the warmth of the hospitality. Katy Dolan wrote to the student leaders that the week had “vastly exceeded expectations,” plus a reminder that a trip that had looked seamless to participants had in fact been an intense labor of love from the four MBA2s who led with grace and humor. And for Cayla Davis, the experience “exceeded her wildest imagination,” not just for the meetings and sights but for the thoughtfulness and care woven into the group dynamic.India, folks realized, is not a case study. It is a billion-person startup, a civilization in beta, a place where compounding is destiny and paradox the default mode.And for Stanford’s delegation, that was the real education.","The Global Study Trip is a Stanford Business School tradition in which students visit countries and immerse themselves in its business fabric.

New Delhi: Haven't you noticed the many long-route luxury buses with AR and NL registration numbers? Private bus operators often register them in smaller states like Arunachal Pradesh (AR) and Nagaland (NL) under the All India Tourist Permit (AITP) scheme, where taxes are lower.To curb this practice, gov plans to make it mandatory for all AITP buses to make at least one trip every 45 days to the state where they are registered.In a draft notification introducing major reforms to AITP Rules, the road transport ministry has proposed stricter registration norms and a requirement for operators to clear pending highway tolls within 30 days for permit renewal.State transport authorities must verify operators' documents to ensure such operators have a residence or place of business in the state where the tourist vehicle is registered,"" according to the draft.The proposal also specifies that each tourist vehicle must either begin or end its journey in its home state and cannot remain outside for more than 45 days. All such vehicles must have active Vehicle Location Tracking devices, with movements monitored by respective states. ""This is essential to ensure they visit their home state as per norms,"" an official said.The scale of the issue is evident. In Arunachal Pradesh, nearly 5,100 of its 10,200 registered buses have AITP.Nagaland counts about 3,100 AITP buses among its total 6,700.Industry insiders say high concentration of AITP buses in these smaller states highlights the loophole. ""Such operators create unfair competition for those registering in bigger states where taxes are higher. They strain infrastructure in states where they operate without contributing proportionate taxes,"" said one.","Private bus operators often register them in smaller states like Arunachal Pradesh (AR) and Nagaland (NL) under the All India Tourist Permit (AITP) scheme.

Delhi government plans to revive Yamuna by dredging,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-govt-plans-to-revive-yamuna-by-dredging/articleshow/123873743.cms,"Delhi Wakes Up To Flood Chaos As Yamuna Continues To Rage, Streets Waterlogged, Houses Submerged

NEW DELHI: Delhi govt is preparing to move National Green Tribunal seeking permission to dredge the Yamuna riverbed in the city. The decision has been taken as Delhi has faced urban flooding repeatedly and the Yamuna's water-carrying capacity has shrunk here.Minister Parvesh Verma said the proposal was aimed at reviving the river's natural flow, easing pressure on regulator drains and enhancing flood resilience of low-lying neighbourhoods along its banks.Dredging involves excavation of accumulated silt, sludge and solid waste from a waterbody. This is usually avoided in a river for concerns related to damaging the ecosystem and disturbing its banks.""Currently, the dredging of the Yamuna is prohibited. We are planning to approach NGT for approval. We are building our case with documentation regarding the need and commitment to follow all environmental norms. Once permission is granted, a detailed project report will be prepared. This will directly increase the carrying capacity of the river,"" said Verma.The urgency of the proposal comes against the backdrop of this year's flooding that pushed up the water level and triggered backflow into the city's drainage channels.Several residential colonies near the floodplain, including those adjoining regulator drains, bore the brunt. Experts have often linked the crisis to the Yamuna's reduced depth, aggravated by unchecked siltation and untreated sewage inflows.The river's Delhi stretch is about 22km between Wazirabad and Okhla. Officials acknowledge that the ecological degradation of this critical stretch has complicated not just flood management but also the city's drinking water supply.Parallel to the dredging proposal, Delhi Jal Board has been working on desilting projects to augment the raw water storage capacity. A plan to clean up the Wazirabad pond, which supplies water to one of the city's largest treatment plants, had to be deferred due to the monsoon. The Wazirabad water treatment plant produces 138MGD, making it a crucial lifeline for the city.Officials believe that clearing the pond and dredging the Yamuna can together double the river's current water-holding capacity. This could help mitigate flooding, improve raw water availability and ease stress on downstream regulators, they added.","Dredging involves excavation of accumulated silt, sludge and solid waste from a waterbody.

This court has time and again emphasised that liberal condonation of delay on behalf of the state, merely on the ground that refusal might cause the dismissal of a potentially meritorious matter, is a misplaced proposition.Public interest is not synonymous with the cause of the govt; it is, instead, synonymous with the enforcement of rule of law, certainty in legal rights, and an administrative machinery that functions with diligence and accountability"".""It must, therefore, be underscored that the guiding principle is not the protection of governmental indifference but the promotion of responsible governance. The state is under a higher duty to act in time, for in every matter it litigates, it does so not in its private capacity but as the trustee of the people's interest. Hence, repeated indulgence in condoning delays on grounds of bureaucratic inefficiency would amount to eroding the very object of limitation statutes, which are enacted in every civilised jurisdiction for the sake of finality, certainty, and public order,"" the bench said.The litigation in the case between the board and a private person over a piece of land started 36 years ago in 1989.

India has taken note of US ambassador-designate Sergio Gor's remarks during his confirmation hearing that President Donald Trump remains committed to a meeting of Quad leaders and to strengthen the strategic grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the US that acts as a bulwark against threats to a free and open Indo-Pacific. Trump's efforts to mend ties with China, including through a landmark trade deal under discussion, have been seen as possible impediments in Quad's progress even though the foreign ministers have met twice since Trump returned to the White House.The technical exchange on misuse of drones will be conducted by the National Security Guard (NSG) on Sept 23-24 at the NSG Garrison in Manesar. ""The exercise will focus on identification of evolving UAS, framework for international cooperation by sharing best practices, subject matter expert exchange and refined national level policies for countering terrorist use of UAS or drones,"" said a source on condition of anonymity.It's important for India that counterterrorism remains a priority for Quad, as evident from its strong condemnation of the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack in the foreign ministers' meeting in Washington in July. While India would have liked a swifter response in the days that followed the attack but the fact that the condemnation eventually came in the strongest possible terms and called for the ""perpetrators, organizers, and financiers of this reprehensible act to be brought to justice without any delay"" was significant for India.The Quad seminar on terrorist exploitation of new and emerging technology will be hosted by the NIA on Sept 26. It will address, according to official sources, emerging threat from terrorists by exploitation of new emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, deepfake technologies, encrypted chat platform and metaverse. ""It aims to strengthen countermeasures against these threats, collaboration among Quad members through intelligence sharing, capacity building and engaging institutions and research organisations to develop safeguard against misuse by terrorists,"" the source said.Looking to boost India-Pacific security and prosperity, Quad will also formally launch its Ports of the Future Partnership next month with India hosting a transportation and logistics conference in Mumbai. According to a White House factsheet, the initiative will complement the work Quad partners have done to boost infrastructure expertise across the Indo-Pacific region through the Quad Infrastructure Fellowships Program.

Suspense Grows in Nepal PM Race: Four Names, One Decision, A Nation on Edge

NEW DELHI: Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh on Friday said that Operation Sindoor , the punitive strike targeting terror bases in Pakistan, served as a “reality check” for India’s armed forces, highlighting areas where the country can improve its defence capabilities.Speaking at the Southern Command Defence Tech Seminar (STRIDE 2025), Singh noted that the operation revealed certain capability gaps, including in electronic warfare, counter-unmanned systems, low-level radars and the need for a stronger ecosystem to manufacture military-grade drones capable of operating in GPS-denied and contested environments.“It's pretty clear in the context of the geopolitical situation now that most countries are paying a lot of attention to defence and hard power again. Given our neighborhood, India is no exception, and we've just had this experience with Operation Sindoor, which was in some ways a reality check for us in terms of where we can do better, where we need to adapt to changing needs for future warfare,” Singh said.In the context of military operation, defence secretary said that it highlighted certain capability gaps in the armed forces.These gaps included areas such as electronic warfare, counter-unmanned systems and the need for a stronger manufacturing ecosystem for military-grade drones that can operate effectively in GPS-denied and contested environments.He also pointed to the requirement for improvements in low-level radar systems. Singh added that these were areas where the armed forces recognized the need to strengthen and enhance capabilities.The defence secretary also emphasised India’s push for indigenous defence production, highlighting that 88 per cent of defence capital expenditure in 2024 was spent within the country.When asked about solutions to address these capability gaps, Singh said the armed forces were given flexibility through emergency procurement rules to quickly acquire equipment needed immediately.For the long term, the focus remains on developing indigenous equipment in collaboration with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Singh added that while short-term purchases from global suppliers may be necessary, the ultimate goal is to achieve fully indigenous capabilities across all areas.He also reaffirmed that DRDO would continue to work on indigenous alternatives for critical systems, ensuring self-reliance in defence production.The defence secretary praised India’s multi-layered air defence system, which performed effectively during military operation. He said the system prevented major losses or casualties despite repeated attempts by drones and missiles to penetrate it.Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7 in response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. It was designed as a targeted campaign to dismantle terror infrastructure along and beyond the Line of Control , reflecting precision, professionalism and strategic purpose.","Rajesh Kumar Singh: Operation Sindoor served as a ‘reality check’ for India’s armed forces.

New Delhi: Launching the 'fast track immigration-trusted traveller programme' (FTI-TTP), which enables faster immigration of pre-verified flyers through automated e-gates, at five more international airports in the country, home minister Amit Shah on Thursday suggested that its coverage be maximised by enabling resident Indians and Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) to sign up for FTI-TTP at the state of issuing of passports or OCI cards itself.With the inclusion of Lucknow, Amritsar, Thiruvananthapuram, Tiruchirappalli and Kozhikode international airports, the number of airports covered under the programme has risen to 13.First launched at the Delhi international airport in June 2022, the programme added seven more airports - covering Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and Ahmedabad - in Jan this year. Shah said the facility will be available at the upcoming Navi Mumbai and Jewar airports as well.Addressing the FTI-TTP inauguration event at the five airports through video-conference, the home minister said around 3 lakh persons had registered under the programme and over 2.6 lakh travellers, both inbound and outbound, had availed of it, enabling them to clear immigration in 30 seconds, with no long queues or manual checks.""The next phase of the effort to enhance passenger convenience by integrating PM Narendra Modi's vision of 'speed, scale, and scope' into the FTI-TTP is starting from today,"" he said, adding the programme also introduces foreign travellers to the positive changes taking place in India.Drawing attention to the 60% increase in international passenger traffic over the past 11 years of the Modi govt - from 5 crore in 2014 to 8.1 crore in 2024 - the home minister said the figure of 2.6 lakh who have availed of the FTI-TTP facility is too small, leaving tremendous scope to maximise its coverage.Shah said everyone who has availed of the programme has voiced appreciation. ""Our goal should be to ensure that every Indian citizen and every OCI cardholder takes advantage of this facility,"" he added.""To achieve this, I request that when issuing passports and OCI cards, we can also conduct this registration (under FTI-TTP), so that people don't have to come twice for fingerprinting or document verification.

China, the world's largest consumer of gold, is planning to relax licensing norms for the export and import of the yellow metal, as the nation continues to steer away its reserves from the US dollar.According to a draft proposal from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the country plans to expand the use of “multi-use permits,” a quicker approval system, by increasing the number of ports authorised to accept them.The central bank also intends to extend their validity to nine months and remove limitations on how the number of times each permit can be used, Bloomberg reported.The latest step comes on the back of PBOC’s 2016 initiative, which aimed to streamline cross-border gold trade by cutting down paperwork and speeding up imports.China’s central bank has been steadily boosting its gold reserves, extending its buying spree for a 10th consecutive month in August. Domestic demand for investment bars and coins has also stayed strong. According to Bloomberg, gold prices have climbed nearly 40% this year, fuelled by central-bank purchases, heightened geopolitical tensions, and expectations of US interest rate cuts.The PBOC said the relaxation of permit rules would “enhance vitality and respond to external shocks by improving business environment at ports.”The proposal is open for public feedback until October 13.","China to relax licensing norms for the export and import of the yellow metal.

ITR filing FY 2024-25: What is the penalty amount for filing income tax return after deadline? Interest implications may result in big amount,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/taxation/itr-filing-fy-2024-25-what-is-the-penalty-amount-for-filing-income-tax-return-after-deadline-interest-implications-may-result-in-big-amount/articleshow/123849359.cms,"If for any reason, you are unable to file a tax return by the due date, you can file a belated return by 31 December 2025.

How much is the penalty for late filing of ITR?

If total income ≤ Rs 5 lakh: Rs 1,000

If total income > Rs 5 lakh: Rs 5,000

Interest under Section 234A becomes applicable when a taxpayer fails to file their income tax return by the prescribed due date. This interest is levied at the rate of 1% per month or part of the month on the net outstanding tax liability—i.e., the unpaid tax remaining after considering TDS, advance tax, and self-assessment tax already paid, Preeti Sharma, Partner, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India LLP tells TOI.

The interest continues to accrue from the original due date till the actual date of filing or full payment of taxes, whichever is later. Even a delay of one day into the next month triggers interest for the full month. Crucially, this 234A interest is independent of and in addition to two other interest provisions under the Income Tax Act:

Section 234B imposes interest if the taxpayer has failed to pay at least 90% of the total tax liability as advance tax by the end of the financial year (i.e., by 31 March 2025). The interest is calculated from 1 April till the date of payment.

Section 234C applies when advance tax instalments—due quarterly—are either not paid or paid late. Interest is levied for shortfalls in each quarter as per specified percentages.

Late filing of ITR FY 2024-25: Other repercussions





ITR filing FY 2024-2025: The deadline or due date for filing Income Tax Returns (ITR) for Assessment Year 2025-26 is September 15, 2025. This due date is unlikely to be extended, and hence it is advisable to file your ITR on or before this deadline.However, if for any reason, you are unable to file a tax return by the due date, you can file a belated return by 31 December 2025. However, be mindful of the penalty and interest implications, along with other repercussions:Late‑filing fee under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act attracts a penalty:There are also interest implications under Section 234A, 234B and 234C for outstanding tax liabilities:“Therefore, a taxpayer who has not paid adequate advance tax during the year and delays filing the return beyond the due date, may end up bearing a three-fold interest burden under Sections 234A, 234B, and 234C. The cumulative impact of these provisions can significantly inflate the overall tax outgo. Timely payment of advance tax and adherence to the ITR deadline is thus not just a compliance requirement, but also a critical strategy for minimizing penal costs,” she says.Bear in mind that you will not be allowed to opt for the old income tax regime when filing a belated tax return. This is the case even if you opted for the old regime at the start of the financial year with your employer.The new income tax regime is the default regime, and ITR filing beyond the deadline or due date results in being switched to the new regime.Additionally, you can’t carry forward any business and/or capital losses. “As the new regime will be mandatory, you will not be allowed to set off or carry forward losses from a self-occupied house property. However, any loss from rented house property, which is not set off with the current year’s income, will be allowed to be carried forward,” explains Preeti Sharma.","If for any reason, you are unable to file a tax return by the due date, you can file a belated return by 31 December 2025. Late‑filing fee under Section 234F of the Income Tax Act attracts a penalty. There are also interest implications under Sections 234A, 234B and 234C for outstanding tax liabilities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123849473,imgsize-53550,width-400,resizemode-4/itr-filing.jpg"

In a big cheer for Provident Fund or PF subscribers, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) may roll out features like withdrawals from ATMs and ban-like transactions ahead of Diwali.The meeting, to be chaired by labour and employment minister Mansukh Mandaviya, is scheduled for October 10-11, although the final agenda remains pending, sources informed ET. The government intends to introduce certain advantages for approximately 80 million EPFO subscribers before Diwali to enhance spending patterns.The EPFO may consider the EPFO 3.0 initiative at its meeting next month, aiming to introduce facilities similar to banking services, including options for withdrawing a portion of provident funds via ATMs or using them for UPI transactions.The organisation's central board of trustees is also expected to review a proposal to increase the minimum pension from Rs 1,000 monthly to between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,500, addressing a persistent request from trade unions.The apex decision-making authority of EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, comprises members representing employers, employees, state governments and the central government. The suggestion to enable partial withdrawals via banks and UPI might encounter opposition from trade unions, who consistently maintain that provident funds are meant for retirement security.Trade unions express concern that allowing withdrawals through banking channels could undermine the fundamental purpose of these savings, particularly if used for purposes beyond those currently permitted by regulations, according to the ET report.The Employees' Provident Fund & Miscellaneous Provisions Act currently permits automated withdrawals of up to Rs 5 lakh for specific needs such as health emergencies, educational expenses, matrimonial purposes and housing requirements, with processing completed within three days without manual intervention.The existing withdrawal system requires a minimum of two to three days for processing and relies on NEFT or RTGS transfers. The ATM withdrawal proposition forms part of EPFO's modernisation initiatives, designed to enhance service delivery and accessibility for its account holders.","The EPFO may consider the EPFO 3.0 initiative at its meeting next month.

How Mizoram’s new rail line will change daily life





Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated Mizoram’s first-ever railway line, the Bairabi–Sairang broad-gauge project, marking a historic moment in the state’s connectivity journey.Built at a cost of Rs 8,070 crore, the 51.38-km line is regarded as one of the most complex undertakings in Indian Railways ’ history.Sanctioned in 2008-09 and launched for construction in 2015, the line features 45 tunnels, 55 major bridges, 87 minor bridges, and ten road over- and underpasses.Nearly 54% of the alignment passes through tunnels and bridges. Among its most striking structures is Bridge No. 144 near Sairang, which at 114 metres stands taller than Delhi’s Qutub Minar, making it the tallest pier railway bridge in the country, according to the Northeast Frontier Railway.The project also added four stations — Hortoki, Kawnpui, Mualkhang and Sairang — connecting communities along the route.The new route extends connectivity from Bairabi on the Assam–Mizoram border to Sairang, just 20 km from Aizawl, directly linking the state capital with India’s railway network for the first time.With this, Aizawl becomes the fourth northeastern capital to gain direct rail access, after Guwahati, Agartala and Itanagar.The Prime Minister also flagged off three new long-distance services: the Sairang–Delhi Rajdhani Express, the Sairang–Guwahati Express, and the Sairang–Kolkata Express.According to Indian Railways, the inaugural Rajdhani left Sairang at 10 am on Saturday to reach Anand Vihar Terminal on September 15.Regular services will see the train depart Sairang every Friday evening and return from Delhi every Sunday night.The Guwahati Express will run daily from September 13, departing Guwahati at 7 pm and Sairang at 7 pm the next day. The Kolkata Express will operate thrice weekly, leaving Kolkata every Saturday, Tuesday and Wednesday and returning from Sairang every Monday, Thursday and Friday.The Prime Minister’s Office said the line would provide “safe, efficient and cost-effective travel options,” while ensuring timely supplies of essentials like food grains and fertilisers, as per news agency PTI.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw underlined that the project had to overcome “Himalayan geology and complex terrain,” noting that engineers even had to solidify loose sand into rock formations before tunnelling could proceed.Alongside the rail project, the Prime Minister laid foundation stones for a range of infrastructure works worth over Rs 9,000 crore. These include the 45-km Aizawl Bypass Road under PM-DevINE, the Thenzawl–Sialsuk Road and the Khankawn–Rongura Road under NESIDS, aimed at easing travel and improving access for farmers and traders.The Thenzawl–Sialsuk Road is expected to benefit horticulture farmers, dragon fruit growers, paddy cultivators and ginger processors, while the Khankawn–Rongura Road will support market access and a planned ginger processing plant (PTI).The Prime Minister also launched projects such as the Chhimtuipui bridge, which will provide all-weather connectivity and support cross-border commerce under the Kaladan Multimodal Transit framework.Other projects include an LPG bottling plant at Mualkhang, new sports infrastructure, and residential schools under PMJVK and the Eklavya Model scheme.Officials said the Bairabi–Sairang railway is expected to transform logistics and tourism, reduce travel time and generate employment.“This project has been constructed under great challenges,” Vaishnaw said, adding that it was a major step in implementing the government’s Act East Policy.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated Mizoram’s first-ever railway line, the Bairabi–Sairang broad-gauge project.

"In Nato letter, Trump calls out 'shocking' Russian oil buys — why it matters to India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/in-nato-letter-trump-calls-out-shocking-russian-oil-buys-why-it-matters-to-india/articleshow/123871506.cms,"‘Do As I Say Or…’: Trump Loses Temper At NATO Nations Buying Russian Oil; Warns Them To Stop…

The India angle: From tariffs to diplomacy



The European oil dilemma







In another attempt to push Western allies to stop their purchases of Russian crude and increase pressure on Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump issued an open letter to Nato members. Yet one detail stood out in the President’s message: India was not mentioned. The omission is striking, given that Trump and his administration, particularly trade representative Peter Navarro, have repeatedly criticised New Delhi over its energy ties with Moscow. “I am ready to do major sanctions on Russia when all Nato Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all Nato Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA,” Trump wrote in a letter he shared on Truth social, a platform he owns.“The purchase of Russian oil, by some, has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia”, he further added.While his comments were directed at Nato, they carry significance for India. For months, New Delhi has defended Russian oil imports by pointing to Europe’s heavy reliance on discounted supplies from Moscow. Trump’s attack, without naming India, effectively echoes what India has been saying that Western double standards are evident in their criticism of Indian purchases while European nations continue their own trade.Trump’s comments also come against the backdrop of his recent praise for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries. Despite imposing steep tariffs, including a 50% duty on Indian goods linked to Russian oil imports, Trump has repeatedly distinguished his criticism of India from his personal regard for PM Modi, describing the two as “very good friends.”On Friday, Trump said his decision to impose a 50% tariff on India is “a big deal” that “caused a rift” between the two countries.Speaking on Fox & Friends, the US President said the move was not taken lightly but was necessary to send a message. “Look, India was their biggest customer. I put a 50 per cent tariff on India because they're buying oil from Russia. That's not an easy thing to do. That's a big deal and it causes a rift with India,” he said.White House officials and Trump’s nominee for ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, have meanwhile underlined that “getting India to stop buying Russian oil is a top priority for this administration.” Yet Gor also acknowledged that New Delhi is a “strategic partner whose trajectory will shape the region,” stressing that both sides are “not that far apart” on a trade deal.For India, Trump’s renewed focus on European purchases reinforces its long-standing argument. If Washington is now pressing Nato capitals with the same language it once reserved for New Delhi, Indian officials can point to the inconsistency in Western criticism.As Jaishankar put it during a recent visit to Moscow: “We are not the biggest purchasers of Russian oil, that is China. We are not the biggest purchasers of LNG, that is the European Union.”The sharpest part of Trump's message was aimed at European capitals. Since 2023, Turkey has been the third-largest buyer of Russian oil, after China and India, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Hungary and Slovakia, both Nato members, have also continued imports despite sanctions elsewhere. Trump’s intervention plays directly into a debate long mentioned by New Delhi: that Europe has been inconsistent in criticising India while quietly maintaining its own dependence on Russian crude.India has defended its position on energy procurement as being guided by “market conditions” and national interest. Jaishankar has openly called out what he termed “double standards,” noting that India’s imports from the US have simultaneously increased even as Washington applies pressure over Russian supplies.The significance of Trump’s letter, then, goes beyond Nato. By calling out Europe’s “shocking” imports, the US president has indirectly validated India’s line of defence. Whether this translates into easing tariff pressure on New Delhi remains to be seen, but the message is clear: in the geopolitical battle over Russian oil, Europe can no longer escape the scrutiny that India has faced from its western counterparts for more than two years.","US President Donald Trump issued an open letter to Nato members.

Understanding solar eclipses – Types and what to expect

Total solar eclipse



The Moon completely covers the Sun.

Observers in a narrow zone experience brief daylight darkness.

Spectacular but rare. Partial solar eclipse



Only part of the Sun is covered by the Moon.

Creates a crescent or “bitten” appearance of the Sun.

This is the type occurring on September 21, 2025. Annular solar eclipse



The Moon is farther from Earth and doesn’t fully cover the Sun.

A ring of sunlight remains visible, forming the “ring of fire” effect.





In an extraordinary celestial turn, September 2025 is bookended by two eclipses, a lunar eclipse on the 7th and a solar eclipse just 15 days later. While the Moon recently turned a vivid red in a dramatic lunar display, the sky will offer another rare phenomenon: a partial solar eclipse on September 21, timed just before the equinox. However, this spectacle won’t be visible everywhere, and the UAE is among the regions that will miss it.The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21. Unlike a total eclipse, this will be a partial solar eclipse, where the Moon covers only part of the Sun, creating a crescent-shaped sliver of sunlight.This event holds additional significance because it closely precedes the September equinox, which falls on September 22, 2025. The equinox is one of two moments in the year when the Sun is directly above the Earth’s equator, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths across the globe. Because of this timing, the eclipse is also being called an ""equinox eclipse"", adding to its astronomical and symbolic intrigue.The event also carries cultural and astrological meaning. This year's Pitru Paksha — a fortnight in the Hindu calendar dedicated to ancestral remembrance and rituals — uniquely begins with a lunar eclipse and ends with this solar eclipse, a rare alignment astrologers consider especially potent.This celestial pairing not only marks an important astronomical event but also deepens the spiritual significance of Pitru Paksha for many observers.Also Read: Saudi National Day 2025 The September 21 partial solar eclipse will be visible only in specific parts of the Southern Hemisphere, offering clear views to skywatchers in select regions.Skywatchers in visible regions must use proper solar filters or eclipse glasses to view the partial eclipse safely.Unlike the lunar eclipse on September 7, which had wide visibility across many countries, this solar eclipse will not be visible in the UAE or most parts of the Northern Hemisphere.Countries that will not witness any part of the eclipse include:This means millions of skywatchers across Asia and the Americas will miss the event entirely — a sharp contrast to the global excitement generated by the earlier lunar eclipse.A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, partially or fully blocking sunlight in specific areas on Earth. These alignments don’t happen frequently in the same place due to the precise positioning required.There are three main types of solar eclipses:Although this particular eclipse is not a total one, its timing, rarity, and symbolic links to the equinox and Pitru Paksha make it a notable event in the 2025 celestial calendar.","The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21.

Sushila Karki, Nepal’s former Chief Justice and one of three names suggested by protestors to lead a proposed interim government in the unrest-hit Himalayan nation, is married to politician Durga Prasad Subedi — who was involved in a plane hijacking 52 years ago.Then a youth leader of the Nepali Congress, Subedi led a three-member team in a 1973 hijacking masterminded by Girija Prasad Koirala — who would later serve four terms as Nepal’s prime minister — to raise funds for an “armed struggle” against the monarchy under King Mahendra.On June 10, 1973, Subedi, along with Nagendra Dhungel and Basanta Bhattarai, boarded a 19-seater aircraft in Nepal's Biratnagar that was bound for Kathmandu. The plane was carrying Rs 30 lakh in Indian currency from India to the Nepali capital.Among the passengers were actor couple CP Lohani of Nepal and Indian film star Mala Sinha.As planned, the hijackers, after a brief struggle with the crew, forced the pilot to land in Forbesganj, Bihar, where five other conspirators were waiting. The group offloaded three boxes of cash before the aircraft quickly took off again with the remaining passengers.Within a year, after hiding in various locations across India, all members of the group — except Dhungel — were arrested one by one by authorities. They were later released on bail and returned to Nepal shortly before the 1980 referendum.","Sushila Karki is married to politician Durga Prasad Subedi, who was involved in a plane hijacking 52 years ago.

Tata Electronics chip plant has a 'problem' and it is how to deal with Snakes and Elephants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tata-electronics-chip-plant-has-a-problem-and-it-is-how-to-deal-with-snakes-and-elephants/articleshow/123847209.cms,"Why 'Elephant-proof' wall

Snake problem





Tata Electronics semiconductor manufacturing is encountering an unexpected challenge in the forests of Assam. As Tata Electronics constructs its new chip assembly facility, it is not only about ensuring meeting technical complexities of microchip production but also with the region’s wildlife, particularly Elephants and Snakes.According to a report in the Economic Times, the company is building a massive “Elephant-Proof” wall around its upcoming outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) plant in the Morigaon district. The project, which is one of the most significant under the Rs 76,000-crore India Semiconductor Mission, is receiving proactive support from the Assam state government to address these unique logistical challenges.The need for an elephant-proof wall is not just about preventing damage to equipment. Experts told Economic Times that the concern lies in the ground vibrations caused by the elephants' heavy tread. In the world of semiconductor manufacturing, where dimensions are measured in nanometers, even a minor vibration can be catastrophic.“Ground vibrations can cause misalignments in precision equipment, leading to inaccurate measurements, distorted patterns, operational failures and ultimately faulty chips,” the report states.A semiconductor industry veteran told the publication that while vibrations are not a major concern for all OSAT plants, they pose a significant threat to ""fine-pitch assembly,"" a process requiring extremely high precision. “If the vibration shifts it even by half a micron, every pin will get shifted by half a micron, the alignment will go and Tata Electronics may lose yield,” the veteran said.In addition to the elephant problem, the plant is also dealing with an abundance of Snakes. The company has hired a team of rescuers who work full-time to capture and safely relocate the reptiles. ""These people have been there for the last three months and since then have rescued many snakes,"" a source told the newspaper.The state government is taking an active role in supporting the project. According to a state official quoted, the wall is being built ""not just for the elephants but for their security as well.” The official noted that the chief minister, industry department, and chief secretary are personally overseeing the project, ensuring the Tata Group receives full support.The new chip assembly plant, which involves an investment of Rs 27,000 crore, is attracting high-profile attention, with Elon Musk’s Tesla reportedly being a key prospective customer.Experts say that industries such as semiconductor manufacturing require strict vibration control as instruments and processes demand high stability and accuracy to function correctly. Proper foundation design and structural engineering are among the initial defences against vibration.",Tata Electronics is building a 'Elephant-Proof' wall around its upcoming semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) plant in the Morigaon district of Assam.

NEW DELHI: More than 50 students from a government school in Chudiyavas, Dausa district, were admitted to hospital after falling ill, reportedly due to food poisoning on Saturday.District collector Devendra Kumar said on Saturday that the students experienced stomachaches and headaches after consuming food at the school.“Almost 15 to 20 students were referred to the District Hospital, Dausa. The preliminary reason is that the food they had was possibly of substandard quality,” he added.Kumar confirmed that the children are now in a stable condition. “We have sent two teams for investigation at the district level, a food safety officer to inspect the food and a team from the education department to determine what was lacking in the nutrition,” he said.Authorities have assured strict action against those found responsible. “We will investigate the quality of the food, and strict action will be taken against those guilty,” Kumar said.","More than 50 students from a government school in Chudiyavas, Dausa district, were admitted to hospital after falling ill.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
