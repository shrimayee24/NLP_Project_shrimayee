Russia is getting Nvidia AI chips from an Indian pharma company,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/russia-is-getting-nvidia-ai-chips-mumbai-drugmaker-putin-shreya-life-sciences-importgenius/articleshow/114672764.cms,"Doing business with Russia is not illegal in India.

Occupying the top three floors of an unremarkable office building in northern Mumbai, there’s little to distinguish Shreya Life Sciences from the many other commercial businesses that keep the Andheri neighborhood of India’s largest metropolis humming throughout the day.But this inconspicuous pharmaceutical company is part of a lucrative trade in leading-edge technology to Russia that has the US and its European allies worried at India’s burgeoning role as an intermediary in the sales.A Bloomberg News analysis of data compiled by trade-tracking firms ImportGenius and NBD shows that Shreya exported 1,111 units of Dell Technologies Inc’s most-advanced servers to Russia in April-August of this year.The servers, known as PowerEdge XE9680, contain high-end processors optimized for artificial intelligence made by Nvidia Corp or Advanced Micro Devices Inc, according to Dell’s website. Specification data available for 998 shipped servers show they were equipped with Nvidia’s H100 chips.The servers — and the chips they contain — are on a list of items restricted by the US and the European Union “to target sensitive sectors in Russia’s military industrial complex.” Yet the shipments, worth $300 million and imported by two Russian trading companies, Main Chain Ltd and I.S LLC, were just the latest in a series of advanced technology exports Shreya made perfectly legally to Russia since September 2022, the data showed.Shreya did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and no one was available to do so during two visits to its office.The findings underscore the holes in western government attempts to shut off Moscow’s access to dual-use technology with potential military applications, as well as the cutting-edge nature of the equipment being shipped. India is increasingly the intermediary of choice: It’s now the second-biggest supplier after China of restricted technology to Russia, Bloomberg reported October 12.Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, complained in a post on X that Russia is still receiving components used for electronic intelligence and warfare systems despite western sanctions. “No one should profit from the lives of Ukrainians,” he said October 7.While India is the point of transshipment, trade data suggest that Malaysia is in fact the origin. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim met with President Vladimir Putin in Russia in September, and hailed the “enormous potential” to enhance regional trade relations, including through advanced technologies.Shipping documents of at least 834 PowerEdge XE9680 units destined for Russia showed their country of origin as Malaysia. Indian import data for March-August 2024 reveals that 1,407 of the same Dell units were imported to India from Malaysia. Neither Malaysia’s Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry nor the Prime Minister’s Office responded to an email seeking comments.The tech companies themselves are obligated to follow sanctions rules and monitor any sales of sensitive products. In a statement, Dell said that it had ceased selling and offering services or support for products in Russia in February 2022, immediately following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and maintains “a strict trade compliance program.” Nvidia and AMD said that they work with partners to ensure that sales are in “full compliance” with export controls, and take appropriate action if any violations are identified.Doing business with Russia is not illegal in India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is not party to the multiple rounds of US and EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. Long dependent upon Russia for military equipment, New Delhi stepped in to buy its crude as European countries cut off oil imports over the war — and is signaling that it will continue to do so for as long as Moscow gives bigger discounts than other producers. During an October 22 meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, Modi referred to “our close and deepening” relations.That role has put India on the radar of western governments. US and EU officials have traveled to India in recent months as part of efforts to encourage the government to act to stop the shipments, according to people familiar with the trips. The visits come amid signs of mounting exasperation with India for its role procuring goods for Russia’s war.US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo sent a letter to the Confederation of Indian Industry this summer warning that foreign financial institutions trading with Russia’s military industrial base risked being sanctioned. Despite the Biden administration’s efforts to keep Modi’s government onside in its competition with China, New Delhi has shown little engagement with the US concerns, a senior US official said.Transshipment of battlefield products via India has ramped up since December of last year, according to David O’Sullivan, the EU’s chief sanctions official. In a briefing to reporters, he attributed the increase to “the huge volume of rupees” Russia has accrued from selling oil, rather than Indian policy. The EU has already sanctioned a few entities based in India.BRICS Leader's Summit In KazanIndia has looked into US allegations and taken action as needed after Washington flagged that some Indian companies were supplying dual-use technology to Russia, said people familiar with the government’s stance, asking not to be named discussing sensitive matters of diplomacy. That matter is now closed, the people said, adding that Shreya Life Sciences did not feature on the list.A spokesperson for India’s Trade Ministry didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. The Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment.India’s exports of controlled and dual-use goods and technologies are in full compliance with its national laws and regulations and its international obligations on non-proliferation, said a senior Indian official who asked not be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.Bloomberg has previously reported that the vast majority of restricted goods enter Russia via re-exports from third countries such as China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Some of those trades involve often unwitting subsidiaries and subcontractors of western firms as well as networks of intermediaries who source from them.Information on those companies involved is rare — and the paper trail leading to Shreya is what makes the drugmaker stand out.The company was founded in Moscow in 1995 by Sujit Kumar Singh just as Russia was on the verge of economic breakdown, offering opportunities for enterprising individuals able to navigate the chaos of those years. Singh, the company’s CEO, was unavailable for comment despite email, telephone and text requests sent to Shreya.In an article for the Economic Times published in 2002, Singh wrote of Shreya’s initial role in developing a marketing and distribution network at a time when “after the collapse of the Soviet Union the pharmaceutical market was practically reduced to zero.” He also expressed hopes that a visit to India by Putin the same year would “impart a new impetus and greater depth and content to Indo-Russian relations.”Records from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs database show that Shreya began life as a distribution and marketing company of pharmaceutical drugs, over time acquiring several companies to create its own manufacturing plants for generic drugs like insulin, antibiotics, anti-malaria and gastrointestinal medicines. Indeed, between January 2022 and August 2024, it sold $22 million worth of pharmaceutical products to Russia, trade data shows. Russia is listed on the company website as the first among six major markets for its international exports.That dependence on Russia has proven to be a liability in the past. Shreya began seeing a dip in operating revenues in 2014-15 coinciding with Putin’s annexation of Crimea that led to sanctions and a collapse in the ruble, according to rating agency Crisil. As Shreya relied on sales of its drugs to Russian clients and to its own entity based in Moscow, Shreya Life Sciences LLC, the company began bleeding losses.The drugmaker defaulted on 1.9 billion rupees ($23 million) of bank loans in March 2015. While its bankers — including the State Bank of India and the LIC Housing Finance Ltd. — restructured its debt, the Bank of India Ltd. filed a suit against the company under the bankruptcy law in 2019, only to later withdraw the petition after the matter was settled out of court.Shreya returned to profitability in the following years. But the biggest lifeline for the Indian concern came from state-owned Promsvyazbank PJSC in Moscow. The bank’s head is Peter Fradkov, son of the former chief of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, Mikhail Fradkov. Both the bank and Fradkov junior are subject to international sanctions.Between 2011 and 2013, Shreya borrowed $86 million from the Russian bank, in the form of a foreign currency loan which was mortgaged against shares owned by Sujit Kumar Singh. The money was used to invest in equity shares of Shreya Life Sciences LLC in Moscow, which in turn used the money to pay for the import of pharmaceutical products from the Indian entity. The loan effectively helped keep the company afloat as the drugmaker sold a significant amount of its products to its own subsidiary.Later, in 2018, as other financial institutions grew wary of tightening western sanctions, Russia turned the lender into the key funder of its defense industry. Throughout that time, the bank seems to have allowed Shreya to defer its repayments consistently, as cash flow payments toward its borrowings were a fraction of what was due. As of 2022-23, the company had 7.6 billion rupees in borrowings of which 85% is owed to Promsvyazbank. An email to the bank seeking comment went unanswered.Meantime, local drug inspectors found deficiencies in insulin injections manufactured by Shreya in 2019, while its products were found to be “not of standard quality” most recently in April by the Central Drug Laboratory in Kolkata.It’s against this backdrop that Shreya began branching out into technology shipments.The first record of non-medical exports by Shreya during the period examined by Bloomberg appeared in September 2022, when it shipped an assortment of computer hardware to Russia worth $755,333. The recipient was Lanprint Ltd., a Russian trading company which was later added to the US sanctioned company list, in September 2023. It sold equipment to another company, Silkway LLC, which was sanctioned the same month.Shreya stopped dealing with both companies two months before they were sanctioned and started selling to Main Chain, which is not on the US list of sanctioned entities.Main Chain was registered as a company in Russia on Jan. 25, 2023, with Anastasia Obukhova its general director. She is listed on a Russian business portal as holding the same post for two previous companies, a tourism agency and a tour operator, both of which were liquidated. Each had declared capital of 10,000 rubles (about $130-$200), so Main Chain is a considerable step up. The company states on its website that it “imports and wholesales computer equipment from various foreign manufacturers.” An email and calls to Main Chain went unanswered.Shreya’s exports to Main Chain and I. S surged in April this year, when it ramped up sales of Dell’s PowerEdge XE9680 at an average price of $260,000. These servers come under HS code 847150, part of the dual-use goods list that aims to curb the Russian weapons systems used against Ukraine. The list, drawn up by the EU in conjunction with the US, the UK and Japan, is based partly on tech identified on the battlefield.Shipping documents show the imports were ordered from Malaysia by Dell International Services India Private Ltd, a Dell subsidiary, and the supplier was recorded as Dell Global BV (Singapore Branch), another subsidiary.Dell said it requires distributors and resellers “to follow all applicable global regulations and export controls,” and invests in tools and resources to help prevent and detect potential product diversion. “If a partner is not adhering to these obligations, we take swift and appropriate action, up to and including termination of our relationship,” the company said.Main Chain sourced technology products from a second Indian company, Hayers Infotech Private Limited. Together, Shreya and Hayers Infotech exported $434 million worth of high-tech goods to Russia since February 2022.Hayers Infotech is registered at the same Mumbai address as Shreya Life Sciences. A discrete plaque at the top floor of Shreya’s offices bears the name, Hayers Infotech Pvt Ltd.","Shreya Life Sciences exported 1,111 units of Dell Technologies Inc’s most- advanced servers to Russia in April-August of this year. The shipments, worth $300 million, were just the latest in a series of advanced technology exports Shreya made perfectly legally to Russia since September 2022.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114672849,imgsize-99996,width-400,resizemode-4/114672849.jpg"
‘There can’t be neutrality between aggressor & victim. It only means you’re with Russia’: Zelenskyy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/there-cant-be-neutrality-between-aggressor-victim-it-only-means-youre-with-russia-zelenskyy/articleshow/114668253.cms,"What did you think about the Brics summit in

Russia

and PM Modi saying he is ready to work for peace in

Ukraine

at the summit?

Many would argue that sanctions haven’t stopped Russia and more sanctions would cripple the global economy. So how do you convince more countries to your point of view?

Everyone is looking to the US elections and there is a belief that a ceasefire could be reached after the elections. Do you think that’s a possible?

You recently revealed your Victory Plan which includes quick Nato membership for Ukraine. But many countries are divided about your plan. Do you think the plan is practical or is it just a bargaining chip?

Zelensky Questions BRICS Unity After Summit Boosts Vladimir Putin’s Image Amid Ongoing Conflict

hat is the position of the war as of now? Because Russia has been making some gains on the battlefield, and with winter coming many believe you will face a tough few months.

When PM Modi was in Kyiv he along with you visited the Martyrologist Exposition dedicated to the fallen children of this war. Can you detail the overall impact of the war on Ukrainian children?

What can India do specifically to bring back the forcibly deported Ukrainian children?

ICC issued arrest warrants for the forcible deportation of Ukrainian children. But those were not implemented as we saw recently with Mongolia. Do you still have faith in international mechanisms to bring back the children.

Do you think there’s any possibility that PM Modi can host negotiations between Ukraine and Russia?

Thank Mr President for speaking to Times of India.

First and foremost the Brics summit in Russia failed. It was a total failure. Not everyone was there, even looking at today’s composition of Brics, we couldn’t see many leaders whom Russia was relying upon within Brics besides the guests. Saudi Arabia wasn’t there at the level of the leader and there was no unity within Brics. I think Brics is divided by Putin himself by his policy of war. And I think Putin’s aim for the summit was to polarise the world and he did not achieve this. He will subvert the Brics’ purpose and use the platform for his own policy of war. That’s why he wants to divide the world into so-called West-plus and Brics-plus. But as of today he has failed to do that for many reasons. First, I think everyone understands that he is a murderer and a terrorist. That today Russia is just a cheap energy resource, and some of the states are using that. But even the states that understand that they can help their economy in this manner, don’t want to spoil the process for themselves with Putin. Plus, Putin is not consistent, and even the proposals of Brazil and China, which were more political and not very specific, were not acceptable to Putin from the perspective of territorial integrity. And for China, I would say, this was a slap on the face. For Brazil too, and that’s why Brazil was not present at the summit at the level of the leader. So Brics in effect did not take place.As for the presence of the UN secretary general, I think that altogether this is a kind of a surrealistic thing. It’s not only about the UN but many other countries. I think that you cannot just say that you are neutral in the war between Russia and Ukraine. You cannot be neutral because it would mean you are on the side of Russia. Neutrality really helps just Russia. And between the aggressor and the victim, there cannot be neutrality. I consider this a hidden support for Russia, and the ones who were present there at the summit and speaking about their neutrality and saying they would like to help to solve the conflict, in my opinion, they look more pro-Russia. And that means it’s not about peace because Russia started this war and continues to wage it. And whether they want it or not, or understand it or not, that is not important. This is the fact: neutrality in this war means support for Russia. After all of the victims, after all of the tortures and deportation of Ukrainian children, this is how it looks.As for the position of PM Modi, I think that any assertions today should not end with words only. Modi is the PM of a really huge country from the perspective of population, economy, influence and impact. Such a country cannot just say we are interested in the end of the war – we are all interested in that. All of the leaders would tell you that they would like to end the war, even the enemy of peace, Putin, will say that even he wants peace. This is a common thing. Especially for such a huge country like India, PM Modi can influence the end of the war. This is the huge value of him in any conflict. This is a huge value of India. Blocking of Russian economy, blocking of cheap energy resource, blocking of defence-industrial complex of Russian will lead to the decrease in capacity of Moscow to wage wars against us. Then the G20; the G20 is considered the ‘Great 20’ because they are main economies of the world. And the whole world is looking to them. That’s why the 20 great economies can just easily put Putin in his place and end the war. Not just incentivise but the opposite, slow down all of Putin’s desires. And you don’t need to say we would like peace, you need to act. Because the daily war is killing people.Sanctions are working. Sanctions have led to effect. If the great economies of the world like India, China, Turkiye and others, which did not impose sanctions on Russia, if they would not help Russia survive in the war economically – they actually helped Russia earn money, sometimes even with the understanding that the energy resource they are buying is helping fuel the war – if they re-evaluated their values, then the sanctions would be functioning fully. Now they are working only partially because the world is implementing them partially.So many things depend on the policies of US. But it’s not a deep analysis to say everything depends on US. Many things depend, but not everything. In the beginning of war in Ukraine our nation stood together against the enemy, let me remind you, without the support of allies, including US. The unity of people of Ukraine, our population and society, this is what in fact repelled the attack of the Russians, stopped them. But the occupation, of course, we wouldn’t be able to respond to without the support, or at least it would be very hard because of human losses. And that’s why we are very grateful to our allies for their help and support. But still, not everything depends on US elections. US policies change not only because of the leader. We don’t know who will become the US president, but undoubtedly the bipartisan support for Ukraine will stay. And the US Congress, in any case which we are cooperating with and have developed strong connections, will have its personal impact on this war. The US president will definitely shape the foreign policy because it’s his or her constitutional obligation. And undoubtedly if US policy changes and it says we don’t support Ukraine in its sovereign and just protection of its territories, it will be really hard for us. This is if the policy totally changes. Then we will think what we will do with that. Definitely not now, we will think on that only then.Another argument is that we shouldn’t forget that Europe is a powerful continent on its own. In fact, India and China shouldn’t forget about that in spite of the fact that India and China are great economies, still Europe is five times bigger than Russia by population and dozens of times bigger economically. Hence, Europe is a more attractive market. So we need to understand that US population is half the population of Europe. And we need to understand that Europe as it is, when it is not divided, is powerful. It is important for us to preserve this unity in Europe, and not to change the policy of Europe about this war. This is the second aspect. And the third about the ceasefire, we need to understand that we are against a frozen conflict, we don’t want the third war. Because in 2014, one war started, and our territories were occupied. In 2022, the full-scale war started, though before 2022 we used to have a frozen conflict. There was a ceasefire already. There were Normandy and Minsk processes where there were dozens of negotiations with Russia and other partners in different platforms. And then we had the full-scale war. So if now freeze the conflict without a proper understanding of what will happen tomorrow, which guarantees of security the Ukrainian people will have, our children will have, then I think it is a huge risk, a very high risk. Everything should be done on paper and should be comprehensible. How this war ends, and who and how much will bear responsibility for it? Definitely the aggressor will do that.The Victory Plan is not a bargaining chip or a topic of negotiations with Russia. Let’s not confuse this. The Victory Plan is not a platform for response for all of the countries of the world. The Victory Plan is the plan for strengthening Ukraine today. Strengthening of Ukraine before heading into those diplomatic formats of negotiations, peace summits, so that Ukraine could be strong. That’s why the Victory Plan is given to countries who are ready to strengthen Ukraine. It’s not about talks with Russia, because Russia is not making us stronger, it’s making us weaker. It’s not a proposal for negotiations. This is a request, very specific one. I shouldn’t ‘ask’ in my Victor Plan . As for the invitation to Nato – I would like that people don’t misunderstand this – the first point is not Nato membership or quick membership of Nato. The first point is invitation to Nato so that in the future nobody can change their opinion. Everything shouldn’t be just in words, but documented in papers, fundamentally and legally. We are talking about invitation, not membership, because during the war we cannot become Nato member obviously. And this point is only for the Nato countries because we would like to be invited to Nato.The second point of the Victory Plan is strengthening the Ukrainian army with weapons today at the battlefield, not tomorrow. We are not talking with Putin about that or the countries of the Global South who do not strengthen us with weapons today. We speak about this with the Ramstein countries which helped Ukraine with weapons during this conflict. Point three is about the package of deterrence against Russia. It does not mean the use of missiles. However, this would be just because Russia is using missiles against us. But we are saying that it’s not about the use of missiles but deterrence of Russia. This is the package of long-range weapons which Ukraine will not use if Russia stops the war against us. Stops the aggression against us. Stops killing our people. That is why this package of long-range weapons should be in Ukraine. This is the prevention measure of weapons. This is the warning for Russia. Stop killing people. The aggressor needs to stop. And that’s why this point of the plan is not for everyone, not even for all of the countries of Ramstein. This point is only for those countries who have certain types of weapons. Who have and who are ready to give it to Ukraine.The fourth point, the economic one, is for the ones who are interested in investments in Ukraine, to protect mineral resources of Ukraine, and to create businesses in future together with Ukraine. The fifth point is about just security of the European continent. And that’s why this is the post-war point. It tells us what will happen after the war with the Ukrainian army as part of the security of Europe. And it is exclusively about Europe. So it is not the plan that will end the war where we unite the whole world. This is the plan of victory that leads us to the plan to end the war. This is the plan of strengthening of Ukraine.Well, this is the third hard winter for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. Russia is doing the same thing every year of this war. We are studying how to protect ourselves. Russia attacked our energy centres since the very beginning to breed chaos in Ukraine, so that our people would starve, so that our people will be ill without having the opportunity to provide insolation and winterisation of their houses. So that the people would die. We as a state started to oppose that. We restored our energy systems. We are step-by-step strengthening the protection of our energy systems. And we aren’t just allowing Russia to kill our people. Gradually we have begun to cope with their attacks on our energy systems. We know how to retaliate to their strikes, but we do that very cautiously. We never target the people, we never target the schools and universities – which Russia does. So they have felt that Ukraine can respond. And in those operations none of our partners have helped us. This is what we have done alone in our response, unfortunately.As for the battlefield, you are right, Russia has more people and more weapons. In many directions, technologically, we are better than them already. Many partners agree with that, especially in long-range drones, systems of electronic warfare etc. But it’s not enough because the most important thing is to save the people. So we look at the battlefield from the perspective of how to save our people. We can lose equipment, we can lose technologies, but we should minimise human losses. Sometimes by the price of metres or few kilometres of land. Yes, the human being is more important than the land, though this is our land. But our land will be brought back later, but we will not be able to bring back the human being. And we live according to this law. It is hard to be at war with Russia by this law because they have a different law – if they are not attacking, if their soldiers are not on the offensive, they are shot by the Russians themselves. Russians are killed by Russians. The Russians have killed many of their own mobilised soldiers just because these soldiers were afraid to attack, to perish under the bullets or to be wounded. So they retreated and this is where they were killed by their own army. This is their law of war. They don’t quantify, they don’t calculate the numbers. They have approximately 650,000 victims already who were killed or wounded in Russia. Just imagine, that’s a lot.And you know what’s really scary? The same is continuing and they don’t even retrieve the bodies. The bodies are just rotting on the battlefield, they don’t take them back. This is the face of today’s Russia, today’s Putin. And what’s more interesting, yes they are having gains in Ukraine’s east because of this strategy, because of this meat-grinder, because they are throwing bodies onto us. But when we came to Kursk region and had a preventive attack against their territory, because they wanted to have a separate operation and occupy our north, we can see that they are attacking their own territory. They are themselves killing their own civilians in Kursk. And our people are giving them food and water because they are civilians not soldiers. Our soldiers are giving away and sharing what they have. And we can see the bodies of Russian civilians, civilians who were shot by Russian artillery. This is the war.First of all I thank PM Modi who joined me and commemorated the perished children. You know the real number of Ukrainian children who have been killed in the war is unknown. Nobody knows the real number, unfortunately. We can definitely state that dozens of thousands of children were deported and kidnapped by Russia. But how many of them were killed, we will only get to know after the war. Dozens of thousands of deported children. Thousands with changed names and surnames. They have been forced to speak a different language. Many of them who were teens, they have been forced to the battlefield to fight against their own country. This is just horrible. Their relatives don’t have their children back. And unfortunately, with dozens of thousands having been kidnapped, less than 1,000 have been brought back. That’s why it’s very important that many countries join the coalition to bring back Ukrainian children. We would really like India to help with this. Today, the coalition is working with more than 40 countries. But unfortunately, not many countries have managed to bring back our children.Besides this, many children have been affected by the war in Ukraine. Schools have been hit, universities have been hit. Many children have been wounded, many have lost their limbs, and many children have been killed. Many children have left Ukraine with their parents. You know that more than 7 million Ukrainians are now abroad. A big number of them are children. Their parents are staying sometimes here. For instance, the men in the family are left here or they are on the frontline of the war. And their children are being deprived of their childhood. Some of those fathers are dying in the war. This is the situation about the children.You can join the coalition to bring back Ukrainian children. You can support the joint communique of the Peace Summit because the third point was about bringing back the children, you can call Putin and ask him who he is, you can force him to bring the children back, PM Modi can do that because he really has huge influence, he can just say specifically how many Ukrainian children will be given to me so that I could bring them back to Ukraine, just say that directly, just give me 1,000 Ukrainian children who will be brought back to Ukraine. This is the real step. Putin took dozens of thousands. Let PM Modi bring back only 1,000 at least. And if every such influential person as PM Modi is able to bring back 1,000, we will be able to bring back the majority of our children. That’s what is needed to be done. You need to raise this issue at the meeting of G20. India can invite us to this meeting as well together with Brazil. So the G20 can divide the obligations. If 20,000 of Ukrainian children are deported, every leader should take the responsibility to bring back 1,000 children. It’s not just to sit at the table during this summit but to really help the children. The world should be helping.We believe just in the international law. We believe in the international influence of the leaders. We believe in the international mechanism. You are right, just one mechanism, just one international criminal court cannot fully correct the situation. It cannot fully influence Putin and his allies. But all of them together, the ICC, the leaders, international law, UN, G20, altogether can definitely end this war. But the results of the ICC are still felt. Putin is not travelling to the majority of world countries. We can see that. The majority of the leaders who acknowledged and approved the Rome Statute, and still acknowledge the verdict of the ICC, the majority of them try not to visit Putin. Remember, this (the deportation of children) is only the first case of war crimes. There will be many more cases for which more evidence will be provided. As for Mongolia, unfortunately it showed that it is not an independent country.As for PM Modi, we have the platform which is the Peace Summit. The second Peace Summit could be conducted in any respected capital and we communicated that it could be held in New Delhi. Undoubtedly it can be in India and PM Modi can really do that if he can organise a certain summit. But for that we need to prepare ourselves in terms of the proposals on which any number of countries could be heard – the proposals of India, EU, the African continent etc. So if Brazil and China would like to see us as well and they have proposals, please by all means, but only according to our format because the war is in our land. So I think that such a summit can be hosted in India.Thank you and I wish the people of India peace. This is really important.","India's Prime Minister spoke to Times of India about the conflict in Ukraine.

"US, France & Armenia top three buyers of Indian defence exports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-france-armenia-top-three-buyers-of-indian-defence-exports/articleshow/114666748.cms,"NEW DELHI: With India shedding its hesitations in exporting lethal arms to other countries, Armenia has emerged as its biggest client of ‘finished’ weapon systems like Akash air defence missile systems, Pinaka multi-launch rocket systems and 155mm artillery guns, among others.The US, France and Armenia ranked as the top three destinations for defence exports by India, which chalked up military sales worth Rs 21,083 crore ($2.6 billion) to other countries in 2023-24, official sources said on Sunday.Indian public and private sector companies are now exporting a wide range of arms, ammunition and fuses to around 100 countries, which also include some complete weapon systems and platforms like BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles, Dornier-228 aircraft, artillery guns, radars, Akash missiles , Pinaka rockets, and armoured vehicles, the sources added.The exports to the US, however, mainly consist of sub-systems and components, which include global defence majors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin sourcing fuselage, wings, and other parts of aircraft and helicopters from India as part of their global supply chain networks as well as offset commitments.The Tata Boeing Aerospace venture in Hyderabad, for instance, is making the fuselage and secondary structures for Apache attack helicopters. “France, in turn, is importing a lot of software and electronic equipment,” a source said.The former Soviet Republic of Armenia, on its part, has inked a flurry of deals with India over the last four years for import of ‘finished products’ like missiles, artillery guns, rocket systems, weapon-locating radars, bullet-proof vests, and night-vision equipment as well as a wide variety of ammunition and artillery shells. Some of these deals were inked even during Armenia’s clash with Azerbaijan — which has close ties with Turkey and Pakistan — over Nagorno-Karabakh, as reported by TOI earlier.Armenia has become the first foreign customer for the indigenously-developed Akash air defence missiles, which have an interception range of 25 km, while other countries like Brazil are even keen on co-production and co-development of advanced versions of the system. “Brazil wants an inter-governmental agreement on it…talks are underway,” another source said.Similarly, after India clinched the $375-million contract in Jan 2022 for the export of three BrahMos anti-ship coastal missile batteries to the Philippines, other Asean countries as well as some Gulf nations are increasingly showing interest in acquiring the precision-strike missiles that India has co-developed with Russia.India, of course, continues to remain in the strategically-vulnerable position of being the world’s largest arms importer, accounting for 9.8% of the total global imports in the 2019-2023 time-frame.The country, however, is now progressively expanding its domestic defence-industrial base (DIB) and banning import of some weapon systems under the drive for ‘Aatmanirbharta’ (self-reliance) or ‘Make in India’, while aggressively pushing arms exports.With India’s annual defence production reaching a record high of Rs 1.2 lakh crore in 2023-24, the govt has set an ambitious target for it to touch Rs 3 lakh crore by 2028-29, along with arms exports of Rs 50,000 crore.India’s defence-industrial base, apart from the 16 defence PSUs, has now expanded to over 430 licenced companies and 16,000 MSMEs, with around three times increase in value of production since 2014-15. The private sector’s contribution amounts to 21% in this, the official sources said.","The US, France and Armenia ranked as the top three destinations for defence exports by India. India chalked up military sales worth Rs 21,083 crore ($2.6 billion) to other countries in 2023-24.

US sends back a planeload of illegal Indian immigrants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-sends-back-a-planeload-of-illegal-indian-immigrants/articleshow/114633377.cms,"NEW DELHI: The United States earlier this week sent back a plane load of illegal Indian immigrants to India, according to an announcement by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Indian govt sources here said that the deportation by a chartered plane was a result of cooperation with the US on migration and mobility .DHS said a large-frame charter removal flight was conducted on Oct 22 to India of Indian nationals who did not establish legal basis to remain in the United States. This shows the “department’s continued commitment to pursuing sustained cooperation with the Indian govt and other international partners to reduce and deter irregular migration and jointly work to counter human smuggling”, it said in a press release. DHS, however, did not give details about the number of immigrants or about where they came from in India.“Indian nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States are subject to swift removal, and intending migrants should not fall for the lies of smugglers who proclaim otherwise,” said senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary of Homeland Security Kristie A Canegallo. “DHS will continue to enforce our nation’s laws,” added the official.Sources in the Indian govt said as part of India-US cooperation on migration and mobility, both sides are engaged in a process to deter illegal migration. “This is being done to create more avenues for legal migration from India to the US. The latest deportation of Indian nationals by a chartered flight is a result of this cooperation,” said an official, adding such deportations have been happening for several years.Since June 2024, DHS said, it removed or returned over 160,000 individuals and operated more than 495 international repatriation flights to more than 145 countries — including India.The Indian govt said in Parliament last year that according to data published by US Customs and Border Protection on their website, the number of illegal Indian immigrants encountered by US authorities in 2023 was 96,917. The annual India-US Consular Dialogue is a mechanism through which both countries discuss consular issues of mutual interest including ensuring safe and legal migration.DHS said it regularly engages with foreign govts throughout the hemisphere and around the world to accept repatriations of their nationals without a legal basis to remain in the United States.“This is one tool among many DHS uses to reduce irregular migration, promote the use of safe, lawful, and orderly pathways, and hold transnational criminal networks accountable for smuggling and exploitation of vulnerable people,” it said.",The deportation by a chartered plane was a result of cooperation with the US on migration and mobility. DHS said a large-frame charter removal flight was conducted on Oct 22 to India of Indian nationals who did not establish legal basis to remain in the United States.

We were attacked and we did nothing: Jaishankar on 26/11,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-were-attacked-and-we-did-nothing-jaishankar-on-26/11/articleshow/114665274.cms,"MUMBAI: Maharashtra requires a govt that is on the same page as the Centre, in which the country as well as the world will repose faith, said external affairs minister S Jaishankar . Reiterating govt's zero-tolerance policy on terrorism , he said, ""When we talk of zero tolerance against terror, it is clear that when somebody does something, there will be a response.""On the India-China border standoff, Jaishankar said the two countries would go back to the arrangement that existed in April 2020 along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. ""We expect to return to pre-Oct 31, 2020, patrolling arrangements in areas like Demchok and Depsang. This will take some time,"" he said.Jaishankar was on a visit to Mumbai on Sunday. Addressing a press conference at BJP's Mumbai office in Dadar, he said a double-engine govt is required as Centre works at the international level enhancing India's image while the state govt works at the ground level. ""PM Modi works very hard attending international investment conferences and when the investments come to the country, the state govt plays a role. Success depends upon state govts being positive, sincere partners,"" he said.On the opposition's charge that investments coming to Maharashtra were being taken to Gujarat, Jaishankar said federal competition for investments is in the country's interest, adding that not all investments that came to the country went to Gujarat. ""The investor makes his own assessment and when he sees a performing govt, he goes there. One needs to see which govt was there (when investments went out of the state). Everyone needs to think of their performance,"" he said.He said India-Middle East Economic Corridor connecting to Europe is one of the most talked-about connectivity corridors today. ""Maharashtra, given its geography, will be at the centre of it,"" he said, highlighting the importance of the Vadhavan port.On the India-China border tensions, Jaishankar said the disengagement of the two armies is the first step in ending the four-year-long standoff in Ladakh. ""We expect our two armies at Depsang and Demchok to return to their earlier positions,"" he said, adding that the de-escalation, as both armies are heavily armed, will not happen until India is sure that the same is happening on the other side as well.On countering terrorism, he said Mumbai is a symbol of counter-terrorism. ""We should not have a repeat of what happened in Mumbai. We were attacked and we did nothing. This is unacceptable. Wherever required, we will act after thinking it through thoroughly,"" he said. When India was a member of the UN Security Council, it was chairing the counter-terrorism committee, Jaishankar said.

IndiGo alone received ""security-related alerts"" for 18 flights through the day, of which two - Pune-Jodhpur (6E 133) and Kozhikode-Dammam (6E 87) - had to be diverted to Ahmedabad and Mumbai, respectively.

In the past 14 days, 350-odd flights have been caught in the mayhem of hoax messages, resulting in thousands of passengers being delayed and the airlines suffering financial losses running into hundreds of crores of rupees.A Goa-Vadodara flight was diverted to Surat late Sunday evening after a bomb threat minutes before it was to land at its destination. The alert came hours before PM Narendra Modi's scheduled visit to Vadodara on Monday. As of 9.30pm Sunday, the flight was grounded at Surat as checks continued.Govt has asked social media intermediaries like X and Meta to curb the misinformation and warned them of strict action if they failed to do so.

Gujarati now third most-spoken Indian language in Canada,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarati-now-third-most-spoken-indian-language-in-canada/articleshow/114638545.cms,":

AhmedabadGujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada, following Punjabi and Hindi . According to data from Statistics Canada , around 87,900 Gujarati-speaking immigrants have settled in Canada since 1980, with a notable 26% of them arriving in the country between 2016 and 2021.During this latter period, Punjabi speakers constituted the largest linguistic group at 75,475, followed by Hindi speakers at 35,170. Gujarati speakers ranked third, with 22,935 immigrants, while Malayalam and Bengali speakers followed with 15,440 and 13,835, respectively.The data also revealed that Gujarati immigrants experienced the second-highest decadal growth among major linguistic groups, with a 26% increase between 2011 and 2021, following a 22% rise among Punjabi speakers. Hindi speakers saw a dramatic growth of 114% during the same period. Kutchi — another language from Gujarat — also featured in the statistics, with a decrease in migration from 460 speakers between 2001 and 2010 to 370 from 2011 to 2021.The migration trend for Gujaratis surged after 2011 as Canada became a favoured alternative to US and other English-speaking countries. “US was a hot favourite for decades, but people struggled with visa processing and high costs. With UK, Australia, and New Zealand also introducing restrictions, Canada’s easier permanent residency process and lower educational costs made it an attractive option for students,” immigration consultant Sameer Yadav said.To put this growth into perspective, the number of Gujarati-speaking immigrants was 13,365 between 1991 and 2000, rising to 29,620 in the following decade, and reaching 37,405 from 2011 to 2021.However, recent changes to immigration policies have raised concerns within the community. Increased housing challenges, job market saturation, and stricter permanent residency requirements have already led to an alarming 80% drop in visa applications for Canada from Gujarat, according to a visa consultant in Ahmedabad.“With fewer visa opportunities, enquiries from students and professionals have dramatically declined, with most applications now coming from those who already hold Canadian PR seeking to bring over family members,” the consultant said.","Gujarati is the third most-spoken language among Indian immigrants in Canada.

Govt will have to decide on 4 key appointments soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-will-have-to-decide-on-4-key-appointments-soon/articleshow/114666821.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Centre will have to decide on four key appointments in as many months, starting with a replacement for G S Murmu, whose term as Comptroller and Auditor General is due to end in November. A trusted Modi government bureaucrat is likely to bag the coveted assignment to keep a watch over the Centre’s spending and accounts.While Murmu can’t be given a fresh term, the other three incumbents — Reserve Bank of India governor, chief economic adviser and Sebi chairperson — can be reappointed. After CAG, govt has to decide if it wants to give another stint to Shaktikanta Das in Dec or look for a replacement for the crucial job on Mumbai’s Mint Road.Das, a former civil servant, was given a three-year term in December 2018 after Urjit Patel’s sudden resignation following a bitter tussle with govt. Das was given a second term three years ago and is widely seen to have managed the financial sector well and has had a smooth relationship with the Centre, something his two predecessors could not manage.A month after the RBI appointment, govt will be faced with the same question on whether to continue with chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran. Given that the budget exercise kicks off in the next few weeks, govt may decide earlier if its top economist is likely to get a fresh term. The CEA provides crucial technical inputs for the budget and also authors the Economic Survey along with his colleagues in the finance ministry’s economic division.The fourth job, that of Sebi chief, is likely to pose the biggest dilemma for the govt given the controversy around Madhabi Puri Buch, the first woman and the first from the private sector to head the regulatory agency. Puri Buch has faced allegations of impropriety and conflict of interest, charges she has denied, amid chatter in govt over how civil servants are best suited to take up such regulatory assignments.On March 1, 2022, the former banker was named Sebi chief for three years and is eligible for a fresh term. At least three of her predecessors G N Bajpai, M Damodaran and C B Bhave have had three-year stints.","G S Murmu's term as Comptroller and Auditor General is due to end in November.

This opinion from a drug costing expert was part of an affidavit filed by a 24-year-old SMA patient in Kerala high court.Dr Melissa Barber of Yale University, who has worked as a consultant for WHO, World Bank and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and has specialised in developing and refining methods for estimating the cost of production of medicines, conducted a cost analysis for risdiplam on the request of the petitioner. “Even a markup of 1,000% (unit price $12.83 per 60mg/80mL vial) would result in a 99% decrease relative to current prices in the United States ($11,170 per vial),” stated Dr Barber on the price of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) required for making risdiplam.In her submission to the court, Dr Barber pointed out that risdiplam was the preferred treatment for SMA in many health systems contexts for both cost and ease of administration. It can be administered orally by family members, while other SMA treatments require infusion or injections using lumbar punctures, she added. “Risdiplam is a small-molecule medicine, with less complex manufacture than other treatments for SMA. Production in small volumes is both feasible and cost-effective,” she stated. The costing Dr Barber submitted to the court included costs of materials (active pharmaceutical ingredient, excipients, vial), formulation and secondary packaging costs, a 20% mark-up, and tax on profit.While the health ministry affidavit filed in Sept stated that financial assistance for patients with rare diseases has been increased from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, the petitioner pointed out that it would not be adequate unless indigenous production was made possible. The ministry stated that a digital platform for crowdfunding has been started to facilitate donors to contribute to the treatment costs of patients with rare diseases. The petitioner’s affidavit pointed out that the digital platform has been a non-starter with just Rs 3.5 lakh collected through it when the number of patients registered as of Oct 14, was 2,340.Her affidavit pointed out that the ministry did not respond to the court’s specific query about how the supply of medicines for the patients could be continued, considering that financial assistance and crowdfunding were insufficient. The ministry merely stated that the department of health research was set to launch a programme developing 12 indigenous drugs for rare diseases without stating whether these 12 drugs included risdiplam.National Rare Diseases’ Committee was constituted through an order in May 2023 for implementing National Policy for Rare Diseases, 2021. The ministry response stated that the short-term goal of the committee is to look after procurement of drugs, while the mid-term goal is indigenisation of drugs. However, there were no details regarding what steps it had taken for creating a conducive environment for indigenous manufacture of drugs for rare diseases at affordable prices as stated in the policy, the petitioner’s affidavit stated.","A drug to treat Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) that costs about Rs 72 lakh per patient per year could be produced for as little as Rs 3,000 per year if India would allow local manufacture.

India's first home-grown electric propulsion satellite to be launched in Dec: Isro chief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-first-home-grown-electric-propulsion-satellite-to-be-launched-in-dec-isro-chief/articleshow/114665755.cms,"NEW DELHI: To make its satellites lighter in future, Isro is going to launch its first home-grown electric propulsion-led spacecraft in Dec, space agency chairman S Somanath announced while also specifying new deadlines for its upcoming key missions like Gaganyaan , Chandrayaan-4 and-5, and Indo-US NISAR satellite project.Delivering the Sardar Patel Memorial Lecture at Akashvani, Somanath said Technology Demonstrator Satellite ( TDS-1 ), which will be steered in space to its desired orbit with electric propulsion rather than fuel-run thrusters, is ready. “TDS-1 and Isro's first spacecraft docking experiment (SPADEX), which will help in setting up India's own space station in future, are ready and will be launched in Dec.”""Electric propulsion system (EPS) will bring down the overall mass of a satellite as chemical fuel is not required in bulk. EPS uses energy of the Sun to move a satellite from the launch orbit to a geostationary orbit. It is a very interesting technology,"" Somanath explained.A four-tonne communication satellite carries more than two tonnes of liquid fuel, which is used to fire thrusters to steer the satellite in space. But in case of electric propulsion, fuel requirement reduces to just 200 kg. As fuel mass is reduced, the electric propulsion system-based satellite will not weigh more than two tonnes but will still have the power of a 4-tonne satellite. The propellant gases in the electric propulsion system (EPS) such as Argon as fuel are ionised using solar power.The EPS was first used to power the South Asia Satellite — GSAT-9 — launched by Isro in May 2017. However, that EPS was entirely imported from Russia.The Isro chairman also informed that India has its own navigation system NavIC under which nine navigation satellites have been launched till now. These satellites have been using the L5 band that is largely restricted for strategic services by the armed forces. “However, now we are introducing L1 band in satellites that will allow civilians to easily access our own navigation system in their mobiles. Our NaVIC is much more accurate than other navigation systems. We are going to launch five more satellites with L1 band,” Somanath said.Sharing specific deadlines for its upcoming key missions, Somanath said the Gaganyaan manned mission is likely to be launched in 2026, the lunar sample return mission called Chandrayaan-4 will be carried out in 2028, and the Indo-US joint space mission is scheduled to be carried out next year.About the fifth lunar mission with Japanese space agency JAXA, originally named LUPEX and now rechristened Chandrayaan-5, the new deadline for the mission is likely to be after 2028, Somanath said.On the Nasa-Isro Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite, which is considered to be the world’s most expensive earth imaging satellite, Somanath said the work on the radar antenna reflector was complete and the crucial component was flown from Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California to Isro's spacecraft integration and test facility in Bengaluru. Somanath said the integration of the radar antenna reflector with the satellite will take about two months. ""We will schedule it for launch in Feb,"" the Isro chairman said.",Isro is going to launch its first home-grown electric propulsion-led spacecraft in Dec.

"Agent Vikash: Wanted by FBI, but patriot to his village",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agent-vikash-wanted-by-fbi-but-patriot-to-his-village/articleshow/114599403.cms,"Vikash Yadav’s house in Pranpura is harder to reach than to find. It’s only after clearing a couple of verification rounds from locals that the large iron gate that hides most of the single-storey house with a pink fence — on the last line of settlements beyond which lies typically shrub-speckled Aravali terrain — parts. But there’s no going in unaccompanied.“Sensitive matter,” we are told by a group playing cards that is our first ‘check point’.“No cameras, please, and no recording on the mobile phone,” we are subsequently told by our local escort who agrees to show us the way.Sporadically seen and rarely heard from, Vikash is as inconspicuous as he could be in Pranpura, just one among hundreds of its youths who took up jobs and left and return only to visit family. This changed last week, sensationally.On Oct 17, Vikash shot to the top of an unravelling international diplomatic row after the United States department of justice revealed it had brought murder-for-hire charges against him for the attempted assassination of New York-based separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. Vikash, according to the American indictment, was also aware of the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar , another separatist, last year in Canada, which has brought a chill in New Delhi-Ottawa ties after the Justin Trudeau govt alleged Indian govt agencies were involved.Though the US indictment refers to Vikash as an Indian govt official — employed by the cabinet secretariat that oversees R&AW — New Delhi has denied it, saying Vikash had been dismissed from service. In a recent statement, Union ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Vikash Yadav is no longer an employee of govt of India.”Pranpura and Vikash’s family believe neither.The watch has been necessitated by journalists landing up and making inquiries about Vikash since the US indictment revealed his name as a co-conspirator (CC1). Pranpura, part of a cluster of villages in Haryana’s Rewari district near the industrial town of Bawal, is 105 km to Delhi’s south, but not on any of the state or national highways that crisscross the region. In this place of familiar faces and routines, the American revelation creased many brows for two reasons — that Vikash was now wanted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the indictment’s implication that he was working as an Indian spy.“How do you know what the Americans are saying is true?” shot back Sudesh. In her 60s, Vikash’s mother spoke from behind the gate after our escort, Rajeev, called out to her. Sudesh, and anyone else you talk to in the village, insist Vikash has always been and remains a govt employee.“My son works for the country and our govt will take care of him,” said Sudesh, who knows little else about Vikash’s job except that he is a “CRPF (Central Reserve Police Force) commandant”.It’s how the rest of Pranpura — which prides itself as a ‘fauji gaon’ (Army village) with a martyrs’ memorial next to the panchayat office its most prominent landmark — knows Vikash too. Like many of them, Rajeev, a neighbour of Sudesh, brushed off the Pannun plot revelation, calling Vikash “a patriot who serves the country”.Vikash, now 39, was born in a ‘fauji’ household in the mid-80s. His father Ram Singh Yadav was in the BSF and died of a heart attack in 2007 when he was posted in Tripura. The family moved around the North East with Yadav senior’s postings, so Vikash and Ajay did their schooling in different places, including Shillong . But both completed their graduation from Ahir College in Rewari.Ajay is now posted in Gurgaon as a police head constable. His wife and two children live with Sudesh. Vikash’s family — wife and one-year-old daughter — is in Delhi.“Our family has always served the country,” said Sudesh. “I don’t believe Vikash committed any crime.” Vikash, added Sudesh, does not visit home regularly and “calls once in a while”. “I don’t know where he and his family are right now. He hasn’t contacted us,” she said, declining comment on media reports that Vikash had spoken to his family after his name as CC-1 was revealed and rubbished the charges.Sudesh said she also had no idea about his arrest last year by Delhi Police. The arrest on Dec 18 by Delhi Police’s Special Cell, on charges of extortion and kidnapping of a businessman from Rohini, followed the first indictment in the Pannun plot probe by the department of justice last Nov. Vikash spent three months in custody before a Delhi court granted him six days of interim bail on March 22 to see his daughter who was undergoing treatment for acute respiratory infection.The court order described Vikash as an “ex-govt employee with clean antecedents”. On April 22, Vikash was granted regular bail with no objection from the prosecution.A Central Administrative Tribunal principal bench order dated Nov 29, 2023 shows Vikash was appointed senior field officer (SFO) of Aviation Research Centre (ARC) in the executive cadre of Directorate General of Security (cabinet secretariat) on Oct 9, 2023 after the completion of probation. ARC is part of R&AW. Vikash knocked on CAT’s door for permanent appointment after working as a probationer in the agency since Nov 2015.In May, soon after his release from prison, Vikash visited Pranpura, the last time Sudesh claims she saw him. “He came here alone and stayed for a couple of days. He didn’t tell me that he was arrested,” Sudesh said.Vikash, neighbour Rajeev offered, hardly left his home during visits, so interactions with him since he began working were rare. “He was good in academics and a fitness freak,” Rajeev said.A local resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity said no one in India would see Vikash as a criminal, even if the US indictment is true. “Pannun is a wanted accused in India and America does not want to hand him over to us. They also did not hand over (26/11 Mumbai terror attacks accused) David Headley, who is a terrorist. Assuming Vikash is an Indian officer, why should India hand him over for doing his job?” he said. Another villager said since the US indictment named Vikash, police had visited the sarpanch and made some inquiries. “No security has been posted here as they felt it is not required in our village. It is safe here,” said a neighbour of Sudesh.“We will wait and watch. What else can we do?” said a neighbour. “Sarkar dekh legi.”How do you know what the Americans are saying is true, asks Vikash’s mother Sudesh, speaking from behind the gate of their house at Pranpura in Rewari. She insists, along with others from the village, that he is a patriot and a govt employee, calling the US’s murder-for-hire allegations ‘false’.","Vikash Yadav shot to the top of an unravelling international diplomatic row after the United States department of justice revealed it had brought murder- for-hire charges against him.

NEW DELHI: The air quality in New Delhi worsened on Sunday, with the Air Quality Index(AQI) recorded at 352, falling into the 'very poor' category, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research ( SAFAR ).The AQI in the Anand Vihar area exceeded 400, reaching 405 at 7am, categorized as 'severe,' compared to 367 recorded on Saturday.Other areas also reported concerning levels; the AQI at Akshardham Temple deteriorated to 261, while IGI Airport recorded an AQI of 324, both in the 'very poor' category. The city experienced a thick layer of smog in certain areas.Himanshu, a visitor to Delhi, described the pollution as ""suffocating"" and urged the government to take action to reduce it. A daily cyclist in the city shared similar concerns, stating, “We can’t breathe properly; we get tired faster due to the pollution. We take precautions like wearing a bandana, but nothing seems to work as pollution levels continue to rise.”The cyclist also noted that the government’s measures, such as stopping construction and implementing the odd-even rule, do not seem effective. He added, ""There should be constructive measures to encourage people to use public transport and carpooling."" BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari criticized the AAP government, stating, ""Pollution in Delhi is at a life-threatening level. Since 2015, Arvind Kejriwal has claimed he would take a dip in the Yamuna, but he has yet to do so because the river is dirty and the situation is dire due to pollution.""He further stated, ""Arvind Kejriwal can install 40 air purifiers in his large bungalows and hotels, but what about the person living in a slum?

CHENNAI: Around 160 passengers onboard an IndiGo flight from Jaipur on Saturday were puzzled as the flight took off soon after touching down at Chennai airport . Airport authorities clarified that it was due to the long float of the flight into the runway caused by crosswinds .The flight touched down at the main runway beyond the threshold point. The alert pilot, realising the flight might not have enough runway space to slow down, decided to take off immediately. However, nothing untoward happened to the passengers in the incident.The flight (6E265) from Jaipur usually reaches Chennai at 1.05 pm. On Saturday, it arrived a little earlier and was about to land at 12.45pm. However, due to crosswinds, the pilot could not touch down at the start of the runway, and the flight floated in and touched the middle of the runway. The flight took off immediately, went around and landed again at 12.58 pm.Airport authorities have said only when the flight lands at the threshold point will the pilot have enough runway time to slow down the flight and taxi it to the parking bay.","The flight touched down at the main runway beyond the threshold point.

RBI’s rosy growth forecast baffles economists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbis-rosy-growth-forecast-baffles-economists/articleshow/114673065.cms,"RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said earlier this month an interest rate cut at this stage would be “very, very risky”.

Festival season sales

The Reserve Bank of India ’s upbeat growth estimates for the world’s fastest-growing major economy is causing both confusion and concern among economists.The central bank has stuck to its forecast that India’s economy will expand 7.2% in the year ending March 2025 despite recent evidence showing activity is starting to taper off. The RBI ’s outlook is far more optimistic than the 6.5%-7% growth projected by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs Corp have already downgraded growth projections to as low as 6.5%.The RBI’s bullishness is underpinned by its view that rural spending is improving and private investment is picking up. Economists, though, point to sluggish urban consumption and weakening exports as a worry. If those warning signals aren’t heeded in time, the RBI runs the risk of keeping monetary policy too tight, undermining growth further, they say.“The RBI’s forecast is higher than what a margin error around market forecast would allow,” said Dhiraj Nim, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Corp. “I don’t think the overall macro mix has evolved very encouragingly in the last couple of months” to support the central bank’s predictions, he said.From sales of cars and coffee to manufacturing, there has been a downturn in several sections of the economy. India’s factory activity had been softening since July, although it registered an uptick this month. Passenger vehicle sales fell for two months in a row in September, while air travel has declined three out of the four months since June.The lingering spell of weak demand for consumer goods in cities has hurt profits of some of the biggest companies in the country, like Hindustan Unilever Ltd, which makes everything from soap to tea. “The pattern is quite clear that urban growth has trended down in recent quarters,” Rohit Jawa, the company’s chief executive officer, said in an earnings call on Wednesday.Muted economic activity comes at a time when the RBI has kept its key interest rate unchanged for almost two years. Governor Shaktikanta Das said earlier this month an interest rate cut at this stage would be “very, very risky” and he’s in no hurry to join the wave of easing by global policymakers. He reiterated on Friday that he wants to see inflation on a “durable descent” to the 4% target.“There’s a risk of a policy misstep if you keep rates higher for longer,” said Teresa John, an economist with Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, projecting a 6.6% expansion for the year. Monetary policy works with a lag, so the more time the RBI takes to cut rates, the greater time it will take to spread through the economy, she said.While the RBI expects a revival in demand in the ongoing festival season, economists said that may not be enough to sustain long-term growth. The three-month long festive period, which culminates with the Hindu-festival of Diwali this week, typically makes up 20%-30% of the annual sales for various companies.“There is hope that this Diwali will be lit, but the light might not last several quarters,” said Achala Jethmalani, an economist at RBL Bank Ltd. “Even if there is a jump in consumption during the festive season, it is expected to be seasonal and the momentum could possibly fade” in later months, she said.Even though momentum is picking up in rural markets after above-normal monsoons and a bumper crop, it’s still not enough to make up for the bleakness in cities, where consumers spend much more.“Rural is recovering from where it was,” Sunil D’Souza, managing director of Tata Consumers Products Ltd, told investors after the company’s earnings. “But it is still not at the stage where it gives us a double-digit volume growth.”",The central bank has stuck to its forecast that India’s economy will expand 7.2% in the year ending March 2025.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Yum! Brands Inc and Burger King removed onions from some of their locations as the restaurant industry investigates an E. Coli outbreak first traced to McDonald’s Corp.Yum withdrew fresh onions from some Taco Bell , Pizza Hut and KFC locations “out of an abundance of caution,” the company said Thursday in a statement to Bloomberg News, without disclosing which stores and regions were affected or naming suppliers.“We will continue following supplier and regulatory guidance to ensure the ongoing safety and quality of our food,” the company said.Burger King said Thursday that it gets some of its onions from a Colorado facility run by Taylor Farms, which supplied the McDonald’s restaurants that have been impacted by the outbreak.Taylor Farms issued a recall of some its yellow onion batches despite finding no traces of E. coli as of Wednesday. Restaurant distributors US Foods Holding Corp and Sysco Corp have also notified customers of the recall.“Despite no contact from health authorities and no indications of illness, we proactively asked our 5% of restaurants who received whole onions distributed by this facility to dispose of them immediately two days ago and we are in the process of restocking them from other facilities,” Burger King said.Fat Brands Inc, owner of restaurants including Johnny Rockets, said it pulled all of Taylor Farms’ fresh onion products.“We have identified an extremely limited number of Buffalo’s Cafe locations and Ponderosa and Bonanza Steakhouses that are currently utilizing Taylor Farms as a supplier for onions,” the company said in a statement Thursday.The restaurant industry is on alert after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that an E. coli outbreak likely tied to pre-slivered onions served on McDonald’s Quarter Pounders sickened dozens of people in the US and killed one. Burger King said it buys whole onions that are cut, peeled and sliced in its restaurants.McDonald’s pulled the popular product from about 20% of its more than 13,000 US restaurants, and it’s working with health authorities to confirm the source of the contamination.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc said in a statement Thursday that it doesn’t source onions from Taylor Farms or any ingredients from the Colorado facility.Inspire Brands Inc, which owns Arby’s, Buffalo Wild Wings, Sonic, Jimmy John’s, Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin’, said its onions don’t come from the facility. It hadn’t pulled onions or any other ingredients from restaurants as of Thursday evening in New York.",Yum!

McDonald’s on Sunday announced that Quarter Pounders will again be on its menu after testing ruled out beef patties as the source of the E. coli outbreak that killed one person and sickened at least 75 others across 13 states.The fast-food chain's Chief Supply Chain Officer, Cesar Pina , stated, ""We remain very confident that any contaminated product related to this outbreak has been removed from our supply chain and is out of all McDonald's restaurants,"" after the outbreak linked to quarter pounder hamburgers sickened nearly 75 people and caused one fatality, New York Times reported.The company confirmed that Quarter Pounders would not include raw slivered onions, which federal regulators suspect to be the likely cause of the outbreak.McDonald's referred to tests conducted in Colorado, the state with the highest number of reported cases. The Colorado Agriculture Department's website stated, ""The CDA Microbiology Laboratory analyzed dozens of subsamples from all the lots and all samples were found to be negative for E. coli. CDA has completed all beef testing and does not anticipate receiving further samples.""According to McDonald's spokesmen, Colorado health officials tested beef samples from the two suppliers that provided patties to the 900 affected locations across a dozen states. The company is not aware of any other state health agency currently testing the beef patties for E. coli.Regarding the slivered onions, McDonald's announced on Friday that it would stop purchasing onions from the Colorado Springs site of its major regional supplier, Taylor Farms, a multistate producer of vegetables and fruits. Last week,Taylor Farms recalled several yellow onion products, including diced and slivered, due to ""potential E. coli contamination.""E. coli is eliminated in beef when properly cooked. The McDonald's Quarter Pounder is typically served with raw, slivered onions; affected restaurants will serve the burgers without these onions, Reuters reported.McDonald's has removed the Quarter Pounder from approximately one-fifth of its U.S. restaurants, including those in Colorado, Kansas, Utah, Wyoming, and parts of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.Previous E. coli outbreaks have negatively impacted sales at large fast-food restaurants as customers avoid the affected chains.",E. coli outbreak linked to quarter pounder hamburgers sickened nearly 75 people and caused one fatality.

MALE: The president of cash-strapped Maldives will take a 50% pay cut as part of an austerity drive that will see public sector salaries reduced to prevent a debt crisis in the tourist hotspot, his office said Thursday. Mohamed Muizzu is introducing a mandatory 10% pay cut to most public sector jobs, leading the belt-tightening with the biggest salary reduction , his office said in a statement.A government source told AFP that Muizzu's annual salary will be reduced to 600,000 rufiyaa ($39,087) from next year - down from 1.2 million rufiyaa but nearly double the average household income of 316,740 rufiyaa per year, according to a 2016 census. Judges and lawmakers in parliament will be exempt from the cuts, though Muizzu's office said he expects them to share the burden by agreeing to a 10% cut voluntarily.Two weeks ago, Muizzu sacked more than 225 political appointees , including ministers, in a bid to reduce expenditure. Among those sacked were seven state ministers, 43 deputy ministers, and 178 political directors. The move is expected to save the country about $370,000 a month. The Maldives said in September that its financial troubles were ""temporary"" and that it had no plans to seek an IMF bailout .","Mohamed Muizzu is introducing a mandatory 10% pay cut to most public sector jobs.

The disease is caused by a mite which burrows under the skin to lay eggs and is contaminated through physical contact, bedding and clothes.BBC quoted the Royal College of GPs RCGP as urging public to take necessary precaution, which is now spreading quickly in crowded places such as universities and care homes. The doctors also urged people to shed off the ""social stigma"" attached to it and come forward to address the disease.The report also quoted professor Kamila Hawthorne, RCGP chairwoman as saying while incidences remained infrequent, the number of GP diagnoses was ""above the five-year average and rising, with the north of England seeing a spike in cases"".""While not a serious condition, scabies can be very itchy and irritating,"" she said.""If not properly treated, it can spread and increase a patient’s risk of complications, such as secondary skin infections or make existing skin conditions worse.""According to NHS data , 3,689 cases of scabies were diagnosed in hospitals across England in the year ending in April, marking a rise from 2,128 cases the previous year.The report gathered accounts from students at five universities who reported clusters of scabies cases that seemed to appear ""out of nowhere,"" with entire households affected.One student described was quoted as noticing ""tiny red dots"" spreading along his wrist and later discovered a housemate had also contracted scabies, prompting him to realize he had it as well. Another student said he had been struggling to eliminate the infection for ""two to three months"" and speculated that ""sleeping together"" may have been the cause.Professor Hawthorne advised that, despite any stigma associated with scabies, people should not ignore their symptoms, as delaying treatment can worsen the condition and increase the risk of transmission.Medical professionals in the UK have recommend that all individuals infected receive simultaneous treatment with a pharmacy cream or lotion. Bedding and clothing should also be washed at a high temperature to reduce reinfection risk.","3,689 cases of scabies diagnosed in hospitals across England in the year ending in April, marking a rise from 2,128 cases the previous year.

LONDON: British head of state King Charles III 's remote private estate in the Scottish Highlands could become an exclusive location for weddings, if an application to the local council is approved.Documents submitted for consideration next week by the Licensing Board of the local Aberdeenshire Council outline plans to allow ""weddings, dinners, meetings and associated events"" at the Queen's Building on the royal Balmoral Estate .The Queen's Building lies just north of Balmoral Castle near the estate's office and stables, and was built in the 1980s as staff quarters and a canteen.It was converted last year to accommodate dining for visitors.If approved at next Wednesday's meeting, the venue could host up to 277 guests inside, with a further 144 on an outside patio.Permission to sell alcohol and play music is also part of the application, which was submitted on April 30, the documents showed.""These events may involve live performances and dancing, where alcohol may be sold up to 12:30 am. These events will be rare throughout the year,"" the application added.A spokesman for the estate said on Thursday that there were ""no plans for Balmoral to host weddings as a commercial venture"".Balmoral, set in 50,000 acres (20,000 hectares) of sprawling grouse moors, forest and farmland, is located around 50 miles (30 kilometres) west of Aberdeen and was the late Queen Elizabeth II's favourite royal residence.She died there on September 8, 2022, aged 96 after a period of ill health.Privately owned by the monarch, the castle was bought by Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert in the mid-19th century and has since become a favoured summer retreat for the royals.Its grounds have been open to the public for many years and provision for tourists has gradually increased in recent times, with holiday cottages and Land Rover tours of the estate.This year the rest of the venue was opened to visitors for the first time, billed as part of plans by King Charles III to give a better insight into royal life.Tickets for the guided tours were snapped up within 24 hours of going on sale, despite prices upwards of £100 ($130).","Application to allow weddings at King Charles III's Balmoral Estate in Scottish Highlands.
