Indo-US S&T ties likely to stay course under Trump 2.0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indo-us-st-ties-likely-to-stay-course-under-trump-2-0/articleshow/115036456.cms,"BENGALURU: As has been the case with any US Presidential election in the past few decades, the 47th also has stakes transcending national boundaries with both allies and rivals hedging future bets — anticipation, speculation, wishful thinking all rent the air.And as Donald Trump prepares to occupy the Oval Office for the second time, Indian science and technology sector anticipates bilateral partnership to remain robust, even as there’s speculation that leadership change may, albeit slightly, alter the trajectory of this cooperation.Trump takes office as India and the US are significantly expanding their technological cooperation across multiple critical and emerging sectors, with particular emphasis on space exploration, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and advanced telecommunications.For instance, Isro and Nasa have strengthened their space partnership, signing a joint statement in Jan 2024 to enhance collaboration, including International Space Station initiatives. Their key joint project remains the Nisar satellite for Earth observation. Indian astronaut-designates Shubhanshu Shukla and Prashanth Nair are training in the US — the former will go to ISS on an Axiom Space mission.The Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), launched in Jan 2023, has facilitated broader tech cooperation. The second iCET Summit in July 2024 reviewed progress in space, semiconductors, AI, quantum computing, and clean energy.The US National Science Foundation and Indian scientific departments have expanded research partnerships across multiple fields. The Sept 2023 MoU between the IIT Council and Association of American Universities established the India-US Global Challenges Institute, focusing on sustainable energy, health, semiconductors, AI, and quantum science.Principal Scientific Advisor to GoI, Prof AK Sood, told TOI: “I don’t see any major red flag or reason to expect drastic changes in S&T cooperation. These are long-standing, national priorities for both countries, and commitment to enhance technological cooperation will likely continue. The large, ongoing projects will proceed without significant disruption.”Terming Indo-US S&T cooperation “very mature” and “well-established”, particularly in emerging and critical technologies, former DST secretary Prof Ashutosh Sharma said there is a consensus direction that this cooperation is headed.“...Areas like quantum technologies, AI, biotech, and clean energy would likely remain on track regardless of the political change. Basic and translational research cooperation is well-established at this point,” he said.Nisha Mendiratta, executive director, Indo-US Science & Technology Forum (IUSSTF), said that by and large, the long-term collaborations and cooperations will continue. “There may be some shifts in priorities, but the fundamental cooperation in providing technological solutions to societal challenges is expected to remain a key focus area,” she added.Space is geopolitics, says Susmita Mohanty, director general of space think tank Spaceport SARABHAI, adding that in this geopolitical play that began in the 1960s, France (CNES) and Soviet Union/Russia (Roscosmos) have been India’s friends for over half a century.“The US will need several decades to catch-up to that level of cooperation and to heal the negative impact of their 1998 technology sanctions on India. Notwithstanding who the US President is, the 21st century cooperation between Isro and Nasa (e.g. Moon, Mars missions, Nisar) will stay the course. The US needs India for economic and strategic reasons, so there is no going back. However, ITAR and other regulatory hurdles will continue to limit the scope, scale and speed of the Indo-American alignment,” Mohanty said.She added that if the US was indeed serious about building trust and a long-term relationship with India in aerospace and defence, the US President should consider elevating India to the status of an “ally”.","India and the US are significantly expanding their technological cooperation across multiple critical and emerging sectors.

Monkey wrench in donkey route of Indians,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monkey-wrench-in-donkey-route-of-indians/articleshow/115036228.cms,"The centrepiece of Trump’s reelection bid was a promise to deport record numbers of undocumented immigrants. If what he calls the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history” becomes reality, it would impact an estimated 11 million people who are in the US without authorisation.According to Pew Research Center, there were about 725,000 undocumented Indians in the US in 2021, making them the third-largest such group in the country. During FY2024, US Customs and Border Protection revealed that an average of 10 Indian nationals were arrested every hour while attempting to illegally cross US borders. Many of them are Gujaratis. Jimmy Patel (name changed on request) from Vijapur, in Mehsana, who is preparing to sneak into the US, said during his previous term, the “Trump Wall” had been unable to keep out illegal immigrants. “Trump had built the wall, but it was porous, with ways to get through. But under Biden, legal entry became nearly impossible due to complicated asylum procedures. Trump now may make the illegal path tougher, but if India and America work closely, the legal route could improve,” Patel said.“Trump administration might make it harder to cross into the US through Mexico or Canada, but we are hopeful Indians might not face the same scrutiny. Trump may not see us as a burden as many Indian immigrants come ready to work and earn our keep, unlike migrants from other countries who must be provided food and lodging till the legalities are worked out,” said Parikshit Patel, a visa consultant from Kalol.Some in Gujarat also cling to the belief that Trump’s strong rapport with PM Narendra Modi will somehow help them avoid scrutiny. According to media reports, Trump and his allies, including Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, have sketched out an expansive vision that dovetails with the plans laid out in Project 2025, a 900-plus-page presidential transition blueprint led by the rightwing Heritage Foundation.The strategy, as Trump has described it, may involve the extraordinary use of US troops for immigration enforcement and border security and the application of 18th-century wartime powers. Immigration advocates have warned that deportation plans could be costly, divisive, and inhumane.","According to Pew Research Center, there were about 725,000 undocumented Indians in the US in 2021.

By Harsh Vardhan Shringla Former Foreign Secretary of India, Ambassador to US

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi proclaimed ‘Ab ki baar, Trump Sarkar’ at the Howdy Modi event in 2019, he foreshadowed a future where India and the US, under Trump’s leadership, would drive forward a robust, dual-powered partnership. Now, with Trump’s return to the White House, that prediction stands to usher in a new chapter in India-US relations.Trump’s second term promises a refreshed approach to India-US trade and economic ties. Though India faced some friction over trade issues in his first term, his renowned deal-making instinct created significant opportunities, and his results-driven pragmatism is likely to open more doors for India. Notably, Trump was vocal about global economic rebalancing even before the pandemic, criticising the distortions caused by China’s policies—an area where India’s concerns strongly resonate.Trump’s regard for India and the Indian diaspora is well known. And where previous US administrations only issued threats to cut military assistance to Pakistan because of its support for terrorism, Trump acted—delivering a strategic shift in support of India’s security needs. His recent tweet on violence against Hindu communities in Bangladesh reflects his acute awareness of the subcontinent’s dynamics and adds to his established goodwill toward India.Trump’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with India was a landmark of his first term, especially given his scepticism toward traditional alliances like NATO. Under Trump’s presidency, in 2018 India was elevated to Strategic Trade Authorisation Tier 1 status which allows it to access military and dual use technologies license-free. Underpinning all of this is the personal bond Trump shares with Prime Minister Modi—a connect that helped steer our ties before and will continue to facilitate diplomatic alignment. Trump accompanied Modi to the Howdy Modi event, one of the most unique and significant events in the India-US relationship, and then he visited India for the ‘Namaste Trump’ event. With Trump’s return to power, the India-US relationship is poised to advance in ways that will benefit both nations, driven by a shared vision and mutual respect under leaders who understand the importance of action over words.India is pivotal to the world today as a powerhouse of economic growth, digital innovation, and democratic stability, shaping global progress and regional security and in the recent past, regardless of party lines, US presidents have treated the ‘India account’ with increasing care, placing the relationship on firmer ground. This was especially visible during Trump’s first term. Trump popularised the term Indo-Pacific and renamed the Hawaii-based US Pacific Command as the Indo-Pacific Command, underscoring the increasing significance of the Indian Ocean in the US’ strategic considerations. Trump also revitalised an otherwise moribund Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) into an initiative promoting peace, collaboration, and stability in the Indo-Pacific.The institutionalisation of the India-US relationship reached new heights with the 2+2 Dialogue initiative. Launched in 2018, the 2+2 Dialogue has marked a shift from sporadic engagement to deep strategic cooperation.Factoring such milestones during Trump’s first term, India approaches Trump’s return with enthusiasm and confidence. The Modi-Trump partnership is expected to focus on significant deliverables in the near future. A potential Free Trade Agreement (FTA) aimed at deepening economic ties and reducing trade barriers between the two countries is a key goal. Both leaders can also focus on aligning their strategies on regional and global issues, particularly in terms of promoting peace and stability. With shared concerns over conflicts in the Indo-Pacific, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, both Modi and Trump are committed to fostering a rules-based international order. With Trump’s comeback to the oval office, the trajectory of India-US relations appears poised for a significant upward trajectory.",Trump’s second term promises a refreshed approach to India-US trade and economic ties.

'Concentrate on India': Usha Vance’s grandaunt after US election win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/concentrate-on-india-usha-vances-grandaunt-after-us-election-win/articleshow/115026581.cms,"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance, and his wife Usha Vance at the Palm Beach Convention Center, Wednesday, November 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Florida. (AP)

NEW DELHI: In a heartfelt reflection, the grandaunt of Usha Vance , the wife of US vice-presidential candidate JD Vance , spoke candidly about her roots and her hopes for the nation. Speaking to news agency ANI, Professor C Santhamma expressed immense pride in Usha's achievements, noting that the Vance family’s connections to Andhra Pradesh run deep.""Naturally, I feel happy... She belongs to our family and it is the most important thing,"" Santhamma said, recalling Usha’s origins in West Godavari district, a region rich in cultural heritage. ""She was born somewhere in West Godavari district. My relationship is through my husband. My husband has 5 brothers. The eldest brother has 4 children. Usha is the daughter of one of his sons,"" she said.Santhamma, an academician herself, also shared two key pieces of advice for Usha, which she believes are crucial for India's future.""My advice is to concentrate on India if possible and see that Indians don't drift to various other countries,"" said Professor Santhamma. She emphasised the need for India to create opportunities that will encourage its brightest minds to stay in the country. ""You must protect them. You must help the country to such an extent that their intelligence is retained in India,"" she said.In addition to focusing on talent retention, Professor Santhamma stressed the importance of reviving ancient cultural knowledge, particularly Sanskrit. “The second thing is, that our Sanskrit is lost. Our Sanskrit should be brought back to India,” she remarked. For Santhamma, preserving and promoting India's rich linguistic and cultural heritage is as crucial as its economic development. Sanskrit, as one of the oldest languages in the world, holds key insights into ancient Indian wisdom, philosophy, and literature.While Usha Vance, who grew up in Ohio, may be far from her ancestral homeland, her family's connection to Andhra Pradesh and the advice from her grandaunt offer a reminder of the deep ties that still link the Indian diaspora to their roots.For Usha, whose journey has taken her from rural West Godavari to the heart of American politics, Santhamma’s words serve as both a personal reflection and a guiding principle. In a time of global interconnectedness, the future of India may hinge not just on economic policies but also on how the nation preserves its cultural identity and intellectual capital for generations to come.","Professor C Santhamma is the grandaunt of Usha Vance, the wife of US vice- presidential candidate JD Vance.

Trump triumph may add more muscle to India-US defence ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trump-triumph-may-add-more-muscle-to-india-us-def-ties/articleshow/115029403.cms,"NEW DELHI: Whether it was Bush, Obama, Trump or Biden in the past, or Trump once again now, the expansive bilateral defence cooperation has been and will continue to be the lynchpin of the larger strategic partnership between the US and India.The strategic convergence over China’s aggressive and expansionist behaviour in the crucial Indo-Pacific, which includes muscle-flexing along the land frontier with India as well as its expanding naval presence in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), will not see any dilution despite differences on other fronts like trade and tariff barriers.The military interoperability between India and the US will also continue to deepen with a flurry of combat exercises, be it in bilateral, quadrilateral or multilateral formats, as will the security cooperation in the IOR, including in the new area of underwater domain awareness in the light of Chinese submarines prowling in the region.“Trump, in fact, may actually push for a stronger, overt military dimension to the `Quad’, which India has resisted so far. The US, Australia and Japan are all keen on this front,” a senior defence official told TOI.India, of course, will need to factor in Trump’s mercurial and transactional nature. On the eve of Trump’s visit to India as the US President in Feb 2020, incidentally, the Modi-led cabinet committee on security had quickly cleared two mega contracts worth $3.5 billion for 24 MH-60 `Romeo’ multi-mission naval helicopters and six AH-64E Apache attack choppers.At the ‘Namaste Trump’ event in Ahmedabad soon after, an exuberant Trump pointed to the chopper deals and said his country looked forward to providing India with “the best and most feared military equipment” on the planet. While strongly pitching for the US to become India’s “premier defence partner”, he had also referred to armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).That UAV deal finally came to fruition last month, with India inking the $3.3 billion contract with the US govt for 31 weaponized MQ-9B`Predator’ remotely-piloted aircraft, along with another $520 million contract with drone-manufacturer General Atomics to set up an MRO facility here.The US has now bagged lucrative Indian defence deals worth well over $25 billion just since 2007, managing to displace even India’s long-standing military supplier Russia for a few years.India, however, now wants co-production and co-development of cutting-edge defence equipment and technologies instead of direct off-the-shelf purchases. Towards this, the Modi govt wants to conclude within this fiscal the ongoing techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the American GE-F414 aero-engines in India for Tejas Mark-II fighters, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion. “The Trump administration will not be an impediment for such projects, but may want to extract a higher price for high-end tech transfer,” another official said.To be sure, the US will also be deeply interested in the IAF’s long-standing quest for 114 new 4.5-generation multi-role fighter aircraft (MRFA) to be manufactured in India with foreign collaboration, at an initial estimate of Rs 1.25 lakh crore.Washington has also been hard-selling the co-production of Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicles, with the Javelin anti-tank guided missiles, and demonstrated them to India in Ladakh recently.These projects, however, constitute just a part of the ever-tightening bilateral strategic clinch. “There is bipartisan consensus in the US on further strengthening defence cooperation with India as a hedge against China in the Indo-Pacific. It suits India as well, especially due to the strengthening Russia-China nexus,” the official said.",Bilateral defence cooperation has been and will continue to be the lynchpin of the larger strategic partnership between the US and India. The strategic convergence over China’s aggressive and expansionist behaviour in the crucial Indo-Pacific will not see any dilution despite differences on other fronts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115029458,imgsize-2029298,width-400,resizemode-4/115029458.jpg"

BATHINDA: Canada 's Khalistani-Hindu altercations, from Brampton to Malton and Surrey, have left many Indians and temporary visa holders, especially those from Punjab, fearing for their safety and their families back home worried.The conflict sparked by an attack on a Hindu Mahasabha temple in Brampton city of Canadian province Ontario's Greater Toronto Area underscores divisions around the demand for Khalistan and its impact on Canada's multicultural communities.Many in Brampton and Surrey feel these clashes could strain social cohesion among various Indian diaspora groups. Punjab's Rohit Kumar, who is on a work permit in Brampton, said: ""We are highly concerned. Incidents such as these only worsen the perception that we are creating unrest here, and that will cause more problems for us.""Kulwinder Singh, who has been involved in peaceful protests for extending work permits, emphasised the potential long-term consequences of the violence on community relations. Calling for unity among communities, Kulwinder said: ""While we focus on securing our future in Canada, incidents like these could affect our ability to integrate.""Back in Punjab, Amit Mittal, whose son lives in Surrey, requested the Canadian authorities to manage these recurring conflicts carefully. ""These events have ripple effects that impact the safety of our children staying abroad,"" Mittal said, also calling on the Indian govt to push for protection of Punjabis in Canada.The rising tensions highlight the delicate balance within Canada's diverse immigrant communities and the need for careful intervention to prevent further discord.These escalating tensions between pro-Khalistan supporters and opposition groups make migrants from Punjab anxious to save their reputation. For those struggling to extend their work permits, like Brampton store worker Jatinder Singh - whose permit expires next month - a dented image could be disastrous. ""These disruptive elements could fracture Canada's social harmony and create unrest back home, where longstanding regional disputes remain unresolved,"" Jatinder added.","Many in Brampton and Surrey feel these clashes could strain social cohesion among various Indian diaspora groups.

"Govt welcomes Trump back, Modi reminds him of good times",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-welcomes-trump-back-modi-reminds-him-of-good-times/articleshow/115026935.cms,"PM Modi and Donald Trump (File photo)

Despite the likely mercurial nature of his second term in office, Donald Trump’s return to the White House is not just an acceptable but a desired outcome of the US presidential elections for India, given the previous Trump presidency’s perceived convergence of interests with India on strategic issues and his rapport with PM Narendra Modi. Unsurprisingly, Modi was among the first heads of government to congratulate ""friend"" Trump for his historic win, shortly after the latter’s victory speech in Florida.“As you build on the successes of your previous term, I look forward to renewing our collaboration to further strengthen the India-US Comprehensive Global and Strategic Partnership. Together, let’s work for the betterment of our people and to promote global peace, stability and prosperity,’’ said Modi in a post on X, which was embellished with photos from his engagements with the president-elect in the past including during his India visit in 2020.According to former foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, who also served as India’s ambassador to the US during the previous Trump administration, his dramatic comeback is good news for India. “The Modi government has worked closely with him in the past and he also has a good relationship with the PM,’’ says Shringla, adding Trump’s focus on ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza also suits India.Trump’s previous term in office saw strong strategic convergence with India, especially on issues like counterterrorism and Chinese assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific. While there are concerns among some of US partners in the region about his contempt for multilateralism and his sceptical attitude towards alliances, India’s experience with Trump 1.0 inspires confidence among Indian officials that he will start from where he left off. It was under Trump that Quad was upgraded to the ministerial level and foundational military agreements like BECA and COMCASA signed with India. Significantly, it was also under Trump that the term Indo-Pacific, a euphemism for calling China out for its expansionism, gained traction. “You have to give credit to Trump for his strategic vision. He introduced the term Indo-Pacific to the global lexicon by renaming US Pacific Command to US Indo-Pacific Command,’’ says Shringla.While the Biden administration worked to take the relationship forward, most notably with the landmark Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) that envisages access to cutting-edge defence technology for India, its efforts to push India into the dock on murder-for-hire plots in both Canada and US, allegedly involving Indian officials, struck a sour note in the relationship.The Pannun case will continue to be pursued by the US but it’s unlikely it will get the kind of salience from Trump as it did from the Biden administration. The government will also expect Trump administration to be more responsive to its concerns related to anti-India activities of Khalistan separatists in both US and Canada.Trump’s victory also spares Indian officials the trouble of dealing with a relatively unknown quantity in Harris, who is unlikely to have been as forgiving as Trump of the alleged human rights violations and democratic backsliding in India. Harris riled the Indian government when she said in 2019 that there’s a need to intervene in Kashmir if the situation demands, although later, as vice president, she chose to have a more pragmatic approach to contentious international issues.India’s main concern with Trump, however, will remain his transactional approach to trade and likely restrictive immigration policies. Trump, who will look to find ways to cut down the $ 30 billion trade deficit with India, had terminated India’s preferential trade status under the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) in 2019 accusing the Indian government of not providing equitable access to its markets. Shringla, however, is hopeful the 2 sides will look to address trade issues by restarting negotiations for a free trade agreement. “We were at an advanced stage of negotiations with the Trump administration to find a solution in the form of a free trade agreement. There’s no reason why we can’t use the same playbook now,’’ he says, adding that Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports worth $ 360 billion also helped India ramp up its exports.With the Republicans flipping the Senate, and practically no opposition left to him within the GOP, Trump 2.0 will also likely be more assertive and uncompromising. How he chooses to exercise his executive powers on US immigration policies, particularly the H1B visa programme, will also be closely followed by India. While Shringla says Trump will look to plug illegal immigration and streamline legal immigration, which works to India’s advantage, another former ambassador to US Arun K Singh says clampdowns on H1B like in the past are unlikely to work. “Given the shortage of skilled professionals in the US, it’s in the interests of American companies to hire workers from India,’’ says Singh.","Trump’s previous term in office saw strong strategic convergence with India, especially on issues like counterterrorism and Chinese assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific.

ASI has been in charge of the monument's upkeep even now.Once described as Asia's largest fort, it was declared a protected monument in the Gazette of India on Nov 29, 1951. However, a notification issued on Aug 17, 2005, claimed the fort area as waqf property.The areas claimed include Solah Kambh or 16-pillar monument, 14 of the 15 domes in Ashtur and multiple tombs, including that of Amir Barid in Barid Shahi Park.Though the CM issued back-to-back clarifications and an order to nullify any takeover notices in the past fortnight, farmers and citizens are still a frazzled lot.Anirudh Desai, assistant surveyor with the archaeology department, claimed he has no knowledge of the govt notification that classifies ""this protected site"" as wakf property since 2005. ""The relevant department records are in the head office in Hampi,"" he said, adding the Hampi office may shed more light on the issue.Deputy commissioner Shilpa Sharma, too, claimed she is unaware of Bidar Fort being designated as Waqf Board property and said she will obtain information from the department concerned.Similarly, Dharmapur and Chatnalli villages of Bidar taluk are claimed by Waqf Board. Sources said a total of 26 acres under Survey No. 87 of Dharmapur village has been marked. The waqf ownership, which was absent from land records until 2001, was incorporated after 2013. Nearly 19 acres of land that belongs to farmer Krishnamurthy in Udabal village in Chittaguppa taluk has been assigned to Waqf Board. Some 30 years ago, Krishnamurthy, in a gesture, had agreed to the burial of a Muslim man in a corner of his farmland.In 2013, Waqf Board officially recognised 960 acres of land in Chatnalli village. Concerned about it, farmers from the village, led by MLA Beldale, recently met the CM, seeking a solution.",Waqf Board has claimed ownership of the historic Bidar Fort and two villages in Bidar taluk. The fort built in 1427 by Bahamani Sultanate was classified as belonging to Waqf Board in 2005.

Repeated assurances from the Taliban, including during the ongoing visit, that they won’t allow the use of Afghan territory against India seems to have convinced India that this might be the right time to deepen engagement with Kabul.Yaqub has in the past expressed hope of stronger ties with India, leading also to cooperation in defence sector. The Taliban have been pushing India to allow the appointment of a diplomat from the Taliban foreign ministry in the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, saying ties between India and Afghanistan are important for both countries and people.

Tariffs and tension to trump trade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tariffs-and-tension-to-trump-trade/articleshow/115030542.cms,"NEW DELHI: In March 2023, defence minister Rajnath Singh had some unusual guests for Holi as commerce secretary Gina Raimondo and her team attended the festivities at his Ashoka Road bungalow. The result was a series of announcements, which extended up to PM Narendra Modi's visit to the US in June 2023. It had taken two years to undo what Trump administration had done in its four years in office.And, just when the commerce department brass in New Delhi was cheering the smooth ties with Washington, they will have to brace for ensuring that the relations are not strained once Donald Trump walks into Oval Office next Jan. After all, just last month, he called India the ""biggest charger"" of tariffs. In Sept, he called India a ""very big (trade) abuser"", keeping it and Brazil just a notch below China.The rhetoric is no different from his first term when he called India ""tariff king"" and went on to increase import duty on steel and aluminum by 10-25%, invoking national security provisions. The duty impacted 2.3% of India's trade with the US, and govt responded with retaliatory tariffs on almonds, apples lentils and steel after preferences were also withdrawn by Trump administration. This time too, he has indicated his preference for ""tit-for-tat"" tariffs. ""So, we're going to do a reciprocal trade. If anybody charges us 10 cents, if they charge us $2, if they charge us 100%, we charge the same,"" Trump had said ahead of Modi's US trip.Trump doesn't believe in looking at the average tariff or if the levies are within permissible limits. His attacks are political. ""Trump may pressure India to cut tariffs and also impose higher tariffs on Indian goods, especially in sectors like automobiles, textiles, pharmaceuticals, and wines, which could make Indian exports less competitive in US market,"" said Ajay Srivastava of GTRI. India isn't unique, countries around the world keep high levies on products that are sensitive. With Trump's return, they are bracing for fresh trade tensions.Given that the president-elect sees China as the ""toughest"" and India as ""tough"", the prime focus of his actions is likely to be Beijing. In any case, in 2023, China's goods exports to the US were estimated at $427 billion - five times higher than India's $84 billion. ""He will come down heavily on China. If Trump increases tariffs for countries like India by a lower magnitude than China, then it stands to gain,"" said Jayant Dasgupta, India's former ambassador to WTO.This may potentially open the doors for some Indian businesses, provided they have the capacity to produce those goods. Biden administration's tariff hikes of EVs and semiconductors, for instance, will offer virtually no gain to India.Having put the dispute settlement mechanism at WTO in deep freeze by blocking all appointments to the appellate body, the multilateral agency is unlikely to see any action for at least four years. A carefully crafted partnership can, however, help India tap into America's hunt for critical minerals and technology. The fate of forums like Indo-Pacific Economic Cooperation, a post-Covid platform to counter China, remains unclear under Trump.But trade experts believe that Trump prefers bilateral deals over multilateral or plurilateral agreements. Which means he may be willing to negotiate deals that demonstrate gains to American businesses, at least to his constituency.","The rhetoric is no different from his first term when he called India ""tariff king"" He went on to increase import duty on steel and aluminum by 10-25%, invoking national security provisions.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Wednesday sought responses of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand govts on a PIL which sought erasing of gender-discriminatory laws in the two states which disentitle a daughter from her share in parental property after marriage and a widow from her share in matrimonial property after her remarriage.A three-judge bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud issued notice to the two states on the PIL filed by Shweta Gupta as her counsel K C Jain argued that SC had in 2019 entertained a petition seeking similar relief regarding gender-discriminatory provisions in Hindu Succession Act . The petitioner said under Section 109 of UP Revenue Code, 2006, when a female (who has inherited land from her father) dies, her land stands devolved upon the heirs of her husband, rather than her own heirs.Similarly, the provision disentitled a daughter's ownership right over land inherited from her father after marriage. The same provision also provided that if a widow remarries, she stands divested from land inherited from her deceased husband as it would go to the next surviving heir of the last male holder of the land.The petitioner sought to know ""whether the marital status of a female can be determinative of her identity to entitle or disentitle her to inherit an interest of a land, while marital status of a male has no significance for succession under UP Revenue Code"".",Supreme Court seeks responses of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand govts on a PIL.

Government nod must for PMLA case on public servant: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prior-sanction-needed-to-prosecute-public-servant-in-pmla-cases-sc/articleshow/115030094.cms,"New Delhi: In another verdict defanging the stringent law of Prevention of Money Laundering Act and to protect honest public servants in discharging official duty, Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that prior sanction of govt is needed to prosecute a govt employee in a money-laundering case and held that Section 197 of Criminal Procedure Code on sanction would be applicable in PMLA cases also. A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih rejected the submission of the Enforcement Directorate that PMLA provisions have an overriding effect over the provisions of the other statutes, including the CrPC on the issue of sanction.Extending the ambit of Section 197(1) to PMLA on money laundering cases, the bench said the object is to protect the public servants from prosecutions and to ensure that they are not prosecuted for anything they do in the discharge of their duties. ""This provision is for the protection of honest and sincere officers. However, the protection is not unqualified. They can be prosecuted with a previous sanction from the appropriate government."" the bench said while dismissing the plea of the agency.""Section 65 makes the provisions of the CrPC applicable to all proceedings under the PMLA, provided the same are not inconsistent with the provisions contained in the PMLA. The words 'All other proceedings' include a complaint under Section 44 (1)(b) of the PMLA. We have carefully perused the provisions of the PMLA. We do not find that there is any provision therein which is inconsistent with the provisions of Section 197(1) of CrPC. Considering the object of Section 197(1), its applicability cannot be excluded unless there is any provision in the PMLA which is inconsistent with the Section 197(1). No such provision has been pointed out to us. Therefore, we hold that the provisions of Section 197(1) of CrPC are applicable to a complaint under Section 44(1)(b) of the PMLA,"" the bench said..Section 197(1) says that when any person who is or was a Judge or Magistrate or a public servant not removable from his office save by or with the sanction of the Government is accused of any offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting in the discharge of his official duty, no Court shall take cognizance of such offence except with the previous sanction.The agency contended that Section 71 of PMLA has an overriding effect over the other statutes, including the CrPC and the requirement of obtaining a sanction under will be inconsistent with the provisions of the PMLA . It said the act of money laundering could not be considered to have been done in the discharge of official duties which needed protection. But the bench was not convinced and quashed prosecution of a senior bureaucrat for want of sanction.""Section 65 is a prior section which specifically makes the provisions of the CrPC applicable to PMLA, subject to the condition that only those provisions of the CrPC will apply which are not inconsistent with the provisions of the PMLA. Therefore, when a particular provision of CrPC applies to proceedings under the PMLA by virtue of Section 65 of the PMLA, Section 71 (1) cannot override the provision of CrPC which applies to the PMLA. Once we hold that in view of Section 65 of the PMLA, Section 197(1) will apply to the provisions of the PMLA, Section 71 cannot be invoked to say that the provision of Section 197(1) of CrPC will not apply to the PMLA,"" the bench said.",Supreme Court ruled that prior sanction of govt is needed to prosecute a govt employee in a money-laundering case. Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih rejected the submission of the Enforcement Directorate that PMLA provisions have an overriding effect.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115030114,imgsize-1058840,width-400,resizemode-4/115030114.jpg"
SC: LMV licence can be used to drive transport vehicles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-lmv-licence-can-be-used-to-drive-transport-vehicles/articleshow/115030054.cms,"NEW DELHI: In an important ruling that would ease payment of insurance compensation to road accident victims, the Supreme Court on Wednesday said a person holding a licence to drive light motor vehicles (LMVs) can drive all kinds of transport vehicles with a gross weight of less than 7,500 kg without the transport department's endorsement.In cases of deaths or injuries to others in accidents involving a transport vehicle driven by LMV licence holders, insurance companies were often denied compensation on the technicality that the licences were not suitably stamped by the transport department authorising them to drive transport vehicles.Solving a 25 year-old confusion over driving licence, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, P S Narasimha, Pankaj Mithal and Manoj Misra unanimously ruled that ""a driver holding a license for LMV class, under Section 10(2)(d) for vehicles with a gross vehicle weight under 7,500 kg, is permitted to operate a 'Transport Vehicle' without needing additional authorisation under Section 10(2)(e) of the MV Act specifically for the 'Transport Vehicle' class.""The additional endorsement by the transport department would be required if an LMV licence holder intends to drive a medium or heavy transport or passenger vehicle having a gross weight of over 7,500 kg, it said.Writing the 126-page judgment, Justice Roy said this authoritative pronouncement would ""prevent insurance companies from taking a technical plea to defeat a legitimate claim for compensation involving an insured vehicle weighing below 7,500 kgs driven by a person holding a driving license of a LMV class.""The bench said, ""In the era where autonomous or driverless vehicles are no longer tales of science fiction and app-based platforms are a modern reality, the licencing regime cannot remain static. The amendments that have been carried out by the Indian legislature may not have dealt with all possible concerns.""""As we were informed by the Learned Attorney General that a legislative exercise is underway, we hope that a comprehensive amendment to address the statutory lacunae will be made with necessary corrective measures,"" the bench said.AG R Venkataramani had informed the court that multiple amendments to classify LMVs into different classes is under consideration of the govt. Justice Roy said, ""Had Parliament acted sooner to amend the MV Act and clearly differentiated between classes, categories and types, much of the uncertainty surrounding driving licences could have been addressed, reducing the need for frequent litigation and an unclear legal terrain.","A person holding a licence to drive light motor vehicles (LMVs) can drive all kinds of transport vehicles with a gross weight of less than 7,500 kg without the transport department's endorsement.

The counting of the votes in the US election extends beyond election night, and the timing will vary from state to state. The US has four main time zones( Eastern Time, Central, Mountain, and Pacific Standard Time), and the election timing is also different among the time zones. Many states had early voting though November 5 is the election day.Counting starts after the ballots are cast. Handmarked paper ballots and ballots filled using BMD (Ballot marking devices) are counted using optical scanners and then tabulated by computers. After counting and tabulation is complete, states then have different time period to self-audit the results.Results are expected to start coming in just hours after the first polls close at 6pm ET on Tuesday.Here is the state-wise polling time by time zonesPolls open at 8am ET (7am local time)There was no early in-person voting.Polls open 11am/noon ET (7am local time -- Alaska covers two time zones).

Murder-for-hire



The emphasis on bipartisan support for India-US ties has been the leitmotif of political discourse in both countries about the relationship that is seen by many as among the most consequential for this century. For over two decades, India-US relations have been marked by steady growth driven as much by strategic convergence as an organic development of people-to-people ties.In the circumstances, it goes without saying that the presidential election in the US next week is unlikely to have any impact on the broad contours of the relationship. However, India will be alert to how a Trump or Harris presidency might have a bearing on cooperation on some key issues and challenges:Keeping the landmark initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET), which was launched by Biden and Modi, going is among India’s foremost priorities as access to cutting edge technology in areas like defence, AI and quantum technologies is important for its growth and security. Dismantling regulatory barriers, the initiative allows India and the US to accelerate cooperation in joint development and production of advanced defence systems with focus on jet engines and munition-related technologies.Amid concern about the delay in implementation of the GE-HAL deal for manufacturing jet engines, US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti tells TOI the agreement is “100 percent on track” and the US remains excited about it. While no American president will wreck this partnership, given also the need for the US to have India on its side in the technology war with China, the Americans will work to ensure no sensitive, dual-use technology is passed on to Russia.India’s biggest concern with a potential Trump presidency comes from its likely restrictive trade and immigration policies. It was Trump who ended India’s preferential trade status under the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) in 2019 for its alleged failure to provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets. Trump has threatened to launch a tariff war against China and he’s unlikely to spare countries like India, which he described as a tariff abuser, and Brazil at a time even the Democrats stand accused of pandering to the protectionist sentiment. A mini trade deal under discussion during the Trump presidency also fell through as neither side was willing to compromise on tariffs.Harris is expected to have a more nuanced approach on trade even though she, like Biden, is unlikely to dismantle the Trump-imposed higher tariffs. That’s still a better alternative though than Trump’s proposed reciprocal trade/ tariff act that could disrupt supply chains across the world. On immigration, any return of some of the H1B regulations that Trump attempted during his presidency, like higher wage requirements for foreign workers, will be bad news for the Indian IT sector.The convergence on China, as reflected in the growing Indo-Pacific partnership and Quad, will continue to act as a guiding factor in the relationship irrespective of who the president is. Notwithstanding efforts to normalize ties with China, which are still at an inchoate stage, India will need to build geopolitical leverages against Beijing and there’s perhaps no better way of doing it than to hit the gas in terms of its cooperation with like-minded countries in the region. While Harris is expected to broadly follow in Biden’s footsteps, India and several other partners might have some worries about possible unpredictability or incoherence and little regard for multilateralism under a Trump presidency. India, however, will take heart from the fact that it was under Trump that Quad was elevated to the ministerial level, foundational agreements for force interoperability were signed and India-US 2+2 ministerial dialogue was launched. For India, the convergence with Trump on issues like counterterrorism was also important.Given her track record, this is an issue Harris is hardwired to addressing all over the world and there’s no reason to believe she won’t prioritize it in talks with India if she indeed becomes the first woman to occupy the White House. It’s also one of the reasons why the Indian right wing, despite Harris’ Indian ancestry, believes Trump, who is unlikely to get into a lather over domestic Indian developments, might prove to be a better president for India. However, while Harris can be expected to be more vocal on concerns about democratic backsliding and declining religious freedom in India, she will ultimately defer likely to following American interests in ties with India, as she has done on the Gaza war by not breaking ranks with the president despite her concerns over the humanitarian situation.While human rights may not be a deal-breaker, this latest and unfortunate entrant into the list of India-US outstanding issues can potentially stymie progress in ties. Harris can be expected to pursue the Biden administration’s focus on ensuring accountability, without doing a Justin Trudeau on India, and the Indian government may have to find a way of addressing American calls for action. As Garcetti recently told TOI in an interview, there’s too much at stake for both countries to not handle the case properly. Trump’s return could ease some of the political pressure on India but it’s unlikely US prosecutors will not pursue the case as diligently or aggressively as they are doing now. Significantly, the US has expressed satisfaction so far over the progress in the Indian probe into the case.",India-US relations have been marked by steady growth driven as much by strategic convergence as an organic development of people-to-people ties. India will be alert to how a Trump or Harris presidency might have a bearing on cooperation on some key issues and challenges.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114984358,imgsize-25186,width-400,resizemode-4/114984358.jpg"

During his campaign, Donald Trump has made several high-profile promises, some of which have sparked debate over their feasibility and potential impact. Many of Trump’s campaign promises involve significant legal , legislative, and logistical obstacles, meaning that even with substantial executive power, achieving these objectives would require cooperation from Congress, states, and possibly even constitutional amendments.The feasibility of these proposals largely hinges on navigating political opposition, potential legal battles, and the practical realities of implementation, making some of these promises more symbolic than achievable. Here’s a rundown of some of the bold promises he’s made on the trail, alongside an analysis of their practicality:Trump has pledged to overhaul the federal bureaucracy, replacing thousands of federal workers with those he considers ""loyalists.""Although a president can influence federal hiring and policies, sweeping federal layoffs face strong resistance due to existing civil service protections, union agreements, and procedural hurdles. Such moves would likely face significant legal challenges from federal employee unions and watchdog groups questioning the legality of mass firings based on political affiliation.Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on all imports to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign goods.Imposing such a broad tariff would require congressional support, which is far from guaranteed. Economists warn that a blanket tariff could raise costs for American consumers, strain trade relations, and potentially prompt retaliatory tariffs. Higher import costs could impact inflation, a point that might attract criticism from economic policymakers.Trump has vowed to launch the most extensive deportation effort ever, targeting millions of undocumented immigrants.While the federal government has the authority to enforce immigration laws, scaling up to this level would require massive resources, funding, and cooperation from local law enforcement. Such an operation would likely face legal pushback and public resistance, particularly in sanctuary cities. The logistical complexity and potential societal disruption make this a challenging promise to fulfil.Trump has proposed constructing ""freedom cities"" on federal land to address housing shortages and encourage innovation.Creating new cities would be a monumental task involving land use policy, infrastructure development, environmental reviews, and state cooperation. While it’s possible for the federal government to support housing initiatives, building entirely new cities from scratch would require substantial funding, legislative approval, and time—likely extending beyond a single presidential term.Trump has expressed support for imposing the death penalty on drug dealers to deter drug-related crimes.Implementing this would be a significant legal and constitutional hurdle, as it would require changes to federal law and might face challenges regarding Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment. Applying the death penalty broadly would likely encounter strong judicial opposition.Trump has suggested reconsidering US involvement in NATO and scaling back certain international commitments.While a president can influence foreign policy, withdrawing from NATO would face resistance from Congress and military leaders, as it is a treaty-bound alliance integral to US defence strategy. Exiting NATO would likely be unpopular with allies and could be seen as a threat to US influence on the global stage.Trump has proposed imposing term limits for members of Congress.Changing term limits would require a constitutional amendment, as term limits are not currently part of US law for federal offices. This amendment would need a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, as well as ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures—a high bar that makes this unlikely to be achieved swiftly, if at all.Trump has hinted at increasing US control over industries deemed strategic, such as energy.Nationalising industries is rare in the US and would meet strong legal, economic, and political opposition. It would require new legislation, significant federal resources, and could clash with private sector interests, raising questions of economic efficiency and constitutional authority.Trump has pledged to restart and expand the border wall construction with added technological enhancements.While Trump may have executive power to direct border security funds, constructing a larger, more advanced wall would require sustained funding from Congress. Legal disputes over land rights and environmental concerns would also challenge rapid expansion efforts.Trump has promised to restore and prioritise energy independence by maximising US energy production, especially fossil fuels.Increasing fossil fuel production could be pursued through executive orders and regulatory changes, but would face resistance from environmental advocates and potential legal constraints. Shifts to renewable energy and global environmental commitments add further complexity, limiting the extent to which fossil fuels can be prioritised without political and environmental repercussions.Trump has frequently claimed he could end the Russia-Ukraine conflict within 24 hours by negotiating directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.While a US president has significant diplomatic influence, resolving such a complex conflict in 24 hours is highly improbable. The war involves deep-rooted geopolitical issues, territorial disputes, and significant military and economic stakes for both countries and their allies.","During his campaign, Donald Trump has made several high-profile promises, some of which have sparked debate over their feasibility and potential impact.

MUMBAI: A lakh plus Indian families are again biting their nails at the prospect of work (employment) authorization being revoked for the H-4 dependent spouse. Members of the Indian diaspora point out that obtaining an employment authorization document (EAD) means much more than financial freedom. It enables spouses to obtain a social security number, open a bank account and get a driving license. In short – be integrated into the American community.President Trump during his previous tenure had issued the Executive Order – Buy American, Hire American – a slew of measures had then followed including a proposed rule to revoke employment authorization for H-4 dependent spouses.Just in the nick of time before the rule was finalized, the Biden administration stepped in and the proposed rule was formally withdrawn in January 2021. “Trump’s return to power would likely bring a renewed attack, disproportionately affecting Indian families where highly educated H-4 spouses play critical roles in tech, healthcare, and other sectors. Eliminating H-4 work permits would be a severe economic and personal blow, particularly for families facing a decades-long green card wait,” points out Ashwin Sharma, immigration attorney.The EAD rule was introduced by the Obama administration in 2015 to mitigate the problems faced by certain sections of immigrants (such as the Indian diaspora) who faced backlogs running into several decades to obtain an employment based green card. As per an analysis by Cato Foundation, the employment based green card backlog from India (EB-2 and EB-3 skilled category) has crossed one million in March 2023. If factors such as death and ageing out are considered (which will lead to these individuals dropping from the backlog statistics) the wait for a green card is 54 years, else it is a whopping 134 years.Under the EAD rule, in those cases where the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card, or has got an extension beyond the permitted six years, the spouse holding an H-4 visa can apply for employment authorization.The EAD rule has faced several legal challenges. In 2015, an advocacy group of tech workers (Save Jobs USA), who lost their jobs to H-1B visa holders, litigated on the grounds that the Department of Homeland Security was not eligible to introduce the rule. Further, it contended that the right given to spouses to work, took away American jobs and made the H-1B program more attractive. A district court upheld this rule and in 2023, the US department refused to intervene in this decision – and the EAD rule seemed here to stay.With hiring of US workers to be a priority for the Trump administration, the question is not – will the EAD rule be revoked, rather the question being asked in hushed tones among the Indian diaspora is – when?","Members of the Indian diaspora point out that obtaining an employment authorization document (EAD) means much more than financial freedom.

Why does the US vote in November but the new president starts in January?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-does-the-us-vote-in-november-but-the-new-president-starts-in-january/articleshow/115019371.cms,"US election in November, president inauguration in January: Understanding the timeline

Election timing: In 1845, Congress established the timing for federal elections, setting the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November as Election Day. This date was chosen to accommodate an agrarian society: early November allowed farmers to complete the harvest and travel to polling places without interrupting agricultural duties. Additionally, Tuesday was preferred to avoid conflicts with religious observances on Sunday and local market days on Wednesday.

Inauguration timing: Originally, the U.S. Constitution set the presidential inauguration for March 4, providing a four-month transition period after the November election. This lengthy gap allowed enough time for vote counting, electoral processes, and the physical travel needed in an era when communication and transportation were slow. In 1933, the 20th Amendment shortened this gap by moving Inauguration Day to January 20, reducing the “lame-duck” period in which an outgoing president remains in office without significant power. This change was intended to streamline the transition and address inefficiencies associated with a prolonged wait between election and inauguration.

This process provides a formal mechanism to verify the vote, giving an additional layer of credibility to the outcome.

Legal and procedural safeguards

U.S. president inauguration day: Key traditions and events

Swearing-in ceremony: The president-elect and vice president-elect take their oaths of office, a tradition that has remained largely unchanged since George Washington’s inauguration. The ceremony is typically held on the West Front steps of the U.S. Capitol at noon, symbolising the start of the new administration’s term.

Inaugural address: Following the swearing-in, the president delivers an inaugural address, outlining the vision, priorities, and aspirations for the upcoming term. Each inaugural address is unique, reflecting the themes and goals of the new administration while honouring the traditions of the office.

Departure of the outgoing president: After the swearing-in, the outgoing president and first lady leave the Capitol, often through a formal send-off, signifying the peaceful transfer of power. This departure reinforces the country’s commitment to a democratic process and respect for the electoral outcome.

Inaugural luncheon: The new president attends a luncheon hosted by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (JCCIC), where members of Congress and other dignitaries gather to honour the new administration.

Pass in review: The president reviews military troops, honouring the role of the armed forces and symbolising the president’s new role as commander-in-chief. A ceremonial procession down Pennsylvania Avenue follows, leading to the White House.

Presidential escort and inaugural parade: After the Pass in Review, the president is escorted to the White House in a procession that includes representatives from various branches of the military, celebrating the diversity and unity of the nation.

Inaugural balls and celebrations: In the evening, inaugural balls and other festivities are held to honour the new administration, allowing public participation in the celebrations. These events may be adjusted depending on circumstances, such as security concerns or public health issues.

In the United States, the presidential election and inauguration are separated by several months, a timeline that reflects both historical tradition and logistical needs. While the election occurs on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, the newly elected president is inaugurated only on January 20 of the following year. This transitional period serves multiple functions, from providing the incoming administration with time to prepare for governance to allowing the Electoral College to complete its process. The November-to-January gap is rooted in the structure of the U.S. electoral system, combining constitutional requirements, historical precedents, and practical considerations to ensure a smooth transfer of power. Here’s a detailed look at why this timeline exists and what events fill the gap between Election Day and Inauguration Day.The U.S. electoral timeline sets the country apart from other democracies, where elections and the transfer of power often occur within a shorter timeframe. The U.S. approach stems from a combination of historical scheduling and constitutional amendments that have shaped the election-inauguration gap over centuries.The period between Election Day and Inauguration Day serves several purposes essential to a stable and orderly transition of power.: The transition period is crucial for the president-elect, who must assemble a team, nominate cabinet members, and begin formulating key policies. This period allows the incoming administration to prepare for governance, helping to ensure that they are ready to address national and international responsibilities immediately after taking office. It includes detailed briefings, security updates, and policy reviews.An orderly transition is particularly important in times of crisis, allowing the new administration to continue policies or make necessary adjustments without disruptions. The transition also allows time for outgoing staff to assist the incoming team, ensuring continuity in government operations.: Unlike many countries, the U.S. does not select its president based solely on the popular vote. The Electoral College, an intermediary body, formally elects the president and vice president. The Electoral College process includes key dates and steps:: The period between the election and the inauguration also provides time for legal and procedural safeguards, including recounts and the resolution of potential disputes. In close or contested elections, this timeline allows for legal challenges to be addressed in court, ensuring that the final result is legitimate and free from unresolved disputes before the inauguration.This period offers a buffer against any attempts to disrupt or contest the election outcome, reinforcing the stability of the democratic process and giving citizens confidence that the result reflects their choice.Inauguration Day is a ceremonial event that formally marks the transfer of power to the new administration. Traditionally observed on January 20, it includes several symbolic events that reinforce the nation’s commitment to a peaceful and orderly transition.","In 1845, Congress established the timing for federal elections, setting the first Tuesday after November as Election Day. Originally, the U.S. Constitution set the presidential inauguration for March 4, providing a four-month transition period after the November election. In 1933, the 20th Amendment shortened this gap by moving Inauguration Day to January 20, reducing the ‘lame-duck’ period in which an outgoing president remains in office without significant power.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115026921,imgsize-32386,width-400,resizemode-4/115026921.jpg"

Trump Towers In India: Trump luxury real estate arm to have maximum properties in India outside of the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trump-luxury-real-estate-arm-to-have-maximum-properties-in-india-outside-of-the-us/articleshow/115025972.cms,"File photo: Donald Trump sr (left) & jr with Kalpesh Mehta (centre)

NEW DELHI: India will have the maximum number of Trump Towers outside of US-president elect’s “The Trump Organisation” home country. From four all-residential high-rise luxury residential Trump Towers in Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon and Kolkata, the number will swell to 10 in the next six years with as many more projects — including office, golf course and villas — to be built in Noida, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Gurgaon and Pune.Trump’s luxury real estate partner in India, Tribeca Developers founder Kalpesh Mehta, now sees even more growth after the news of his victory in the US polls came in on Wednesday.“I did my MBA from Wharton, where the Trump family, including President Trump, went to. A professor there connected me to Donald Trump jr. We met at a bar in New York 13-14 years ago and on the back of a cocktail pier napkin discussed and made our initial plans which eventually became a reality. President Trump’s advice when we subsequently tied up and since then has been just this: ‘We don’t want to do too many projects, but whatever we do should be the best in class’,” Mehta (46), who comes from a family of architects, told TOI Wednesday.In 2014 when the two companies were launching Trump Tower Mumbai, Donald Trump had come to India. “This was shortly after PM Modi had won the 2014 general election. He generally discussed India during his first time trip to the country and the topic here was mainly Modi at that time. Since then he has been very fond of our PM. The President has always believed firmly in the potential of India but he became more bullish after Modi became the PM. India will have the maximum Trump properties outside of the US,” Mehta said.The Trump real estate business is run along the lines of management contract hotels where the Indian partner invests in the hardware (brick and mortar) and the foreign partner, Trump Organisation in this case, brings its branding and software in terms of service level and global reach. The Trump real estate business is doing very well here.“The four Trump Towers (one each in Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon and Kolkata) have a combined area of 30 lakh square feet with about 800 residences in the range of Rs 6-25 crore each and a total sale value of Rs 7,500 crore. The six more coming up in as many years will have a combined floor area of 80 lakh square feet and total sale value of Rs 15,000 crore,” Mehta said. Pune, which already has a Trump Tower, is getting another Trump complex with an office block.Trump golf course and villas will come up in another city.“A Trump presidency is fundamentally good for the world and for further strengthening the India – US relationship. PM Modi and President Trump greatly admire and respect each other and this relationship has the potential to be greatly beneficial to the world at large…. Trump is the only super luxury real estate brand in the world,” he added.","From four all-residential high-rise luxury residential Trump Towers in Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon and Kolkata, the number will swell to 10 in the next six years.

"The writing on the wall is clear: Tighter H-1B norms on anvil, perhaps with wage-hikes and stiffer vetting of applications",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections-the-writing-on-the-wall-is-clear-tighter-h-1b-norms-on-anvil-perhaps-with-wage-hikes-and-stiffer-vetting-of-applications/articleshow/115025897.cms,"Image credit: lexica.art

Challenges Ahead for H-1B Visa Extensions :

Hike in wages and restrictions in eligibility norms:

MUMBAI: American companies, including tech giants have been meeting with their attorneys over the past several days, debating what lies ahead. With President Trump’s victory, the immediate impact is expected to include greater scrutiny for new H-1B visa applications (the window for which will open in March) and also visa extensions.Scrutiny is expected to cover whether the job qualifies as a specialty occupation and ensuring an employer-employee relationship exists. A rise in Requests for Evidence (RFEs) and also denials is expected, which will have to be taken in stride. Policy changes relating to the H-1B program, that were previously stalled due to court rulings may be reintroduced.Indians are major beneficiaries of the H-1B program, receiving over 70% of all H-1B visas granted each year, both for initial applications and extensions. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023, Indians received 2.8 lakh H-1B visas, accounting for 72.3% of total allotments. Thus, procedural and policy changes will impact not only American employers but also the Indian diaspora.Immigration attorney Kripa Upadhyay told TOI, “During the last Trump administration, there was significant disruption due to the introduction of ‘extreme vetting’ for visa interviews. Certain job categories, such as ‘Computer Occupations, All Other,’ may no longer be an option, as they may require applicants to demonstrate specific technical skills and knowledge.”Those seeking H-1B visa extensions could be particularly affected. H-1B visas are typically issued for a maximum of three years, with the possibility of another three years. If the beneficiary (the individual sponsored by an American employer) is on track for a green card, further periodical extensions are permitted. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023, around 210,000 Indians received H-1B visa extensions, compared to 68,825 visas for new employment cases.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, explained, “We expect Trump will rescind the ‘deference policy’ again. During his first term, Trump directed USCIS not to defer to any previous approvals for extension cases and each extension application was treated as a new one leading to challenges. President Biden reinstated the deference policy, but it hasn’t been codified in regulations. If Trump rescinds this policy it will again lead to chaos and unpredictable outcomes.”Immigration attorney Cyrus D. Mehta added, “Similarly, the Trump administration could make it more difficult for employers to renew H-1B visas by requiring artificially high wages and making it harder to prove that the job qualifies as a specialty occupation for H-1B classification.”Policies pushing for steep wage increases for H-1B workers and linking visa allotments to the highest salaries within their occupations and locations may return. In early December 2020, a US district court struck down a rule issued by the Department of Labor (DOL), which had increased H-1B and employment-based green card wages by 40% to 100%. The court invalidated this rule, citing its rushed implementation without public notice and comment, violating the Administrative Procedure Act.""If a wage hike is announced for H-1B workers and allotment is linked to the highest wages, it would badly impact international students. F-1 students typically transition to an H-1B and earn the lowest range of salary in the initial years of their career,"" points out Adam Cohen, partner at immigration law firm Siskind Susser. The contingent of Indian students in the US is quite significant. According to the Open Doors Report, during academic year 2022-23 there were nearly 2.70 lakh Indian students in the US.The same court judgement also struck down a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rule that had imposed stricter definitions for the employer-employee relationship and specialty occupations, targeting tech companies, including Indian firms like Infosys and Wipro, which typically place H-1B workers at client sites. It also limited the H-1B visa duration to one year for workers in third-party placements.Steven A. Brown, partner at immigration law firm Reddy, Neumann, Brown, told TOI, “Many of Trump’s previous court losses were due to procedural issues, not substance. The incoming team may now proceed in a ‘smarter’ way to prevent courts from overturning their policy changes.”Ashwin Sharma, immigration attorney, noted, “In Trump’s first term, stricter H-1B eligibility criteria and increased paperwork, particularly for third-party placements, led to denials and RFEs that complicated approvals. A second term would likely bring swift reinstatement of these policies, creating new obstacles for Indian professionals in specialized fields, especially IT consulting.”US visa challenges may result in housing foreign employees to neighbouring countries or even having a major share of the work done remotely in India, state immigration experts.Charles H. Kuck, another immigration attorney, summed up, “Prepare for major H-1B changes: a lottery based on wages, higher filing fees, and stricter enforcement against job shops. Expect higher denial rates, longer processing times, no immigration reform, no increase in green card allotments, no changes to the 7% per-country limit, and possibly reduced legal immigration.”","With President Trump’s victory, the immediate impact is expected to include greater scrutiny for new H-1B visa applications and also visa extensions. A rise in Requests for Evidence (RFEs) and also denials is expected, which will have to be taken in stride. Policy changes relating to the H- 1B program, that were previously stalled due to court rulings may be reintroduced.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115026242,imgsize-1105056,width-400,resizemode-4/115026242.jpg"

Due to Donald Trump's return to the White House, Indian exporters may face increased customs duties on key products, including automobiles, textiles, and pharmaceuticals, according to trade experts.Trade experts warn that Trump's 'America First' policy could lead to tougher negotiations and additional trade barriers. Analysts also anticipate stricter H-1B visa rules, raising costs for Indian IT firms. The American market is crucial, contributing over 80 per cent of India's IT export earnings, making visa policy changes a serious concern.Trump has previously labelled India a ""large tariff abuser"" and the ""tariff king,"" intensifying fears of protectionist measures. Ajay Srivastava, Founder of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), indicated Trump might extend tariffs beyond China to countries like India.“His America First agenda would likely push for protective measures, such as reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods , potentially adding barriers for key Indian exports like automobiles, wines, textiles, and pharmaceuticals,"" Srivastava explained, adding that this could impact sector revenues.Despite possible setbacks, stricter US policies towards China could create new opportunities for Indian exporters. Bilateral goods trade between the US and India was valued at $120 billion in 2023-24, slightly down from $129.4 billion in 2022-23. However, GTRI noted that US tariffs are already high on many items, with rates reaching 193 per cent for cereals and 188 per cent for dairy products.Biswajit Dhar, another trade expert, suggested that Trump might hike sector-specific tariffs to fulfil his MAGA agenda. ""With Trump coming to power, we are going to enter a different era of protectionism,"" Dhar said, warning that electronics could be particularly affected. He also pointed out the uncertainty surrounding the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and questioned Trump’s stance on global trade agreements like those under the WTO.Ajay Sahai, Director General of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), expects Trump to advocate for balanced trade, possibly leading to disputes. He mentioned that ongoing protectionist trends and tighter immigration rules could persist. Agneshwar Sen of EY India noted that high tariffs might be strategically used to boost US manufacturing, potentially affecting Indian exports.India could either look for new markets or negotiate a favourable trade deal. Srivastava also highlighted concerns about outsourcing restrictions impacting IT exports, while acknowledging that some statements might be political rhetoric. H-1B visa policies remain crucial, with Trump’s stricter immigration stance posing challenges for Indian professionals. Despite these hurdles, easing environmental standards under Trump could aid Indian exports.Additionally, India’s demand for US technology and energy, along with American investment in sectors like IT and manufacturing, presents avenues for growth. Services trade between the nations grew by over 30 per cent since 2018, with substantial American investments flowing into India, totalling $66.7 billion since April 2000.","Trade experts warn that Trump's 'America First' policy could lead to tougher negotiations and additional trade barriers.

Benefits of Trump's Potential Victory for India

Indian export sectors could gain significant advantages if Trump wins, as higher tariffs on Chinese products may enhance competitiveness of Indian manufacturers in areas like auto parts, solar equipment, and chemical production in US markets.

Energy costs might decrease due to Trump's fossil fuel policies and expected slower Chinese economic growth. This could positively impact Indian oil companies like HPCL, BPCL, IOC, and gas distribution firms such as IGL and MGL.

Manufacturing and defense sectors could experience growth as Trump's emphasis on US industrial development may benefit companies operating in both countries, including ABB, Siemens, Cummins, Honeywell, GE T&D, and Hitachi Energy.

Resolution of international tensions under Trump could improve supply chain efficiency, aiding Indian businesses. His focus on strengthening US manufacturing and military capabilities could provide opportunities for Indian defense companies like Bharat Dynamics and HAL.

The business climate could improve with Trump's leadership, potentially benefiting Indian equity markets through reduced corporate taxation, fewer regulatory requirements, and business-friendly policies.

Disadvantages for India due to Trump's Return:

A Trump presidency could trigger inflation, affecting Indian businesses through higher interest rates and increased costs for US-sourced materials and equipment. Economic experts anticipate that his proposed policies on tariffs, deportation, and deficit spending could cause inflationary pressures, resulting in immediate price increases and wage adjustments.

Trump's economic policies could strengthen the US dollar and increase bond yields through tax reductions and fiscal measures. This would attract global capital to the US, potentially weakening emerging market currencies including the Indian rupee. A stronger dollar would increase India's import expenses, particularly for oil, leading to higher domestic inflation.

Despite possible initial market gains, Trump's policy uncertainties could create extended market instability. Previous data shows US markets outperformed Indian markets during his first term, with Nasdaq gaining 77% compared to Nifty's 38%.

Previous restrictions on H-1B visas under Trump affected Indian IT companies through increased rejection rates and costs. However, these companies have adapted by increasing local US hiring and green card holders, reducing their vulnerability to future immigration restrictions.

Trump has criticized India's trade policies and suggested reciprocal tariffs. His administration could pressure India to reduce trade barriers, affecting sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles. However, his efforts to reduce Chinese manufacturing dependence could benefit India.

The anticipated increase in the US fiscal deficit under Trump could lead to global inflation and higher interest rates, creating challenges for emerging markets' monetary policies. While India's domestic-focused economy provides some buffer, a Harris victory would likely maintain current economic frameworks with minimal disruption.

US election results : Republican candidate Donald Trump is projected to defeat Democrat candidate Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections, as per the latest counting trends. Indian equity markets have responded positively to Trump’s potential win. But what will the long-term impact of Trump at the White House be for Indian stock markets?A Republican sweep might trigger a short-term upswing in stock markets, primarily due to gains in US equity markets, as per Emkay Global's analysis.The Chinese markets, however, are expected to face heightened volatility and uncertainty during this period.India appears to be among the primary beneficiaries of Trump's presidency, particularly concerning economic and foreign policy matters. As Nomura's Sonal Verma states, ""We see India as a relative beneficiary, due to its domestic demand-driven growth model and benefits from lower commodity prices, supply chain shifts and on foreign policy.""The advantages India stands to gain from the current supply chain reorganisation, as companies reduce their dependence on China during Trump's administration, are likely to outweigh any potential challenges related to trade and immigration policies, according to Verma.According to an ET analysis, India stands to potentially benefit from this situation, with improved prospects for Foreign Portfolio Investment positioning and increased capital flows, according to the brokerage firm's assessment.

This election has not only reshaped America’s leadership but also impacted diverse industries, global relations, and various communities within the US.Here’s a look at some of the notable winners and losers from the 2024 election results.Donald Trump scored a ""magnificent victory for the American people,"" reclaiming the White House in a fiercely contested election against Democratic rival Kamala Harris “This truly will be the golden age of America,” Trump said in his victory speech at a celebration in West Palm Beach, Florida. He was joined on stage by his wife Melania, other family members, vice-president elect JD Vance and some high-profile supporters.His victory marks a remarkable political comeback, underscoring the enduring influence he holds within the Republican Party and among conservative voters. Trump’s return signifies a shift back to the “America First” policies that defined his first term, which included strict immigration policies, a robust stance on trade, and a pronounced nationalism that resonated with his voter base.The election saw a surge of Trump support in battleground states, allowing Republicans to win a majority in the Senate. This “Red Wave” also facilitated a Republican majority in Congress, giving Trump and his administration a unique opportunity to implement their agenda with fewer legislative obstacles.He boosted his support across suburban counties, rural areas, and even some major cities that have traditionally been Democratic strongholds; in both high-income and low-income counties; as well as in regions with historically high unemployment and areas now experiencing record-low jobless rates.Analysts predict that this control will allow for significant changes to fiscal policy, likely including tax cuts and regulatory reforms, echoing Trump’s first term.“We have a new star. A star is born: Elon,” said Trump in his victory speech. The world's wealthiest person had gone all out to support Trump. The Tesla CEO watched the US presidential results at Mar-a-Lago with Trump.The 53-year-old owner of X (previously Twitter) has dedicated his wealth, time and substantial influence to support Trump following his endorsement in July.Trump has reportedly contributed a minimum of $118 million to his political action committee(PAC). His PAC was giving $1 million-a-day to voters to register in swing states. His involvement also included appearing alongside Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign event and conducting several town halls independently in this crucial swing in run up to the US presidential elections.Trump has already signaled his intention to appoint Elon Musk to lead a proposed Department of Government Efficiency. This new position would grant Musk sweeping authority to assess federal agencies and propose reductions in government spending. Although the role could potentially streamline government functions, it would also give Musk significant control over the regulators who oversee his own companies—a setup that could lead to substantial conflicts of interest. Concerns arise over Musk possibly leveraging his role to shape policies that could favor his business ventures.Musk has suggested trimming at least $2 trillion from the federal budget, with a focus on reducing government expenditure. At a Trump rally in New York’s Madison Square Garden, Musk openly criticized current fiscal practices, declaring, “Your money is being wasted. We’re going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook.”As a rising figure within the Republican Party, Indian-American entrepreneur and political newcomer Vivek Ramaswamy was a standout figure during the election season. Known for his outspoken stances on corporate wokeness and free-market capitalism, Ramaswamy’s influence has grown as he aligned himself with Trump’s economic agenda. Ramaswamy’s “anti-woke” messaging resonated with a subset of Trump supporters and gave him national prominence as a future Republican leader.While Ramaswamy was not on the ticket, his presence in Trump’s orbit and his alignment with pro-business policies have solidified his role as an influencer within the GOP.At occasions, Trump has hinted that Ramaswamy could take on an advisory role or even be considered for a cabinet position in the new administration, which would enable him to continue pushing for deregulation and limited government in economic affairs.Indian-American representation in the House of Representatives has grown to six members, up from five in the previous Congress. Making history, Suhas Subramanyam became the first Indian-American representative elected from Virginia and the East Coast region. Currently serving as a Virginia State Senator, Subramanyam secured victory against Republican candidate Mike Clancy. The Indian-American presence in the House could potentially rise to seven members, as Dr Amish Shah maintains a narrow lead over the Republican incumbent in Arizona's first Congressional District.While Kamala Harris, the first Indian-American to serve as Vice President, lost the presidential race, the overall influence of Indian-Americans in US politics has only grown.Bitcoin surged to an all-time high on Wednesday following Republican Donald Trump's win against Democratic rival Kamala Harris in the US presidential elections. The cryptocurrency climbed as much as 8.63% to reach a record $75,120.Trump has pledged to transform the United States into the world's leading cryptocurrency hub, establish a national reserve of Bitcoin and select regulatory officials who are enthusiastic about digital currencies.""The price of bitcoin has closely followed Trump's position in the polls and on betting markets,"" Russ Mould, an analyst at AJ Bell, told AFP.Investors are ""potentially taking the view that a Republican victory would lead to a surge in demand for the digital currency"", he added.The Trump victory has set the US dollar on track for its largest one-day gain since March 2020. Analysts suggest that a unified Republican control of both Congress and the White House could drive up the dollar and Treasury yields due to Trump’s tax-cutting agenda and proposed import tariffs.""A potential unified government under President Trump would have the greatest degree of freedom for fiscal policy and would likely be the most dollar bullish outcome,"" Deutsche Bank analysts noted. They added that, “even without control of Congress, a Trump victory would be decidedly dollar bullish via the impact of tariffs and the dollar should especially outperform against high-beta currencies,such as the Mexican peso and Australian dollar.Economist Peter Esho, founder of Esho Capital, observed, ""The markets are scrambling to figure out what happens next, but for the time being, the market is pricing in a higher growth and higher inflation outlook.""Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate and incumbent Vice President, suffered a significant defeat. Despite her historic role and appeal among certain demographics, she was unable to rally enough support to overcome Trump’s resurgence. Harris’ campaign struggled to energize key voter bases, including moderate Democrats and independents, and she faced significant challenges with the progressive wing of her party. The election outcome represents a setback for her political career and has left Democrats searching for new leadership and a clearer, more unified message.The Democratic Party as a whole finds itself among the losers following the 2024 election. Losing the White House and Senate has weakened the party’s standing and signaled a need for reevaluation. The Democrats’ defeat has also exposed internal divisions, with calls for new strategies to reconnect with working-class voters and to address issues related to the economy, immigration, and international relations.This election showed the limitations of a platform that some critics argue focused too heavily on social issues rather than economic concerns. The party’s path forward may involve a generational shift and a rethinking of policy positions, especially as it contends with a Republican majority in Congress.Republican lawmakers who had previously voted to impeach Trump now find themselves isolated within their party. As Trump reclaims the presidency, loyalty to his administration is paramount, and GOP members who opposed him during his last term face political consequences. These lawmakers risk marginalization and may find it challenging to secure leadership roles or committee assignments.The wave of Trump-aligned candidates who have gained congressional seats also means that the GOP is moving further to the right, with less tolerance for dissent. For Republicans who opposed Trump, political futures are uncertain as the party seeks to consolidate support for Trump’s agenda.China stands as one of the notable international losers following Trump’s victory. During his campaign, Trump made it clear he would pursue a tough stance on China, focusing on trade tariffs, restrictions on technology, and strengthening alliances in the Indo-Pacific. China’s economy, already under pressure from global economic shifts, could face further strain under a new round of tariffs and restrictions.Trump’s return to office could also mean a more assertive US military presence in the Pacific, as well as strengthened ties with allies in the region who share concerns about Chinese influence. With a pro-business administration favoring US companies and protecting intellectual property, China could see increased economic and diplomatic pressure.The 2024 election marks a pivotal moment for US politics, ushering in a new phase of Trump’s influence over the country. For Republicans, this victory offers a chance to pursue a robust agenda on deregulation, tax cuts, and a “tough on China” trade policy. However, it also risks deepening the country’s political divisions, as Trump’s administration has faced consistent criticism for fostering partisanship.On the Democratic side, leaders must address the divisions within their ranks and recalibrate their approach to connect with a broader base. The coming years will be a test of whether the party can unify around a cohesive vision.As the dust settles, the key winners and losers from the 2024 election highlight shifting priorities, both domestically and internationally. The real impact of Trump’s policies will unfold in the months ahead as markets, communities, and foreign governments adapt to the new political landscape.","The 2024 US presidential election brought a political shake-up with former President Donald Trump returning to office.
