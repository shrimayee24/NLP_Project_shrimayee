NEW DELHI: In a move to address the menace of loose items, such as soil, construction materials and municipal waste, often falling from both uncovered or tarpaulin-covered trucks, the govt will soon make it mandatory for these vehicles to have “mechanised covering” — automated or machine-assisted methods for covering.This will be part of the updated Truck Body Code. Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari has said the code will be notified soon. Officials said the changes to the code have been adopted by a committee under the road transport ministry that has representatives from the industry as well. TOI has learnt that the truck-manufacturing industry has sought two years to implement the code while the govt is keen to roll it out in the next one year.There have been several Supreme Court orders directing proper covering of trucks carrying loose and protruding loadsbut there has been little compliance due to poor enforcement.Officials said the Automotive Industry Standards (AIS)-093, dealing with the code has been published. This addresses issues related to unsafe body building practices, structural weaknesses, overloading, instability and non-uniform vehicle dimensions. The AIS provisions for minimum safety standards, structural integrity, dimensional uniformity and roadworthiness of truck bodies built on approved chassis.Officials said the revised code will incorporate the requirement of AC driver cabin, advanced driver assistance systems for improving safety, and updated provisions for under-run protection devices.",The truck-manufacturing industry has sought two years to implement the code.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the bench, said that the Bombay high court erred in quashing its decision of declaring the account ""fraud.""Goyal was arrested by ED in Sept 2023 on charges of laundering money and siphoning off loans worth Rs 538.6 crore extended to Jet Airways.Goyal's counsel submitted that the HC order was on the basis of concession given by the bank and it couldn't be challenged by it in SC.

Smriti Mandhana opens up on 'love', World Cup win and more

NEW DELHI: Fresh controversy has surfaced around the cancellation of Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana ’s wedding with singer-composer Palaash Muchhal, following serious allegations made by actor-producer Vidnyan Mane. Mane has accused Muchhal of infidelity and financial misconduct, claiming he was cheated of more than Rs 40 lakh in connection with an unreleased film project. A formal complaint has been filed in Sangli, Maharashtra.Smriti and Muchhal were initially scheduled to tie the knot on November 23, 2025. The wedding was first postponed citing health emergencies in both families before being officially called off in December 2025.In an interview with Hindustan Times, the 34-year-old alleged that the relationship between Mandhana and Muchhal broke down after a shocking incident during wedding festivities in November 2025.“I was at the wedding celebrations (November, 23, 2025) when he was caught red-handed with another woman in bed. Bhayanak scene tha, he was beaten up by the Indian female cricketers. The entire family is chindi chor. I thought he’d get married and settle in Sangli, but it has completely backfired on me.”Mane further claimed he is a childhood friend of Smriti Mandhana and was introduced to Muchhal through her family.Mane also levelled allegations of financial coercion against the Muchhal family, stating that he was pressured to invest additional money into a stalled film project.“When I met his mother (Amita Muchhal) last month, she said the budget to release the movie has now increased to Rs 1.5 crore. They asked me to invest another Rs 10 lakh or I wouldn’t get any money back. They started blackmailing me and threatened to throw me out of the film, thus I was forced to file a complaint,” he said.According to Mane, communication with the family stopped entirely after the wedding was cancelled.“After the wedding was called off, the family blocked me from everywhere. I found out that other artistes from the movie had not received payment they were due to receive either. I had heard of directors fleecing producers in the film industry but this is complete theft,” he added.Mane also asserted that he has evidence to back his claims. “I have saved all proofs including my chats and phone conversations that I’m willing to share with the police and the media,” he said.Muchhal later issued a response through an Instagram story, firmly denying all accusations. ""In light of the allegations made by Sangli-based Vidnyan Mane on social media, I wish to state that these claims against me are entirely baseless and factually incorrect. They have been made with malicious intent to tarnish my reputation, and they will not go unchallenged. My lawyer, Shreyansh Mithare, is exploring all legal avenues, and this matter will be dealt with strictly through the appropriate legal channels,” Muchhal wrote.Amid widespread speculation over the reasons behind the split, both parties later issued separate statements confirming the cancellation. Smriti stated that she needed to “clarify that the wedding is called off” and requested privacy, while Muchhal said, “I have decided to move on in my life and step back from my personal relationship. Its been very difficult for me to see people react so easily on baseless rumours about something which has been most sacred to me. Its the most difficult phase of my life and I will deal with it gracefully holding on to my beliefs.”",Smriti Mandhana and Palaash Muchhal's wedding has been called off.

NEW DELHI: Light rain and a thunderstorm on Friday provided slight relief from pollution in the national capital, but air quality remained in the “poor” category, with the AQI recorded at 297 at 7 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Light rain also lashed Ghaziabad and Noida.This marked a marginal improvement from Thursday morning, when the AQI had been in the “very poor” category at 312.Several parts of the national capital continued to register poor air quality, with Anand Vihar at 317, Ashok Vihar 335, Wazirpur 351, Punjabi Bagh 326, RK Puram 315, Bawana 342, ITO 266, Chandni Chowk 326, and Dwarka Sector 8 316, the CPCB reported.Meanwhile, the temperature in Delhi was around 16.4°C at 7 am, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Under the AQI classification, readings are categorised as follows: 0–50 ‘Good’, 51–100 ‘Satisfactory’, 101–200 ‘Moderate’, 201–300 ‘Poor’, 301–400 ‘Very Poor’, and 401–500 ‘Severe’.Thursday had been unusually warm, with the mercury soaring to 27.1°C, about seven degrees above normal, marking the warmest January day in seven years.The high temperature was attributed to persistent warm easterly winds and clear skies, which increased sunshine hours.“Westerly winds are cold, while easterly winds are warm during this time of the year,” a weather official explained.With multiple spells of rain expected on Friday, the temperature is likely to drop. Officials said the maximum temperature is forecast to fall to 18-20°C on Friday and further to 16-18°C on Saturday.The rainy spells, accompanied by cloud cover, are also expected to bring down Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) to the poor category on Friday and to moderate by Saturday, if the predictions hold true.The IMD has issued a yellow alert for rain across the city. “Another round of very light to light rain is likely towards the afternoon or evening on Friday,” officials added, advising residents to remain cautious of strong winds and localized thunderstorms.A day earlier, the Sub-Committee on the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) revoked all Stage III measures across Delhi-NCR with immediate effect on January 22, following improvements in air quality and favorable forecast trends.A statement from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said: “The Sub-Committee had invoked Stage III of GRAP on January 16, 2026, after a deterioration in Delhi’s average AQI.” Since then, air quality has shown a downward trend. According to the daily AQI Bulletin from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the average AQI improved from 378 on January 20 to 330 on January 21 and 322 on January 22.Considering this improving trend, and based on air quality and meteorological forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), the CAQM Sub-Committee convened today to review the situation.","Light rain and a thunderstorm on Friday provided slight relief from pollution in the national capital.

Indian seafarers are most abandoned in the world again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-seafarers-are-most-abandoned-in-the-world-again/articleshow/127319128.cms,"Representative image: ANI

LONDON: Indian seafarers are the most abandoned in the world for the third year running.A total of 1,125 Indian seafarers were abandoned on ships in 2025 out of a total of 6,223 seafarers abandoned across 410 ships worldwide, making 2025 the worst year on record for seafarer abandonment.The number of Indian seafarers abandoned has gone up 25% compared to 2024, when 899 were abandoned. In 2023, it was 401. After Indians, the next highest cohort to be abandoned in 2025 were Filipinos (539).India is the third-biggest supplier of seafarers in the world, after the Philippines and China.Worldwide the total number of seafarers abandoned has increased by 32% and ship abandonments are up 31% compared to 2024, according to the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), headquartered in London.ITF data shows that seafarers were owed a total of $25.8 million in 2025 as a consequence of abandonment. From this, the ITF has recovered and returned $16.5 million to seafarers.The two countries where most ship abandonments took place were Türkiye and the UAE.Seafarer abandonment is defined as failing to cover the cost of a seafarer’s repatriation; leaving a seafarer without maintenance; or severing ties with a seafarer, including failing to pay wages for at least two months.“It’s nothing short of a disgrace that, yet again, we are seeing record numbers of seafarers abandoned by unscrupulous ship owners,” said David Heindel, chair of the ITF seafarers’ section.An Indian seafarer abandoned with three Indian crew on the “Eleen Armonia”, off the coast of Nigeria, since June, without pay, said: “I can’t sleep from stress, and if this continues I don’t know how it will affect my health. I joined this vessel quickly because the assignment meant I could spend Christmas and New Year with my new daughter and family. I have now missed these and an important family event. As seafarers, it feels really shameful that we’re treated this way. ”Last Sept India’s Directorate General of Shipping blacklisted 86 vessels linked to recurrent Indian seafarer abuse.Three hundred and thirty-seven ship abandonments in 2025 were on vessels sailing under flags of convenience — flags of a country other than the country of ownership. These flags are commonly used by shadow fleets (carrying sanctioned goods) to hide the identity of the real ship owner and are associated with poor safety standards and working conditions.","Number of Indian seafarers abandoned has gone up 25% compared to 2024, when 899 were abandoned.

India Named Global Growth Engine By IMF, BJP Says Global Data Exposes Rahul Gandhi's Claim

BJP hits back

NEW DELHI: Congress leader and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Friday renewed his “dead economy” attack on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi , citing the impact of steep US tariffs on India’s textile sector. He held him accountable, alleging official inaction amid job losses and growing uncertainty for exporters.“50% US tariffs and uncertainty are badly hurting India’s textile exporters. Job losses, factory shutdowns and reduced orders are a reality of our ‘Dead Economy’,” Gandhi wrote in a post on X.Targeting PM Modi, Gandhi accused the government of failing to respond to the crisis despite the scale of the impact.“Mr Modi has offered no relief or even spoken about tariffs, even though more than 4.5 crore jobs and lakhs of businesses are at stake. Modi ji, you are accountable; please direct your attention to this matter!,” the leader of opposition further wrote.Earlier, echoing US President Donald Trump ’s sharp criticism of India’s economy, Gandhi had said the Indian economy was “dead” and blamed the PM Modi government’s policies for the situation.He accused the Centre of damaging growth through decisions such as demonetisation, a flawed GST rollout and what he termed the collapse of MSMEs and job creation, remarks that had drawn strong political reactions.In a post on X last year, Gandhi said, “Economy is dead. Modi killed it”. He also listed the key reasons behind the decline: the “Adani-Modi partnership,” demonetisation, a flawed GST, a failed “Assemble in India” initiative, the wiping out of MSMEs, and distress in the farming sector.Speaking to reporters at the time, Gandhi claimed that the economic slowdown was evident to everyone except the Prime Minister and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.“Everybody knows this except PM Modi and the Finance Minister. It is a dead economy. I am glad that the US President has stated facts,” he said, alleging that government policies had destroyed jobs and hurt small businesses.Trump had earlier taken a swipe at India and Russia on his Truth Social platform. He wrote, ""I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India — their tariffs are too high, among the highest in the world. Likewise, Russia and the USA do almost no business together.""Reacting to Gandhi’s claims, the BJP rejected allegations of job losses and factory shutdowns. Union minister Giriraj Singh said that the industry was expanding, not declining and accused the Congress leader of spreading misinformation.Also read: 'Maha Yuddh in Maha Panchayat?'

“The textile and garment industries have not shut down; the only shutdown is in the minds of those spreading negativity about India. From April to December 2024, exports were Rs 95,000 crore, and from April to December 2025, they rose to Rs 1,02,000 crore. So, which shutdown are they talking about? Which exports have fallen? Those spreading confusion are misleading people. During the previous government, stitching machines, whether for garments or leather products, were not manufactured in India, and 40 lakh machines had to be imported. .. In the fabric-to-garment sector, one machine provides employment to 1.7 people. So with 2 crore machines today, at least 3 crore people are employed in this sector alone. Over the past 11 years, we have created employment for 5 crore people in the textile sector. This is not a shutdown. Visit industrial hubs in Odisha, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and across the country, and you will see investments worth Rs 60,000 crore. Stop spreading false claims about a shutdown, the industry is thriving; it is only his (Rahul Gandhi) mindset that is in a shutdown,” Singh said.","Congress leader and leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi renewed his “dead economy’ attack on the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

What's cooking in this kitchen? Just synthetic drugs like MDMA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/whats-cooking-in-this-kitchen-just-synthetic-drugs-like-mdma/articleshow/127339356.cms,"Representative image (ANI)

.

NEW DELHI: The south district police have arrested an alleged narcotics kingpin and uncovered a ""chemical kitchen"" of sorts that was operating as a factory for manufacturing high-end psychotropic substances like MDMA and heroin . The action to bust synthetic drug distribution in the city led to the arrest of Emmanuel (36), a Nigerian national. He was held with ready-to-sell heroin.The drug lab was inside the suspect's nondescript house in south Delhi's Devli area. A huge quantity of raw material required for synthesising the drugs was seized, besides the processed heroin.According to police, around 16 kg of crystalline material and 16 kg of grey grain-like substances used as bases for drug synthesis were stored in the house.The haul also included 51 kg of liquids stored in multiple containers and 30 unlabelled glass bottles, all intended for the chemical processing of MDMA and heroin. In total, 113 kg of raw materials was recovered. The heroin and MDMA crystals that could have been made using these chemicals would be worth several crores in the international market.DCP (south) Ankit Chauhan said that the breakthrough came on Jan 20, when a team led by ACP Mukesh Walia and SHO Paras Nath Verma arrested the Nigerian national while he was allegedly on his way to sell the processed heroin. The operation was conducted as part of a drive against organised crime and illegal foreigners.""The police teams were on foot patrol when they spotted the suspect. His attempt to evade the police backfired, leading to a search that revealed the cache of premium heroin worth over a crore. However, as the interrogation deepened, it transitioned from a routine drug bust to the uncovering of a sophisticated manufacturing nexus,"" said a senior police officer.During the raid at his house, the cops stumbled upon the chemicals stored in multiple containers. This massive haul of precursors suggests that the accused was not merely a foot soldier or a distributor, but a ""cook"" or supplier in a larger Nigerian gang operation.According to the investigators, the ability to transform raw, industrial-grade chemicals into ""high-quality"" heroin and MDMA marks a shift from simple smuggling to local production, making this bust significant for Delhi Police . Emmanual had been living in India illegally. By hiding in the dense residential pockets of Devli, he managed to operate under the radar. An FIR has been registered against him under the NDPS Act. Cops are conducting an in-depth investigation as the sheer volume of seizure indicates links to an international cartel.Special CP Madhup Tiwari has formed a team under joint CP Sanjay Jain to bust the supply chain and trace the absconding members of this gang.",The drug lab was inside the suspect's nondescript house in south Delhi's Devli area.

ECINET to integrate 40+ poll apps: India invites world EMBs to collaborate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ecinet-to-integrate-40-poll-apps-india-invites-world-embs-to-collaborate/articleshow/127262009.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Thursday formally launched ECINET — a single digital platform that onboards over 40 different election-related applications and portals — at the ongoing India International Conference on Democracy and Election Management (IICDEM) here, with chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar offering EC's collaboration to other election management bodies (EMBs) for developing similar platforms for their respective countries.Addressing delegates from around 42 EMBs at the launch of ECINET — which subsumes IT innovations by EC over a protracted timeline of eight years, is as per the election laws and offered in 22 Indian languages and English — Kumar proposed that the EC team behind ECINET can work with the representatives of other EMBs to evolve a similar platform aligned with their laws and in their own language. ""I would request the EMBs to examine this, and if you so request, EC will be more than willing to work with you on this score,"" he said.During bilateral meetings between EC and heads of 32 EMBs — from countries like the US, UK, South Africa, Portugal, Peru, The Philippines and Sri Lanka, etc. — on Thursday, the latter evinced interest in the collaboration offer. India also offered to provide training support to the officials of foreign EMBs through the India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management (IIIDEM).ECINET was envisaged as a one-stop digital platform by Kumar, along with election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi, and its development was announced in May 2025.It onboards more separate EC apps meant to connect citizens, candidates, political parties, election officials, and extend key services like voter registration, electoral roll search, 'track your application', 'know your candidate, 'connect with election officials', 'book-a-call with the BLO', e-EPIC download, near-realtime polling trends, grievance redressal, amongst others.""I formally launch ECINET for the world for better elections... and for a much more transparent and efficient sharing of information with billions of users at all points in time,"" Kumar said at the event.The beta version of ECINET was successfully piloted during the 2025 Bihar assembly elections and the preceding special intensive revision (SIR), enabling EC to deliver enhanced citizen-centric electoral services and make available all election-related information at the click of a button. Suggestions were sought from citizens before giving final shape to the platform. Kumar on Thursday shared that nearly 53,000 suggestions were received and the app was constantly updated, sometimes by the hour. He even reached out to the EMBs of the world to examine the app and offer their suggestions to improve it further.Since the beta release, ECINET has processed over 10 crore registration forms, averaging 2.7 lakh forms per day. More than 11 lakh booth-level officers (BLOs) have registered on the platform. Over 150 crore documents have been digitised through this platform to date.Earlier, election commissioner Sandhu said that ECINET is a great tool to enhance trust in EMBs as it brings in greater transparency and provides for quick decision-making and information dissemination. Fellow commissioner Vivek Joshi said IICEDM 2026 will allow EMBs to draw from global practices on the adoption of technology and digital innovations.DG (Information Technology) in EC, Dr Seema Khanna, underlined that cybersecurity is one of the key pillars of ECINET.

"Low Vitamin D may worsen Dengue outcomes, global study raises questions for India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/low-vitamin-d-may-worsen-dengue-outcomes-global-study-raises-questions-for-india/articleshow/127236738.cms,"Photo for representative purpose only

NEW DELHI: A clinical study from Colombia, published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research, the peer-reviewed journal of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has found that low vitamin D levels are linked to more severe dengue, a finding with clear relevance for India, where both dengue and vitamin D deficiency are widespread.Dengue remains a recurring public health challenge in the country, especially during the monsoon, when hospitals see sharp rises in patients with high fever, falling platelet counts and bleeding complications. While many recover with supportive care, a significant proportion deteriorate rapidly, and predicting severity remains difficult.In the Colombian study, researchers analysed blood samples from nearly 100 laboratory-confirmed dengue patients, classified by disease severity, and compared them with healthy individuals. They measured serum vitamin D levels along with miRNA-155, a molecule that regulates immune and inflammatory responses. Patients with milder dengue had higher vitamin D levels, while those with warning signs or severe disease showed significant deficiency.At the same time, miRNA-155 levels rose steadily with increasing severity, indicating an exaggerated immune response. The study also found an inverse relationship between vitamin D and inflammatory markers such as TNF-alpha and interleukin-6, both linked to severe dengue and complications like dengue haemorrhagic fever.Commenting on the findings, Dr R. Goswami, professor of endocrinology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said the study strengthens earlier evidence linking low vitamin D with severe dengue, particularly dengue haemorrhagic fever. “What this study adds is a possible disease mechanism through microRNA-155, which is involved in immune dysregulation via Th1 and Th2 pathways,” he said, adding that it is prudent to maintain normal levels.Doctors say the findings resonate with Indian clinical experience. Dr Pankaj Soni, principal director (internal medicine) at Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, said low vitamin D is associated with bleeding and complications and may worsen inflammation and viral replication, making it a modifiable risk factor but not a treatment. Dr Atul Gogia, head of infectious diseases at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said severe dengue is often driven by a cytokine storm, and correcting deficiency could help reduce complications, though larger, well-controlled trials are needed.India continues to face a heavy dengue burden, with about 1.13 lakh cases and 95 deaths reported till November 2025, and much higher numbers recorded in peak years such as 2023. At the same time, national studies show vitamin D deficiency affects a large majority of Indians across age and income groups. Experts caution against self-medication but say the study highlights the need for India-specific research to examine whether correcting widespread deficiency could help identify high-risk patients early and reduce dengue-related complications.","Study from Colombia finds low vitamin D levels linked to more severe dengue.

Srinagar snowfall disrupts flight services; IndiGo issues advisory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/srinagar-snowfall-disrupts-flight-services-indigo-issues-advisory/articleshow/127222033.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Flight operations at Srinagar were temporarily suspended on Friday due to snowfall, with both arrivals and departures put on hold.In an advisory to passengers, the airline said the suspension could lead to extended wait times, both onboard aircraft and at the airport, as weather conditions continued to affect operations. It added that boarding formalities may be completed in advance so that flights can depart immediately once clearance is granted.The airline said it was closely monitoring the situation and assured passengers that efforts were being made to minimise inconvenience. Travellers have been advised to check the latest status of their flights before heading to the airport, as operations will resume only after weather conditions improve.Cold conditions tightened their grip across Kashmir on Thursday as minimum temperatures dipped further at most locations, with officials warning that an approaching western disturbance could bring fresh snowfall later in the day.Night temperatures fell below the freezing point across the valley. In Srinagar, the minimum temperature dropped by one degree from the previous night to settle at minus 3.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday night.The coldest spot in the valley was Sonamarg in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district, where the mercury plunged to minus 6.1 degrees Celsius, compared to minus 5.5 degrees Celsius a night earlier. North Kashmir’s ski resort of Gulmarg recorded a minimum of minus 4 degrees Celsius.In south Kashmir, Pahalgam, which also serves as a base camp for the annual Amarnath Yatra, registered a low of minus 4.4 degrees Celsius, down from minus 3.8 degrees Celsius the previous night.Officials said Qazigund recorded a minimum of minus 3.8 degrees Celsius, while Kokernag settled at minus 2.6 degrees Celsius and Kupwara at minus 3.7 degrees Celsius.According to the meteorological department, two strong western disturbances are expected to affect Jammu and Kashmir this week. The first system is likely to impact the region on Thursday, followed by another on January 26. Under their influence, widespread light to moderate rainfall and snowfall, including in the plains of the Kashmir Valley, is forecast, with peak activity expected on January 23 and January 27.","Flight operations at Srinagar were temporarily suspended on Friday due to snowfall.

"Patent rejected for MNC’s cancer drug, generics to follow",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/patent-rejected-for-mncs-cancer-drug-generics-to-follow/articleshow/127206094.cms,"Image: IANS

NEW DELHI: In what could be good news for patients, Indian Patent Office (IPO) has rejected MNC AbbVie’s patent application for its blockbuster cancer drug Venetoclax citing lack of inventive step. AbbVie markets the drug under the brand, Venclexta, in India. The company holds another patent on a composition of Venclexta, which is facing opposition in courts.IPO’s Delhi office declined to grant a patent on Venetoclax used in treatment of certain blood cancers, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. The decision, if not challenged, paves way for entry of affordable generics in country, legal experts told TOI. The application faced sustained opposition at pre-grant stage, with seven parties filing challenges between 2018 and 2025. The patent office held that the claimed invention was “obvious” and lacked inventive step, a violation of Section 3(d) of Indian Patent Act.Section 3(d) bars patents on new forms or derivatives of known substances unless they demonstrate a significant enhancement in therapeutic efficacy, a provision aimed at preventing “evergreening” of pharmaceutical patents.It is the same provision under which Swiss firm Novartis lost patent on its blockbuster cancer drug, Glivec, in 2013. The order, accessed by TOI, said “claims of complete specification is not patentable under the Act, does not describe the invention”, and added it offered “no enhancement in therapeutic efficiency”, and hence, is a case of evergreening.Further, applicants have failed to give data of better therapeutic efficacy of compounds claimed in the present application over compounds disclosed in the prior art document, it added. “In absence of any biological data for all claimed compounds in the present specification, it cannot be decided whether the claims actually have the claimed anti-cancer activity or not. Hence, applicants have completely failed to establish any pharmacological activity and/or therapeutic efficacy for all the millions of claimed compounds,” the order said.","Indian Patent Office (IPO) has rejected MNC AbbVie’s patent application for its blockbuster cancer drug Venetoclax.

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court directed IndiGo on Thursday to clarify how it intended to compensate flyers affected by the mayhem of cancellations last Dec, saying issuing refunds wasn’t quite the same as doing right by those who bore the brunt of the crisis.“Apart from refunding fares, what are the civil aviation rules for compensation? Please file an affidavit about compensation,” the bench of Chief Justice D K Upadhyaya and Justice Tejas Karia told the counsel for the airline after he informed that the carrier had processed refunds for cancelled flights.The counsel submitted that for flights that were “most severely impacted”, IndiGo was offering vouchers worth Rs 10,000 to each passenger. He said a website has been set up for them to claim compensation. “You know who the flyers are; why do they need to claim compensation?” the bench responded. “Anyway, you file an affidavit to this effect in two weeks.”The court was hearing a PIL by advocates Akhil Rana and Utkarsh Sharma, seeking directions to Centre to provide support and refunds to passengers affected by cancellation of hundreds of flights by IndiGo during that period.They argued that compensation must be in the form of money instead of vouchers.The petitioners pointed out that IndiGo had issued travel vouchers to stranded passengers with a time limit for utilisation. When the airline’s counsel said the vouchers were valid for 12 months, the judges noted the time frame appeared reasonable. They sought to know if there were options for flyers who did not use the vouchers within that period.Civil aviation ministry and DGCA informed the court that steps have been taken by authorities to prevent a recurrence of the crisis.Based on the inquiry committee’s report, IndiGo’s senior vice-president for operations was asked to step down, and a penalty of Rs 22 crore was slapped on the airline for its failure to adhere to the new flight roster norms, Centre’s counsel said.He said the airline was directed to furnish a bank guarantee of Rs 50 crore to ensure compliance with regulatory directions and long-term systemic corrections, while warnings had been issued to the chief operating officer, director, deputy head of flight operations and a resource analyst.The inquiry report was submitted to court in a sealed cover. Between Dec 3 and 5, IndiGo cancelled 2,507 flights while 1,852 were delayed, impacting over three lakh passengers across country. The inquiry found out that the airline was not adequately prepared to implement the new flight duty norms for pilots.",Delhi high court directed IndiGo to clarify how it intended to compensate flyers affected by the mayhem of cancellations last Dec.

'They Exist Because Of Pakistan': Canadian Journalist Exposes Brutal Truth About Khalistan Movement

NEW DELHI: Members of terrorist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) trespassed and vandalised Indian embassy in Zagreb and tried to replace the Tricolour with a ""Khalistan flag"", drawing strong condemnation from Indian govt.Govt on Thursday said it had raised the issue with Croatian authorities both here and in the Croatian capital and asked them to bring the perpetrators to justice. ""We condemn the incident of trespassing and vandalism at our embassy in Zagreb, Croatia, by anti-India elements,"" said MEA in a statement, adding under Vienna Convention, diplomatic premises are inviolable and must be protected.It said such actions also speak of the character and motives of those behind them, and law enforcement authorities everywhere would do well to take note of them. ""Accordingly, we have taken up the matter strongly with Croatian authorities, both in New Delhi and in Zagreb, and asked them to hold the perpetrators accountable for their reprehensible and illegal actions,"" said the ministry.Looking to target India ahead of its Republic Day, the separatists tried to take down the Indian flag and replace it with a ""Khalistan flag"". They also raised anti-India slogans. This was one of the few occasions where the separatists targeted an Indian mission outside of the ""five eyes countries"" - US, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand - where they are mostly based.India has been looking to ramp up its ties with Croatia, a member of EU, and PM Modi had visited the country last year on his way back to India from G7 summit in Canada.In a statement, SFJ claimed the act was timed to coincide with the lead-up to Republic Day. ""Ahead of EU leaders' participation in Republic Day, Indian Tricolour was removed and destroyed, while Khalistan flag was raised at the Indian embassy in Zagreb, Croatia..."" SFJ chief Gurpatwant Singh Pannun said.Continuing his anti-India rhetoric, Pannun claimed that the act was the first such incident in past 40 years.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday fast-tracked proceedings on the legal dispute over the religious character of the Bhojshala Saraswati Temple cum Maulana Kamal Maula Mosque in Dhar in Madhya Pradesh which has been a bone of contention between the Hindu and Muslim communities, lifting the stay it had ordered on the case pending with MP high court.The court also decoupled it from the larger issue of a challenge to Places of Worship Act. In the meantime, SC allowed Hindu and Muslim communities to perform Basant Panchami and Friday prayers respectively within the compound in separate demarcated areas.As Saraswati Puja will be celebrated on a Friday this year, a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul Pancholi appealed to both communities to show tolerance and mutual respect while holding their prayers and also cooperate with the district administration to maintain law and order in the area.With the Hindu side pleading with the court that they should be allowed to hold puja throughout the day as Saraswati puja is a day-long ritual and the Muslim side saying Juma Namaz can happen only between 12.30 pm and 3.00 pm, the bench decided to allow them to perform their rituals at the same time in the compound but in different corners. The court passed the order after additional solicitor general K M Nataraj, appearing for the state, assured that all necessary arrangements would be put in place to maintain law and order.The bench then asked senior advocate Salman Khurshid, appearing for the Muslim side, to brief the state govt on the number of people who would be offering namaz on Friday so that proper arrangements could be made. The court clarified that the namaz would be allowed between 1pm and 3pm while Basant Panchmi celebrations would be allowed all day.“A fair suggestion was given that in the afternoon, for namaz within 1pm and 3pm, an exclusive and separate area within the same compound, including separate ingress and egress within the same compound, shall be made available so that namaz can be performed. Similarly, a separate space shall be made available to the Hindu community to hold traditional ceremonies on the occasion of Basant Panchami... Administration may, with a view to ensure the maintenance of law and order, issue passes for the visitors or may adopt any other fair means to ensure that no untoward incident happens,” the bench said. “We appeal to both sides to observe mutual respect and trust towards each other.”The 11th century monument is at the centre of a dispute between Hindus and Muslims. Hindus believe it is a temple of goddess Vagdevi, an incarnation of goddess Saraswati, while the Muslim community calls it the Kamal Maula mosque.Advocates Vishnu Jain and Ashwini Upadhyay, appearing for Hindu side, pleaded with the court to expedite the hearing in Madhya Pradesh high court where the case arising from the dispute over religious character of Bhojshala Saraswati Temple cum Maulana Kamal Maula Mosque, has been pending. They told the court that proceedings in the case were not moving forward because of the apex court’s stay order even though the Archaeological Society of India (ASI) had filed its report in a sealed envelope.The bench thereafter asked the HC that the case be taken up by a division bench preferably headed by the Chief Justice or senior most judge and by opening the sealed envelope. It directed that the report be unsealed in open court and a copy to it be given to both sides. “Till the writ is finally decided, the parties shall maintain the status quo at the site,” the court said.","The 11th century monument is at the centre of a dispute between Hindus and Muslims.

Reforming SARFAESI Norms to Expand Rural Housing Credit

Bringing Gold Lending Into the Formal Economy

(Shaji Varghese is CEO of Muthoot FinCorp)

India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural economies. One powerful yet underutilised lever in this journey is household gold. In recent years, the value of household gold has more than doubled, significantly increasing family wealth across India. According to a 2025 Morgan Stanley estimate, Indian households hold nearly 34,600 tonnes of gold jewellery, valued at around $3.8 trillion—almost 89 percent of the country’s GDP. Much of this gold has been accumulated over generations or acquired to mark important life milestones.While gold carries immense emotional and cultural significance, in its idle form it contributes little to economic activity. It is therefore imperative that India deploys effective policies to enable household gold to be used productively—without forcing families to relinquish ownership.Gold loans offer precisely this solution. They allow households to unlock the economic value of gold while retaining emotional ownership, making gold a working asset that supports livelihoods, enterprise, and growth.Over the past few years, regulators have taken meaningful steps to introduce balanced regulations that protect customers while supporting sectoral development.These measures, coming into effect from April 1, 2026, create a stronger foundation. However, to unlock the full potential of gold loans for inclusive growth, further reforms are needed.Credit penetration in rural India remains low, particularly among shopkeepers and MSMEs—estimated at nearly six million nationwide. Many continue to lack access to formal finance, even as they need working capital to upgrade infrastructure, manage inventory, and expand offerings.Gold loans are ideally suited to meet these short-term needs. Interest is charged only for the period the loan is utilised, allowing borrowers to repay when cash flows improve and re-borrow as required. This flexible credit cycle supports business growth, encourages financial discipline, and mobilises household savings in a way that benefits both borrowers and the broader economy.Strengthening Last-Mile Credit Through NBFC Branch ExpansionA key reason for low credit penetration in Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural areas is limited physical branch presence. Over time, NBFCs have demonstrated a superior ability to reach underserved regions, tailor products to local needs, and operate efficiently through well-established models.For gold loans in particular, physical branches are essential and cannot be fully replaced by digital channels, unlike unsecured personal loans. Encouraging NBFCs to expand branch networks would significantly improve access and deepen market penetration.Currently, regulatory restrictions and prescriptive guidelines on branch expansion can slow network growth. Liberalising these norms—especially for collateral-backed products like gold loans—would accelerate outreach while maintaining prudential safeguards.NBFCs play a critical role in last-mile credit delivery, particularly for small-ticket and entry-level loans in rural areas. However, all NBFC loans currently carry a uniform 100 percent risk weight, which raises the cost of lending and limits credit supply.Gold loans are regulated by loan-to-value (LTV) norms, similar to home loans, where risk weights vary based on LTV. Extending a similar risk-based framework to gold loans could unlock significant capital, enabling NBFCs to expand credit availability to deserving borrowers.A coordinated approach between the Government and regulators can help create a supportive policy framework that recognises the broader economic and nation-building potential of expanding gold loan credit.Recent stress in unsecured lending segments, including microfinance, has adversely affected credit scores for millions of households. Many of these borrowers experienced temporary or one-time defaults and are now excluded from formal credit.Targeted schemes are needed to help such borrowers re-enter the formal financial system. Ensuring that temporary distress does not lead to permanent exclusion will allow households to regain access to credit and participate productively in the economy.Housing is a powerful economic driver in rural India, with strong linkages to nearly 50 sectors. While banks offer rural housing loans, their reach in smaller ticket sizes—below ₹10–15 lakh—is limited. NBFCs, with their extensive branch networks, are better positioned to serve this segment.However, SARFAESI Act provisions restrict NBFCs’ ability to recover smaller-ticket secured loans, as enforcement is allowed only for outstanding amounts of ₹20 lakh and above. Harmonising SARFAESI applicability for NBFCs in line with banks and housing finance companies would significantly improve credit flow and accelerate rural housing growth.An estimated 60 percent of gold lending remains unregulated. Formal gold loans, by contrast, operate under clear regulatory guidelines and supervision. Allowing greater flexibility in NBFC branch expansion would accelerate formalisation and extend regulated credit to underserved markets.With a strong regulatory framework already in place, wider branch access can help bring millions of borrowers into the formal financial system.The upcoming Budget presents a timely opportunity to build on existing reforms. With continued policy support and regulatory alignment, gold loans can unlock household wealth, deepen rural credit access, and drive inclusive growth across Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural India.","India stands at a pivotal juncture where inclusive growth must extend beyond metros to Tier-2, Tier-3, and rural economies.

Planning a bank visit? You might want to reschedule, as banks are set for a four-day holiday, beginning from January 23 till January 26. Keeping track of bank holidays is crucial for customers to plan their finances in advance and avoid last-minute inconvenience.It is important to note that banks in India follow a combination of national and state-specific holidays, which means branch closures may vary from one state to another. Here's a list of when and where will banks remain closed for rest of January:Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed as it is the fourth Saturday of the month. According to RBI, banks remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month.Banks will remain sut nationwide, as it is a Sunday.Banks across the country will remain closed, to mark Republic Day While bank branches will not be operational on these days, customers will still be able to access a range of digital banking services.Online banking platforms, ATMs, mobile banking applications and UPI services will continue to function, allowing users to carry out fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical visit to a bank branch, including large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available during the holidays. Account holders are therefore advised to complete such tasks in advance and rely on digital options when branches are shut.","Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

Budget 2026 metal sector expectations: MMTC-PAMP pushes for duty parity for refiners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-metal-sector-expectations-mmtc-pamp-pushes-for-duty-parity-for-refiners/articleshow/127354109.cms,"As the Union Budget 2026 is drawing closer, India’s precious metal refiners are have laid out their expecations from the finance minister. The sector is seeking relief from the current duty structure that favours importers as compared to local refiners, through free trade agreements.MMTC-PAMP managing director and CEO Samit Guha the duty gap has majorly affected the competitiveness of domestic refiners, even as the government is aware of the problem.Highlighting expectations from the government, Guha said that the whole ""precious metal refining sector has seen this disparity, which is there in duty, especially through the SEPA route between what we get as Dore versus what refined bullion is imported at.""He added that bullion has been kept out of free trade agreements signed after SEPA, and the industry hopes that upcoming trade deals will also exclude gold and silver from concessional duty regimes.He said targeted policy support is needed to help India enhance its refining capabilities and increase the number of London Bullion Market Association-accredited refineries. This, he suggested, could be done by offering input-linked incentives through duty differentials, either under trade agreements or by expanding the existing gap.""We would request the government to see what they can do in terms of either input-related benefits, in terms of duty differentials...which will really encourage local refiners to invest in the refinery and get ROIs and up their refining capacity and capability to a global level,"" Guha said.At present, dore imports attract a duty of 6% for both gold and silver. Refiners receive a 0.65% differential, bringing the effective duty rate down to 5.35%.MMTC-PAMP largely imports gold in dore form for refining. While gold and silver imports have traditionally been in a 1:1 ratio, the company imported about 40 tonnes of gold and 50 tonnes of silver in the 2024–25 financial year.Back in the April–December period of the current fiscal year, imports of gold stood at 36 tonnes and silver at 60 tonnes, Guha said pointing to strong demand for the white metal.","The sector is seeking relief from the current duty structure that favours importers as compared to local refiners.MMTC-PAMP largely imports gold in dore form for refining.

In this backdrop, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Union

Budget 2026

assumes significance. What are the risks to India’s robust and resilient growth story, and what can Budget 2026 do to mitigate them? We ask economists:

What Are The Biggest Risks To India’s Growth Story?

What Can Budget 2026 Do To Mitigate Macro Risks?

What Budget 2026 can do

Credit pipes: strengthen cashflow for MSMEs that are facing export stress, enforce payment timelines, and use targeted credit guarantees to help scale MSMEs

Supplyside disinflation: invest in logistics, power reliability, fixing legacy infrastructure issues, better service delivery in driving investment decisions. Already on the cards, customs reforms to ease bottlenecks

Fiscal anchor: Keep deficit to the target, disinvestments, better asset utilization, communicate a medium-term debt-to-GDP glide path while preserving capex multipliers

External diversification: accelerate FTA sequencing and utilization, and services mobility to offset single market risks.

India is the world’s fastest growing economy - with an over 6-7% GDP growth rate - the world’s fifth largest economy is driving global growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has acknowledged India as a key growth engine for the world. But amidst increasing geopolitical and economic risks, especially US President Donald Trump’s policy uncertainty and tariff war, India’s growth story faces external headwinds.Even as India’s GDP growth has beaten forecasts so far this financial year - the big question is can it continue to grow well amidst the global economic storm? Indian stock markets had a poor 2025, the rupee was the worst performing currency in 2025, and an India-US trade deal is yet to be finalised. Adding to injury, India faces 50% tariffs from the Trump administration, denting its exports. India’s growth is majorly domestic driven, yet global turbulence plays a key role in an increasingly interconnected world.Most economists surveyed by the Times of India Online point to two main risks: rupee depreciation, and Trump’s trade war and tariffs. The challenging external environment may weigh on India’s growth story, even though it is largely domestic demand driven.Economists believe that the rupee's free fall may lead to imported inflation. They stress the need for the government to stick to the path of fiscal credibility. Economists warn of trade and tariff-led shocks unless an India-US trade deal is finalised.Madan Sabnavis, Chief Economist at Bank of Baroda doesn’t see any domestic headwinds. “The Indian economy is largely a domestic economy and here we do not see any major risk besides the usual assumption of a normal monsoon. The risk on the external side is still in the realm of tariffs as the affected industries are dependent on export markets of which the USA is a major player. This can be addressed by incentives on the credit side as well as direct support based on performance,” he tells TOI.Yuvika Singhal, Economist at QuantEco tells TOI, “The biggest macro risk India faces is from global uncertainty and rupee depreciation. In a global environment marked by heightened escalation of trade wars and economic policy uncertainty, it is essential to remain steadfast towards preserving domestic macro stability.”Ranen Banerjee, Partner, Government Sector Leader at PwC India agrees that the macroeconomic risks that India faces is on the exchange rate front as in the event the outflow of capital continues combined with headwinds to exports, the currency will be under pressure. “This could inflate the import bills and feed into inflation and put pressure on the current account balance. Since the monetary policy is outside the purview of the budget, the only way the budget can support the macro is through continued adherence to fiscal prudence by keeping the deficit in check, reducing the debt GDP ratio and keeping the quality of budgetary spend high,” he explains.Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director at Anand Rathi Group says that the biggest macro risk he sees in FY27 is the trade shock from higher US tariffs, given India’s export dependence on a few advanced economies.According to Rumki Majumdar, Economist at Deloitte India the biggest risks to India’s growth story are weak credit transmission despite RBI easing (MSME/household lending lag), inflation resurgence as demand accelerates (imported inflation from tariffs/INR depreciation), fiscal pressure from slower revenues amid external headwinds and reforms, and external shocks such as tariff hikes, FPI outflows, currency volatility; delayed India–US trade deal.For Dr DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor, EY India buoyancy of tax collections is a factor that the government should keep in mind. “GST collections will go down and continue to remain low even in the next year. So there is a risk to fiscal consolidation that may emanate because of the fact that GST revisions took place and the rate effect has been immediate. The expectation was that the tax base will improve as consumption demand improves, but although it is improving, it is not enough to wipe out the GST reduction. This will have an impact on the budgetary, fiscal consolidation. So that is one risk to the other,” he tells TOI.Yet another factor he points to is: longer term risk related to household financial savings that have been falling relative to GDP over time now.Rishi Shah, Partner and Economic Advisory Services Leader at Grant Thornton Bharat flags the volatile geopolitical environment, fragmented global trade and increasingly fragile capital flows as risks for India.“While spending on AI and technology has supported growth across developed markets, this cycle seems narrow and possibly vulnerable. Any disruption could trigger risk-off behaviour, with capital flowing back to perceived safe havens, raising volatility in emerging-market currencies and asset prices,” he says.Sachchidanand Shukla - Group Chief Economist at Larsen & Toubro also cautions that resurgence of geopolitical risks and uncertainty over tariffs even though the IMF’s World Economic Outlook of January 2026 hints that the global economy has shaken off this shock are risks.Crediting the government for sticking to the fiscal consolidation path, Yuvika Singhal says, “Post the initial COVID shock, India has displayed remarkable fiscal prudence in gradually scaling back the pandemic-era stimulus along with reinvigorating appetite for reforms. It is also imperative that the entrepreneurs’ animal spirits are rekindled to build real businesses. On the fiscal side, although the level of deficit/debt for India remains higher than that of its peers in advanced/emerging economies, the resolve and the pace of fiscal consolidation has been commendable. ”“We believe the government should uphold the ethos of prudent fiscal consolidation and target a 1 percentage point reduction in its Gross Debt-to-GDP ratio from 56.1% in FY26 BE to 55.1% in FY27. Assuming Nominal GDP to grow by 10.0-10.5% in FY27, this could translate into an effective fiscal deficit range of 4.1-4.3% of GDP. In our opinion, the broader fiscal arithmetic would be formulated with an implied baseline target of 4.2% fiscal deficit/GDP ratio, which will provide two-way fiscal flexibility to the government. If growth momentum disappoints, then fiscal compression could go easy, with the deficit veering towards 4.3% of GDP by the end of FY27. On the other hand, if growth momentum surprises on the upside, the government could utilize the opportunity to deepen the counter-cyclical thrust by tightening the fiscal deficit to 4.1% of GDP by the end of FY27,” she adds.Sujan Hajra of Anand Rathi Group explains that since exports support over 40 million jobs, Budget 2026 needs to focus on targeted support for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather and electronics to protect employment and competitiveness.“At the same time, the sharp increase in welfare spending by states is crowding out productive capex, with revenue expenditure dominating state budgets. The Budget can address this by linking central loans and additional borrowing space to capex utilisation, while creating capex-linked incentives for states, ensuring fiscal support strengthens medium-term growth rather than consumption-led pressures,” he tells TOI.Rumki Majumdar of Deloitte India prescribes the following responses from Budget 2026 for the economy:Rishi Shah of Grant Thornton Bharat feels that Budget 2026 should prioritise resilience and sustainability.“Maintaining a strong pipeline of public capital expenditure remains critical to anchor growth and crowd in private investment when global capital flows turn cautious. At the same time, improving efficiency of expenditure and maintaining credible deficit trajectories will be key to preserving investor confidence. Finally, a sustained push on productivity, innovation and capability building—rather than incremental incentives—will be essential to ensure durable, domestically driven growth that can withstand external shocks,” he tells TOI.","India is the world’s fastest growing economy - with an over 6-7% GDP growth rate.

Explained: Why India-EU 'Mother Of All Deals' Matters As Trade Talks Enter Final High Stakes Phase

Excerpts:

With a new EU-India strategic agenda, the relationship seems to have acquired greater strategic salience. What are the big likely deliverables you are looking at from the upcoming summit and how can the 2 sides work together to ensure that the rules-based international order isn’t undermined at a time the world is in a flux?

Specifically on the FTA, have both sides been able to resolve differences over contentious issues like CBAM, cars and steel? Have you reached any understanding on the carbon border tax issue? Will the agreement be signed at the summit and how are you looking to reconcile your climate agenda with India’s focus on industrial growth?

India and the EU are also looking at a new defence and security partnership to facilitate defence industrial collaboration. Will this include high-end defence technology transfers to India?

India’s ties with Russia remain strong as the war in Ukraine continues. How do you plan to navigate differences over that issue as you seek a deeper and more impactful strategic partnership with India?

You have said that Greenland can count on the EU politically and economically. What is your assessment of the US military takeover threat and how would the EU respond to any violation of Denmark’s sovereignty?

Can we expect any new announcement at the summit to revitalize the IMEC initiative?

As EU-India ties enter a watershed moment on the back of a free trade agreement (FTA) that’s still being negotiated, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told TOI’s Sachin Parashar in an exclusive interview that while the last mile is always the hardest, it will be more than worth it. The conclusion of the trade talks and a new defence and security partnership, which the EU chief said can help both sides diversify military supply chains and improve access to new capabilities, are expected to be the 2 major outcomes from the EU-India summit on January 27.“Both sides are working intensively to address the remaining challenges and bring the agreement (FTA) over the line,” said von der Leyen, adding that the EU is committed to finding a workable solution to sticking points like CBAM. She also said the FTA would knock off 4 billion Euros in tariff for exporters.Without directly referring to the transatlantic strife, von der Leyen, who arrives Saturday for the summit, said the importance of EU-India cooperation when values like multilateralism, international law and democracy are being challenged is greater than before. She said India and the EU can help preserve the rules-based order and shape a secure and resilient world.On India’s ties with Russia, she said the EU is offering India reliability and long-term partnership that’s anchored in respective security concerns, “not alignment by pressure, but cooperation by choice”.Asked about the Greenland issue, von der Leyen said the EU remained committed to upholding Denmark and Greenland sovereignty and will face any challenge with resolve, while working on an investment surge in Greenland. The president, who will be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade along with European Council President Antonio Costa, also said the new EU-India defence partnership can be a game-changer - vital for EU-India shared security in an increasingly volatile world, from Ukraine to the Indo-Pacific.Europe and India are the two largest democracies in the world. We have always been natural partners. We share a deep commitment to democracy, human rights, international law, and multilateralism. At a time when these values are increasingly being challenged, the importance of our friendship and cooperation is greater than ever.With Prime Minister Modi, we share the same ambition to take our partnership to the next level, and the 16th EU–India Summit in New Delhi is the perfect occasion to do so. First, we are working ambitiously to finalise our ambitious EU–India Free Trade Agreement. It would be one of the largest agreements of its kind globally, creating a market of two billion people. Our trade relationship is already thriving, but its full potential is far from realised. So let us seize this moment, and seal the “mother of all trade deals”. Both sides will gain enormously, and it will send a strong signal to the rest of the world.Second, we must work together to make our two billion citizens safer in an increasingly dangerous world. We are in the final stretch towards agreeing a Security and Defence Partnership. This could truly be a game changer, with stronger cooperation on defence industries, maritime security - especially in the Indian ocean - and secure communications. Europe and India are trusted and like-minded partners. Together, we can help to preserve a cooperative, rules-based order while working together to shape a more secure, open, and resilient world.Let’s first recall how huge this deal would be. And what a tremendous impact it would have on our economies. Trade in goods between Europe and India has nearly doubled over the past decade, reaching more than €120 billion annually, The FTA would unlock an extraordinary opportunity to expand trade and investment even further, by eliminating € 4 billion in tariffs for exporters of all sizes.This agreement will support good, sustainable jobs for millions of workers, in both India and Europe. Both sides are working intensively to address the remaining challenges and bring the agreement over the line. We are committed to investing every effort to find workable, mutually beneficial solutions on issues such as CBAM, automobiles, and steel. The final mile is always the hardest, but it will be more than worth it.Europe and India are strategic partners with a long history of cooperation, which has progressively expanded over time in terms of economy, connectivity, and more recently in security and defence. Our Security and Defence Partnership will provide a clear framework and stronger structure for this cooperation.Together, we will deepen work on new security threats like cyber and hybrid, as well as diversifying military supply chains and improving access to new capabilities. This will strengthen resilience on both sides, helping to keep our people safe.In an increasingly volatile world, from the battlefields of Ukraine to the troubled waters of the Indo-Pacific, this cooperation is not only valuable; it is vital to our shared security. At the same time, it is important to be clear about roles and responsibilities. EU Member States retain their decisive authority in this domain. The export of high-end defence technology is, and will remain, a national competence.We are coming all the way to India to strengthen our unique and trusted relationship in a time of systemic rivalry and growing global fragmentation. Our cooperation holds immense potential. By deepening it, we can create countless new opportunities, as well as credible alternatives.Europe’s offer is clear and consistent: we offer reliability. We offer stability. We offer genuine partnership built for the long term. We do not seek dependency, but mutual resilience; not alignment by pressure, but cooperation by choice.Our relationship is anchored in shared values and in mutual respect vis-à-vis our respective security concerns. We share the objective of a just and lasting peace for Ukraine, in line with the principles of the UN Charter. We are bound by a common conviction that democracy, openness, and respect for international law are the strongest foundations for lasting prosperity and security.I can wholeheartedly confirm that Greenland, and Denmark can always count on us. We are working on a massive European investment surge in Greenland, to see how we can further support the local economy and infrastructure, in close cooperation with Denmark and Greenland. We’re ready to step up our diplomatic and political engagement on the ground, via our newly opened EU office in Nuuk, the capital.We stand firm in our commitment to uphold the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark. We will face these challenges with steadiness and resolve.Beyond this, Europe intends to take a more strategic approach to Arctic security. We will step up European investments in Arctic security and presence. And we will deepen cooperation with our partners and NATO allies, including the US, to reinforce our collective security in the High North.The India–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) is set to connect our regions as never before. It will boost trade, improve access to goods, energy, and data, and take our economic ties to a new strategic level. Through our Global Gateway programme, we are already supporting key projects that support IMEC.These include the EU–Africa–India Digital Corridor, which is building a trusted, secure, and high-capacity data link Blue Raman between continents, and the Global Gateway Green Shipping Corridors, connecting ports, including Mundra and Mumbai, to enable the supply of renewable maritime fuels. Last year, we held two highly successful IMEC Steering Committee meetings, in New Delhi and in Brussels. We will continue to work hard to turn this great project into reality, including during the upcoming EU-India Summit.",EU-India ties enter a watershed moment on the back of a free trade agreement that’s still being negotiated. The conclusion of the trade talks and a new defence and security partnership are expected to be the 2 major outcomes from the EU-India summit on January 27.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127346931,imgsize-725785,width-400,resizemode-4/ap-file-photo.jpg"
India has a river that flows backwards: Know which river it is,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/india-has-a-river-that-flows-backwards-know-which-river-it-is/articleshow/126525975.cms,"The Narmada river flows in the opposite direction and here’s why

The origin of the Narmada River

The reason why the Narmada flow westwards

What landscapes does the river support

Dams and projects that lie on the river

Natural sites found along the Narmada

Narmada and its importance for faith and culture





India’s river systems are usually described as following a clear pattern. Most major rivers rise in the Himalayas or the central highlands and travel eastward to the Bay of Bengal, a rule taught early in geography lessons and seldom challenged. Yet one notable river defies this logic. Flowing westward across the subcontinent, it reshapes landscapes, livelihoods, and belief systems along its course. Far from obscure or insignificant, this river is long, deeply revered, and extensively studied, though its direction often surprises first-time learners. The Narmada stands apart not for its size or speed alone, but because its westward journey is dictated by geology rather than convention. This geological defiance has influenced settlement patterns, pilgrimage routes, dam construction, ecological debates, and identities for centuries across western India.The Narmada is the river that flows west instead of east. It is the fifth-longest river in India, spanning around 1,310 kilometres. The Narmada River does not empty into the Bay of Bengal like the Ganga or Godavari do. It travels steadily westward from its source until it eventually reaches the Arabian Sea.The Tapi is another prominent example of the few big Indian rivers that follow this path. The idea that the Narmada runs ""backwards"" originates from the fact that the majority of the region's rivers flow in the opposite direction, eastward.The Narmada River begins near Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh. The location is forested and serves as a pilgrimage site. From here, the river begins to move westward. It runs across Madhya Pradesh, briefly crosses Maharashtra, and finally enters Gujarat. Its trip ends near Bharuch, where it enters the Arabian Sea. The river's character alters as it travels. In some areas, it cuts through hills and small valleys, but in others, it spreads out and slows. The upper stretches feel isolated, whereas the lower ones feel settled.Geology shapes the Narmada's flow direction. It flows across a rift valley caused by previous tectonic action. The valley slopes east to west. Water follows the slope. The Vindhya Range sits to the north of the basin, while the Satpura Range extends to the south. Because the river passes through this gap, it behaves differently than many others. It does not form a wide delta. Instead, it creates an estuary where it joins the sea.The Narmada basin covers varied terrain. While the upper areas are hilly and forested, with less people living nearby, the land becomes flatter and more open when you go further west. These plains are fertile. Farming depends heavily on the river here. Crops such as wheat, pulses, and cotton are common. The river also supplies drinking water. Over time, canals and reservoirs have extended its reach. Towns and cities along the river rely on it in quiet, everyday ways.Several large dams have been built along the Narmada. The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is the most widely known. Others include the Indira Sagar Dam and the Omkareshwar Dam in Madhya Pradesh. These projects generate electricity and supply water for farming and households. They have also changed how the river flows. Over the years, they have been linked to debates about land, displacement, and environmental impact. These discussions continue.The river is also associated with well-known natural features. Near Jabalpur, it passes between tall marble cliffs known as the Marble Rocks. Close by, there is Dhuandhar Falls that send water crashing down in a thick spray, especially during the monsoon. Although these places are not vast, they leave an impression. The river here feels contained. The sound carries. The landscape holds it in place.For numerous individuals, the Narmada signifies more than merely a river. Temples in Maheshwar, Omkareshwar, and Amarkantak attract pilgrims year-round. Some individuals undertake the Narmada Parikrama, an extensive pilgrimage along its banks. The river is regarded as a living entity. Its trajectory has remained consistent across generations. Throughout its extent, faith, establishment, and customary practices persist in expanding around it.","The Narmada is the fifth-longest river in India, spanning around 1,310 kilometres.

Blue Davos 2026: What it means and why 2026 is being called the ‘Year of Water’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/blue-davos-2026-what-it-means-and-why-2026-is-being-called-the-year-of-water/articleshow/126787725.cms,"AI-generated

What is Blue Davos and why water dominates the Davos 2026 agenda

Extreme water events are becoming more common

Long term data show rising pressure on freshwater

Flood exposure is growing alongside scarcity

Oceans are warming faster than expected

Economic stakes are drawing new attention

New approaches are beginning to surface





A theme known as ""Blue Davos"" is beginning to emerge at the World Economic Forum 's annual meeting, signifying that water-related issues are no longer marginalised in international discourse. The connections between rivers, oceans, glaciers, and groundwater as a one stressed system are receiving more attention. The food supply, commercial routes, public health, and economic stability are all under pressure, frequently simultaneously. In 2026, the UAE will host just the third UN Water Conference in nearly 50 years, raising hopes that long-standing issues may finally find political attention and financial support. The tone is more about acknowledging boundaries that are become increasingly difficult to ignore than it is about declaring crises.At Davos, water is no longer framed as a narrow development issue or a footnote to climate policy. Under the Blue Davos label, it is being treated as a core condition for economic resilience and political stability. Briefings point to disruptions across the water cycle that are appearing more often and lasting longer. Flooding, drought and pollution are touching supply chains, energy systems and cities in uneven ways.Bringing oceans and freshwater into the same discussion reflects a broader scientific view that changes in one part of the system tend to echo elsewhere, sometimes far from where they begin.Recent events have made the pattern harder to ignore. In late 2024, rivers in parts of the Amazon basin dropped to unusually low levels, while Spain dealt with its most serious flooding in decades. Similar contrasts appeared in other regions, occasionally within the same country. Water arrives suddenly and destructively in some places, while it retreats for months in others. Researchers often describe this less as a series of isolated shocks and more as a hydrological cycle that is drifting out of balance, shaped by accumulated stress rather than a single breaking point.Longer records reinforce that impression. Since 1900, the share of global land affected by dry conditions has more than doubled, according to OECD data. This expansion strains drinking water supplies and agriculture at the same time. Large lakes offer another signal. Around half of the world’s biggest lakes no longer recover easily after periods of stress. River basins show similar instability, swinging between unusually high and low flows instead of staying within familiar seasonal ranges.Flood risk has increased alongside water shortage. World Bank estimates suggest roughly 1.8 billion people face exposure to significant flooding during a one-in-100-year event, most of them in low and middle-income countries. Even shallow flooding can interrupt housing, transportation, and daily work. These impacts are often felt most severely in areas where sanitation and access to safe drinking water are already unreliable. What emerges is not a single global picture but a patchwork shaped by income, geography and infrastructure.The ocean side of the cycle is shifting as well. Ocean warming has accelerated sharply since the 1980s, bringing effects that include ice loss, rising seas and acidification. Glaciers are losing hundreds of gigatonnes of ice each year. These changes influence weather patterns and coastal economies, sometimes far inland. The scale of these links helps explain why Blue Davos treats marine and freshwater issues as parts of the same problem rather than separate tracks.Water also carries economic weight that is becoming harder to overlook. Estimates place the annual value of water ecosystems at around 58 trillion dollars. Investment, however, has not kept pace. Only a small share of global water funding comes from private sources, leaving gaps in infrastructure and resilience. Projections suggest that close to a third of global GDP could be exposed to high water stress by mid century. These figures are nudging the conversation toward risk and long term stability rather than short term fixes.Some responses are beginning to appear. Water-focused microfinance schemes have helped millions gain access to safe taps and sanitation. Industry groups are testing cooperation at the river basin level, while ocean-related innovation is attracting more investors than in the past. Funding linked to the blue economy has grown quickly over the last decade, driven partly by recognition that degradation carries financial risk. These efforts do not resolve the wider imbalance. They sit alongside uncertainty and long timelines, as attention slowly builds toward 2026.","Water is no longer framed as a narrow development issue or a footnote to climate policy.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Friday rescheduled the civil suit filed by late industrialist Sanjay Kapur's Rani Kapur over the dissolution of the RK Family Trust, setting the next hearing for January 28. The court noted that the issues involved require detailed examination and a longer hearing.During the hearing, the bench of Justice Vikas Mahajan allowed the parties to submit brief written statements to clarify points arising from their preliminary arguments.Rani Kapur has approached the court challenging the formation and management of the RK Family Trust.In her suit, she alleges that the trust was created and operated without her informed consent, which led to her exclusion from the beneficial ownership of assets she claims were originally hers.According to the plaintiff, the relevant events took place at a time when she was medically unwell following a stroke and was dependent on her son for managing her personal and financial affairs. She has contended that she relied on assurances that her assets remained under her control and were being managed for her benefit.The suit further alleges that her late son either acted under undue influence or was used in implementing the trust arrangement.Rani Kapur claims she was led to believe her estate was secure based on representations made to her, even as transactions were allegedly carried out that diminished her ownership rights.She also alleges that she was made to sign documents without being fully informed of their contents or legal implications, and that some documents were signed in blank. These claims are directed against Priya Kapur and other defendants, who are accused of concealing the true nature and consequences of the trust structure.Through the suit, Rani Kapur has sought the cancellation of the RK Family Trust and the restoration of her estate, asserting that the transactions were carried out through misrepresentation and undue influence, without her informed consent.(With agency inputs)",The Delhi High Court rescheduled the civil suit filed by late industrialist Sanjay Kapur's Rani Kapur over the dissolution of the RK Family Trust.

Over 8L consumers in Uttar Pradesh unable to check electricity bills after UPPCL Smart App fault,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/over-8l-consumers-in-uttar-pradesh-unable-to-check-electricity-bills-after-uppcl-smart-app-fault/articleshow/127357466.cms,"





LUCKNOW: At least 8.48 lakh consumers in Uttar Pradesh are unable to view their outstanding electricity bills on the UPPCL Smart App or the official portal due to a technical fault in the state’s smart prepaid metering system.The fault has raised concerns among consumers, as the power corporation has started strict enforcement of disconnection rules for unpaid dues.Due to the problem, at least 5.03 lakh consumers collectively owe ₹212.13 crore in basic dues, along with an additional ₹434.9 crore in arrears that continue to mount.The state has installed 61.64 lakh smart meters, of which 47.43 lakh are currently operating in prepaid mode. An AMISP review under the RDSS smart metering project, held on 16 January, revealed that 31.79 lakh consumers carry a combined outstanding balance of ₹1,097 crore, up from ₹904.16 crore reported just a month ago.Following the review, UPPCL issued fresh instructions to initiate disconnections for consumers whose dues remain pending beyond the permissible limit.Under the new rules, LMV-1 (up to 2 kW) and LMV-2 (up to 1 kW) consumers will face disconnection if their balance remains unpaid for more than 30 days.Reconnection will require them to clear at least 50% of the outstanding amount, apart from arrears adjustment. Consumers who recharge 50–75% of the pending amount will get three days to complete the top-up, while those who recharge 75–100% will get seven days. Failure to make payments within the given time will result in fresh disconnection. This relaxation will only be provided once to a consumer.For all other consumer categories, disconnection will occur immediately after the grace period ends. An interim seven-day emergency credit has been approved for the transition period. Reconnection will only be permitted once payments are made.The corporation has also activated an automated arrear-recovery mechanism, in which a fixed percentage will be deducted from every recharge to clear old dues.LMV-1 domestic consumers will have 10–25% of each recharge adjusted based on the size of the outstanding amount, while all other categories will face a flat 25% deduction.Meanwhile, the move to snap connections has triggered criticisAvadhesh Kumar Verma, chairman of the UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad, said that in three discoms — DVVNL, PuVVNL and KESCo — 8.48 lakh consumers were unable to check their balance due to the fault in the application. “Without transparency, any action based on a negative balance is unjustified,” he said, demanding that no disconnections should take place until technical issues are resolved.An official said the faults would be rectified before the end of the month.","At least 8.48 lakh consumers in Uttar Pradesh are unable to view their outstanding electricity bills.

LUCKNOW: Six key discoms of Uttar Pradesh, including private utility NPCL, have shown noticeable improvement in their performance in the 14th Annual Integrated Rating and Ranking of Power Distribution Utilities report, released by the Union power minister Manohar Lal Khattar in Parwanoo, Himachal Pradesh, on Friday.Leading the charge is Noida Power Company Limited (NPCL), the state’s privately operated discom, which has secured seventh spot with an A+ rating and a score of 96.18, placing it among the top 10 discoms nationwide.Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Ltd (PVVNL) emerged as a national standout by earning an A+ rating, a remarkable climb from its B grade the previous year. PVVNL’s score of 86.57 places it among the country’s top performers, and reflects strong strides in financial sustainability, timely payment to power suppliers, and improved cost recovery.It is also among the select group of discoms that managed to limit days payable to ‘Gencos’ (generation companies) and ‘Transcos’ (transmission companies) to below 60 days, earning full marks in that category.Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Ltd (DVVNL) also saw a significant uplift, progressing from a Cto Brating with a score of 45.04. The discom was recognized for its improved billing and collection efficiency, along with a reduction in technical losses.This progress highlights DVVNL’s growing emphasis on operational streamlining and digitalization.Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Ltd (MVVNL) climbed from Cto B-, scoring 38.82, and displayed upward momentum in reducing its ACS – ARR (Average Cost of Supply minus Average Revenue Realized) gap. This improvement is a result of increased cost control measures and better subsidy realization.Kanpur electricity supply company (Kesco) maintained its Brating, with a stable score of 42.52, signalling consistent performance and steady recovery on key parameters like financial leverage and receivables. Its efforts in adopting digital payment solutions and customer-centric reforms helped it remain competitive.Purvanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Ltd (PuVVNL), while still rated C, demonstrated meaningful progress by improving its score from 18.76 to 29.38 — an indicator of focused reforms and better revenue management. This improvement reflects stronger billing practices and early results of efforts to reduce aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses.One of the key enablers across all five public discoms has been full realization of booked tariff subsidies, with UP among the states where subsidy dues were completely cleared over the past three years. This financial support, combined with internal process reforms, is helping the utilities strengthen their base for long-term sustainability.UP’s progress comes at a time when national metrics are also improving — India recorded its first-ever positive PAT (Profit After Tax) of Rs 2,701 crore for all rated discoms combined in FY25. Collection efficiency across the country reached 97%, while billing efficiency climbed to 87.59%, supported by reforms under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS).At the national level, Torrent Power (Ahmedabad and Surat) and UGVCL (Gujarat) led the rankings with perfect or near-perfect scores, reflecting mature utility management and near-zero losses.Member of the central electricity regulatory commission’s advisory committee and chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad, Avadhesh Kumar Verma, called performance upgrade a positive sign for the state’s energy sector.","Six key discoms of Uttar Pradesh have shown noticeable improvement in their performance.

SEC seeks approval to email summons after delivery hurdles



Adani group denies charges; analysts flag lingering uncertainty



Shares of Adani group companies fell sharply on Friday, with some stocks plunging as much as 13%, after reports said the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approached a New York court seeking permission to serve summons to group chairman Gautam Adani and executive Sagar Adani in connection with an alleged fraud and $265-million bribery case.The sell-off wiped out an estimated $12.5 billion in market capitalisation, reported Reuters, adding to broader weakness in domestic equities.Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship firm, dropped as much as 10.65% during the session and ended among the top losers on the Nifty 50. On the BSE, the stock fell 9.38% to Rs 1,891.60. Adani Power declined 8.84% to Rs 128.35, Adani Ports slid 7.81% to Rs 1,303.35, and Adani Total Gas dropped 7.55% to Rs 507. Adani Ports was the biggest loser on the Sensex.Adani Green Energy Ltd plunged 13.20% to Rs 785 after reporting a consolidated net profit of Rs 5 crore for the December quarter of 2025, marking a 99% year-on-year fall from Rs 474 crore a year earlier.Shares of Adani Energy Solutions Ltd fell 10.57% to Rs 827.20 and hit a lower circuit after the company reported an over 8% decline in quarterly net profit to Rs 574.06 crore, largely due to higher tax expenses.Other group stocks also came under pressure. Ambuja Cements fell 5.98%, Sanghi Industries dropped 5.96%, NDTV slipped 5.31%, and ACC declined 2.76%.According to filings cited in reports, the US SEC told a Brooklyn court that it has been unable to secure assistance from Indian authorities to deliver summons to Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani. The regulator has now sought court approval to serve the notices via email.The lawsuit, unsealed in November 2024, alleged that Adani group executives violated US securities laws by making false and misleading statements in relation to Adani Green Energy Ltd and were part of a scheme to pay bribes to Indian officials to secure favourable solar power contracts.US law bars foreign companies that raise capital from American investors from paying bribes overseas or soliciting investments through misleading disclosures.The Adani group has denied the allegations, calling them baseless, and said it would pursue all possible legal remedies.“The allegations made by the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission against directors of Adani Green are baseless and denied,” a group spokesperson said, as quoted PTI, adding that the conglomerate is compliant with all applicable laws.Market participants said the timing of the SEC filing unsettled investors. “Market participants assumed there’s nothing pending and that the group has been cleared, so the SEC filing seems to have come out of the blue,” Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst, told Reuters, adding that with no clear timeline, the issue could weigh on sentiment in the near term.The broader market also remained under pressure, with the BSE Sensex falling 769.67 points to close at 81,537.70, while the NSE Nifty dropped 241.25 points to 25,048.65.","Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship firm, dropped as much as 10.65% during the session and ended among the top losers on the Nifty 50.

Great Indian traffic challan trap: Fake SMS link drains Rs 2.5L from Delhi man over Rs 500 fine; check on official platform to dodge fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/great-indian-traffic-challan-trap/articleshow/127311842.cms,"Delhi Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.







NEW DELHI: Received an SMS informing you of a pending traffic challan with a link to pay online? Check it before you click. Cybercriminals are increasingly using fake challan alerts to defraud people. Recently, an elderly resident in east Delhi was defrauded of Rs 2.5 lakh after he clicked on such a fraudulent link to pay a small fine of Rs 500.The victim, a 65-year-old from Laxmi Nagar, told police that his wife had received a message on Jan 13 from an unknown mobile number containing a link for paying a vehicle challan. Believing it to be genuine, she forwarded it to her husband.When he tried to pay using his credit card, the transaction initially appeared to go through normally. But within minutes, another Rs 2,49,246.61 was billed on his card, including SAR 10,350 in Saudi riyals, suggesting international routing. A case has been registered by the cyber police of East district for cheating and personation.Police warn that such frauds are on the rise, exploiting people's fear of fines and legal action. With WhatsApp-based challan alerts now active, scammers send messages on SMS, WhatsApp, even through PDFs.Some claim to be from the transport ministry or pose as transport officials. These messages often pressure recipients to ""process"" the payment immediately via a link that mimics official portals.Such links, QR codes or payment requests from unknown numbers or unverified WhatsApp accounts are a major warning sign as are urgent messages warning of fines, licence suspension or legal action, officers caution. Fraudsters may also ask for payment through third-party apps, agents or unfamiliar websites. They often omit critical details such as notice number, vehicle number and offence location. The messages may try to collect sensitive information through links instead of redirecting to the official Parivahan portal. Once clicked, these links lead to fake gateways designed to steal banking credentials and withdraw funds without authorisation.To protect yourself, pay challans only through official channels. Always verify website URLs before entering any details and check challans using your vehicle or licence number. Authorities also emphasise the importance of the ""golden hour"", the first 60 minutes after a fraud, during which swift reporting can increase the chances of blocking or recovering stolen money.Victims should immediately call the National Cyber Crime helpline 1930, lodge a complaint on cybercrime.gov.in and inform their bank or card issuer to block the account and initiate a chargeback.","Police warn that such frauds are on the rise, exploiting people's fear of fines and legal action.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge Labs is a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
