‘Second time my father was forced to release terrorists’: Omar Abdullah on how Rubaiya Syed kidnapping set a 'benchmark' for IC814 hijack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/second-time-my-father-was-forced-to-release-terrorists-omar-abdullah-on-how-rubaiya-syed-kidnapping-set-a-benchmark-for-ic814-hijack/articleshow/113141698.cms,"NEW DELHI: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah revealed that 1999 IC814 hijacking incident was not the first time his father Farooq Abdullah was compelled to release individuals, drawing parallels to the 1989 kidnapping of Rubaiya Syed , daughter of then-home minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.""This is the second time my father was forced to release people. With Rubaiya Syed and families of the hijacked victims, they used the Rubaiya Syed incident as the benchmark,"" Abdullah said in an interview with ANI.""They said when you could release terrorists for a home minister's daughter, is our family not precious? Why is it only she is precious to the country? Then if she is precious to you, then our family is precious to us.So we set a benchmark that had to be followed,"" Abdullah added.The Central government, led by VP Singh, had agreed to release five imprisoned terrorists of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front in exchange for Rubaiya Syed's release. This precedent, Abdullah said, played a significant role in shaping the demands made during the IC814 hijacking.The IC814 hijacking has garnered renewed attention, partially due to its depiction of hijackers in the Netflix series ""IC814: The Kandahar Hijack,"" directed by Anubhav Sinha. The series delves into the controversial decision to release terrorists in exchange for the safety of the hostages.Abdullah highlighted the difficult position the government found itself in, saying, ""I think the Government of India had an option. At the time of Rubaiya Syed's kidnapping, they could have chosen not to negotiate with terrorists. But once you do it once, you have to do it again.""Speaking on the execution of Afzal Guru, Abdullah said that the ""J&K government had no role"" in the process, adding that the execution ""did not serve any purpose"".The National Conference and the Congress are contesting the upcoming Jammu and Kashmir assembly polls together.

Ganesh Fest: Ganesh Festival 2024: Toll-Free Rides on Maharashtra Highways from Sept 5-19,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/ganesh-fest-toll-free-rides-on-major-hways-for-15-days/articleshow/113072955.cms,"MUMBAI: In what is seen as a move to avoid embarrassment over the condition of roads during Ganpati festival, the state govt on Wednesday announced toll exemption on all public works department (PWD) and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) highways across the state from Sept 5-19. But a tad arduous process of getting the exemption has raised eyebrows.A senior public works department official said a self-declaration proforma will have to be downloaded from the state govt's website, filled and pasted on thick, black paper.This will then have to be taped on the FasTag sticker outside the vehicle so that the RFID reader skips it. To err on the side of caution, motorists have been advised to tape black paper behind the FasTag sticker, too. Some officials acknowledged that with even these precautions, motorists could still be charged. ""If a FasTag sticker gets read and the toll gets deducted, one can make a cashback request through the FasTag bank account, following which the amount will be refunded,"" said a senior MSRDC official.The toll exemption directive covers all entry points of Mumbai (Vashi, Airoli, Mulund, LBS and Dahisar), barring Bandra-Worli Sea Link, NH-48 (Mumbai-Bengaluru), NH-66 (Mumbai-Goa), and other PWD and MSRDC roads. It applies to Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses as well, said a govt resolution (GR) issued on Wednesday, which said the move is targeted at devotees travelling during Ganesh festival. Samruddhi Mahamarg will also implement the GR, said officials. There was no clarity on whether MTHL is covered under the directive.Toll exemption passes will be issued to MSRTC buses with the vehicle number and driver's name. These will be coordinated by the transport department, traffic police, police and regional transport offices (RTO) and made available at police stations, traffic police checkpoints and RTO offices. The passes will also be valid for the return journey, the GR said.","The state govt on Wednesday announced toll exemption on all public works department (PWD) and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) highways from Sept 5-19.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a petition by Sandip Ghosh , arrested ex-principal of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, seeking to intervene in proceedings before Calcutta HC which had ordered CBI probe into an alleged scam in biomedical waste disposal in the hospital and whether it had a nexus with the rape-murder of a doctor on Aug 9.""You (Ghosh) have no locus standi to intervene in the PIL.You were the principal when the alleged offence took place. The HC is not commenting on the merit of your involvement in corruption or the offence. Both are matters for investigation. As an accused, you have no locus standi to intervene in a PIL in which the HC has transferred the investigation to CBI and is monitoring it,"" a bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said.For the ex-principal, senior advocate Meenakshi Arora said her client was prejudiced by the HC observation indicating a nexus between the offence on Aug 9 and the alleged medical scam. The CJI said, ""That is itself a matter of investigation.""Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general S V Raju said the alleged nexus was the precise matter for investigation by CBI. Arora vociferously argued that the probe into financial irregularity and rape-murder case should be done separately and criticised the HC for drawing a nexus between the two cases.Both Mehta and Raju said an accused could not decide or direct how the investigation was to be conducted by CBI and could never be permitted to put fetters on the probe. CJI Chandrachud agreed and said even courts could not direct a particular course of investigation. ""Let us not stultify the investigation. We (SC) have also asked CBI to file status reports before us. As the highest court is looking into the matter, it will ensure that the investigation is fair. CBI will apprise us of what emerges during investigation,"" the CJI said.Arora tried to narrate why students, who have been agitating against the rape-murder of their colleague, were inimical towards Ghosh. She said Ghosh joined as principal in 2021 and had stopped the Covid-period practice of promoting students without examination. On financial irregularities in the hospital as alleged by the PIL, Arora said the plea was filed by ex-deputy superintendent of RG Kar Hospital Akhtar Hussain as a counter to the show cause notices he was served for lapses leading to his transfer to Murshidabad.The bench said it was not giving Hussain a clean chit. Arora said similar petitions alleging financial irregularities in disposal of biomedical waste had been dismissed earlier by the HC and argued that it could not continue to entertain petition after petition without being restrained by the principle of 'res judicata' (a matter that has been finally decided).""These are not matters which we can dispose of on a technicality. Three PILs were dismissed by the HC. But now it has entrusted the probe to CBI. At this stage, you do not have locus at all,"" the CJI said.Arora responded, ""When the PIL only alleged irregularities in biomedical waste, and did not draw any nexus with the Aug 9 offence, could the HC pass an order terming there is apparent nexus?"" The CJI-led bench said, ""The issue of biomedical waste is a trigger.

In a major milestone, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ) on Friday issued the rules for establishing vertiports - from where these vertical take-off & landing (VTOL) capable aircraft - will operate, paving the way for ""advance air mobility"" (AAM) in India. IndiGo parent InterGlobe Enterprises (IGE) plans to launch California-based electric air taxi-maker Archer Aviation 's e-VTOL 'Midnight' in the country around 2026. IGE chief Rahul Bhatia has signed up for upto 200 Midnights worth $1 billion.Issued after ""extensive consultation with all stakeholders,"" the DGCA circular ""provides comprehensive guidelines covering various critical aspects"". These include, basic infrastructure requirement specifications; physical attributes for vertiports; guidelines to ensure air taxis' safe and unobstructed take-off and landing; standards for visual aids to assist in landing; battery charging/energising requirements and emergency response planning.""Under this circular, site clearance and authorisation post-construction of the vertiport will be granted,"" the regulator said. Vertiports will be used by passengers to board and alight from air taxis; charging and parking these eVTOLs.Delhi-NCR, where IGE has its headquarters, is likely to be the first place in India to get air taxi service. Mumbai and Bengaluru are also expected to get the same in 2026. Hyderabad and Chennai could also get this traffic-buster.Archer, whose chief commercial officer is Indian origin Nikhil Goel , is working on a number of hi-tech innovations and features for vertiports. It expects the US FAA's approvals this year and then will start service in New York next year as the launch route. After the US, India and the UAE will get air taxis.Trial flights will be conducted here, with the regulator's nod, before commercial launch. Once they get the go-ahead, air taxis can start flying on the allowed routes. The UAE's aviation authority had this April granted operational approval for the country's first vertiport.Nikhil Goel had recently said the cost per passenger of using this service is likely to be just a ""slight premium"" over Uber. ""Delhi-Gurgaon, for instance, costs Rs 1,500-2,000 by Uber. An air taxi (per passenger) will cost upto 1.5 times of that or Rs 2,000-3,000,"" he had said.Archer's 12-rotter Midnight can seat a pilot, upto four passengers and some luggage. The same machine has been selected by the US mega carrier United, one of the backers of Archer, that has also firmed up two routes for launch next year - United hub Newark and downtown Manhattan, and Chicago O'Hare and the windy city centre.

In Aug 2017, he developed Tatkalforsure to help travellers secure Tatkal tickets, which are limited and reserved for last-minute bookings.While the Railways' Tatkal website took 5-7 minutes to generate a ticket, Dahake's tool could do it in just 45 seconds, making it very popular. Initially, the service was free, but in Feb 2020, Dahake limited the bookings through his extension to 10 and began charging Rs 30 per booking.This caught the attention of the Railways, and despite Dahake claiming to have paid relevant taxes and GST on all transactions, he was issued a notice on Sept 29, 2020. His laptop was seized, and based on his alleged confession, a case was registered.After three years, a final report was filed and the court took cognizance of the offence against Dahake under Section 143 of the Railways Act, which he challenged before the high court. Section 143 prescribes punishment for procuring and supplying railway tickets without authorisation.However, Justice M Nagaprasanna , after perusing the material on record, observed that the ingredients of Section 143 weren't present in this case, as Dahake had neither procured nor distributed railway tickets, which is necessary for an offence here.The judge also noted that Dahake had only created an extension to the IRCTC website, which sped up the process of securing Tatkal confirmation for potential travellers, benefiting the public.Since Dahake hadn't indulged in the unauthorized business of procuring and supplying railway tickets, permitting further proceedings would run counter to the law, Justice Nagaprasanna observed.","Gaurav Dahake, an entrepreneur, had previously founded'buyhatke.com ', a product price comparison online browser extension.

SC to CBI: Probe ASI U-turn on Defence Colony monument

The Supreme Court has mandated a CBI investigation into the Archaeological Survey of India's change of stance on safeguarding the Lodi-era Shaikh Ali 'Gumti' monument in Delhi. The court seeks clarity on why the structure, occupied by Defence Colony Welfare Association since 1963, was not declared protected despite initial recommendations for its preservation.

Waqf board scam: ED arrests AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan in money laundering case

Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with a money laundering case linked to the Waqf Board, following a raid on his residence. The AAP claims this is politically motivated and intended to disrupt their work as elections approach, alleging misuse of central agencies.

Waqf board scam: Court sends AAP's Amanatullah Khan to 4-day ED custody

A Delhi court has ordered AAP leader Amanatullah Khan into four days of Enforcement Directorate custody. The ED is probing money laundering allegations tied to the Delhi Waqf Board and disproportionate assets. Following a raid at his residence, Khan was arrested for alleged non-cooperation and evasive responses during questioning.

NEW DELHI: As a fiery fourth meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, took place Friday, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) said there were over 120 monuments under its protection that were claimed by different state waqf boards , sources said. The ASI presentation is learnt to have included an indicative list of 53 protected monuments that were declared waqf at different points of time.According to sources, the indicative list shared by ASI shows monuments that were declared ‘protected’ a century ago were claimed as waqf property in the 21st century. The list includes the tomb of Ahmad Shah, a Nizam ruler, in Ahmednagar, declared by ASI as a protected monument in 1909, which was designated a waqf property in 2006. Similarly, Safa Masjid of Belgaum, which was declared a protected monument in 1909, was categorised as waqf in 2005.Culture ministry officials, sources said, faced criticism from opposition members for raising concern that the law allowed waqf boards to declare any property as waqf. Pointing out that the law laid out a process for declaration of waqf, members said it was like peddling “WhatsApp university” misinformation to claim waqf boards could declare ownership of any property.Sources said dual control over monuments of national importance — by ASI and waqf boards — gave rise to conflicts and administrative complications. There are cases where waqf boards have undertaken construction, additions or alterations within premises or occupied portions of monuments. ASI raised issues ranging from commercial activities, installation of fittings, coolers and loudspeakers to operation of madrasas and worship inside monuments. Opposition members countered that these facilities were bound to be present in places of worship.Another member, sources said, countered ASI’s concern on encroachment and namaz being offered at monuments, saying ASI was responsible for upkeep of monuments and did not have jurisdiction to decide if prayers can be offered as that was covered under Article 26 which protects right to practise one’s religion.",The Supreme Court has mandated a CBI investigation into the Archaeological Survey of India's change of stance on safeguarding the Lodi-era Shaikh Ali 'Gumti' monument in Delhi.

JAMMU/NEW DELHI: Taking a hardline stand on abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A with a pledge to ensure it remains part of history, BJP on Friday released its manifesto for Jammu and Kashmir assembly polls, announcing 25 promises, including a slew of freebies, increase in 'Kisan Samman Nidhi' from Rs 6,000 per year to Rs 10,000, restoration of over 100 ruined temples, rehabilitation of displaced Hindus and also a concerted drive to address illegal Rohingya and Bangladeshi settlements in the region.Releasing the manifesto, senior BJP leader and home minister Amit Shah asserted that Article 370 was buried forever and BJP won't allow efforts aimed at its restoration while he mentioned the party's promise to release a 'white paper' on over 40,000 killings in J&K and fix responsibility.The assertion seemed aimed at cornering Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi over the manifesto of their alliance partner National Conference , which has promised restoration of Articles 370 and 35A, besides resuming talks with Pakistan.""I want to ask Rahul Gandhi if he and his party want revival of terrorism , separatism in J&K? Does Rahul support restoration of two flags and Article 370? He won't answer.

PM Narendra Modi, in an interview in May, had said restoring J&K's statehood was a solemn promise and he stood by it.Responding to NC's promise to restore Article 370, Shah said, ""The agenda of NC cannot get implemented on the ground. Article 370 is the past. It is history. Nobody can bring it back.""On the possibility of talks with Pakistan, Shah said talks and terror couldn't go together. ""We will talk to the youth of Kashmir, not Pakistan unless Pakistan stops terrorism,"" he said. Replying to a query whether trade could be started with Pakistan, he said trade set the base for terrorism. ""So no question of trade with Pakistan till terrorism is there,"" he said.BJP also promised to conduct a free and fair census to ensure proper decision making, focusing on inclusive development, with targeted interventions for marginalised communities.Shah promised further development under BJP, with plans to build 10,000 km of roads and a Metro system if the party was voted into office. The party has promised 20% quota to Agniveers in J&K govt jobs and police recruitment, and will follow the J&K reservation policy without affecting the general quota.""Tourism will also be a key focus,"" Shah said, announcing plans to turn Rajouri into a premier tourist destination surpassing Pahalgam. ""We will work to restore the beauty of Dal Lake and develop new attractions, including an amusement park at Tota Ground in Srinagar,"" he added.Shah also underscored BJP's commitment to women's empowerment, asserting that the party's manifesto was designed to benefit all sections of society in J&K.The party has promised to undertake reconstruction of Hindu temples and shrines under 'Rishi Kashyap Pilgrimage Rejuvenation Drive' under which 100 ruined temples will be restored. It will also further develop existing temples, including the Shankaracharya Temple (Jyeshteshwara Temple), Raghunath Temple and Marthanda Sun Temple.BJP has promised to enhance women's financial security by implementing 'Maa Samman Yojana' to provide Rs 18,000 per year to the senior-most woman in every household and two free LPG cylinders every year.

NEW DELHI: Captain Devi Sharan — the captain of hijacked IC 814 in Dec 2019 — and Captain S P S Suri — the pilot flew the hijacked aircraft of erstwhile Indian Airlines back home on Jan 1, 2000, — had another tryst with danger 12 years later. This time the two and their cabin crew member colleagues got stuck in civil-war torn Libya and were waylaid by AK 47-totting youngsters on the streets of the city.Luckily, they escaped unhurt.India had launched “Operation Safe Homecoming” in Feb 2011 to evacuate its citizens fleeing the Libyan civil war. Captains Sharan and Suri had operated an Air India Airbus A330 to Sabha in Libya which got grounded on arrival due to a snag. “The city, and the entire country, was seeing serious unrest. Somehow escorts were arranged to take us from the airport to an abandoned hotel in the city. There was no staff there and we had to search for something to eat in the kitchen,” Captain Suri, now retired, told TOI. Captain Sharan still flies for AI, now the Boeing 787.Captain Sharan had also spoken to TOI about this episode in an interview three years ago.“The next day, again with armed escorts, we went to the city to look for food. On the way, we were stopped by armed people and asked to lie down on the road. Our escorts explained that we were airline staff from India and had got stuck there. Then the machine gun-totting youngsters let us go,” said Suri. The food hunt did not go well either — there was only camel meat in the market which the Indian crew did not take. Indian diplomats arranged pizzas, again only tuna fish pizzas with no veg option to be found, for them.Two days later when a replacement part was sent for the grounded aircraft and the same was fir to fly, the two daredevil pilots took off for what was to be a nonstop flight to Delhi. This journey was also not without its share of last-minute surprises.“Enroute, Lebanon refused us overflying. We had to turn back and then took Egypt permission to overfly. Then we went to Saudi Arabia; took a fuelling halt in Jeddah and then came to Delhi,” recalled Suri. The two pilots go back a long way and their chemistry helped come out of this situation too. This had happened when the 2011 cricket World Cup, which India won, was between Feb 19 and April 2, 2011. India had won that cup.On the fateful Dec 2019, Captain Sharan and Captain Suri had taken off almost simultaneously from Dubai (for Kandahar) and Sharjah (for Calicut), respectively, in the early hours of Christmas. “We had come to know about IC 814 hijacking while on the ground in Sharjah. While operating these flights, I spoke to Captain Sharan on RT (radio telephony) and asked himhow are you. He had replied, ‘Sir, I can’t talk’,” Suri said.On landing in Delhi from Calicut later that day, Captain Suri from the airport left for Kandahar along with a team of officials and IA staff including Captain J R D Rao whose bravery he recalls with tremendous admiration.On Dec 31, 1999, everyone onboard IC 814 including Captain Sharan were flown back to Delhi. Captain Suri, J R D Rao and two others stayed in Kandahar as they were to fly the hijacked Airbus A330 back home, which they did the next morning in true daredevil style. The old saying luck favours the brave proved to be correct for them.“On Jan 1, we decided to give it a try and start the engines of IC 814 without any ground power. Luckily the engine started with a growl after seven days and we started taxiing. The Kandahar air traffic control asked us to stop and told us we did not have take off clearance. There was a fuel bowser close to our aircraft and I was worried one side wing of the aircraft might hit it. Captain Rao, who had a sore throat and could barely speak, told me, ‘keep going)Suri said.They took off from Kandahar with Afghan ATC shouting they did not have permission to do so. Shortly thereafter they entered Pakistan airspace, where also they were told they did not have the same. “I just kept saying hello, hello, can’t hear or something like that. We had butterflies in out stomach that Pakistan will scramble jets and force us to land. That did not happen.”The four members heaved a sigh of relief when they heard from “alpha control” — Amritsar ATC welcome IC-814 D (delayed) to India and tell them they had a straight routing clear for India.","Captain Devi Sharan was the captain of hijacked IC 814 in Dec 2019.

Social media trends can have serious, and sometimes fatal, consequences. A recent incident in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, UK, has highlighted the grave dangers associated with one such trend known as ""chroming."" Here's a detailed overview of the incident involving a 12-year-old boy and explores the dangerous practice of chroming , its popularity among youth, and the associated risks.Cesar Watson-King, a 12-year-old resident of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, experienced a life-threatening medical emergency linked to the chroming trend . On the day of the incident, Cesar inhaled a can of antiperspirant, which led to his sudden collapse. His mother, Nichola King, who had just finished breastfeeding her youngest child, heard a loud thump and rushed downstairs to investigate.Upon finding Cesar unconscious, Nichola's eldest son, Kaiden, immediately dialled 999 for emergency assistance. Nichola began performing CPR on Cesar while awaiting the arrival of paramedics. Cesar was transported to the hospital, where he was placed in a medically induced coma for two days due to experiencing multiple seizures and cardiac arrests. The seriousness of his condition underscores the extreme dangers associated with this trend.Chroming refers to the practice of inhaling volatile substances to achieve a short-term euphoric effect. The term originally derived from inhaling chrome-based paint, but it now encompasses a range of household and industrial solvents. According to the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, common substances used for chroming include:These substances are inhaled to induce a temporary high, which can have severe health repercussions.Despite its dangers, chroming has gained traction, particularly among younger individuals. The temporary euphoric effects produced by inhaling these substances make the practice appealing to some. According to the American Addiction Centers, chroming has become increasingly popular among Generation Z, especially those aged 16 to 24. The trend has been amplified by social media platforms, notably TikTok, where videos related to chroming, often tagged as ""Whiptok,"" have garnered millions of views.Chroming poses significant health risks, including but not limited to:The popularity of dangerous trends like chroming on social media platforms poses a growing concern. The viral nature of these trends often encourages imitation among young people, leading to increased risk and potential harm.","Chroming refers to the practice of inhaling volatile substances to achieve a short-term euphoric effect.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

""A Completely Broken Play"" - Travis Kelce's hysterical of the Mahomes behind the back pass

Travis Kelce Professes His Love for Taylor Swift During Kansas City Chiefs Panel | E! News

If it isn't all the Swifties looking for this.Swifties, it's time to stop being concerned for our queen and start looking on the bright side: Travis Kelce 's enormous net worth . While we are cheering on Taylor, let's be amazed at how well Kelce is doing in terms of money, and vice versa. It is pretty obvious that these stars are killing it, so why not celebrate them while “lovers” play in the background.Travis Kelce is a professional football player and one of the best tight ends to have ever played in the NFL.Born on October 5, 1989, in Westlake, Ohio, he currently plays for the Kansas City Chiefs , which drafted him during the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft. Kelce is a three-time Super Bowl champion and has been recognized as a nine-time Pro Bowler and a seven-time All-Pro, which has attested to his breathtaking performance on the field. He has also widely been covered in the media because of his romance with the pop star Taylor Swift and for being quite entertaining on the screen, which includes hosting the podcast ""New Heights"" with his brother Jason Kelce, who is also an NFL player . Kelce's reach extends beyond football to include the most iconic figures in American sports culture.Travis Kelce's net worth is within the range of $120 million to $130 million as of 2024, considering how well his successful NFL career and other endorsement partnerships are continuing to pay off. Still, other sources estimate his net worth at an approximate value of $70 million, reflecting some inaccuracies in these financial estimates.It was not until June of 2023 that Travis would finally say to Vanity Fair, ""My managers and agents love to tell me how underpaid I am"".""You see how much more money you could be making and, yeah, it hits you in the gut a little bit. It makes you think you're being taken advantage of.

"Pope urges end to Papua New Guinea tribal conflicts and fair, sustainable extraction of resources",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/pope-urges-end-to-papua-new-guinea-tribal-conflicts-and-fair-sustainable-extraction-of-resources/articleshow/113141237.cms,"PORT MORESBY: Pope Francis called Saturday for an end to tribal violence that has wracked Papua New Guinea for decades and appealed for sustainable, equitable development of its natural resources during a visit to the South Pacific nation.Dancers in swishing grass skirts performed for Francis as he opened his first full day in the country with a mix of political and church business.He met with the governor general and then addressed government authorities before visiting with the country's priests, nuns and street children.Francis is on an 11-day, four-nation tour through Southeast Asia and Oceania, the longest and most challenging of his pontificate. He landed on Friday evening in Port Moresby, the capital of the Commonwealth nation, from Jakarta, Indonesia to open the second leg of his journey.During his speech to government authorities and diplomats, Francis marveled at the diversity of the Papua New Guinea's people - there are some 800 languages spoken here - saying their variety must be ""a challenge to the Holy Spirit, who creates harmony amid differences!""But he also noted that such diversity has long created conflict here, a reference to the tribal violence over land and other disputes that have long characterized the country's culture but have grown lethal in recent years. Francis appealed for a sense of civic responsibility and cooperation to prevail, to benefit everyone.""It is my particular hope that tribal violence will come to an end, for it causes many victims, prevents people from living in peace and hinders development,"" he said.If people agree to sacrifice their personal interests for the common good, ""the necessary forces can be used to improve infrastructure, address the health and educational needs of the population and increase opportunities for dignified work,"" he said.The poor, strategically important Commonwealth nation is home to more than 10 million people, most of whom are subsistence farmers.In a related appeal, Francis also called for a ""definitive solution"" to the question of Bougainville, an island region whose people voted overwhelmingly to become independent from Papua New Guinea in 2019. The outcome of the nonbinding referendum has not been implemented.Francis also appealed for fair and environmentally sustainable extraction of country's vast natural resources, which include gold, nickel and natural gas. Disputes over how wealth should be distributed and who is entitled to mining royalties which have often led to conflicts.Francis has long insisted that development of natural resources must benefit local people, not just the multinational companies that extract them, and be pursued in an environmentally responsible way to preserve them for future generations.He made that argument again Saturday, saying Papua New Guinea's resources ""are destined by God for the entire community.""""Even if outside experts and large international companies must be involved in the harnessing of these resources, it is only right that the needs of local people are given due consideration when distributing the proceeds and employing workers,"" he said.""These environmental and cultural treasures represent at the same time a great responsibility, because they require everyone, civil authorities and all citizens, to promote initiatives that develop natural and human resources in a sustainable and equitable manner,"" he said.Later Saturday, Francis was visiting with charity workers who care for street children and then meeting with Papua New Guinea's clergy and religious sisters at a Marian sanctuary. On Sunday, he travels deep into the jungle to meet with Argentine missionaries.Francis is the second pope to visit Papua New Guinea, after St. John Paul II visited first in 1984, then in 1995 to beatify Peter To Rot, a Catholic layman who was declared a martyr for the faith after he died in prison during World War II.","Francis is on an 11-day, four-nation tour through Southeast Asia and Oceania, the longest and most challenging of his pontificate.

MUMBAI: Canada’s Express Entry draws that offer permanent residency to those selected are back with a bang after a considerable hiatus. In May 2024, there were just two draws and only one in the following month. Since then, the periodicity of the draws has picked up, as was the earlier norm. However, there is a marked shift with ‘General’ category rounds conspicuous by their absence.The writing was on the wall – way back in March, Canada’s immigration minister, Marc Miller had said, “…As part of our efforts for temporary residents to transition to permanent residency, we will have more domestic draws for us and ask provinces and territories taking part in the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) to do the same with their allocations.”In other words, it was clear that going forward the focus would be on PNP draws and Canadian Experience Class (CEC) draws which are for skilled workers who have Canadian work experience and want to become permanent residents - typically such individuals are already residing in Canada.An analysis of the draws in July and August clearly reflects this. The main reason was to reduce an additional inflow of new immigrants and thus mitigate the pressure on health care and housing.Express Entry is a system used by the Canadian government to manage applications from skilled and qualified workers for permanent residence (PR) through three economic immigration programs. These are the Federal Skilled Worker Program, Canadian Experience Class (CEC) and the Federal Skilled Trades Program.Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the country’s immigration agency, on its website explains the different types of draws that are held throughout the year.In each draw, aspiring candidates are ranked relative to each other based on a score under the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). Those who meet the cut-off score are sent an invitation to apply and become permanent residents. A permanent residency is akin to a green card in the USA and offers a future path to Canadian citizenship.The CRS score is divided into two sections. The core score can reach a maximum of 600 points and is based on the candidate’s age, education, official language proficiency, work experience etc. Second, a maximum of 600 points are awarded to the candidates if they meet policy or other objectives such as: having a provincial nomination, a qualifying offer of arranged employment, Canadian educational credentials, French-language proficiency or a sibling in Canada.Candidates that receive an invitation to apply have 60 days to either decline the invitation or submit an online application for permanent residence to IRCC. After a due process, applicants and their accompanying family members become permanent residents.Here is an analysis of the draws held during the past two months.Immigration experts point out that the cut off scores, except for category based draws be it - French proficiency draws or occupation-related draws, continue to remain high (above 500 points). Recently, IRCC also announced a pilot that offers a direct pathway to permanent residency to Francophone (French speaking) students.Those already in Canada now appear to have a better chance to become permanent residents under the Express Entry mechanism.","Canada’s Express Entry draws that offer permanent residency to those selected are back with a bang after a considerable hiatus.

The world of billionaires offers a sharp contrast. Many of the youngest billionaires inherited their wealth from their parents, whereas older generations frequently established their fortunes through their own efforts. Nonetheless, a few young billionaires have conquered the obstacles of entrepreneurship and innovation. Their success tales are characterised by perseverance, resilience, and the ability to seize opportunities.Regardless of how they become wealthy, today's young billionaires are not only constructing empires, but also shaping the future. Their tales show that with passion and determination, dreams can become reality.Let's examine the world's top 10 youngest billionaires and how they earned their incredible fortunes.Clemente Del Vecchio is the second youngest billionaire on the list. He inherited a 12.5% stake in the Luxembourg-based holding company Delfin from his late father, Leonardo Del Vecchio, who was the chairman of EssilorLuxottica until his death in 2022. Delfin's assets include shares in EssilorLuxottica, insurer Generali, and banks like Mediobanca and UniCredit. Despite inheriting this fortune, Clemente is passionate about science and technology and aims to pursue higher education in these fields.Kim Jung-youn and her sister, Jung-min, hold around 18% of NXC, the largest shareholder in the online gaming company Nexon. Their shares were inherited from their late father, Kim Jung-ju, who founded Nexon in 1994 and passed away in February 2022. Both sisters are not involved in Nexon's daily operations and prefer to maintain a low profile.Livia Voigt is a major shareholder in WEG, the leading electrical motor manufacturer in Latin America. Her grandfather, Werner Ricardo Voigt, co-founded WEG along with other prominent figures. Despite being the largest individual shareholder, Livia remains a university student and does not hold an executive role at the company.Kevin David Lehmann owns a 50% stake in Germany's drugstore chain, dm (Drogerie Markt), which generates about $14 billion in annual revenue. The chain was founded in 1973, and Lehmann's father, Guenther, invested in dm in 1974, later transferring his 50% stake to Kevin David in 2017. Kevin David and his father have kept a low profile and are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the company.Luca Del Vecchio is one of the six children of the late Leonardo Del Vecchio. He inherited a 12.5% stake in Delfin from his father, alongside his brother Clemente. Delfin's portfolio includes shares in EssilorLuxottica, Generali, Mediobanca, UniCredit, and Covivio. Unlike Clemente, Luca is actively involved as the Chief Strategy Officer at Delfin.Kim Jung-min, the sister of Jung-youn, ranks fourth among the youngest billionaires. Both sisters together hold about 31% of NXC, which is the largest shareholder in Nexon. Like her sister, Kim Jung-min maintains a private life and does not participate in Nexon’s daily operations.Remi Dassault is part of the Dassault family, known for founding Dassault Aviation, an aerospace company with origins in World War I. His father, Olivier Dassault, was a notable French politician who passed away in 2021. The Dassault family also owns vineyards, a private aviation company, and the newspaper Le Figaro.Zahan Mistry inherited an 18.4% stake in Tata Sons following the death of his father, Cyrus Mistry, in 2022. He is actively involved in the family’s construction empire and holds a 25% stake in Shapoorji Pallonji Group, which is planning to list Afcons Infrastructure for $850 million as part of its debt reduction strategy.Dora Voigt de Assis, Livia Voigt's older sister, is also a significant shareholder in WEG, the leading electrical motor manufacturer in Latin America. Dora graduated from architecture college in 2020 and, like her sister, does not hold any executive position at WEG.Firoz Mistry, Zahan Mistry's elder brother, inherited a portion of the family's 18.4% stake in Tata Sons following their father’s death. He pursued his education at the University of Warwick and is known for his business acumen and strategic insight. Firoz holds a 25% stake in Shapoorji Pallonji Group.","Clemente Del Vecchio is the second youngest billionaire on the list.

Boeing Starliner heads back home without any astronauts onboard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boeings-starliner-heads-back-home-without-any-astronauts-onboard/articleshow/113141292.cms,"Boeing 's Starliner capsule, after a period of uncertainty about its safety, left the International Space Station on Friday to Earth without its crew. The two NASA test pilots, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will remain at the space station until next year.The Starliner capsule undocked 260 miles (420 kilometers) over China, with springs gently pushing it away from the orbiting laboratory.The return flight was expected to take six hours, with a nighttime landing in the New Mexico desert.""She's on her way home,"" astronaut Suni Williams radioed after Starliner exited.Williams and Wilmore were supposed to fly Starliner back to Earth in June, a week after launching in it. However, thruster failures and helium leaks compromised their ride to the space station.Nasa then decided it was too risky for them to return on Starliner, which led to the fully automated capsule departing with empty seats and blue spacesuits, along with some old station equipment. SpaceX will bring the duo back in late February, extending their original eight-day mission to more than eight months.""A minute after separating from the space station, Starliner's thrusters could be seen firing as the white, blue-trimmed capsule slowly backed away. Nasa Mission Control called it a 'perfect' departure.""Following the undocking, flight controllers planned additional test firings of the capsule's thrusters.Engineers believe that the more the thrusters are fired, the hotter they become, causing the protective seals to swell and obstruct the flow of propellant. Unfortunately, they won't be able to examine any of the parts, as the section containing the thrusters will be discarded just before reentry.Following the June 5 launch, Starliner's propulsion system experienced a small helium leak, which was initially thought to be isolated. However, four additional leaks emerged after liftoff, and five thrusters failed. Although four of the thrusters were recovered, Nasa expressed concern about potential malfunctions that could hinder the capsule's descent from orbit.Over the summer, Boeing conducted extensive thruster tests both in space and on the ground, and was confident that Starliner could safely return Wilmore and Williams to Earth. However, NASA had a different opinion and decided to go with SpaceX instead.As experienced astronauts and retired Navy captains, Wilmore and Williams anticipated challenges on the test flight. They have kept busy in space, assisting with repairs and experiments. The two are now full-time station crew members, joining the seven others on board.Boeing's first astronaut flight marks the end of a journey filled with delays and setbacks. After the space shuttles retired more than a decade ago, Nasa contracted Boeing and SpaceX for orbital taxi service. Boeing encountered numerous problems on its first uncrewed test flight in 2019, requiring a repeat mission. The 2022 do-over revealed even more flaws, with the repair bill exceeding $1 billion.Steve Stich, Nasa's commercial crew program manager, stated earlier this week that teams have been so focused on Starliner's return that they haven't had time to consider what's next for Boeing. He emphasized that NASA remains committed to having two competing U.S. companies transporting astronauts.","Boeing's Starliner capsule left the International Space Station on Friday to return to Earth without its crew.

3 die amid outbreak of legionnaires' disease at an assisted living home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/3-die-amid-outbreak-of-legionnaires-disease-at-an-assisted-living-home/articleshow/113141528.cms,"Three people who tested positive for Legionnaires' disease have died amid an outbreak at an assisted living home in Albany , New York, that sickened at least seven others, officials said on Friday.The deaths came amid what Maribeth Miller, the interim Albany County health commissioner, described in an email as a ""cluster"" of Legionnaires' cases at the Peregrine Senior Living at Shaker home that officials had learned of Aug.30.Water samples from the home showed the presence of Legionella bacteria , which causes the disease, Miller wrote. She said the county Health Department had placed certain restrictions on water use at the home while more tests were conducted. Water filters have been installed on some showers and sinks so residents can still use bathrooms, she added.""There is no threat to the community at large,"" Miller wrote.Kristyn Ganim, the home's executive director, said employees had been working with health officials to address the outbreak. In addition to installing filters across the water treatment system, she said, staff members were providing residents with bottled water.""I want to reassure all of our residents, staff and visitors that our community is completely safe,"" she said in a statement.Legionella bacteria occurs naturally in water, and people typically contract Legionnaires' disease by inhaling mists or water vapor containing the bacteria, according to the state Health Department. The bacteria can grow in poorly maintained industrial water systems; cooling towers; or heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.People 50 and older and those who have compromised immune systems are at particular risk of contracting the disease, according to the state Health Department. Symptoms, which usually begin two to 10 days after exposure to the bacteria, include fever, headaches, muscle aches, coughing and shortness of breath.Most cases can be successfully treated with antibiotics, but about 1 in 10 people who contract the disease die, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 1 in 4 of those who contract it at a health care facility die.Mary Rozak, a spokesperson for the Albany County executive, Daniel McCoy, said that 25 people linked to the 171-bed home had been hospitalized in connection with the outbreak. Ten tested positive, including the three who died, she said. About nine others tested negative; the rest reported symptoms but were not tested.Of the three people who died, Rozak said, two had been hospitalized for treatment of other ailments, and it was unclear whether Legionnaires' disease had killed them.The Legionella bacteria was first discovered through an outbreak connected to an American Legion convention in Philadelphia in 1976. There are about 6,000 documented cases of the disease a year in the United States, according to the safety and health administration, and 200 to 800 in New York, according to the state Health Department. The figures may understate the true number of cases because many infections go undiagnosed or unreported, officials say.The number of reported cases of Legionnaires' disease has been on the rise since the early 2000s and peaked in 2018, CDC data shows. The number of cases dropped when the COVID-19 pandemic began but started to creep up again in 2021, according to the data.There have been several outbreaks in New York City over the past decade, including one that killed five people at a Manhattan nursing home in 2022 and another in 2015 that caused 16 deaths and was linked to a cooling tower in the Bronx.","The deaths came amid a ""cluster"" of Legionnaires' cases at a New York assisted living home.

"US reports first bird flu case without animal exposure, sparks public health alert",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-reports-first-bird-flu-case-without-animal-exposure-sparks-public-health-alert/articleshow/113141201.cms,"A Missouri resident has become the first person in the United States to contract avian influenza without any known exposure to infected animals, authorities confirmed on Friday. This rare case marks a significant shift in the patterns of infection, as all previous US cases have involved contact with farm animals or contaminated environments.The patient, an adult with pre-existing health conditions, was hospitalized on August 22 after testing positive for a suspicious strain of the flu.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, the individual was treated with antiviral medication, made a full recovery, and was discharged from the hospital shortly after.Initial tests indicated an unusual flu strain, prompting further investigation at both state and federal laboratories. These tests confirmed the presence of the H5 virus, commonly known as avian or bird flu. This case brings the total number of bird flu cases in the US to 14 this year, but it stands out as the first instance of a human infection without direct animal contact.Missouri health officials have stressed that no H5 infections have been detected in dairy cattle within the state, although some cases have been reported among wild birds and in commercial or backyard poultry flocks. Historically, bird flu has primarily affected farmworkers or those in close proximity to livestock. The first US case of bird flu in a human was reported in 2022, also involving a farmworker.While avian flu is usually confined to wild birds and poultry, recent outbreaks have been reported in mammals, including cattle. This year has seen a significant number of cattle infections across the country.The CDC maintains that the risk to the general public remains low, but they warn that this could change quickly as more information becomes available. ""Although human infections are rare, circumstances may evolve as we learn more about this case,"" the agency said in a statement.In the past, sporadic human infections have been recorded without a clear link to animals. However, the CDC emphasizes that there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission—a critical factor that could dramatically raise the threat level of the virus.Although most previous cases in the US have been mild and involved healthy farmworkers, the broader population, especially those with pre-existing health conditions, could be at greater risk for severe illness. Globally, the mortality rate for confirmed bird flu cases hovers around 50%, though experts believe many mild cases likely go undetected.","A Missouri resident has become the first person in the United States to contract avian influenza without any known exposure to infected animals.

Brazilian plane crash report: Ice buildup and de-icing failures under scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/brazilian-plane-crash-report-ice-buildup-and-de-icing-failures-under-scrutiny/articleshow/113140940.cms,"A preliminary report on last month's tragic plane crash in Brazil , which claimed the lives of all 62 passengers and crew, reveals a troubling issue with the aircraft’s de-icing system. Published on Friday, the report suggests that ice formation on the plane’s wings and a malfunctioning de-icing system could have significantly contributed to the disaster.Investigators have been cautious not to definitively link ice buildup to the crash, emphasizing that their work is ongoing. However, the report adds weight to the prevailing theory among aviation experts that ice formation and the de-icing system’s failure played a crucial role, reported AP.On August 9, the Voepass flight, an ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop, took off from Cascavel, Paraná, heading to São Paulo’s Guarulhos International Airport. The plane crashed into a residential area in Vinhedo, about 80 kilometers northwest of São Paulo, just minutes after reporting issues with ice accumulation.Cockpit voice recorder data reveals that pilots were concerned about ice buildup, with the copilot noting, ""A lot of ice,"" just two minutes before the crash. The plane’s data recorder showed that the de-icing system, which is manually controlled by the pilots, repeatedly cycled on and off, suggesting it was activated but may not have functioned properly.Carlos Henrique Baldin, head of the investigation division at Brazil’s Air Force Center for the Investigation and Prevention of Air Accidents (Cenipa), stressed that while ice formation seems to be a significant factor, ""there are still many doubts."" The report also highlights that the aircraft was equipped with protection equipment that should have prevented such an incident.Henrique Hacklaender, president of the national aviators' union, noted that while the de-icing system was engaged, it remains unclear whether it was effectively utilized. ""Based on the preliminary report, it isn’t possible to conclusively affirm that ice on the wings caused the accident, but there are indications it was a significant contributing factor,"" Hacklaender told The Associated Press.The investigation, which is also being reviewed by the Federal Police, is ongoing with no set deadline for completion. The ATR 72, produced by the French-Italian company ATR, has been involved in several fatal accidents over the years, including a similar crash in Nepal in January 2023.As the probe continues, the aviation community and the victims' families await further clarity on the cause of this devastating crash.","A preliminary report on last month's tragic plane crash in Brazil reveals a troubling issue with the aircraft's de-icing system.

How Elon Musk is influencing Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-elon-musk-is-influencing-donald-trump/articleshow/113140885.cms,"In a livestreamed conversation on his social platform X with former President Donald Trump last month, Elon Musk raised the idea of a "" government efficiency commission ."" Such a council could ensure that taxpayers' money was ""spent in a good way,"" Musk said during their more-than-two-hour talk.""I'd love it,"" Trump said.On Thursday, Trump followed up on Musk's suggestion.In a speech at the Economic Club of New York, Trump said he planned to appoint Musk, who leads Tesla , SpaceX and X, as the head of a new government efficiency commission if he was elected president in November.The commission would audit the ""entire federal government"" and ""make recommendations for drastic reforms,"" Trump said.The announcement capped weeks of discussions between Trump and Musk, who have bonded over a mutual hobbyhorse of eliminating wasteful spending, three people close to the men said. Trump has told Musk that he wants the tech entrepreneur to slash the federal government's costs, just as he did at X, one of the people said.Musk, the world's richest man, has started to influence Trump as the Republican presidential nominee heads into November's election. That the tech mogul has the ear of the candidate throws open what each can get out of an alliance -- and creates a potential minefield. Their political friendship is particularly tricky because Musk has a sprawling set of businesses, which may present conflicts of interest if Trump is elected.Notably, Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, and his electric automaker, Tesla, have received billions of dollars in federal contracts and subsidies. Musk and some of his companies are also under scrutiny for various infractions from federal agencies including the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.""The conflict-of-interest issue is one of the more obvious concerns in this appointment, with SpaceX having government contracts and Tesla benefiting from federal tax credits,"" said Ann Skeet, a senior director at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. ""That's just what happens if Musk is in a position of power in a government agency.""Musk, 53, has wooed right-wing world leaders before to benefit himself and his companies. In Brazil, he became close with then-President Jair Bolsonaro as he sought advantages for SpaceX. Musk also ardently supports President Javier Milei of Argentina, a country with abundant deposits of lithium, a mineral used in Tesla's car batteries. Milei has promised to cut government spending and encourage mining operations.Musk, who endorsed Trump for the presidency in July, did not respond to a request for comment. Before Trump's speech Thursday, Musk posted on X: ""I look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises. No pay, no title, no recognition is needed.""Brian Hughes, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement, ""Elon Musk has dedicated himself to America's future by offering to serve with President Trump to ensure our government works more efficiently and uses America's taxpayer dollars effectively."" He added that Trump, 78, was ""committed to having Mr. Musk lead this commission to analyze the functionality of our government.""Musk has long used his account on X, where he has nearly 197 million followers, to push his political views. In recent weeks, he has posted messages excoriating the Biden administration's policies on government spending and criticizing the campaign promises of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.Some of his posts have become more erratic. On Sunday, Musk endorsed a post that suggested that women did not have the ability for critical thought and should not participate in government or democracy. On Monday, he shared an artificial intelligence-generated image of Harris dressed as a communist.Musk has also posted about spending cuts. He has expressed concerns over what he views as wasteful costs at his businesses, including at X, where he slashed more than 75% of the workforce in 2022 and 2023. X's market valuation has dropped more than 55% since Musk bought the company in 2022, as advertisers have shied from the platform.""Government spending is driving America to bankruptcy,"" Musk posted on X on Thursday.Musk and Trump were not always fans of each other. Musk previously said Trump should ""sail into the sunset"" and instead supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Trump once used an expletive to describe Musk as a phony.But their political relationship was kindled with a meeting in March in Palm Beach, Florida, as Trump sought cash infusions for his campaign. Around then, Musk also told a friend that he wanted to keep his support for Trump quiet while backing him financially, the friend recalled.Musk has since abandoned that caution. Over the spring, he seeded a pro-Trump super political action committee and planned to put as much as $180 million into the group. He also recruited some of his friends, such as tech investor Joe Lonsdale, to front some of the early money for the PAC, which planned to do field organizing for Trump.But the foray has not been smooth. Musk hired a team for the PAC that he met through Texas politics, but fired them after about two months, replacing them with national political operatives who had worked for DeSantis. Thousands of field organizers were affected by the switch.Musk has since hired a top Republican political operative, Chris Young, to personally advise him on how to grow more sophisticated in his political work.In June, at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting, Musk said he and Trump had been speaking. ""I have had some conversations with him, and he does call me out of the blue for no reason,"" Musk said.After an assassination attempt against Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July, Musk decided to publicly speak up about his support for the Republican candidate.""I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,"" Musk wrote on X. He later posted a photograph of Trump moments after the assassination attempt and added: ""Last time America had a candidate this tough was Theodore Roosevelt.""During their conversation on X last month, Trump called Musk ""the greatest cutter"" and praised him for firing employees who wanted to strike. In a podcast appearance a few weeks later, Trump called Musk a ""brilliant guy"" who could be a consultant to his administration ""involved in cutting some of the fat.""On Thursday, Trump provided few details of what an efficiency commission would do, but he said ""fraud and improper payments"" had cost taxpayers ""hundreds of billions of dollars."" He did not say if Musk planned to divest from or take time off from his companies for the role, should it come to pass.""As the first order of business, this commission will develop an action plan to totally eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months, saving trillions of dollars,"" Trump said, without providing any evidence.","Trump says he will appoint Musk to head a government efficiency commission. The commission would audit the ""entire federal government"" and ""make recommendations for drastic reforms"" The tech mogul has a sprawling set of businesses, which may present conflicts of interest if Trump is elected.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113140935,imgsize-1406078,width-400,resizemode-4/113140935.jpg"
