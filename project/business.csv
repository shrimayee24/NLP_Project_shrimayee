"AAP's poll anthem a Kejriwal eulogy, veiled dig at LG & BJP",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aaps-poll-anthem-a-kejriwal-eulogy-veiled-dig-at-lg-bjp/articleshow/117037753.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid cheers of ""Aam Aadmi Party, zindabad"" and lively dance moves among the crowd, party national convener Arvind Kejriwal launched his outfit's election anthem on Tuesday.Titled 'Fir Layenge Kejriwal,' the song combines an upbeat, danceable melody with lyrics showcasing the party's significant achievements in Delhi.The song, part-eulogy to Kejriwal as well as a pointer to all the popular schemes that Delhi govt implemented, subtly touches on the all-season tussle between the govt and the lieutenant governor's office. ""Unke roke ye nahi rukta, chalta rehta apni chaal. Saamne wale shor machaye, karle chahe jitna bawal (He doesn't stop when they try to halt him. He keeps moving forward, undeterred by the noise and chaos),"" it says.The song also targets opposition parties, accusing them of spreading misinformation. It portrays Kejriwal as a leader who overcomes obstacles to work for the people.At the launch, Kejriwal said, ""For months, I've got calls asking me when the song will be released. Here it is, dedicated to the people of this country. Enjoy it, dance to it and play it in weddings and celebrations.""In a veiled dig at BJP, he added: ""There's a political party in this country that thrives on abuse and insults. I'm sure its leader will also appreciate this song. If he wishes, he can listen to it in the privacy of his own home and enjoy it. No one is watching.""The song highlights Delhi govt's key initiatives such as free electricity and water, and improvements in health and education infrastructure. It features visuals of completed projects, such as roads, schools and flyovers. The lyrics proclaim: ""Dilli ke janta ke kaam karta hai, bas apna Kejriwal. Dilli mein bijli-paani muft rakhta hai, bas apna Kejriwal. (Only Kejriwal works for the people of Delhi. Only Kejriwal keeps electricity and water free in Delhi).""The video shows Kejriwal addressing rallies, leading roadshows and engaging with supporters, alongside clips of him stepping out of Tihar Jail last Sept. It also shows common people singing, dancing and celebrating.The anthem also outlines AAP's promises, including a proposal to provide a monthly allowance of Rs 2,100 to women and free medical treatment to the elderly. ""Beheno ko 2,100 bhi bhejega woh. Buzurgo ko free me ilaaj dega firse. (He will send Rs 2,100 to women and once again provide free treatment to the elderly),"" the song says.Kejriwal, announcing the Rs 2,100 scheme in Dec, described himself as a ""magician"" of finances, asserting that he knows how to save money to fund such programmes. The song calls him a magician. ""Jaadugar hai. Jaadu karta hai (He is a magician, he performs magic),"" it says about the AAP chief.The event was attended by chief minister Atishi, former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and MLA Gopal Rai. Delhi health minister Saurabh Bharadwaj reminisced about the success of previous campaign songs, ""When we released 'Paanch Saal Kejriwal' in 2015, it quickly became a favourite at weddings and other social events. I'm confident this new anthem will have a similar impact.""","'Fir Layenge Kejriwal' is part-eulogy to Arvind Kejriwal and pointer to Delhi govt's schemes. The song portrays Kejriwal as a leader who overcomes obstacles to work for the people. The video shows Kejriwal addressing rallies, leading roadshows and engaging with supporters.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117037762,imgsize-1643289,width-400,resizemode-4/117037762.jpg"
5 years of turmoil after dream run: Govt faced 'corruption' charges and LG kept pot boiling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5-years-of-turmoil-after-dream-run-govt-faced-corruption-charges-and-lg-kept-pot-boiling/articleshow/117037681.cms,"NEW DELHI: Since the 2020 assembly polls, when Aam Aadmi Party trampled upon the opposition with a massive mandate to govern Delhi for the second consecutive term by winning 62 of the 70 seats, a lot of water has flown under Loha Pul.The image of the ruling party, which was formed on the anti-corruption plank, has since taken a severe beating and it struggles with charges of bribery and financial irregularities. AAP 's top leadership, including supremo Arvind Kejriwal and his lieutenant Manish Sisodia, spent lengthy periods in jail, directly impacting the city's governance which led to an erosion in civic amenities.On the other side, the BJP-led central govt wrested control of services - matters of bureaucracy, including posting and transfer of officials - by enacting a new law and appointed a lieutenant governor in May 2022 who has refused to remain a constitutional head or a mere rubber stamp for the state govt. He has been proactive in actual governance, regularly conducting meetings not only with officials of agencies that fall under his direct jurisdiction but also with the heads of the departments controlled by the elected dispensation. This has led to unending wrangling and trading of barbs between LG VK Saxena and AAP govt.After a 49-day stint in govt with the outside support of Congress in 2013-14 followed by a year-long President's rule in Delhi, AAP created a record by winning 67 of the 70 assembly seats in 2015. The 'Delhi model' of governance largely centred on improvement of city schools, mohalla clinics and free electricity and water to everyone consuming them within a capped amount. With a reputation of ""fulfilling"" most of the electoral promises it made and running a largely untainted govt, AAP contested its third election in 2020 and was re-elected with a drop of just 1% in vote share - from 54.6% in 2015 to 53.6% - and five fewer seats than in the previous term.The 2020 assembly polls were held amid vociferous protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill - which later became a law - the nerve centre being the Muslim-dominated Shaheen Bagh in southeast Delhi's Okhla. The consolidation of votes this caused helped AAP emerge the victor. It got a huge mandate and validation of the masses, but its fortune started changing within a year. The first was the denting of the image of an ""honest"" dispensation. Starting with the allegations of irregularities in formulation and implementation of now-withdrawn Delhi excise policy to allegedly benefit a particular liquor cartel, the party has faced a flurry of corruption charges in the last three years or so. Nobody had imagined that Kejriwal, idolised by the people for his honesty, would go to jail on corruption charges. The renovation and furnishing of the chief minister residence at 6 Flagstaff Road in north Delhi's Civil Lines, allegedly at an extravagant cost, has further tarnished the kattar imandaar image.The 2020 election was held when the Municipal Corporation of Delhi - which is responsible for basic civic amenities such as sanitation and internal roads - was under the control of BJP. The saffron party was constantly attacked by AAP on civic issues and its ""mis-governance"" was cited as an example of the administrative (in)capability to govern. The tide turned in 2022 with AAP winning the municipal polls. The civic condition of the city hasn't changed much since then. In fact, the intractable power struggle in the municipal body has caused a paralysis of action. Two years later, AAP will be judged for its performance in MCD, especially on the stalemate in the formation of the standing committee, which decides all the important capital-intensive projects.In the last 30 months or so, several inquiries ordered by LG into projects under the direct control of the elected govt have irretrievably soured his relationship with AAP functionaries and provided BJP with ammunition to attack them during the assembly polls. Many big names in the party, including three ministers - Kailash Gahlot, Raaj Kumar Anand and Rajendra Pal Gautam - exited AAP, alleging involvement in corruption and little being done for the scheduled castes.The enactment of the new law that gave LG control of bureaucracy too came as a stumbling block for Delhi govt. Though they work for the elected govt, bureaucrats know it is LG who has the power to decide their transfer and posting and appraise their performance. Their loyalties, therefore, have accordingly shifted. Never earlier had senior bureaucrats held press conferences against their own ministers or made confidential communication public.""This had serious repercussions for the functioning of our govt,"" a senior AAP functionary confided. ""Several projects that we wanted to implement faced obstructions in the absence of bureaucratic support. The registration of corruption cases against our leaders and their imprisonment also had a direct impact on governance."" The functionary, however, remained optimistic. ""The electorate is fully aware that AAP was hobbled from working fully all these years,"" he claimed.The arrest of Kejriwal in the excise policy case in March last year led to a near collapse of the governance in the city. He continued to remain CM while incarcerated, thus incapacitating govt from taking major decisions. The restriction on signing files and entering the Delhi secretariat imposed on him by the Supreme Court while granting him bail forced Kejriwal to hand over the baton to Atishi in Sept. While AAP is still projecting him as the incoming CM, the question remains whether Kejriwal will be able to take up helmsmanship if AAP is re-elected in view of the bail order. Though there has been no change in the legal position since then, AAP insists that he can.Taking a critical look at governance in the last few years, Chandrachur Singh, associate professor of political science at Delhi University's Hindu College, said Kejriwal, who stood for ""ideal"" politics for a decade, was now being made to answer questions about probity in public life. ""Kejriwal's political journey so far has proved that idealism and politics are two totally different aspects. People have started to think that somebody who entered politics to cleanse it himself got enmeshed in it. He had the potential to become a pan-India leader had he taken governance more seriously,"" said Singh.Ravi Ranjan , a professor of political science at DU's Zakir Husain College, said the situation isn't as clear cut this year as it was in 2020. ""AAP has tried to convince the electorate of the obstructionist stances of LG and BJP in delivery of projects, and so the voters of unauthorised and JJ colonies may continue to support Kejriwal. Those who are opposed to the saffron ideology may not consider Congress strong enough to counter BJP,"" he said. ""Yet, the arrests of AAP's stalwarts and failure in delivery, in particular health and education infrastructure, could give BJP the edge, provided that party puts up the right candidates and its campaigners desist from barbs at women, minorities and marginalised sections.""","The image of the ruling party, which was formed on the anti-corruption plank, has since taken a severe beating. AAP's top leadership, including supremo Arvind Kejriwal and his lieutenant Manish Sisodia, spent lengthy periods in jail, directly impacting the city's governance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117037702,imgsize-1446708,width-400,resizemode-4/117037702.jpg"
"8 lakh voters added in past five years, but electorate shrank in 14 constituencies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/8-lakh-voters-added-in-past-five-years-but-electorate-shrank-in-14-constituencies/articleshow/117037609.cms,"NEW DELHI: The number of voters in the capital increased by nearly eight lakh since the last assembly polls, but the electorate shrank in 14 constituencies in the past five years.An analysis of the electoral data provided by the office of the chief electoral officer of Delhi revealed that between the 2020 assembly polls and the final data published Monday, the number of voters increased by over 5% while it surged by more than 10 percentage points in the preceding state assembly elections.Among the major constituencies that witnessed a fall in the numbers were Delhi Cantonment, New Delhi, Rajendra Nagar, RK Puram and Laxmi Nagar.In Delhi Cantonment, the number of voters dropped from almost 1.3 lakh in 2020 to 78,893 in 2025, making it the smallest assembly constituency in the capital, and registering the highest decline of 50,445 votes (39%). In New Delhi constituency, over 1.4 lakh voters were enrolled in 2020, which dipped to less than 1.1 lakh in 2025 - a decline of 36,879 electors (25.3%).Constituencies with a significant increase in numbers included Bawana, which saw a surge of 62,413 voters (19.5%) - from less than 3.2 lakh in 2020 to over 3.8 lakh in 2025 - followed by Vikaspuri, Burari, Kirari and Okhla. The increase in Vikaspuri was recorded at 59,863 (14.8%), in Burari 58,574 (16.2%), in Kirari 45,310 (16.5%) and in Okhla 44,432 (13.2%).According to experts, the increase in the number of voters was registered more in constituencies in Outer Delhi, which have a large migrant population and where a lot of land is still available for new habitations to come up.""All constituencies that saw double-digit growth are those where the migrant population settles down,"" said Chattar Singh, who was associated with Congress for over five decades and now analyses election data independently.""Constituencies like Delhi Cantt, New Delhi and RK Puram, where the number of electors has dipped, are govt housing colonies. In New Delhi constituency, govt demolished a large number of flats in areas such as Sarojini Nagar, Kidwai Nagar and Laxmi Bai Nagar, to build highrise general pool residential accommodation, and thousands of families moved out,"" Singh said, adding, ""Similar is the case with RK Puram and Delhi Cantt, where number of govt employees seeking housing reduced.""Interestingly, the population in land-locked constituencies grew in single digits, indicating there was little scope for new families to settle here. In fact, residential areas have shrunk in the past few years due to massive commercialisation, resulting in either negative or marginal growth of electors.Voter percentage grew by just 0.4% in Chandni Chowk, and only marginally in Madipur (0.7%), Tilak Nagar (1%) and Jangpura (1%).Of the 12 reserved constituencies for Scheduled Castes, only Bawana witnessed a huge growth. Madipur (0.7%), Gokalpur (1.7%), Patel Nagar (1.8%) and Ambedkar Nagar (3.3%) saw below-average surges in the number of voters Mangolpuri (0.2%) and Trilokpuri (4.6%) saw a decline.Except Okhla, most Muslim-dominated constituencies also registered a below-average rise in the number of electors.""Overall, between 2008 and 2013, the number of voters increased by 10.1%. The rise was 11.1% between 2015 and 2020. However, it is just about 5% between 2020 and 2025. I don't know if it is natural or a deliberate one,"" said Singh.In central Delhi, Model Town (5.7%), Sadar Bazar (5.3%) and Ballimaran (8.1%) saw a modest rise in the number of electors in the past five years.","The number of voters in the capital increased by nearly eight lakh since the last assembly polls. But the electorate shrank in 14 constituencies in the past five years. Bawana saw a surge of 62,413 voters (19.5%) - from less than 3.2 lakh in 2020 to over 3.8 lakh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117037655,imgsize-44410,width-400,resizemode-4/117037655.jpg"
Delhi elections: Can talking points dictate voter choice?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-elections-can-talking-points-dictate-voter-choice/articleshow/117037564.cms,"Freebies

NEW DELHI: Few can predict voter behaviour with any certainty and political analysts and psephologists will not disagree. The capital has shown quite resolutely over the years that it can live with the Centre-state dichotomy and all issues - howsoever stark and emotive - may not be of consequence to all individuals. A cumulative effect of all the issues can set a narrative but overriding factors can come into play when one casts the vote. As the city heads for possibly the most bitterly fought elections in its history, TOI looks at the issues that could weigh on the voters' mind.If there is one issue that AAP is counting on for swaying the electorate, it is that of freebies or 'revdis', depending on which side of the political divide you stand. The bureaucracy has been raising the red flag, warning about depletion of the exchequer, but freebies have in a way been the centrepiece of the Arvind Kejriwal govt's welfare measures. These include free power for households consuming up to 200 units per month, free water up to 20,000 litres and free bus rides for women. The govt also provides free pilgrimage for the elderly, financial aid to students and healthcare services through mohalla clinics and hospitals. It has also promised Rs 1,000 per month under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana, with plans to eventually increase it to Rs 2,100 if the party returns to power. The underprivileged, bulwark of AAP's support base, see this bouquet of freebies as their lifeline, a fact being gradually acknowledged by the opposition. Congress has promised Rs 2,500 for women and BJP may be mulling such a scheme.BJP's biggest success in trying to make a comeback in the capital has been that it has gradually chipped away at the image of AAP and its founder, Arvind Kejriwal, as being ""kattar imandar"". Honesty and transparency have been the calling cards of AAP, a party forged in the crucible of Anna Hazare's anti-corruption agitation. The exigencies of running a govt has forced the party to make ideological compromises, but the plethora of cases slapped on AAP's ministers and other functionaries has dented its image. The alleged excise policy scam landed their leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia, in jail and they were later let out on bail. The LG, too, has ordered a series of inquiries. Earlier, former health minister Satyendar Jain was arrested on money laundering charges. AAP has countered with its own charge of ""persecution"". However, the allegedly extravagant expenditure on renovating the CM's house has given BJP and Congress an opportunity to target AAP with charges of reckless financial spending and even graft. ""Sheesh Mahal"" is both a taunt and a potent image that AAP will have to counter convincingly.Delhi has the dubious distinction of being one of the cities in the world which have the worst air quality. It has been gasping every winter, surviving on emergency measures but unable to come up with long-term solutions because of a virtual policy paralysis. Its poisonous air contains high levels of PM2.5 and PM10, the primary concerns, besides SOx, NOx and Ozone. People expected an AAP govt in Punjab to eradicate stubble burning but that hope has been belied. Those who have the resources are relocating but most have no choice. Children on inhalers is now a common sight. Meanwhile, former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's promise in 2021 to clean the Yamuna by February 2025 and take a dip in it remains unfulfilled. The river's most polluted stretch, running for over 20km through Delhi, was found to have the worst quality metrics in four years during December 2024, with faecal coliform levels reaching 8.4 million units as against a permissible limit of 2500 units. In fact, the foam on its surface has become the photographer's wicked delight.Some attribute it to AAP's misgovernance and others to LG's interference over the past few years which stalled developmental work, but no one disputes the fact that the civic infrastructure in Delhi has suffered degradation like never before. In fact, the condition of roads is a daily reminder to people of the poor quality of life in the city. Despite repeated promises by the state govt of a 'pothole-free city', including a recent October announcement by chief minister Atishi, roads remain bumpy. In 2023, the then CM Arvind Kejriwal had introduced a comprehensive decade-long road maintenance initiative which was opposed by MCD, also under AAP, citing jurisdiction over road sanitation. The project remains unimplemented. A June 2023 amendment to Mukhyamantri Sadak Punarnirman Yojana guidelines, which enabled councillors, along with MLAs and urban development minister to allocate road development funds, has shown no tangible improvements. The decision to transfer major drainage systems to the irrigation and flood control department last year, aimed at preventing severe flooding which erodes the road surface, remains incomplete.A rise in incidents of gang wars and gangsters targeting businessmen and even small traders for extortion - often brazenly shooting at business outlets - has caused unease in the city. Lawrence Bishnoi, Himanshu Bhau, Kapil Nandu and other criminals have suddenly acquired notoriety. The Centre intervened, with Union home minister Amit Shah sending a stern message to Delhi Police in November last year. The cops have also failed to curb the frequent bomb threats sent to city schools, which have disrupted the academic calendar. Hospitals and IGI Airport were also targeted but the menacing calls have disturbed children and the parents the most.","Freebies have in a way been the centrepiece of the Arvind Kejriwal govt's welfare measures.

NEW DELHI: A fresh drama erupted on Tuesday over the Delhi chief minister's residence as AAP leader Atishi alleged BJP-led Union government of ""snatching her home"" for the second time in three months by cancelling the allotment. The dangal over the CM's house escalated after BJP's Amit Malviya stepped in to counter the Delhi CM by saying that she was ""not evicted"" and ""never moved into Sheesh Mahal , which was allotted to her on October 11, 2024.""During a press conference on Tuesday, Delhi CM Atishi said the BJP has thrown her out of the CM's residence ""for the second time in three months.""Targeting further, she said that BJP can stop AAP from working by snatching their houses, abusing them and speaking against their family but can't stop their passion to work for the people of Delhi.""The BJP thinks that they will stop us from working by snatching our houses, abusing us and speaking ill about my family. They can snatch our houses, stop our work but cannot stop our passion for working for the people of Delhi,"" she said.Unexpectedly, Atishi in her speech said if needed she would stay at the homes of Delhiites and keep working from them.""If needed, I will come and stay at the homes of the people of Delhi and keep working for the people of Delhi,"" she said.""Three months ago my belongings were thrown on the road.

Why Lalu's 'open doors' offer evoked strong retort from Nitish Kumar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/olive-branch-or-mind-games-why-lalus-open-doors-offer-evoked-strong-retort-from-nitish-kumar/articleshow/117024968.cms,"File photo of Lalu Prasad (L) and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar

Poll What Drives Loyalty Shifts in Politics? Personal Gain Ideology

NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar seems to have some uncanny connection with political doors. In 2023, Amit Shah had shut "" BJP doors"" for the JD(U) chief and yet he managed to open it and go inside. Two years later, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad again opened ""Mahagathbandhan doors"" for Nitish but the chief minister says he is not interested.Last week, Lalu Prasad triggered fresh speculations about realignment in Bihar politics when he said that doors were open for Nitish Kumar if the JD(U) president showed willingness to snap ties with the BJP which represented ""communal forces.""Nitish Kumar, whose several political U-turns in the past have given him the dubious distinction of being the ""paltu ram"" of Bihar politics, responded with a categorical 'No' to Lalu's offer and ruled out quitting the NDA this time around. The JD(U) chief went on to call his two short-lived alliances with the RJD-Congress combine a ""mistake"". With Lalu's offer putting the focus back on his previous flip-flops, Nitish invoked former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee perhaps to add credibility to his claims of allegiance to the BJP.""It was respected Atal ji who made me a Union minister. He used to shower so much of affection on me. I never faced any difficulty in getting my proposals cleared. It was Vajpayee's wish that ""I become the CM"" when the NDA first won assembly polls in Bihar in 2005,” Nitish told reporters in Vaishali district, which he toured as part of the state-wide ‘Pragati Yatra'.Lalu's remarks on Nitish followed Amit Shah's interview last month to a news channel in which he was asked whether the NDA could go to polls in Bihar without declaring a chief ministerial candidate, like it recently did with great success in Maharashtra. When asked whether Nitish Kumar would be the face of the NDA in the upcoming Bihar elections or if the BJP would adopt a strategy similar to Maharashtra's, Shah chose not to give a clear answer. ""We will sit together and decide over the issue. Once we take a decision, we will let you know,"" he said, adding that such policy decisions are not made in public forums.Shah's response led to speculations that the BJP could insist on not projecting Nitish Kumar, who had been leading Bihar's NDA charge for close to a couple of decades, in the 2025 assembly polls. The state BJP leaders soon swung into damage control mode. Dilip Jaiswal, state minister and Bihar BJP chief said, ""We should understand that Amit Shah was trying to underscore that he was a ‘karyakarta' (worker) of a party in which big decisions are taken by the parliamentary board"". ""But, the leadership role of chief minister Nitish Kumar had been a given for long. There is no question of going back on that,” asserted Jaiswal.Ironically, in 2023, it was Amit Shah who had led the charge against Nitish Kumar after the JD(U) chief dumped the BJP and joined hands with RJD and Congress. Amit Shah had then accused Nitish Kumar of changing from ""Vikaswadi to Avsarwadi"" and had also taken swipes at his prime ministerial ambitions.However, the 2024 Lok Sabha elections has changed the equations within NDA. Both the BJP and the JD(U) won 12 seats each in the state. But the BJP is now dependent on Nitish Kumar's crucial support to run its government at the Centre. Surely, Nitish Kumar will extract a cost for this help especially after being reduced to being the junior partner in Bihar assembly. The BJP, which was the junior partner in the coalition till 2015, surged ahead of the JD(U) in the 2020 assembly elections. Nitish Kumar was reduced to 43 seats in the assembly while the BJP increased its tally to 74.On the other hand, the RJD, which has emerged as the single largest party in the last two assembly elections, is going all out to form a government in 2025. Tejashwi Yadav , who has served two stints as deputy chief minister of the state under Nitish Kumar, had led the RJD campaign in the last elections and managed to put up an impressive show. Tejashwi is confident that Nitish Kumar will be voted out in the elections this year.""It is too cold. Keep yourselves warm but do not make any wild guesses. The new year will see a new harvest (nai fasal) and a new government that will be sensitive to the people's need for health, education and jobs (padhaai, kamaai, dawaai, sunwai aur karvaayi ki sarkaar),"" said the young leader when asked about Nitish Kumar. He added, ""In the new year, my uncle (chacha) Nitish Kumar will be voted out. He has been in power for 20 years. Soil gets ruined if the same crop is sown for so long. So, it is time for the departure of Nitish ji and the NDA.""The RJD has Congress on its side, but Lalu knows the strategic importance of having Nitish in its fold to take on the BJP. The run up to the assembly elections will see a lot of flexing of muscles in both the coalitions. So, perhaps Lalu was testing the waters with his open invitation to Nitish?","In 2023, Amit Shah had shut "" BJP doors"" for the JD(U) chief and yet he managed to open it and go inside.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

He is the second police officer to be fired in the Jaahnavi accident case. Earlier, Daniel Auderer , vice-president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild, who was seen on body camera footage making fun of her death, was fired in July 2024.According to Seattle police, interim Seattle police chief Sue Rahr, in an email sent to her employees, said she fired Dave after the Seattle office of police accountability found he had violated four department policies. The policies he failed to follow included using emergency lights for an emergency response and being responsible for safely operating a patrol vehicle.Jaahnavi (23) died after she was struck by a police patrol vehicle in Seattle. She was hit just after 8pm on Jan 23, 2023. She was rushed to Harborview Medical Centre where she succumbed to her injuries.In July 2023, body cam footage surfaced which showed Jaahnavi being struck while crossing the street and fatally run over by a Seattle police car driven by Kevin.According to FOX 13 Seattle, in the body camera video, a loud rumble of the engine was heard as Kevin's speedometer showed speeds of up to 74 mph, higher than the prescribed limits of 20 to 25 mph. Kevin was also heard saying ""I f****d up"" in the video and performing CPR on Jaahnavi after the accident.Jaahnavi's death drew international attention after an audio recording was published in Sept 2023 of officer Daniel Auderer laughing and downplaying her death, saying she had ""limited value"" and that the city should ""just write a check"" for $11,000. Auderer was fired in July for his callous commentsJaahnavi had completed her bachelor's in computer applications in April 2019 and worked with a software company in Bengaluru for two years. She later moved to Seattle, in Sept 2021, to pursue a master's in information systems at Northeastern University. She also worked part-time on her campus as an administrative and event support assistant.US media reports in Feb 2024 had quoted King County prosecutors as saying that they would not file criminal charges against Dave because there was no evidence he was impaired or driving recklessly during the collision. The Seattle city attorney's office issued Dave a $5,000 citation in March for second-degree negligent driving in the crash that killed Jaahnavi.According to the Seattle police department, Kevin was on a ""high priority one"" call.

On December 24, BPSC Chairperson Parmar Rai Manubhai dismissed calls for a full cancellation, stating that the irregularities were confined to a single centre. Despite this clarification, many candidates persisted with their demands, leading to clashes with the police near Gandhi Maidan.Protests turned violent when candidates attempted to breach barricades and march toward the chief minister's residence. Police resorted to baton charges and water cannons to disperse the crowd, leaving several injured. Patna authorities subsequently declared Gandhi Maidan a restricted area, prohibiting student gatherings.Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor, voiced support for the protesters. Kishor criticised the state government for its response, saying, “Bihar is the birthplace of democracy, and students are being denied their fundamental right to express themselves.”","The Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) 70th Combined Competitive Preliminary Examination was held on December 13.

The airline closed this with just a counselling session only without any corrective training for the PIC, the regulator said in its order Monday.This came to light during an audit of Akasa conducted at its Mumbai office on Oct 10. Subsequently a show cause was issued to the pilot and the airline. The regulator found the airline’s reply unsatisfactory and has now issue its order in the case. The pilot has been directed to undergo “corrective training simulator session of two hours to cover stabilisation criteria…. (And) specific training on hazards of attempting takeoff after applying reverser and cancelling go-around decision after applying TOGA (take off go around).”The DGCA has also withdrawn the pilot’s LTC approval and short take off and landing “with immediate effect and till further orders.” LTC approval allows a providing practical training on commercial flights to trainee pilots.In the past few months, Akasa has been in the DGCA’s line of fire for its training.

What is the use of creating an institution under a legislation and not keeping it functional?""The bench was faced with a peculiar position in Jharkhand, where state information commission (SIC) has been non-functional for the last four years.

The bench ordered the largest party in opposition, which is BJP, to nominate one of its MLAs for inclusion in the selection panel and directed the state to appoint chief information commissioner and six information commissioners within seven weeks.Laying down the timeline for compliance, the bench directed all other states to publish a list of applicants for the posts of CICs and ICs within one week, composition of search committee along with selection criteria a week thereafter, completion of interviews in next six weeks, and make appointments in the subsequent two weeks.SC asked chief secretaries of all states to file compliance reports after eight weeks and asked them to inform the level of pendency before information commissions.","SC expressed concern over continued vacancies in state and central information commissions.

Delhi elections: Stage and pitch set in 3-way capital contest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-elections-stage-and-pitch-set-in-3-way-capital-contest/articleshow/117035249.cms,"NEW DELHI: Twice in the past 10 years, Arvind Kejriwal 's AAP halted BJP's relentless victory march in head-to-head contests in Delhi, reversing 7-0 clean sweeps by the saffron juggernaut in the immediately preceding Lok Sabha polls to win thumping majorities in the assembly elections of 2015 and 2020. Will the script be repeated in 2025? Or have incumbency and charges of corruption dimmed Brand Kejriwal's lustre enough to enable BJP to triumph in a state in which it last won a majority in an assembly election in 1993? The answer will become clear on February 8, when the results of what promises to be a bitter and high-voltage election will be announced.Election Commission of India Tuesday released the poll schedule for Delhi, fixing Feb 5 as the polling date for over 1.55 crore eligible voters. Chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said the poll process has to be completed by Feb 10.The outcome of the poll will be crucial for the three main players. Incumbent AAP is fighting to secure a third consecutive term in the city-state regarded as its bastion, but is looking more vulnerable here than it has in a long time. BJP dominates large swathes of India but has found success elusive for 26 years in the capital (it was voted out of office in 1998 and hasn't run a state govt in Delhi since then). Congress dominated Delhi politics from 1998 to 2013, with Sheila Dikshit serving as three-term CM, but has seen its fortunes plummet since then and is now battling to regain its vote base from AAP in order to stay relevant.While the election process will start from Jan 10 with notification of elections, the last date to file nominations is Jan 17. Nomination papers will be scrutinised on Jan 18, and candidates will be able to withdraw till January 20. The next 14 days, until the evening of Feb 3 when the silent period will begin, are expected to witness a blitzkrieg by candidates and parties vying for the attention and votes of the electorate.Though poll dates were announced only on Tuesday, campaigning has effectively been going on for several months. In fact, a brief lull after the Lok Sabha polls gave way to hectic activity after AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal was released on bail. AAP has already announced its candidates for all 70 seats, Congress has declared 48 names, and BJ. And while AAP has been busy unveiling ""guarantees"" to different sections to woo voters, the other two have not been far behind.In the 2020 polls, AAP got an impressive 53.6% of votes and won 62 of the 70 seats, while BJP managed to win the remaining eight, with a vote share of 38.5%. Congress barely managed to get 4.3% of votes and its column of seats remained empty. In the preceding election, AAP fared even better, winning 67 seats and 54.6% vote share. BJP polled 32.8% of votes and won three seats. Congress had a vote share of 9.7%, but none of its candidates could score a win.Confident of repeating his success story, Kejriwal said the election was going to be a battle between ""politics of work and politics of hurling abuses"". Calling party volunteers his greatest strength, Kejriwal urged them to rise with determination to ""defeat the opposition's machinery"".Showcasing its work in healthcare, education, power, and women's welfare as ""transformative achievements"", senior AAP functionary and former deputy CM Manish Sisodia claimed, ""Delhi will vote for a leader who has provided 24-hour electricity, ensured zero electricity bills, eased the lives of families with free pilgrimages, ensured free bus travel for women, and implemented welfare schemes with sincerity and integrity.""Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva expressed confidence that ""lotus will bloom"" in the capital and a ""double-engine govt"" will take charge. ""Those who are inflating balloons of lies and attempting to exert political pressure by threatening election officials have now been silenced. People of Delhi are resolute in their determination to oust this corrupt and plundering AAPda govt,"" Sachdeva said, adding that party volunteers were actively engaged in a door-to-door campaign across the city.Delhi Congress president Devender Yadav claimed that the people of Delhi ""desired"" to see Congress back in govt and their dream would be ""realised"" soon. ""The date has been announced for the end of the sins of corruption and misrule by AAP and BJP, to end the toxic, unbreathable air, rid Delhi of the mountains of garbage, purify the polluted Yamuna and free Delhi of crimes and lawlessness,"" Yadav said.Congress general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal claimed on Feb 5, Delhi will get to make a decision on whether it wished to see ""five more years of chaos and confrontation"" between the state and Centre, or a ""stable govt"" that works solely for the people. ""Under Congress, Delhi was transformed into a modern city that responded to 21st-century needs. Be it the world-class metro or the massive infrastructure that brought connectivity, Delhi had its golden period under Congress rule,"" Venugopal said.The number of eligible voters is likely to swell further with the Delhi election office still scrutinising more than five lakh new applications for the addition of names to the voters' list. ""It is a single-phase election... We have deliberately kept polling on a Wednesday so more people come out to vote...like we did in Maharashtra,"" CEC Kumar said.Of the 70 seats in Delhi, 58 are general and 12 reserved. Kumar said bypolls to two assembly constituencies - Milkipur in Uttar Pradesh and Erode in Tamil Nadu - will also be held according to the same schedule while two constituencies of Jammu and Kashmir - Budgam and Nagrota - will vote later due to current snowy conditions.","Election Commission of India Tuesday released the poll schedule for Delhi, fixing Feb 5 as the polling date for over 1.55 crore eligible voters.

Even after publication of draft electoral rolls, claims and objections are invited from public and aggrieved electors given a hearing ahead of finalisation of rolls.Stating that the process for additions and deletions is transparent, rigorous, and immune to arbitrary changes, the CEC insisted that ""every step of the electoral roll process is rooted in transparency and accountability...Deletion of names is not possible without adhering to strict protocols, and every political party has the right to raise objections at various stages.""Kumar said names were added through Form 6 and field verification by BLOs, while holding regular meetings with political parties, represented by booth-level agents, and sharing with them the list of objections on a weekly basis.

However, Union health minister J P Nadda allayed concerns, saying the rise in cases won't lead to a Covid-like outbreak.""HMPV is not a new virus. It was first identified in 2001, and it has been circulating around the world for many years,"" Nadda said.Experts said HMPV rarely requires hospitalisation, and timely intervention can prevent complications.Nadda said the health ministry, along with Indian Council of Medical Research and National Centre for Disease Control, was monitoring the situation in China and neighbouring countries. ""WHO has taken cognisance of the situation and will share its report shortly with us,"" he said.ICMR confirmed two cases at Bangalore Baptist Hospital. A three-month-old girl from Bengaluru, admitted with fever and cold in December, tested positive and has since recovered and been discharged.The second case of HMPV, detected on January 3, involves an eight-month-old boy admitted for fever following an injury. He tested positive for both HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and is currently recovering. Both children have a history of bronchopneumonia and neither has travelled abroad, suggesting they contracted the infection locally.A two-month-old from Dungarpur in Rajasthan was admitted to a private hospital in Ahmedabad on Dec 24 with respiratory illness and diagnosed with HMPV on Dec 26. Dr Bhavin Solanki of AMC said the hospital reported the case late, and the patient was isolated. Two children, aged seven and 13, tested positive at Meditrina Institute of Medical Sciences in Nagpur. They were initially treated for suspected H1N1 (swine flu) with Tamiflu, but PCR tests confirmed HMPV on Jan 3. The kids recovered through outpatient treatment.Although the hospital reported the cases, Nagpur Municipal Corporation decided to re-test the samples at AIIMS Nagpur. These cases were discussed in an ICMR video conference Monday.Tamil Nadu health secretary Supriya Sahu said the state has two active cases - in Chennai and Salem - and the condition of both is stable. ""HMPV infections are self-limiting and resolve with symptomatic care, including adequate hydration and rest,"" she said.First identified in 2001 in the Netherlands, HMPV causes illnesses from mild respiratory infections to severe conditions like bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In India, its prevalence varies between 1% and 19% across regions.Health minister Nadda said HMPV spreads through respiratory droplets and can affect all age groups. ""The virus spreads more during winter and early spring months,"" he said. ""Our health systems and surveillance networks remain vigilant, ensuring the country is ready to respond promptly to any emerging health challenges. There is no reason to worry. We are closely monitoring the situation,"" he assured.ICMR chair for disease elimination, Dr Rajni Kant, said HMPV is a known cause of respiratory illness in children and confirmed its presence in different parts of India. ""ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Gorakhpur, tested respiratory pathogens in 100 under-five patients... at BRD Medical College in 2022. Out of 100 enrolled paediatric patients, four (4%) were found HMPV positive,"" Kant said.Karnataka health minister Dinesh Gundu Rao said the virus is likely a local strain unrelated to the outbreak in China. ""Referring to any recent case as the 'first' is misleading. I don't think we should be pressing the panic button."" A Karnataka health official highlighted the potential severity of HMPV in vulnerable populations, particularly children under five, the elderly, and immunosuppressed people. ""About 10% of adult patients admitted with pneumonia test positive for HMPV, and 4-6% of viral illnesses in children are caused by this virus,"" the official said.Current data from ICMR and Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) confirmed no unusual surge in influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory illness cases in the country.A five-month-old boy in Kolkata, who travelled from Mumbai, was the last known case of HMPV in Bengal requiring intensive care. He was admitted to a private hospital with symptoms such as high fever, diarrhoea, vomiting and respiratory distress. After receiving breathing support for a week, he was discharged and is doing well.(Inputs from Sarfaraz Ahmed in Nagpur, Sumati Yengkhom in Kolkata)","India reported seven cases of human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) infection in children.

NEW DELHI: China's recent display of two new-generation stealth fighter jets, which sent shock waves around the globe at the country's astonishing pace of military modernisation, found mention in the IAF chief 's remarks on Tuesday, which saw him stress the need for India to strongly push for self-reliance in defence R&D and production along with greater private sector participation even though it will involve much higher costs.""The world today is in a precarious position dominated by conflicts and contests. We have our own security concerns on the western and northern borders with increased militarisation by China and Pakistan,"" Air Chief Marshal A P Singh said at the annual Subroto Mukherjee seminar here.""China is investing heavily in its air force the recent unveiling of its new stealth aircraft is a case in point,"" he added, while also expressing frustration at the extremely slow pace of delivery of the indigenous Tejas fighter. On December 26, China conducted the maiden flights of what are probably two new 6th-generation fighters at Chengdu. Videos of the tailless, stealthy advanced combat aircraft cruising at low altitudes shocked even the US, which is yet to finalise its own 6th-generation fighter project. China already has 5th-generation fighters in the Chengdu J-20 jets, which it has also deployed at its airfields facing India like Hotan and Shigatse, as reported earlier by TOI.India is still far away from producing even a 5th-generation fighter, with the PM-headed cabinet committee on security clearing the development of the swing-role advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore, only in March last year. As per projected timelines, the first AMCA prototype will make its maiden flight in four to five years, with production and induction beginning only after 2035. At present, India is struggling to produce the 4th-generation Tejas Mark-1A fighters because of the continuing delay in supply of GE-F404 turbofan jet engines by US major General Electric. Down to 30 fighter squadrons when it is authorised 42.5 to tackle challenges from China and Pakistan, IAF wants to induct at least 180 Tejas Mark-1A and 108 Mark-2 jets in the run-up to the AMCA.The IAF chief said, ""R&D loses its relevance in case it is not able to meet time-lines. Technology delayed is technology denied. There has to be an increased aptitude for acceptance of risks involved and failures in R&D."" He added, ""Atmanirbharta will come at a cost and we should accept it. We may have to spend more and buy at a higher rate if required - amortising of the R&D part and limited numbers will push the cost up - but will give the much needed self-reliance.""",China's recent display of two new-generation stealth fighter jets sent shock waves around the globe.

Sullivan meets PM Modi

NEW DELHI: The United States is finalising the removal of longstanding regulations that have hindered civil nuclear cooperation between Indian nuclear entities and US companies, announced national security advisor Jake Sullivan during his visit to India. Sullivan described the move as a significant step in cementing the bilateral partnership, which he said was long overdue.""Although former President Bush and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh laid out a vision of civil nuclear cooperation nearly 20 years ago, we have yet to fully realise it,"" Sullivan said, adding that the Biden administration has determined it is ""past time to take the next major step."" He confirmed that the necessary paperwork is being finalised, enabling Indian entities previously on restricted US lists to collaborate with American private sector players, scientists, and technologists.""The United States is now finalizing the necessary steps to remove long standing regulations that have prevented civil nuclear cooperation between India's leading nuclear entities and US companies,"" he said while speaking at IIT Delhi.Sullivan said that the decision reflects the progress made in the strategic partnership and India's transparent engagement over the last four years.""The formal paperwork will be done soon, but this will be an opportunity to turn the page on some of the frictions of the past and create opportunities for entities that have been on restricted lists in the United States to come off those lists and enter into deep collaboration with the United States, with our private sector, with our scientists and technologists to move civil nuclear cooperation forward together,"" he said.The announcement comes as Sullivan concludes his two-day visit to India, during which he held discussions with national security advisor Ajit Doval. Sullivan credited Doval for his role in advancing the US-India relationship, noting their ""deep personal and professional relationship"" developed over the past four years.""This is likely the last trip overseas that I will lead as NSA and I cannot think of a better way to end my tenure in the White House, visiting India on my final overseas trip to mark the advances that we have made together over the past four years,"" Sullivan said.He predicted that within the next decade, joint initiatives could see American and Indian firms working together on advanced semiconductor technologies and conducting research in space exploration.Sullivan’s agenda also included a visit to the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, where he met with entrepreneurs and discussed the US-India alliance on innovation under the iCET initiative.

Also, controversy stirred as Taylor was dragged into allegations surrounding Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. Taylor and Travis have not yet commented on the issue.

Travis Kelce’s Girlfriend Taylor Swift Became A Part Of The Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni Controversy



Travis Kelce And Taylor Swift Have Not Spoken About The Controversy Yet



The NFL star and the tight end of the Kansas City Chiefs, Travis Kelce , recently won the NFL Pro Bowl as he got the maximum number of votes. But many NFL fans think Travis’ girlfriend, the global pop star, Taylor Swift’s fans voted for him. But this is not the first time in the last two weeks that Taylor Swift was dragged into a controversy that had no direct connection with her. A few weeks back, the New York Post published an explosive article about how famous actress and Taylor’s best friend, Blake Lively accused Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment on set for their famous movie “It Ends With Us” and for running a “smear campaign” against her and somehow Taylor also unknowingly became a part of this.As per the New York Post report, actor Justin Baldoni’s PR team, the TAG PR, had named the NFL star, Travis’ girlfriend, Taylor Swift, in a “scenario planning document” that was all about publishing instigating stories against Taylor Swift using feminism as a ""weapon"". This was mainly planned because Taylor is one of Blake’s close friends and she has faced some criticism before for using feminism.Obtained by the US Weekly, the complaint by Blake Lively reads, “The Scenario Planning document states that TAG could ‘also explore planting stories about the weaponization of feminism and how people in [Lively’s] circle like Taylor Swift, have been accused of utilizing these tactics to ‘bully’ into getting what they want.”An email sent on 6th August last year also spoke about how Blake Lively shares some of her fan base with Taylor Swift so they will be taking the matter “extremely seriously.” The mail read as, “We have seen the most innocuous issues turn giant due to socials or the hugest crises have no effect on social whatsoever. You just cannot tell at this stage. But, BL does have some of the same TS fanbase so we will be taking it extremely seriously.”Taylor has not issued an official statement regarding this and neither her boyfriend, the NFL star and the highest paid tight end of the NFL, Travis, has spoken about the matter publicly.Taylor is currently taking a short break in her career after she wrapped up the legendary Eras Tour back in the first week of December. She is in her $50 million apartment in the Big Apple where she is spending time with her boyfriend, Travis. Taylor has not yet announced her new project while Travis will be seen playing for his team in the playoffs.Coming back to the Justin and Blake controversy, Justin has sued the New York Post for publishing that article and has denied the sexual harassment claim Blake had accused Justin of. Blake has not yet issued a statement about what Justin has accused her of.Taylor and Travis started dating in September of 2023 and since then, it seems like the couple has gotten pretty comfortable with each other.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes was in Denver, but his wife, Brittany Mahomes, and the kids were having an unforgettable snow day","NFL star Travis Kelce won the Pro Bowl, but speculation arose that Taylor Swift's fans influenced the vote.

New Lawsuit Alleges Emmanuel Acho Had A Physical Relationship With Broadcaster Joy Taylor

On Sunday, news broke that Fox Sports, along with multiple on-air talents, and an executive had been named defendants in a workplace misconduct lawsuit filed in California. The 42-page suit has been bought by hairstylist named Noushin Faraji who worked at the company between 2012 and 2024 and has made claims of sexual harassment from former FS1 host Skip Bayless and executive Charlie Dixon , along with racially insensitive comments by current FS1 host Joy Taylor .Faraji further alleges that Taylor was involved in a physical relationship with former NFL linebacker-turned-analyst Emmanuel Acho and also with Charlie Dixon to advance her career. The lawsuit alleges that these relationships helped Taylor secure a more prominent position in the network. Fox issued the following statement to Front Office Sports: “We take these allegations seriously and have no further comment at this time given this pending litigation.”The lawsuit alleges that Joy Taylor who’s a popular FS1 host created a hostile work environment. Faraji’s lawsuit claims that Bayless allegedly offered her $1.5 million for a sexual encounter, eventhough she had turned down his advances multiple times in the past. When Faraji reported her issues with Bayless to Taylor the host allegedly dismissed her concerns and told her to “get over it.”“In approximately February 2020, Ms. Taylor asked Ms. Faraji to meet her for lunch in Beverly Hills. When Ms. Faraji arrived, she found Ms. Taylor with a man, Emmanuel Acho. Ms. Faraji did not know Mr. Acho but could tell that the two were romantically involved,” the lawsuit says.It further reveals, “A few months after meeting Mr. Acho at the lunch, Ms. Faraji noticed him in the hallway while at work. Ms. Faraji later asked Ms. Taylor if Mr. Acho also worked at Fox. Ms. Taylor confirmed and explained that she wanted Mr. Acho to eventually recommend her on the show Speak for Yourself. Ms. Faraji became alarmed and warned Ms. Taylor that she should probably not sleep with Mr. Dixon and Mr. Acho at the same time, as Mr. Dixon is a very powerful man that may become very angry.”“Ms. Taylor told her not to worry about it. She explained that she was also now powerful, and once Mr. Dixon was no longer useful to her, she would follow through on her plan to tell the company that he forced himself on her. She would not allow herself to be forced out by Mr. Dixon like other women talent,” it concluded.Though neither Acho or Taylor have spoken about this allegation, some fans spotted some suspicious online activity on Acho’s end; the NFL athlete, who at the time was a member of Speak for Yourself. recently deleted video from 2022 in which he praised Taylor.“I gotta take a moment to shout out my co-host Joy Taylor,” Acho says in the video which was shot in his car, after his rehearsals with Taylor. “A woman. A Black woman. Daily Show. Sports. Do you realize how hard it is to get to the position that she is in? So often there’s misogyny and sexism running rampant in sports and we don’t even care what women have to say in sports,” remarked Acho.He continued, “But Joy is not only in the position on television as a Black woman but as an opinionist. So not just asking men what they think but providing her own unique and distinct insight. It’s hard to do and Joy you have done it, so congratulations. Looking forward to working with you.”","Fox Sports, along with multiple on-air talents, and an executive had been named defendants in a workplace misconduct lawsuit filed in California.

In a significant development, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced his decision to step down as leader of the Liberal Party and prime minister. This announcement marks a turning point in Canadian politics, as Trudeau has been a central figure in the country’s political landscape for over a decade. The decision follows escalating internal dissent within the Liberal Party, mounting public criticism, and strained relations with international leaders, particularly U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, added to the discourse with a pointed comment: “2025 is looking good.” This statement, coupled with Musk’s previous critiques of Trudeau, highlights the far-reaching implications of this decision for Canadian politics and its global perception.Elon Musk reacted to Trudeau’s resignation with a brief comment on X (formerly Twitter): “2025 is looking good.” This statement aligns with Musk’s earlier prediction that Trudeau would lose the upcoming Canadian elections in October 2025. Musk’s confidence in this outcome reflects his broader disapproval of Trudeau’s policies. Over the past year, Musk has repeatedly criticized Trudeau’s administration for actions he perceives as authoritarian or restrictive. His critiques range from regulatory policies targeting online streaming services to the invocation of emergency powers during Canada’s trucker protests. Musk’s commentary has often fueled public debates, further polarizing opinions on Trudeau’s leadership.Trudeau’s resignation comes after years of increasing political challenges and declining public support. Having served as leader of the Liberal Party since 2013 and prime minister since 2015, Trudeau was once seen as a transformative figure in Canadian politics. However, his tenure has not been without controversy. Internal calls for his resignation had been growing, with party members expressing concerns about his ability to lead the Liberals into the 2025 federal elections. External pressures, including strained relations with the U.S., further weakened his standing. The breaking point came with tariff threats from Donald Trump, which disrupted Canada’s economic and political alliances and underscored Trudeau’s diminishing influence on the global stage.Musk’s criticism of Trudeau has been a recurring theme, particularly as the Canadian government introduced policies that Musk viewed as infringing on individual freedoms. One notable example was the requirement for online streaming platforms to register for regulatory controls, which Musk condemned as an attack on free speech. Similarly, during the trucker protests, Musk described the government’s use of emergency powers as authoritarian, drawing parallels to undemocratic regimes. The tension between Musk and Trudeau reached a peak when Trudeau spoke about the global rise of “regressive” political forces, criticizing Donald Trump’s influence and Kamala Harris’s loss in the U.S. presidential race. Musk’s response, calling Trudeau an “insufferable tool,” ignited further controversy and underscored their ideological differences.Trudeau’s resignation comes at a time of heightened scrutiny over his leadership and its impact on the Liberal Party. His tenure has been marked by both significant achievements and deep-seated challenges. While his progressive policies and inclusive rhetoric once resonated with voters, his administration faced criticism over economic management, strained international relations, and controversial decisions. Internally, the Liberal Party has struggled with divisions, and Trudeau’s leadership became a point of contention. Externally, the tariff threats from the U.S. and strained diplomatic ties underscored the complexities of navigating global politics in a rapidly changing world. As Trudeau steps down, he leaves behind a mixed legacy, with questions about the future direction of the Liberal Party looming large.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced his decision to step down as leader of the Liberal Party and prime minister.
