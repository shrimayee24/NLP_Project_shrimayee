Mission Sudarshan Chakra: Multi-layered air & missile shield integrated with offensive weapons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mission-sudarshan-chakra-multi-layered-air-missile-shield-integrated-with-offensive-weapons/articleshow/123328590.cms,"Mission Sudarshan Chakra

NEW DELHI: Mission Sudarshan Chakra will entail building a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, robust command and control posts, reliable land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles and other weapons.The defence shield will, of course, also require effective use of space-based assets for early-warning and tracking threats. Announcing the launch of the ambitious `Mission Sudarshan Chakra’ just three months after cross-border military hostilities with Pakistan, PM Narendra Modi on Friday said all important places in India, including strategic areas as well as civilian ones like hospitals, railways and centres of faith, will be given `complete security cover’ under it by 2035.This indigenously-developed national air and missile defence shield, which will also be integrated with potent counter-offensive weapons, will progressively be expanded, strengthened and modernised with “great intensity” in the coming 10 years, with a system in place to work out strategies to cater for futuristic warfare needs.“Every citizen of the country should feel safe. Whatever technology comes to attack us, our technology should prove to be better than that,” the PM said, adding that the country will move forward towards developing the “powerful weapon system for targeted precise action” like Lord Krishna’s Sudarshan Chakra in the battle of Mahabharata.This announcement comes soon after Pakistan Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir was reported to have recklessly threatened to destroy any dam India builds to impede water flow to his country, while also warning of a nuclear Armageddon.While Modi did not spell out any details, the plan to erect a defence shield, akin to Israel’s `Iron Dome’ (which only has to protect a very small country) and the proposed `Golden Dome’ of the US, will take a lot of doing along with huge funding.The PM’s remarks that Mission Sudarshan Chakra will not only neutralise the enemy’s attack, but will also hit back at the adversary “many times more”, points at the impending expansion of India’s conventional (non-nuclear) arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles. These new missiles will include the induction of the new 500-km range quasi-ballistic missile Pralay and the 1,000-km range subsonic long-range land-attack cruise missile. The increase in strike range of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile from 450-km to 800-km is also on the anvil.The building blocks for the robust air and missile defence shield are already in place. India’s existing integrated multi-layered air defence network, with a mix of Indian and foreign surface-to-air missile systems, had thwarted waves of Turkish drones and Chinese missiles during Operation Sindoor from May 7-10.Last week, Air Chief Marshal A P Singh had also declared that the IAF’s Russian-origin S-400 air defence system had shot down at least five Pakistani fighters and a large special mission aircraft -- the last at a distance of 300-km -- during the hostilities.Officials say the PM’s announcement is connected to the ongoing development of the indigenous long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system, being developed by DRDO under the ambitious Project Kusha, which will have interceptor missiles to hit hostile targets at 150-km, 250-km and 350-km ranges. Phase-1 of this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29, as was first reported by TOI.There could also now be a green signal for the operational deployment of Phase-1 of the indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which as per DRDO is designed to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, at different altitudes both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere for “a higher kill probability”.In July last year, India had also successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of the BMD system, with the defence ministry proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.","Mission Sudarshan Chakra will entail building a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors.

Trump Thinks 50% Tariff on India Has Put Pressure on Russia, Ex-US Official Calls His Strategy Wrong

Nayara Energy in troubled waters

Russia-backed Nayara Energy, an Indian refinery, faced with European Union sanctions for its procurement of crude from Russia is looking at damage control. Nayara Energy is now sending a shipment to China, a first for India since 2021.According to a Bloomberg report, a shipment of Indian diesel is en route to China, marking the first such delivery since 2021. This development comes as Nayara Energy, which has Russian connections, faces uncertainty in its oil product exports due to new European Union sanctions.The vessel EM Zenith departed from Nayara's Vadinar terminal carrying approximately 496,000 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel on July 18, as reported by Kpler, a port agent document and vessel tracking information gathered by Bloomberg.Also Read | Fresh trouble for Russia-backed Nayara Energy! SBI stops trade & foreign currency transactions of Indian refinery; doesn’t want to risk US tariffs, EU curbs The ship left just before the EU announced sanctions on the Rosneft-supported refinery, as part of its intensified measures against Russian oil commerce. The ship, originally heading to Malaysia, changed course in the Strait of Malacca and remained anchored for approximately 12 days whilst several Nayara cargoes were affected by EU sanctions. The vessel has since changed its destination to Zhoushan, China, the Bloomberg report said.Recent sanctions have created payment difficulties for Nayara, prompting the company to request advance payments or letters of credit before loading fuel shipments. Additionally, the company had to reduce production at its Vadinar refinery due to disruptions in crude oil deliveries.According to Kpler data, this diesel cargo to China marks the first such shipment from India since April 2021, coinciding with improved diplomatic relations between the two Asian countries.Meanwhile, State Bank of India, India’s largest public sector bank, has discontinued processing international trade and forex transactions for Nayara Energy following recent US tariff increases. According to a source who spoke to ET, this decision was taken to prevent potential US and European Union sanctions. The US administration has implemented a 25% additional tariff on India regarding its Russian crude oil trade.Also Read | ‘China issue more complicated…’: After tariff on India, will Donald Trump impose additional duties on China for Russia oil trade?

All banks with international branches and operations have to adhere to the government laws to ensure that they do not attract regulatory scrutiny,"" said the person cited above. ""The last European sanctions along with the US tariffs imposed after that have made the processing of transactions for Nayara difficult.""""This call has been taken by the bank very recently after the US sanctions to ensure compliance with international rules,"" the source told ET.

Consider converting Noida to a metropolitan council: SC to UP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/consider-converting-noida-to-a-metropolitan-council-sc-to-up/articleshow/123292648.cms,"Form citizen advisory board for Noida in 4 weeks: SC to UP government



NEW DELHI: Nearly half a century after New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) came into existence, Supreme Court on Wednesday asked UP government to consider replacing it with a metropolitan council for people-centric governance.The direction was based on findings of an SC-constituted SIT, which gave a stinging report into the functioning of Noida Authority, finding, among other things, decision-making centralised in the hands of a few officers.Accepting SIT's recommendations, a bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi ordered: ""In order to infuse transparency and fairness as well as a citizen-centric approach in the day-to-day functioning of Noida, we direct UP chief secretary to place the recommendation... before the council of ministers for an appropriate decision.""Till that decision is taken, the bench directed the chief secretary to post a chief vigilance officer, who should be an IPS officer or an officer on deputation from CAG, in Noida for a financial audit.According to SIT, Noida officers were involved in 20 cases of excess payment of compensation to landowners. Led by IPS officer SB Shiradkar, SIT also concluded that Noida's land allotment policies favour builders, and there was a lack of transparency and fairness in the development authority's overall functioning.It sought an inquiry into assets of officers and their relatives for a proper look at who benefited from excess compensation that Noida paid out.Commenting on the functioning of Noida, SIT said discretionary powers exercised by its officers in allotment of land is such that very soon, there will be no land available in Delhi's neighbouring city for future development purposes. It also flagged the lack of process to garner public view and conduct environment impact assessments for projects in Noida. SIT said residents often complain of delay and inadequate resolution of grievances, as Noida Authority acts reactively rather than proactively.The Justice Kant-led bench directed the chief secretary to set up a citizen advisory board for Noida in four weeks and banned giving effect to any project in Noida without environmental impact assessment and clearance from SC's green bench.In the 20 cases where excess compensation was paid to landowners because of alleged collusion of Noida officials who were identified by SIT, the bench constituted another SIT to conduct a probe into each of these officers and register FIRs on detection of a cognisable offence. It asked the authority to grant sanction for prosecution against delinquent officials within four weeks of SIT seeking it.""The SIT headed by a police officer not below the rank of commissioner of police will register preliminary enquiries (PEs) and proceed to inquire into the illustratively highlighted points (in the previous SIT report) and involve experts from forensic account department as well as economic offences wing. If the SIT, after preliminary enquiry, finds commission of cognizable offence, it would register FIRs,"" the bench said.The court asked this SIT to submit a probe status report but clarified that excess compensation paid to landowners would not be recovered.","The direction was based on findings of an SC-constituted SIT, which gave a stinging report into the functioning of Noida Authority.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday used the pulpit of Red Fort to lavish praise on RSS, saying that the Sangh's contribution to the nation marks a ""proud and golden chapter"".Speaking about the contributions of individuals and organisations to nation-building in his Independence Day address, he said: ""Today, with great pride, I wish to mention one such institution. One hundred years ago, RSS was founded. These 100 years of service to the nation constitute a proud and golden chapter. With the resolve of nation-building through character-building, with the aim of serving Maa Bharati, the swayamsevaks have, for a century, dedicated their lives to the welfare of the motherland. ""The remarks of the PM, himself a swayamsevak, eulogising the Sangh when it is seen as enjoying unprecedented influence, can only add zing to its ongoing centenary celebrations.PM also praised Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, the founder of Bhartiya Jan Sangh, as BJP was known in its original incarnation, who died in jail after being imprisoned for campaigning against Special Status for J&K.""The removal of the wall of Article 370 and the realisation of the mantra of 'One Nation, One Constitution' have been our true tribute to him,"" said Modi.Although Sangh was invited to be a part of the Republic Day parade in 1963, this was, perhaps, the first instance of praise for the organisation which has defied bans, controversies and intense opposition from influential political and academic quarters to become one of the country's major influences and a challenge to the Nehruvian/ ""liberal"" version of nationalism and secularism.Interestingly, the high praise comes amid persisting speculation about a strain in Sangh's equations with BJP.Modi went the full distance in expressing his veneration for the organisation. ""Today, from the ramparts of Red Fort, I salute all the swayamsevaks who have contributed to this century-long journey of national service, and the nation takes pride in the grand and dedicated journey of RSS, which will continue to inspire us,"" he said.","PM Narendra Modi used the pulpit of Red Fort to lavish praise on RSS.

"Months after Sindoor, India plans its own 'Iron Dome'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/months-after-sindoor-india-plans-its-own-iron-dome/articleshow/123326642.cms,"PM Narendra Modi

NEW DELHI: Announcing the launch of an ambitious `Mission Sudarshan Chakra’ just three months after cross-border military hostilities with Pakistan, PM Narendra Modi on Friday said all important places in India, including strategic areas as well as civilian ones like hospitals, railways and centres of faith, will be given `complete security cover’ under it by 2035.This indigenously-developed national air and missile defence shield, which will also be integrated with potent counter-offensive weapons, will progressively be expanded, strengthened and modernised with “great intensity” in the coming 10 years, with a system in place to work out strategies to cater for futuristic warfare needs.“Every citizen of the country should feel safe. Whatever technology comes to attack us, our technology should prove to be better than that,” the PM said, adding that the country will move forward towards developing the “powerful weapon system for targeted precise action” like Lord Krishna’s Sudarshan Chakra in the battle of Mahabharata.This announcement comes soon after Pakistan Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir was reported to have recklessly threatened to destroy any dam India builds to impede water flow to his country, while also warning of a nuclear Armageddon.While Modi did not spell out any details, the plan to erect a defence shield, akin to Israel’s `Iron Dome’ (which only has to protect a very small country) and the proposed `Golden Dome’ of the US, will take a lot of doing along with huge funding.It will entail building a multi-layered integrated air and missile defence shield around identified locations, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, robust command and control posts, reliable land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles and other weapons. This will, of course, also require effective use of space-based assets for early-warning and tracking threats, if not for actual warfare.The PM’s remarks that Mission Sudarshan Chakra will not only neutralise the enemy’s attack, but will also hit back at the adversary “many times more”, points at the impending expansion of India’s conventional (non-nuclear) arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles. These new missiles will include the induction of the new 500-km range quasi-ballistic missile Pralay and the 1,000-km range subsonic long-range land-attack cruise missile. The increase in strike range of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile from 450-km to 800-km is also on the anvil.The building blocks for the robust air and missile defence shield are already in place. India’s existing integrated multi-layered air defence network, with a mix of Indian and foreign surface-to-air missile systems, had thwarted waves of Turkish drones and Chinese missiles during Operation Sindoor from May 7-10.Last week, Air Chief Marshal A P Singh had also declared that the IAF’s Russian-origin S-400 air defence system had shot down at least five Pakistani fighters and a large special mission aircraft, the last at a distance of 300-km -- during the hostilities.Officials say the PM’s new announcement is connected to the ongoing development of the indigenous long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system, being developed by DRDO under the ambitious Project Kusha, which will have interceptor missiles to hit hostile targets at 150-km, 250-km and 350-km ranges. Phase-1 of this air defence system should be ready by 2028-29, as was first reported by TOI.There could also now be a green signal for the operational deployment of Phase-1 of the indigenous two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD), which as per DRDO is designed to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, at different altitudes both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere for “a higher kill probability”.In July last year, India had also successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of the BMD system, with the defence ministry proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.","All important places in India, including strategic areas as well as civilian ones like hospitals, railways and centres of faith, will be given `complete security cover’ under it by 2035. “Every citizen of the country should feel safe.

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has said the stray dog issue in Delhi-NCR should be addressed through measures to regulate their population, rather than confining them to shelters - an approach that echoes the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules mandated under law.

The problem can be solved only by regulating the population of street dogs, but it cannot be resolved by putting them in shelters,"" said Bhagwat, a veterinary science graduate, while addressing a religious congregation at Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium in Cuttack Thursday. He added, ""Sheltering all street dogs is not a practical solution. The only effective way is to implement sterilisation and vaccination, as already prescribed in law.

Here are top observations of Supreme Court order



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has uploaded the full order in suo motu case on the stray dog issue, in which a two-judge bench on Monday, August 11, directed that stray dogs in Delhi-NCR be relocated to shelters.In the judgment, uploaded on the apex court's website on Wednesday, the Court has included directions to ensure that the dogs are not ill-treated in shelter homes while saying that the judiciary bears the sole responsibility to ""possess the courage and strength"" to remind people of truths that they may not prefer to hear.Meanwhile, in a related development, a new three-judge bench comprising Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria will hear the matter on Thursday.The directions to permanently relocate all strays from streets to shelters ""at the earliest"" were passed by a bench comprising Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice R Mahadevan on August 11.The bench passed a slew of directions while hearing a suo-motu case initiated on July 28 over stray-dog bites leading to rabies, particularly among children, in the national capital.""The judiciary must not assume or take on the colouration of the prevailing popular sentiments of the time, for its role is not to echo the passions of the moment but to uphold the enduring principles of justice, conscience and equity,"" the order said.""As the sentinel on the qui vive, a guardian of rights, the judiciary bears the solemn responsibility to possess the courage and the strength to remind the people of truths that they may not like or prefer not to hear,"" it added.The bench acknowledged the “genuine love and care” many people have for stray dogs and encouraged them to “come forward and become a part of this exercise,” taking responsibility for the care and upkeep of the animals in shelters or pounds.""In light of the concerns of the interveners, we urge all to adopt and give dogs a shelter in their homes. However, we do not ascribe to the virtue signalling of all those who share love and concern for the animals,"" the order noted.The court said it is mindful of and sensitive to the concept of coexistence, but stressed that coexistence should not mean one life existing at the cost of another.""As a court, our heart pains equally for everyone. We condemn those who, beneath the cloak of 'love and care' for the voiceless, pursue the warmth of self-congratulation. The directions given by us, as a court which functions for the welfare of the people, are both in the interest of humans as well as dogs. This is not personal,"" it added.""The exercise that we propose to undertake is not to be performed in a casual manner. The burning issue that we have embarked upon is not driven by a momentary impulse,"" the bench said.""On the contrary, it is only after the deepest of deliberations, and having reached the firm conclusion about the systematic failure of the concerned authorities over the past two decades to address an issue that strikes at the heart of public safety that we have decided to take the matter in our hands,"" it added.Noting the rising incidents of dog bites, the bench said this is not the time for resistance or hesitation stemming from complacency. It added that streets should not be places of vulnerability.""Among a bundle of concerns, we are at pains to take cognisance of the experiences of visually-impaired persons, young children, elderly persons, people from a humble background who are not able to afford even a day's meal, let alone the medical expenses. The visually-impaired persons are at the highest risk of dog bites as their primary support, their canes, are seen as threats by the dogs,"" it said.The bench also said there is no way one can identify or classify between a rabies-carrying dog and other dogs.""It is often said that 'no person is above the law'. However, of equal significance is the flip side of that maxim -- 'no person is below the law' either,"" it said.","The Supreme Court has uploaded the full order in suo motu case on the stray dog issue.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016.

The potential mega-tsunami threat

Areas at highest risk of tsunami

Urgency of preparedness for tsunami and earthquake





Scientists are warning of a potentially catastrophic mega-tsunami that could strike parts of the US Pacific Coast, triggered by a major earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). Stretching roughly 600 miles from Northern California to Vancouver Island, this fault line accumulates massive tectonic stress as the Juan de Fuca Plate slides beneath the North American Plate. Researchers from Virginia Tech, led by geoscientist Tina Dura, estimate there is a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 or greater earthquake occurring along the CSZ within the next 50 years.According to their study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, such an event could suddenly sink coastal land by up to 6.5 feet, dramatically expanding floodplains and generating tsunami waves hundreds of feet high, posing unprecedented risks to millions of residents, critical infrastructure, and ecosystems along the West Coast.The Cascadia Subduction Zone is one of North America’s most hazardous fault lines, according to the Virginia Tech research team. Over centuries, tectonic stress builds as the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate is forced beneath the North American Plate. When this stress is released during a major earthquake, coastal regions could experience sudden land subsidence, dramatically increasing floodplain areas and altering shorelines almost instantly.The last great earthquake along this fault occurred in 1700, triggering a tsunami recorded as far away as Japan. The Virginia Tech study emphasizes that a similar event today would have far more devastating effects due to dense populations, developed urban infrastructure, and critical transportation networks along the coast. Researchers warn that rapid inundation could leave little time for evacuation, magnifying the human and economic toll.According to simulations conducted by Dura and her team, a major CSZ earthquake could generate a “mega-tsunami” with waves potentially reaching up to 1,000 feet, far surpassing typical tsunami heights of only a few feet. Coastal cities including Seattle, Portland, and towns in northern California could be submerged within minutes. The Virginia Tech study ran tens of thousands of models, showing that thousands more people, buildings, and miles of roads would be exposed to flooding than current hazard maps predict.Researchers emphasize that such an event would combine sudden ground subsidence with extreme wave heights, creating conditions unlike any historical tsunami in the region. The study highlights the urgent need for improved early-warning systems, evacuation planning, and resilient infrastructure to minimize potential loss of life.The Virginia Tech research identifies southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California as the regions most vulnerable to flooding from a CSZ mega-tsunami. While Alaska and Hawaii also face tsunami risks due to their own seismic activity, they are geographically farther from the CSZ and would experience less immediate threat. Low-lying coastal zones along the fault line could face permanent inundation, particularly when combined with climate-driven sea level rise projected by 2100.The study underscores that communities must prioritize flood-resilient urban planning, fortification of critical infrastructure, and preparation for long-term displacement scenarios. Emergency planners are advised to use the study’s simulations to guide evacuation routes, reinforce hospitals and shelters, and prepare for cascading impacts to energy, water, and transportation systems.Research led by Tina Dura highlights that a Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquake has the potential to generate a large tsunami, making advance planning an important priority. The study notes that while such an event could cause significant impacts, careful preparedness can help reduce risks. Factors such as evacuation planning, stronger building codes, and resilient infrastructure are seen as practical steps to improve community safety. Researchers also point out that rising sea levels may add to future challenges, making coordinated efforts even more important.According to Dura, cooperation between local governments, policymakers, and residents through early-warning systems and community preparedness activities can strengthen resilience. The Virginia Tech study concludes that proactive measures taken today can lessen both human and economic impacts if a major tsunami occurs in the future.","Scientists warn of a potentially catastrophic mega-tsunami that could strike parts of the US Pacific Coast, triggered by a major earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone.

“biased and unfair”,

Brian Flores’ case highlights NFL hiring bias and diversity issues

Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores can now continue his racial discrimination lawsuit against the NFL and three teams in open court. On August 14, 2025, a federal appeals court in New York ruled the league's arbitration process invalid; otherwise, it could have stopped his case. Initially filed in February 2022 against organizations including the New York Giants, Houston Texans, and Denver Broncos, Flores asserted that head coach hiring discriminated against him. This decision allows his ideas to be openly broadcast. According to Flores’ attorneys Douglas Wigdor, David Gottlieb, and John Elefterakis, the NFL’s arbitration is “biased and unfair.”The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan agreed with a 2023 ruling from U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni. Judge Caproni had said Flores’ claims should not be forced into the NFL’s private arbitration, which gives Commissioner Roger Goodell power over disputes. The appeals court confirmed that this arbitration is “plainly unenforceable” because it lacks fairness and independent oversight.Brian Flores’ lawyers- Douglas Wigdor, David Gottlieb, and John Elefterakis called the ruling a major win, saying it is important not just for NFL employees but for all workers seeking fairness and transparency.They said the NFL’s arbitration wasand this decision sends a strong message that such practices cannot continue. NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy responded by saying the league disagrees and plans to appeal the ruling.This is the second legal setback for the NFL in just a few days, after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled against the league on August 11 in former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden’s arbitration case.Claiming NFL teams discriminated against Black applicants for head coach jobs, Brian Flores brought the lawsuit in February 2022. According to the Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview minority candidates, he said that teams like the New York Giants and Houston Texans conducted ""sham interviews.Also Read: Kylie Kelce And Ciara Spark Heated Rivalry Talk After Targeting The Dallas Cowboys Brian Flores contended that this reflects a general bias in the NFL against Black coaches.

Poll Do you think Bengaluru needs more flyovers and elevated corridors to ease traffic? Yes No

Bengaluru: It is not just ordinary citizens who are exasperated by Bengaluru's traffic mess, even DCM DK Shivakumar admitted he gets an earful about it at home.Speaking in the legislative council Thursday, Shivakumar said his children berate him almost every day over the city's crippling congestion and deteriorating road infrastructure.Participating in a debate on the proposed tunnel road project, BJP MLC CT Ravi said Bengaluru has over 1.2 crore registered vehicles, with citizens spending an average of 117 hours a year stuck in traffic.Acknowledging the problem, Shivakumar said around 40 lakh additional vehicles enter the city daily from surrounding districts. ""Bengaluru is not as planned as New Delhi. The road dimensions have remained the same since city founder Kempegowda's time, but vehicle numbers have exploded. It can take six to seven hours to travel just 10-15km. My own kids complain it takes up to three hours to reach some parts of the city and fight with me. High court judges who commute to work from Hebbal have also been complaining that it takes 45 minutes to travel to work,"" he said.Shivakumar noted the city's population has doubled from 70 lakh to 1.4 crore, including 25 lakh tech professionals — nearly double the number in California's Silicon Valley.But road widening, he argued, is nearly impossible given property costs exceeding Rs 10,000 per sqft.Instead, he proposed largescale double-decker flyovers and elevated corridors. Citing a pilot flyover from Ragigudda to Silk Board executed by minister Ramalinga Reddy after a study visit to Pune, Shivakumar said PM Narendra Modi recently appreciated the concept and advised to expand it, even suggesting solar panel coverage.","DCM DK Shivakumar said his children berate him almost every day over traffic.

""With easterly winds to persist and a low-pressure area also building up, we will continue to see scattered light to moderate rains in Delhi over the next three to four days.

The winding river is now home to nearly 442 crocodiles—a staggering 60% increase from 2020, when 275 were counted.""We conducted the census in a scientific manner, carrying out surveys both during the day and at night. A detailed report was submitted to the forest department and the VMC. The findings clearly indicate an increase in the crocodile population,"" said Ritesh Gehlot, former deputy director of the GEER Foundation, who supervised the exercise.Herpetologist Raju Vyas said, ""The crocodiles have fully adapted to the river and its urban ecosystem, despite the rapid growth of human settlements along its banks. A major reason for the substantial rise in their numbers is the abundance of food in the river, coupled with favourable living conditions.""Sayajibaug Zoo curator Pratyush Patankar added, ""Human interference in the Vishwamitri is minimal, as its polluted water is of little direct use to people. Yet, the river supports a healthy fish population that provides ample food for the crocodiles, along with stray dogs and pigs that live along the banks. This is one of the main reasons for their thriving numbers, even though crocodiles are highly territorial.""Although the civic body has banned dumping non-vegetarian food and other waste into the river, the practice continues in certain areas, giving the reptiles easy access to food. While they often prey on stray dogs entering the river, attacks on humans remain rare.Wildlife activist Kartik Upadhyay, who participated in the census, noted, ""A few dozen crocodiles once lived in city lakes, but with several of these lakes either encroached upon or filled in recent years, the reptiles may have migrated to the Vishwamitri, leading to the spike in numbers.""""Though the river has predators like mongooses and monitor lizards that feed on crocodile eggs, the reptiles have still managed to survive and grow in strong numbers,"" Upadhyay added.However, some wildlife experts have voiced concern that such a sharp rise in the crocodile population could increase the risk of human-animal conflicts in the future.","A census carried out in February by the GEER Foundation revealed a significant rise in their population.

Igor Babuschkin , a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the founding members of Elon Musk ’s AI startup xAI , has officially announced his departure to launch a new venture focused on AI safety research and responsible innovation. Babuschkin played a pivotal role in shaping xAI’s technical infrastructure, building engineering teams, and overseeing the development of its Grok chatbot.On August 13, 2025, Babuschkin announced his resignation, writing on X: “Today was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023… Building AI that advances humanity has been my lifelong dream.” Elon Musk replied publicly, “Best of luck, Igor,” a cordial farewell that contrasted with Musk’s often tense relationships with departing executives. With his new firm, Babuschkin Ventures , he aims to fund research and startups developing AI systems that advance humanity while ensuring the technology’s safe and ethical deployment in an increasingly competitive global AI landscape.While Babuschkin has kept much of his personal life private, his career trajectory reflects a consistent passion for advanced machine learning systems and the ethical use of technology. He studied computer science and artificial intelligence, developing a strong foundation in deep learning, neural networks, and natural language processing before entering the tech industry’s most competitive AI labs.As reported by Reuters, Babuschkin’s AI journey began at Google DeepMind, one of the world’s most prestigious research labs known for breakthroughs in AlphaGo and protein-folding prediction. As a research engineer, he contributed to projects pushing the boundaries of reinforcement learning and large language models.Later, he joined OpenAI, working on technical infrastructure that powered the organization’s advanced AI models. This experience exposed him to both the incredible potential and serious risks of powerful AI systems — insights that would later shape his philosophy at xAI and beyond.In 2023, Babuschkin became a founding member of xAI, a company Musk envisioned as a transparent and mission-driven alternative to Big Tech AI platforms. He recalled his first meeting with Musk: As per his tweet on X(formerly Twitter) he shared, “We talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold. We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed. Building AI that advances humanity has been my lifelong dream.”At xAI, Babuschkin played a central role in building the company’s infrastructure, assembling engineering teams, and developing foundational tools used to manage large-scale training jobs. One of his signature achievements was overseeing the creation of the Memphis supercluster — a high-performance computing hub powering xAI’s flagship Grok chatbot.Babuschkin revealed plans to start Babuschkin Ventures, a firm dedicated to:His focus marks a pivot from building AI systems to funding projects that ensure AI’s safe deployment — a move aligned with growing global regulatory interest in AI governance.During his tenure, Babuschkin helped xAI achieve rapid operational milestones, including:Despite its technical progress, xAI faced operational controversies during Babuschkin’s time.The Memphis facility powering Grok’s training relied on natural gas-burning turbines, prompting protests from locals who claimed emissions worsened air quality in West Tennessee. Environmental activists demanded cleaner energy alternatives, highlighting concerns about health risks, increased pollution, and the facility’s impact on vulnerable communities nearby.May 2025: Grok generated false claims about “white genocide” in South Africa after an unauthorised modification to its system prompts.July 2025: A code update led Grok to post antisemitic content, including praise for Adolf Hitler.These incidents prompted public apologies from xAI and drew regulatory scrutiny from the European Union.",Igor Babuschkin is a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the founding members of Elon Musk ’s AI startup xAI.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Dharali-like disasters could become more frequent & deadlier: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/dharali-like-disasters-could-become-more-frequent-deadlier-experts/articleshow/123328747.cms,"Collaboration between scientists and policymakers vital to build resilience in Uttarkashi region: Expert

DEHRADUN: The devastating flash flood that tore through Dharali village in Uttarkashi on Aug 5, leaving dozens missing and entire families displaced, comes amid a sharp escalation of monsoon extremes in Uttarakhand, fuelling concerns that climate change is intensifying the Himalayan state's vulnerability to natural disasters.Experts have cautioned that without urgent adaptation measures, ""disasters like Dharali are likely to become more frequent and more deadly in the years ahead"".Between June 1 and Aug 5 this year, 65% of days - 43 out of 66 - recorded extreme weather events, the highest frequency in four years, far exceeding 59% in 2024, 47% in 2023 and 33% in 2022, according to the Centre for Science and Environment's (CSE) analysis of India's Atlas on Weather Disasters.Since June 1, weather-related incidents across the state have claimed 39 lives, with 13 people still missing - figures that do not include the 43 still unaccounted for in Dharali, as per the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC) of the Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority (USDMA).Professor Anjal Prakash, IPCC author and climate adaptation expert, called the trend “alarming”, saying it reflects the deepening impact of climate change on fragile Himalayan ecosystems.The region’s complex terrain and weather patterns already make it susceptible to intense rainfall and landslides, but warming temperatures, he said, are altering monsoon behaviour and increasing the severity of events.He added that human-driven factors, including deforestation, unplanned development and glacier melt, are compounding the risks. Rivers fed by glacier melt and extreme rainfall are increasingly likely to trigger flash floods, as seen in Dharali.Prakash added that reducing disaster risk will require stronger early warning systems, sustainable land-use planning and afforestation, combined with communitybased preparedness. “Collaboration between scientists and policymakers is vital to build resilience in this fragile region,” Prakash said.Glaciologist DP Dobhal, former scientist at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, warned that climate change is pushing the zerodegree isotherm -the altitude where snowfall occurs -to higher levels. “A decade ago, summer rainfall typically occurred below 4,500 metres, but now it is happening at 5,000-5,200 metres, which is a clear indication of rising temperatures,” he said.Dobhal added that rising temperatures at higher altitudes are accelerating glacier melt, increasing the risk of hazards such as glacier bursts and glacial lake outburst floods.","Dharali flash flood comes amid a sharp escalation of monsoon extremes in Uttarakhand.

Can Myanmar’s 2025 quake data predict the next big one?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/can-myanmars-2025-quake-data-predict-the-next-big-one/articleshow/123328636.cms,"Could seismologists have seen it coming?

Why was the

Mandalay earthquake

so destructive?

Earthquake forecasts, not predictions

Earthquake forecasts still have 'large uncertainties'





Scientists say earthquake prediction is impossible, but studying the 2025 Myanmar earthquake may help forecast when and where the next big tremor could strike.During the midday prayers on March 28, a magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck central Myanmar along the Sagaing Fault.With an epicenter close to Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, it was the most powerful earthquake to strike Myanmar since 1912. It caused widespread destruction of Mandalay's infrastructure while reports have put the death toll between 3,700 and more than 5,000 people.Its seismic impacts reached as far as Bangkok, Thailand's capital, where it collapsed a 30-story skyscraper, claiming at least 92 lives.Scientists had been anticipating a large earthquake along a segment of the fault, which had not ruptured since a similarly destructive earthquake in 1839. But they couldn't predict when the earthquake would hit, its epicenter or how destructive it would be.""Despite decades of effort, scientists still can't reliably predict exactly when and where earthquakes will strike,"" Kit Yates, a mathematician at the University of Bath in the UK, told DW.""The movements and interactions of the Earth's tectonic plates are incredibly complex. Distinguishing meaningful earthquake warning signs from background seismic noise, especially with added human activity, is extremely difficult.""Five months after the Mandalay quake, scientists have been analyzing its destructive effects. Their findings could help predict features of earthquakes in the future.""The hope is that such [findings] might be used to forecast the time, magnitude and extent of future earthquakes,"" said Jean-Philippe Avouac, a seismologist at California Institute of Technology, US, who led a new study published this week in the journal PNAS.Real-time footage of the quake revealed the Sagaing Fault's movement in stunning detail. The Mandalay quake hit like a rapid, pulse-like rupture along the fault line. Beneath people's feet, the ground moved three meters apart in just 1.3 seconds at the epicenter.In total the quake lasted 80 seconds, extending 460km (285 miles) down the fault, causing surface displacement six meters (20 feet) deep.Avouac's team compared this data to past earthquakes with similar features. They then created a computer model that contained several predictions about the Sagaing Fault.The key ingredient of the model was its description of tectonic changes caused by past earthquakes. Avouac described this as a ""memory effect"" in the Sagaing Fault.""This is a nice result to show that our simple model results in a memory effect [and] is consistent with [real world] observations,"" Avouac said.The model confirmed that a ""supershear"" rupture — which has amplified waves in the direction of the split — was anticipated on the fault because of its very straight geometry and its history of similar ruptures.Their model forecasts that large-magnitude earthquakes occur along the Sagaing Fault irregularly and with an interval of around 141 years — meaning the next quake to hit Myanmar could be in 2166, give or take 40 years.The model also identified features of the fault ""slip"" that help refine forecasts about future ruptures.Instead of predicting quakes, seismologists are focused on forecasting seismic activity with better accuracy. Much like weather forecasts, they aim to estimate the likelihood of earthquakes over more extended periods and in specific regions.""There are consistent relationships between the frequency and energy of earthquakes. This allows scientists to estimate how often large quakes might occur based on smaller ones, for which there is more data,"" said Yates.The hope is that models like Avouac's might be used to forecast the time, magnitude and extent of future earthquakes.""Such forecasts are crucial for disaster planning. A city like San Francisco, with a high probability of a major quake in the next 30 years, can justify major investment in preparedness,"" Yates said.Current models ""can only make probabilistic hazard assessments with large uncertainties,"" said Avouac.Avouac said scientists are currently unable to forecast the time, location and magnitude of a future earthquake with enough precision to take action, like order evacuation of a city.Earthquakes are chaotic events, meaning even tiny changes in the initial conditions can lead to unpredictable shifts in seismic activity.""The challenge is that the model needs to be tuned to the state of the fault at present, but we don't know how to measure the distribution of [tectonic] stress, and don't know enough [about] past ruptures to reconstruct them,"" Avouac said.Researchers are currently aiming to better understand how seismic activity can lead to different types of earthquakes in the hope they'll lead to more accurate hazard assessments in the future.","Scientists say earthquake prediction is impossible, but studying the 2025 Myanmar earthquake may help forecast when and where the next big tremor could strike.

Protests mark Hasina’s exit anniversary: Student-led party rallies in Dhaka; calls for new constitution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/protests-mark-hasinas-exit-anniversary-student-led-party-rallies-in-dhaka-calls-for-new-constitution/articleshow/123078902.cms,"Protesters on the streets of Dhaka (AP)





A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

LONDON: A multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but ""time is running out"" to halt the decline, the head of Natural England, which led the initiative, said Wednesday.The public body, responsible for protecting and enhancing England's natural environment, invested a £13 million ($17.6 million) grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole, oystercatcher, lady's slipper orchid, the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon.""From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations,"" the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025.Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence.Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done.""A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country,"" he said in the press release.""We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding. But time is running out fast,"" he added.Juniper called for more projects, more volunteers and more investment, particularly from the private sector.","Multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species.

List of UK cities in drought



UK government's 7 tips on how to save water at home



Install a rain butt to collect rainwater to use in the garden Fix a leaking toilet -- leaky loos can water 200-400 litres a day. Use water from the kitchen to water your plants. Avoid water in your lawn-- brown grass will grow back healthy. Turn off the taps when brushing teeth or shaving. Take shorter showers. Delete old emails and pictures as data centers require vast amounts of water to cool their systems.
