NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming annual UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, representing 134 companies from 27 countries, including India, has urged world leaders to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon resilient economy.The CEO-led alliance, one of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) flagship decarbonisation initiatives, has issued an open letter calling on govts to deepen public-private collaboration to unlock the full potential of the climate economy at a time when the transition is under threat. It underlined the current trajectories that suggest that global warming could exceed 2 degrees Celsius by mid-century, with severe consequences on economies, societies and ecosystems.The Alliance companies have a combined emissions footprint of 5.2 gigatons, accounting for 14% of global emissions — equal to the annual emissions of the US, which second after China. The group represents $4 trillion in revenues and 12 million employees in 134 companies.Tata Steel, Mahindra Group, Infosys, Hindustan Zinc, Dalmia Cement, ReNew and Wipro are among the Indian companies within the alliance, launched alongside the signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change.CEOs of big tech multi-national companies are also part of the group.The WEF noted that these companies reduced aggregate emissions by 12% while growing revenue by 20% from 2019 to 2023, proving that climate action is compatible with driving growth.Their open letter, released by the WEF this month, calls for 13 action areas to accelerate the transition and drive growth. It highlights the need for policymakers to provide more stable frameworks, shorten permitting processes, scale climate finance, support breakthrough technologies, phase out unabated fossil fuels and invest in nature and resilience.“Climate action is no longer just a moral imperative — it is a powerful driver of green growth, innovation and resilience,” said Sebastian Buckup, managing director, Centre for Nature and Climate, WEF. “We urge govts and business leaders to act decisively and accelerate proven solutions so we can unlock the full potential of the climate economy and secure a more prosperous, sustainable future for all. Our work at the forum aims to connect leaders for people, planet and sustainable progress,” the WEF quoted him as saying.The Alliance’s open letter highlights that the corporate leaders across the world have made significant investments in building low-carbon and climate resilient businesses in the recent years, proving that climate initiatives can drive long-term value for business and society.“However, this momentum now faces strong headwinds. The cost of the transition, combined with policy obstacles and uncertainties, fiscal pressures and geopolitical tensions, is slowing the transition. COP30 presents a pivotal moment for business and government to reignite progress towards a more resilient and environmentally sustainable economy,” say the CEOs in their joint open letter to govts.They suggest that the policy-makers can drive growth and create wealth by accelerating the transition by maintaining a stable and predictable policy environment; mitigating the financial risk of private investments and projects; doubling financing and incentives for breakthrough tech; transitioning away from unabated fossil fuels; removing transition obstacles such as lengthy permitting processes; and supporting investments and policies for nature.Their remaining suggestions in the list of 13 proposed actions include building climate-resilient economies and food systems; adopting science-based targets and reporting transparently on progress on emission reduction; working together across the value chain to drive low-emission end products and business models; leveraging efficiency solutions to reduce energy usage, costs and emissions; strengthen innovation and digital solutions; support creation of demand signals; and investment in climate adaptation and resilience.","Tata Steel, Mahindra Group, Infosys, Hindustan Zinc, Dalmia Cement, ReNew and Wipro are among the Indian companies within the alliance.

SC praises ED for restitution of flats to 213 homebuyers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-praises-ed-for-restitution-of-flats-to-213-homebuyers/articleshow/124695237.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has praised the restitution of flats to at least 213 homebuyers who had waited for more than 12 years to get possession of properties they had paid for.The restituted properties are part of 354 flats, 17 commercial units and two plots in Royal Rajvilas project in Udaipur — together worth over Rs 175 crore — restored by Enforcement Directorate to victims of a ‘scam’ in which project promoters had allegedly swindled over Rs 1,267 crore of Syndicate Bank, now Canara Bank.SC lauded ED for helping the homebuyers. The agency had attached Royal Rajvilas after the project got entangled in multiple cases of fraud, cheating and money laundering. ED later approached Rajasthan HC, and subsequently, the apex court seeking to withdraw its attachment partially and restore the properties to the fraud victims.“We place on record our appreciation for the efforts made by the learned counsels for parties and ED in restoring the attached properties to secure the interests of genuine and innocent homebuyers,” an SC bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and Alok Aradhe said.ED verified the details of 221 homebuyers and submitted ‘no objection’ in restitution of the properties to homebuyers, except in case of eight, which were marked as beneficiaries of “proceeds of crime”.The restitution will help the 213 homebuyers who had been in throes of anxiety because of protracted litigation of over seven years between the successful resolution applicant Udaipur Entertainment World Pvt Ltd and ED. SC has, however, clarified that it has passed the order on the peculiar facts of the case without going into the merits, and so it shall not be treated as a precedent and questions of law shall remain open to be decided in an appropriate case.","SC lauded ED for helping the homebuyers.

DK Shivakumar hits back at corporate honchos over Bengaluru infrastructure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dk-shivakumar-hits-back-at-corporate-honchos-over-bengaluru-infrastructure/articleshow/124695225.cms,"Karnataka Deputy CM DK Shivakumar Sparks Row By Singing RSS Anthem In Assembly, Then Clarifies

BENGALURU: The feud between Karnataka deputy CM DK Shivakumar and two of Bengaluru’s most prominent corporate captains — Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and former Infosys director TV Mohandas Pai — escalated Sunday over the city’s crumbling infrastructure.Mazumdar-Shaw hit back at Shivakumar’s remarks that those criticising govt’s handling of Bengaluru’s civic issues had a “personal agenda” and had remained silent during previous administrations.“Not true. Both TV Mohandas Pai and I have criticised deteriorating infrastructure in our city to previous BJP and JD(S) govts. Our agenda is to clean up and restore roads,” she wrote on X, tagging the deputy CM’s statement.Pai amplified her remarks, reposting several comments slamming the poor state of roads and public infrastructure.Unfazed, Shivakumar said industrialists who built their fortunes in Bengaluru were now turning against the city. “They are forgetting their humble beginnings and how the city helped them grow. We should not forget our roots,” read a statement from his office after his ‘Walk with Bengaluru’ event.He listed ongoing infrastructure projects — tunnel roads, elevated corridors, double-decker flyovers, and buffer roads — costing more than Rs 1 lakh crore, claiming they aim for “integrated development” of the city.“We have formed five corporations to take governance closer to people,” he added.Later in the day, Mazumdar-Shaw softened her tone and responded positively to the Ejipura flyover project update. “This is a positive development which will greatly relieve traffic congestion and has been 10 years in the making, which previous BJP and JD(S) govts did not prioritise. Putting this on a priority track is a good move by DK Shivakumar,” she posted on X.The public spat underscored growing frustration among Bengaluru’s business bosses and citizens over chronic traffic snarls, delayed civic projects, and governance gridlock in India’s technology capital.For his part, Pai had said the city’s infrastructure was “lagging 10-15 years behind its growth”. He stressed that citizens had the right to demand better infrastructure and criticise govt, saying “ministers are representatives, not ‘maliks’ who should fear free speech — they must listen”",Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and former Infosys director TV Mohandas Pai clashed over the city's crumbling infrastructure.

Silver market crisis 2025: Panic in London! How the market broke – Is demand in India the cause?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/silver-market-crisis-2025-panic-in-london-how-the-market-broke-is-india-to-blame/articleshow/124693366.cms,"Silver market crisis 2025:

Silver Shines Brighter Than Gold This Dhanteras Amid High Prices

Is India leading the buying frenzy?

London in panic!





The perfect storm





Is India to blame?









The global silver market is facing its most severe crisis in decades, and for once, the epicenter of the turmoil isn’t just Wall Street or London— Is India to blame?As the country celebrated Diwali, millions of people flocked to buy silver, turning a seasonal ritual into a market-breaking frenzy. For Vipin Raina, head of trading at MMTC-Pamp India Pvt, the scale of demand was unprecedented.Raina had been preparing for months for a surge in silver purchases by Indian customers ahead of Diwali, the festival honouring the goddess of wealth. But when it came, it blew everything away. His company, India’s largest precious metals refinery, ran out of silver stock for the first time in its history.“Most people who are dealing silver and silver coins, they’re literally out of stock because silver is not there,” Raina, who is head of trading at MMTC-Pamp India Pvt, told Bloomberg.“This kind of crazy market — where people are buying at these levels — I have not seen in my 27-year career,” Raina added.While India’s Diwali demand is usually gold-heavy, this year saw silver take the spotlight. Social media and market hype fueled the shift. According to the Bloomberg report, investment banker and content creator Sarthak Ahuja, with nearly 3 million followers, promoted silver as the “next big buy” after gold’s historic rally.“It’s never been like this before. The demand this time for silver has been humongous,” Amit Mittal, GM at M.D. Overseas Bullion told Bloomberg.Premiums for silver in India surged above $5 an ounce, far exceeding the usual few cents above international prices. Dealers in Mumbai reported bidding wars, with buyers prioritizing availability over cost.But the frenzy for silver wasn’t confined to India. Global investors and hedge funds joined the surge, betting on a weaker US dollar or simply following the unstoppable rally. By early October, JPMorgan Chase, a key supplier to the Indian market, warned clients that it had no silver to deliver for October, with the next availability only in November.The buying spree hit London, the global hub for silver trading. Traders described a market “all but broken” as banks struggled to quote prices amid repeated client calls and thin liquidity. Robin Kolvenbach, co-CEO of Argor-Heraeus, said, “There is more or less little to no liquidity actually available in terms of leases in London. We have basically stopped all silver intake that is not committed contractually.”The spike in silver prices reached $54 an ounce, before tumbling 6.7%, reflecting extreme stress across the market. Analysts compared it to historical crises, including the Hunt brothers’ attempt to corner the market in 1980, underscoring the severity of the situation.The 2025 silver crisis was not triggered by a single factor but by a convergence of events that drained global inventories and pushed the market to the brink. India’s Diwali demand played a key role, as millions of buyers turned to silver instead of gold, creating unprecedented pressure on domestic and international supplies.Over the past five years, silver demand has consistently exceeded supply from mines and recycled sources, driven largely by a solar industry boom using silver in photovoltaic cells.Since 2021, demand has outstripped supply by 678 million ounces, while London’s total inventories stood at around 1.1 billion ounces at the start of 2021, according to the Silver Institute.Market stress intensified this year as traders rushed to front-run potential U.S. tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, moving over 200 million ounces of silver into New York warehouses.Adding to the pressure, more than 100 million ounces flowed into global silver ETFs through September, as heightened investor demand for precious metals fueled a rally that also propelled gold past $4,000 an ounce for the first time in history. This coincided with a surge in investment demand through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), part of the so-called “debasement trade,” as investors sought a hedge against a weakening US dollar.The combined effect of these forces left London’s free-floating silver reserves, metal not tied up in ETFs—dropping to less than 150 million ounces, far below the daily trading volume of roughly 250 million ounces.Even in ideal circumstances, moving silver from Comex to London can take four days, but delays at customs and complex supply chains left traders exposed to high costs when contracts couldn’t be fulfilled on time. Comex inventories fell by more than 20 million ounces in two weeks, the largest drop in 25 years, benefiting logistics firms but stressing the market further.According to the Bloomberg report, some traders hesitated due to the risk of new tariffs on critical minerals, while TD Securities analyst Daniel Ghali noted that the London market had been primed for a squeeze for over a year.After the frenzy peaked, silver prices plunged more than 5% following signs of improving US-China relations, with Ghali suggesting further pressure may ease as silver flows in from New York and China.“The logistics were a little more complex than we initially assumed,” Ghali said. “We certainly did not expect the scale of the retail-buying bonanza across the globe that ensued while the London market was getting squeezed.”At the same time, China, a key supplier of silver, was on a week-long holiday, reducing the flow of metal into global markets.In essence, a perfect storm had formed: festive demand, industrial growth, investment mania, and trade-related hoarding converged, creating a market under extreme stress and unprecedented volatility, reported Bloomberg.While India’s Diwali buying played a major role, the crisis also reflects structural supply-demand imbalances built over years. Since 2021, silver demand has outpaced supply by 678 million ounces, largely due to industrial demand and ETF accumulation.Yet, the timing and scale of India’s purchases acted as the catalyst, turning an already tight market into a full-blown global squeeze, the Bloomberg report said. Analysts like Satish Dondapati, fund manager at Kotak Asset Management, point to the FOMO factor. “Analysts, bullion dealers were all giving bullish calls on silver in Indian media in a way that has not happened in the last 14 years. The FOMO factor has worked,"" Dondapati stated.The silver market remains under stress as the world waits for sufficient deliveries to ease the crunch. While regulators like the London Bullion Market Association have not intervened, citing genuine supply shortages rather than logistics issues, the current situation underscores the fragility of global metals markets in a hyper-connected world.","India's largest precious metals refinery ran out of silver stock for the first time in its history.

Tata Motors demerger: What does it mean for investors & why did the share price drop 40%?

What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

"EPFO final settlement period extended: PF withdrawal now after 12 months, pension after 36 months; what it means for members",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/epfo-final-settlement-period-extended-pf-withdrawal-now-after-12-months-pension-after-36-months-what-it-means-for-members/articleshow/124554802.cms,"



EPFO subscribers take note! The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members. Under the revised rules, members can now withdraw their provident fund after 12 months of unemployment and their pension after 36 months, PTI reported.The change was approved by the apex decision-making body of the EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, chaired by Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, during a meeting held on Monday. Earlier, the scheme allowed full withdrawals from both accounts after just two months of continuous unemployment.A senior official explained PTI that the move aims to ensure social security for formal sector workers who typically exit the EPFO after two months of unemployment. “Most of these unemployed youth need to enrol again when they secure new jobs and lose chances of earning pension and other benefits, as an account becomes pensionable only after a combined service of 10 years or more,” the official said.The ministry said the revision will also allow partial withdrawals, enabling members to meet immediate financial needs without affecting their retirement savings or pension entitlements.Additionally, a provision has been introduced to maintain a minimum balance of 25 per cent of contributions in members’ accounts at all times.“This will enable members to enjoy the high interest rate currently offered by the EPFO, 8.25 per cent per annum, along with compounding benefits to build a sizeable retirement corpus,” the statement added.The rationalisation is intended to improve ease of access while ensuring members maintain a sufficient retirement fund over the long term.","EPFO has extended the period for final settlement or full withdrawal of funds from provident fund and pension accounts for unemployed members.

Upgrading strike capability: India tests 800-km BrahMos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/upgrading-strike-capability-india-tests-800-km-brahmos/articleshow/124694864.cms,"‘Pinpoint Accuracy’ Rajnath Singh Praises BrahMos Precision During Operation Sindoor

NEW DELHI: In what will be a major boost for its precision strike capabilities, India plans to begin inducting the new 800-km extended range BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles in a little over two years, while over 200km Astra air-to-air missiles are also slated for production in 2026-27.Tests are underway for the 800-km BrahMos, with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades, to ensure the conventional (non-nuclear) missile is fully ready by end-2027, top defence sources told TOI.The existing 450-km range BrahMos missiles, which fly at almost three times the speed of sound at Mach 2.8, were launched from Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets for the targeted strikes deep into Pakistan under Operation Sindoor in May. “The 800-km BrahMos is more or less developed in terms of the modifications to its ramjet engine. A few more tests are required to test the efficacy of its combination of internal INS (inertial navigation system) and external global navigation satellite systems to ensure high accuracy, resilience and resistance to jamming,” a source said.Navy, for instance, can then begin upgrading the existing 450-km BrahMos missiles on its frontline warships to the 800-km variant, with just some tweaking of the software, the ‘graphical user interface’ of the fire control system and the like.“With the basic missile and launcher remaining the same, Navy and Army will first begin inducting the 800-km missile. The air-launched version will take slightly longer,” the source said.Parallelly, DRDO is increasing the beyond visual range (BVR) of Astra Mark-2 missiles to over 200km from the earlier 160km, while IAF is inducting over 280 Astra Mark-1 missiles with 100km range.“Along with trajectory shaping, the propulsion system is being upgraded to generate more thrust and burn for a longer time. If the trials are successful, Astra Mark-2 production can begin in six months. Otherwise, it will take a longer,” another source said.IAF has already finalised the plan to induct an initial 700 Astra Mark-2 missiles for its Sukhoi-30MKI and Tejas jets. There is also an Astra Mark-3 on the way, with solid-fuel ducted ramjet (SFDR) propulsion to increase the range to 350kmm but it will take three years to become operational. The all-weather day and night capable Astra series of missiles are crucial because they will eventually replace the expensive Russian, French and Israeli BVR air-to-air missiles (BVRAAMs) that are imported to arm IAF fighters.During its strikes on the nine terror hubs on May 7, IAF was initially caught off-guard by Pakistan’s use of Chinese-origin jets like J-10s armed with PL-15 BVRAAMs with ranges over 200km, as was reported by TOI earlier.The BrahMos air-to-ground missiles launched from stand-off distances were, however, an unqualified success. The total value of the deals inked with Indo-Russian joint venture BrahMos Aerospace has crossed Rs 58,000 crore over the years, with the missiles becoming the prime conventional precision strike weapons for IAF, Navy and Army.In March last year, for instance, defence ministry had inked the largest-ever Rs 19,519 crore deal for procurement of over 220 BrahMos missiles for Navy. Around 20 warships, including the latest destroyers and frigates, are already armed with the vertical-launched BrahMos missiles.After Sindoor, the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council in Aug had also given the preliminary nod for IAF to get another 110 air-launched BrahMos missiles for around Rs 10,800 crore.The land variant of the 800-km BrahMos missiles will also eventually be part of the proposed Integrated Rocket Force (IRF), along with the Pralay ballistic missiles (400-km range) and long-range land-attack cruise missiles (derivatives of the original Nirbhay missiles with 1,000-km range), among others.","Tests are underway for the 800-km BrahMos, with a modified ramjet engine and other upgrades.

Delhi air turns toxic again: GRAP Stage II curbs kick in; AQI crosses 300,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-air-turns-toxic-again-grap-stage-ii-curbs-kick-in-aqi-crosses-300/articleshow/124689532.cms,"Stop Ignoring The AQI Index: Long Exposure To Polluted Air Can Increase Your Risk Of Heart Attack

NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Saturday invoked Stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR after air quality showed a sharp deterioration, crossing into the ‘very poor’ category. The decision follows an emergency review by the Sub-Committee on GRAP, which observed a steady rise in pollution levels through the day.According to the order, “The AQI of Delhi has shown an increasing trend since morning and has been recorded as 296 at 4.00pm and 302 at 7.00pm. The forecast by IMD/IITM also predicts further deterioration of AQI in the coming days.” The Sub-Committee, therefore, decided to implement all measures under Stage II of GRAP with immediate effect, in addition to those already active under Stage I.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed Delhi’s overall Air Quality Index at 296 on Sunday afternoon—just below the ‘very poor’ threshold of 301. Of the 38 monitoring stations across the capital, 12 reported ‘very poor’ air quality, with Anand Vihar topping the chart at a severe 430. Other hotspots included Wazirpur (364), Vivek Vihar (351), Dwarka (335), and RK Puram (323).The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported maximum and minimum temperatures of 33.3°C and 20.6°C respectively, with humidity touching 91% by evening.Misty conditions are expected on Monday morning, though temperatures are likely to remain steady.Residents have begun expressing frustration over the annual spike in pollution. “Just like every year, pollution in Delhi persists… It causes difficulty in breathing, especially for cyclists like me,” said Aryan Gupta, a resident of Rohini. He attributed the worsening smog to vehicle emissions, stubble burning, and seasonal fireworks, saying that “closing schools and colleges are temporary solutions.”Stage II, applicable when AQI ranges between 301 and 400, includes intensified dust control, public transport expansion, and restrictions on diesel generator sets. Authorities have ordered daily mechanical sweeping and water sprinkling on roads, especially in high-traffic areas.Power supply agencies have been directed to ensure uninterrupted electricity to curb DG set usage. Public transport services—including buses and metro trains—will be augmented, and parking fees increased to discourage private vehicle use.The CAQM also urged Resident Welfare Associations to provide electric heaters to outdoor staff to prevent open burning of waste or biomass. Additionally, only CNG, electric, or BS-VI diesel inter-state buses will be allowed into Delhi.","The Commission for Air Quality Management invoked Stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR.

The new JD(U) constituency





From inclusion to isolation

India's political history is packed with turning points, each shaping the course of the next decade. And a very few years proved as crucial as 2013. That summer, two decisions were made within a week, which seemed to rewire Indian politics.On June 9, the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) named Narendra Modi the head of its 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign committee, effectively setting him on the path to the prime minister's office.Just seven days later, on June 16, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar walked out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), bringing down the curtain on a 17-year partnership that had helped him rise to power. Three months later, on September 13, BJP formally declared Modi as its prime ministerial candidate.Nitish struck back, calling Modi a ""divisive"" leader and remarking that the BJP’s decision reflected ""(when misfortune strikes, judgment falters). Political observers saw the break as more than a clash of personalities.Some read it as Nitish’s effort to protect his Muslim vote base in Bihar from the polarising politics associated with Modi's BJP. Others believed it was a calculated move to keep his own prime ministerial hopes alive.Cut to 2025. Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), once the dominant partner in Bihar’s NDA, will this time contest the assembly elections on equal footing with the BJP, with 101 seats each.What stands out even more is who gets those tickets. Of JD(U)’s 101 candidates this time, only four are Muslims. The sharp contrast between the Nitish of 2013 and the Nitish of 2025 begs a single question: What changed?Nitish Kumar's evolution from the inclusionist of 2005 to the realist of 2025 is not a sudden shift. It is the outcome of two decades of political recalibration shaped by alliances, arithmetic, and survival instincts.When Nitish came to power in 2005, his slogan ""(development with justice) was aimed at building a broad coalition that could counter the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s ( RJD ) Muslim-Yadav base.Muslims, who make up around 17 per cent of Bihar’s population, were key to this equation.In his early years, JD(U) fielded 8–10 Muslim candidates, and several of them, like Jama Khan and Aslam Azad, won. Nitish’s outreach to Pasmanda (backwards) Muslims and welfare schemes such as scholarships, hostels, and minority commissions earned him goodwill.By 2010, JD(U) had fielded 14 Muslim candidates, the highest in its history, underscoring Nitish’s attempt to project himself as a centrist who could balance development with inclusivity even while in alliance with the BJP.The split with the BJP in 2013 was presented as a stand on ""secular values,"" but it also had a clear political logic. Nitish sought to preserve his minority base at a time when Narendra Modi was rising at the national level and being projected as anti-minority by the opposition.In the 2015 assembly elections, JD(U) allied with the RJD and Congress, giving thegrand alliance) a strong secular image. Although JD(U) itself fielded only 6–7 Muslim candidates (due to seat-sharing), Muslim representation across the alliance was healthy, and Nitish’s image as a moderate remained intact.Nitish's 2017 return to the BJP-led NDA marked the beginning of a slow but clear retreat from minority politics. By then, BJP dominance had grown both nationally and in Bihar, and Nitish's political leverage had shrunk.Muslim voters, disillusioned by his flip-flops, shifted decisively toward the RJD. For JD(U), Muslim candidates now offer little electoral dividend.In the 2020 Bihar elections, JD(U) fielded just 5 Muslim candidates, down from double digits a decade earlier. By 2025, that number stands at 4, the lowest since the party’s formation.JD(U)'s declining Muslim representation also mirrors the changing power equation within the NDA. Nitish, once the “big brother” in Bihar's alliance, now contests the same number of seats as the BJP, a symbolic indication of how much ground he has ceded.Within such a coalition, there's limited room for independent social engineering. The BJP's voter base is heavily majoritarian, and Nitish's attempt to retain Muslim representation risks unsettling that core. His reduced ticket allocation is as much about coalition management as it is about electoral realism.Today, Nitish leans on what party insiders call his ""3W"" base -- women, weaker castes, and welfare beneficiaries.His welfare measures for women, EBCs, and Mahadalits have replaced the old caste-plus-community model with a beneficiary-driven one. In this arithmetic, Muslim representation matters less; welfare visibility matters more.Two decades ago, Nitish Kumar’s politics revolved around bringing people in. Today, it’s about holding ground. His reduced Muslim outreach does not seem to be driven by hostility, but by calculation.At the centenary celebration of the Bihar Madrasa Education Board on August 21, 2025, CM Nitish Kumar made headlines for what he didn’t do. He declined to wear the muslim headgear offered to him on stage.It was a striking image, not least because a decade earlier, Nitish had taunted Narendra Modi for the same gesture. “To run the country, you have to take everyone along,” Nitish had said then, “at times you will have to wear a topi, at times a tilak.”Back then, it was Nitish jabbing Modi on inclusion. This time, it was Modi’s old line that seemed to echo louder, the one he’d delivered in a television interview: “Muslim children should get better education and ideally, they should have the Quran in one hand and a computer in the other.”At that moment, the roles had reversed. The man who once preached symbolism now sidestepped it.Nitish Kumar's journey captures the arc of India’s coalition-era politics itself, from the optimism of inclusion to the pragmatism of survival.His shift seems to be less about ideology and more about adaptation in an age where political space is shrinking for those who once thrived in the middle.For Bihar’s Muslims, the story of Nitish Kumar is no longer about trust lost or gained, but about a leader who adjusted to the times and, in doing so, quietly redrew the boundaries of his own politics.","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar walked out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in 2013. The split with the BJP in 2013 was presented as a stand on ""secular values,"" but it also had a clear political logic.

The HC rejected his arguments.The ED investigation began based on complaints and reports from other agencies, including Income Tax department, Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), and Economic Offences Wing (EOW), between 2022 and 2024.ED conducted a detailed search at Baghel's premises on Mar 10 and recorded reasons to believe that Chaitanya was involved in money laundering. However, the arrest was delayed by over four months and was precipitated primarily based on statements from a co-accused, Lakshmi Narayan Bansal, who remains at large despite a permanent arrest warrant issued against him on May 19.The petitioner’s counsel argued that there was no necessity to arrest Baghel as he was never summoned to cooperate in the investigation.","Chhattisgarh high court has rejected the petition filed by former chief minister Bhupesh Baghel’s son, Chaitanya Baghel, challenging his arrest by Enforcement Directorate (ED) The ED investigation began based on complaints and reports from other agencies between 2022 and 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124695104,imgsize-744366,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

Those organising live events will soon be able to go online to check venue availability, capacity, pre-approved licences, and get clearance within 15 days through a new single-window digital portal being rolled out by the information and broadcasting ministry.This was decided at the joint working group meeting — renamed Live Events Development Cell — this week to make event organisation in India faster, simpler and more transparent.The cell brings together central ministries, nine state govts, leading industry associations and stakeholders under a common framework to streamline permissions, promote creative employment and establish India as a global live entertainment hub. “The portal, expected to go live by Oct-end, will provide end-to-end digital facilitation — from checking available venues and seating capacities to verifying pre-cleared licences and applicable tariffs,” said senior I&B ministry officials, adding that this has been done to remove redundant permissions and overlapping approvals that have long delayed event organisation in the country.The live events industry, valued at over Rs 20,800 crore in FY25, grew 15% in the past year and is projected to double by 2030, according to a white paper, titled ‘India’s Live Events Economy: A Strategic Growth Imperative’, released earlier this year at the WAVES-2025 summit. The sector could generate 15-20 million direct and indirect jobs by 2030, spanning roles in logistics, hospitality, event management, performance and technical services.A model framework is also being prepared by the ministry to serve as a citizen charter, laying out time-bound clearances and grievance redressal mechanisms.The initiative follows PM Narendra Modi’s remarks at the Utkarsh Odisha Summit earlier this year, where he cited the example of international concerts, like Coldplay’s performances in India, as opportunities to harness the country’s growing youth-driven concert culture for economic, employment and cultural growth.The joint working group, chaired by the I&B Secretary, includes representatives from the ministries of culture, sports, skill development, DPIIT, finance, and tourism, as well as govts of Maharashtra, Assam, Delhi, Telangana, Karnataka, and others.","Organisers of live events will soon be able to go online to check venue availability, capacity, pre-approved licences, and get clearance within 15 days.

Government to consider providing highway builders with additional funds for BOT projects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-consider-providing-highway-builders-with-additional-funds-for-bot-projects/articleshow/124691810.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The government is looking to provide additional funds to highway builders to make projects under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model more financially viable, allowing private players to recover their investments through toll collection.Currently, such funding, known as Viability Gap Funding (VGF), is capped at 40% of the project cost. TOI has learnt that under the proposed plan, VGF beyond the 40% cap would be paid by highway authorities in instalments, through annuity payments.The matter was discussed at a high-level committee meeting held recently at NITI Aayog . A framework for the revised VGF mechanism will be developed, as the government is keen to attract more private investment in the infrastructure sector, sources said.The timing of the proposal is significant, considering that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the highways ministry are finalising an overhaul of the contract document for projects built under Build Operate and Transfer (BOT-Toll) mode to attract more investment in the highway sector. The NHAI leads among agencies with the maximum number of BOT-Toll projects (182), of which 25% have had to be terminated.Officials said the government has modified several provisions in the contract document to make the highway sector more attractive to investors. More changes are being made after getting feedback from private highway builders and project financing entities, including the proposal to make 95% of land available before start of construction work in BOT-Toll projects.“Provisions will be introduced to compensate for revenue shortfall annually, with a cap on such payment, if actual traffic flow is 10% less than the projected traffic in the first seven years and the concession period to collect toll would be increased or reduced by linking it to rise or fall in traffic. Now with FASTag tolling, there is hardly any scope for reporting wrong traffic data,” said an official.Modifications have also been proposed for termination payment by highway agencies to protect lenders’ interests. In a move aimed at curbing accidents, failure to correct faults to prevent recurrence of road crashes will be treated as a “default” by concessionaires.Striking a balancing act, the road transport ministry has also proposed to compensate private highway builders for delay on the part of NHAI and other agencies, including interest on debt due and operation and maintenance expenses, and through extension of contract period.","Currently, such funding, known as Viability Gap Funding (VGF), is capped at 40% of the project cost.

Nearest Amer Centre in Dubai – for in-person support and document submission.





In a landmark initiative that underscores the UAE’s growing emphasis on humanitarianism and social sustainability, the country has announced that donors to Islamic endowments known as Waqf will now be eligible for the coveted UAE Golden Visa.The decision was unveiled following a strategic agreement signed between the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs – Dubai (GDRFA-Dubai) and the Endowments and Minors Affairs Foundation (Awqaf Dubai). The announcement came during GITEX GLOBAL 2025, one of the region’s largest technology and innovation exhibitions, held at the Dubai World Trade Centre.The initiative now enables both UAE residents and international donors to obtain a 10-year renewable Golden Visa under the specific category of “Financial Supporters of Humanitarian Work”, as clearly laid out in Cabinet Resolution No. 65 of 2022. The move is specifically aimed at encouraging high-impact charitable giving, positioning Dubai as a global hub of generosity, tolerance, and community-driven innovation.Officials say the Golden Visa will not just serve as a token of appreciation for philanthropists, but also as a strategic tool to attract global supporters of sustainable humanitarian work worldwide.“This agreement represents a pioneering model of government integration that empowers endowers to play a vital role in community development,” said Lt.Gen. Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, Director General of GDRFA-Dubai.Waqf, in Islamic tradition, refers to a perpetual charitable endowment. This could be in the form of land, buildings, cash, or other valuable assets set aside for public benefit—such as supporting education, healthcare, or religious institutions. The key feature of Waqf is that once donated, the asset cannot be sold or inherited. Instead, it is managed sustainably, with its revenue used for community development.In the UAE, Waqf is regulated and promoted by Awqaf Dubai, which ensures all endowments are Sharia-compliant, transparent, and channelled into meaningful causes.To qualify for the Golden Visa under this new category, donors must fulfil several conditions:According to officials, the scheme is expected to boost charitable contributions while offering donors several tangible benefits:Awqaf Dubai Secretary-General Ali Mohammed Al Mutawa called the initiative a “natural extension of Dubai’s vision to position endowment work as a key partner in sustainable development.”The Golden Visa scheme for Waqf donors is being seen as a forward-thinking policy that not only aligns with Islamic charitable values but also resonates with the UAE’s long-term vision of sustainable, human-centered growth.It also broadens the appeal of the Golden Visa, which is already available to investors, scientists, entrepreneurs, and outstanding professionals in fields like medicine and engineering.Officials believe the latest addition will attract global philanthropists, foster cross-border partnerships in social development, and further establish the UAE as a beacon of generosity and inclusive progress.With this strategic move, the UAE is strongly reinforcing its long-term commitment to becoming a leading global humanitarian capital. The innovative partnership between GDRFA-Dubai and Awqaf Dubai is also expected to usher in a new era of digitally-enabled, impactful social initiatives, wherein charitable giving is not just encouraged but actively integrated into national development policy.Those interested can begin by visiting:","United Arab Emirates announced new Golden Visa for Waqf donors.

Explained: What was Saudi Arabia’s Kafala system and why its abolition is a historic moment for migrant workers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/explained-what-was-saudi-arabias-kafala-system-and-why-its-abolition-is-a-historic-moment-for-migrant-workers/articleshow/124689473.cms,"Saudi Arabia’s labour reforms mark a major shift, easing worker mobility and reducing Kafala dependency to promote fair employment rights / Illustration generated by AI

What was the Kafala system?

Change employers

Leave the country (many needed an “exit visa”)

Seek legal recourse if abused

Why was it so controversial?

Around 13.4 million migrant workers live in Saudi Arabia, nearly 42% of the population.

Millions come from South and Southeast Asia, including India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.

An estimated 4 million are domestic workers, often isolated and vulnerable to abuse.

Why is Saudi Arabia abolishing it now?

What’s changed under the new system?

Freedom to change jobs: Workers can move to a new employer without needing approval from their current one.

Freedom to exit: They can leave the country without an exit visa or sponsor consent.

Legal protections: Workers will have improved access to labour courts and complaint mechanisms.

How much will life really change?

Implementation gaps remain: many employers still demand consent for job changes or control exit visas.

Domestic workers among the most vulnerable may not benefit equally from new protections.

Recruitment abuses in origin countries (like high fees and contract substitution) are still common and not addressed by Saudi law.

Why this matters





For over half a century, a single word defined the lives of millions of foreign workers in the Gulf: kafala, Arabic for “sponsorship.” It decided whether they could change jobs, whether they could leave the country, and whether they could fight back against abuse. It was a system critics compared to “modern-day slavery.”Now, for the first time in 50 years, that system has officially been abolished in Saudi Arabia, where roughly 13 million foreign workers make up the backbone of the economy. But what exactly was the kafala system? Why was it so controversial? And how much will life really change for those who lived under it? The kafala system was a legal framework that governed the employment and residency of migrant workers across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. It emerged in the 1950s, when oil-rich economies needed cheap labour to build cities and infrastructure but wanted to avoid granting permanent residency or citizenship.Under kafala, a foreign worker’s legal status was tied entirely to their employer, or kafeel. This sponsor controlled their visa, their right to live in the country, and often their ability to change jobs or even exit the country. Without the sponsor’s approval, workers could not:The system was designed to minimise state bureaucracy and regulate labour through private sponsors.But in practice, it created an enormous power imbalance. Employers could confiscate passports, withhold wages, or threaten deportation, and workers had almost no way to challenge them.Over the decades, kafala became one of the most criticised labour systems in the world. Human rights groups and the International Labour Organization (ILO) accused Gulf governments of enabling forced labour and human trafficking under the guise of sponsorship.Because workers risked arrest or deportation if they left their jobs without permission, many remained in exploitative or abusive situations — particularly in domestic work, construction, and agriculture. In extreme cases, NGOs documented conditions resembling indentured servitude.The scale was staggering:The decision to abolish kafala, announced in June 2025, is part of Vision 2030, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s sweeping plan to diversify the Saudi economy, attract foreign investment, and modernise its global image.The move also reflects mounting international pressure. Ahead of high-profile events and partnerships, Gulf states have faced criticism from global rights groups, Western governments, and even multinational companies over their labour records. Qatar, for instance, introduced partial reforms ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Saudi Arabia says it is replacing kafala with a contract-based employment system that aims to restore agency to workers. Key changes include:Officials say the reforms will boost productivity, reduce exploitation, and improve Saudi Arabia’s reputation among investors and the international community.The announcement is a breakthrough but experts caution that legal reforms alone won’t end abuse overnight.Rights groups point out that:“Changing the law is the first step,” says Human Rights Watch. “Changing the reality on the ground will take much longer.”For millions of migrant workers from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, the Philippines, and beyond, the end of kafala is more than just legal reform, it’s a restoration of basic rights long denied. The ability to walk away from an abusive employer, to leave the country freely, or to seek justice without fear marks a fundamental shift in how Gulf economies treat the workers who sustain them.For Saudi Arabia, it’s a signal to the world that the kingdom is serious about modernisation and understands that economic reform must go hand in hand with human rights reform. But as activists note, this is not the end of the kafala story — it’s the beginning of a new chapter. The true test will be whether Saudi Arabia enforces these rights in practice and whether other Gulf states follow its lead.The abolition of the kafala system is undoubtedly one of the most significant labour reforms in the modern Middle East in recent decades. It promises freedom, dignity, and legal protection to millions of vulnerable migrant workers, but the gap between law and lived reality remains a challenge that will ultimately define the next phase of the Gulf’s labour history.","Kafala was a legal framework that governed the employment and residency of migrant workers across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.

Income tax refund: Is your tax refund delayed?

How to check income tax refund status:

Why your income tax refund may be delayed: Top Reasons

(Amarpal S. Chadha is Tax Partner at EY India and Shanmuga Prasad is Director at EY India)





ITR filing FY 2024-25 income tax refund status: With improved technology and faster processing systems, income-tax refunds are now issued more quickly than ever. However, if for some reason the refund is getting delayed, there are simple ways to track where your money is and when it will reach you.The quickest place to start is the Income-Tax e-Filing portal: log in with PAN and password, go to e-File → Income Tax Returns → View Filed Returns and check the status of return processing against the relevant assessment year. Once the status shows as tax return is processed with either refund or tax payable, the same can be cross checked in the intimation which is sent by the Tax Department to the taxpayers via email or can be downloaded from the e-filing portal.In case the refund status is shown as processed with refund due, the next step is to check if the refund determined has been released or not. This can be checked on the e-filing portal in the Services → Know your refund status by entering the relevant Assessment Year. However, not all refund status can be checked by following this process. For example, if refund due has been determined on or before 31st March 2023 (typically refunds relating to Assessment Year 2022-23 or prior), refund status cannot be checked through this service, but through the NSDL/TIN portal (https://tin.tin.nsdl.com/oltas/refund-status-pan.html) by entering the PAN and assessment year.If your refund is delayed, do check for reasons: sometimes the tax department offsets refund against earlier unpaid tax demands. To confirm this, log in to the e-filing portal and visit Pending Actions → Response to Outstanding Demand. The portal lists any outstanding demands against your PAN and gives options to “Pay Now” or “Submit Response” (agree / disagree). If a demand exists, the system may adjust your refund against it. Hence, resolving or disputing the demand promptly is important for smoother processing of refunds.It is also important to have a validated bank account (PAN linked) on e-Filing portal for receipt of refunds. Validated bank account details can be checked at e-Filing portal under Profile -> My Bank Account -> Revalidate/Add Bank Account (if applicable). Further, in case refund is not getting released due to non-validation of bank account, one can raise a refund reissue request on the e-filing portal under Services → Refund reissue which will automatically request for information of bank account which needs to be linked/validated.Given that currently the tax return itself has an option to validate the bank account, this step of bank account validation through e-filing portal is mostly relevant for prior year refunds which are still not released due to invalid bank accounts.Though refund processing is quicker today, it is equally important for taxpayers to stay proactive. Regularly checking the income-tax portal, addressing outstanding demands promptly, and keeping records accurately help avoid delays, and in case of complex issues, seeking professional guidance is advisable.","With improved technology and faster processing systems, income-tax refunds are now issued more quickly than ever.

Markets will also stay shut on October 22 for Balipratipada. Regular trading will happen on Monday, October 20.This year’s Muhurat session will be held from 1:45 pm to 2:45 pm, breaking from recent tradition where trading took place in the evening.

The tradition, observed for decades, blends faith with finance — reflecting optimism, prosperity, and the belief that investments made during this hour bring good fortune in the year ahead.Historically, Dalal Street has celebrated the occasion with gains: the BSE Sensex has closed higher in 14 of the last 18 Muhurat sessions, including a 5.86 per cent rise in 2008 amid the global financial crisis. In 2024, it extended its winning run, gaining 335 points (0.42 per cent).Though the trading window lasts just an hour and often sees high volatility due to thin volumes, investors view the session as a ritual of renewal rather than a profit-making opportunity.","Muhurat Trading marks the beginning of Samvat 2082, ushering in a new Hindu financial year marked by prosperity and optimism.

What’s next for her





Canadian entertainer and digital creator Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University, a milestone that highlights her transformation from online sensation to mainstream cultural influencer. The award, bestowed during the university’s Fall Convocation on 14 October 2025, reflects Singh’s impact on pop culture, media representation, and diversity advocacy, signalling the growing significance of digital platforms in shaping global cultural narratives.Singh’s career illustrates a broader trend in global media where social media platforms have become launching pads for internationally recognised cultural figures. Beginning as a teenager posting humorous sketches on YouTube under the moniker ‘Superwoman’, she cultivated a large following through content combining comedy, personal reflection, and commentary on cultural identity. This digital prominence opened doors to mainstream television, literature, and public advocacy.Her recognition also highlights evolving metrics of influence. Universities and institutions increasingly acknowledge contributions beyond traditional academic or professional achievements, valuing social reach, advocacy, and public engagement.Singh’s honorary Doctor of Laws degree is emblematic of this shift, recognising the societal and cultural impact of digital creators in ways that transcend conventional accolades.Globally, Singh’s work resonates beyond entertainment. She has amplified conversations about gender equity, representation of minorities in media, and mental health awareness, reaching audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. Her trajectory offers a lens into how online personalities can shape social norms and public discourse, bridging cultural gaps and challenging stereotypes.On 14 October 2025, York University conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Singh during its Fall Convocation ceremony. The award cited her “contributions to community building and accomplishments in pop culture and entertainment.” Singh, who graduated from York in 2010 with a degree in psychology, described the honour as “immense”, noting the irony of fulfilling her parents’ long-held expectations of having a ‘doctor’ in the family, albeit in an unconventional manner.Singh’s speech to the graduating class underlined her philosophy on failure and growth. She encouraged students to embrace uncertainty and to view setbacks as teaching moments, asserting that “having it all figured out is a false narrative.” Her address also highlighted her experiences as the child of Indian immigrants navigating cultural expectations while forging a career in entertainment, a journey marked by creativity, resilience, and humour.The milestone comes amid Singh’s continued presence in mainstream media. Beyond her YouTube success, she hostedin 2019, becoming the first woman of Indian descent to lead a late-night talk show on a major American network. She has also authored bestselling books blending personal anecdotes with practical advice, further consolidating her influence across multiple platforms.Singh’s recognition signals the increasing legitimacy of digital creators in shaping cultural narratives. In a media ecosystem historically dominated by traditional broadcast networks and print outlets, social media personalities now influence public opinion, social norms, and even policy discussions on inclusivity and diversity.Her work also underscores the importance of representation. By foregrounding South Asian identity, gender equity, and minority experiences, Singh provides a template for how entertainers can leverage visibility to challenge stereotypes and promote social inclusivity. This has implications not only for entertainment but for broader societal attitudes, encouraging younger audiences to pursue unconventional paths while advocating for equity.Economically, figures like Singh exemplify the monetisation potential of digital platforms. Her trajectory highlights how online content can generate significant revenue streams, sponsorships, and brand partnerships, reshaping employment and entrepreneurship in creative industries. The honorary doctorate amplifies her credibility, reinforcing the notion that influence and impact extend beyond formal qualifications.In a wider sense, platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and other streaming networks are indirectly implicated, as Singh’s career reinforces the significance of digital-first pathways in the entertainment ecosystem. Social media companies stand to gain from the visibility and credibility conferred upon creators, while advertisers and sponsors can capitalise on the extended reach of influential figures like Singh.Singh’s trajectory is rooted in the rise of social media as a dominant form of entertainment. Launching her YouTube channel as a teenager, she capitalised on the platform’s global reach, producing content that resonated across demographics.

Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week, marking the latest restructuring at the startup since Mark Zuckerberg's Meta invested $14.3 billion in the company in June. The shuttered team, known internally as the NPO or New Projects Organization, had over a dozen members who focused on generalist tasks such as improving the writing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.Scale AI attributed the cuts to an industry shift toward more technical, expert-level training work, according to Business Insider. As AI chatbots improve, they increasingly require input from humans with specialised skills in fields like medicine, robotics, and finance, rather than generalist contractors.“Scale wound down a small experimental onsite program in Dallas staffed by a contract workforce,” Scale AI spokesperson Natalia Montalvo said.“This reflects an industry shift toward higher skill, expert data work. It only affects a small fraction of our overall workforce and has no impact on customer delivery,” Montalvo was quoted as saying.Scale AI offered the laid-off workers four weeks of severance pay and healthcare coverage through October, according to an email from HireArt, a staffing agency used extensively by Scale AI.The recently terminated workers were also invited to join Scale's gig-work platform, Outlier, where thousands of freelancers help train AI models.“As you navigate this transition, we want to ensure you are aware of alternative opportunities,” the email stated.Montalvo added that Scale AI continues to expand expert-level programmes and that broader groups of contractors continue to work in Dallas.The Dallas layoffs represent the latest in a series of cuts at Scale AI since the Meta investment. xAI has also made similar moves to focus on specialised AI training, recently downsizing its team of generalist AI tutors in September.",Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week.

MacKenzie Scott’s philanthropic ventures





Focus on diversity and equity causes









MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the SEC filed Tuesday and dated September 30. Many of Scott’s recent philanthropic efforts have focused on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. First reported by Bloomberg, the filing shows that Scott now holds 81.1 million Amazon shares – down 58 million from a year earlier. This reduction occurred despite Amazon shares more than doubling since Scott's 2019 divorce from Bezos.The filing, however, does not specify whether the reduction in Amazon holdings resulted from share sales, donations, or a combination of both, the report said. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, Bezos retains voting authority over Scott's holdings and is required to disclose them annually.With an estimated net worth of $32 billion, Mackenzie Scott obtained most of her wealth following her 2019 divorce from Bezos and has pledged to give away the majority of it. After ending up with approximately 4% of the e-coomerce giant, Scott has given away $19 billion in gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits over the past five years.The median gift size of her thousands of donations since the divorce is roughly $5 million.As a part of Scott’s philanthropic efforts, one of her most recent donations includes a $42 million gift to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit expanding college access for low-income and largely non-white students.According to a report by Fortune, this followed a $70 million gift to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through the nonprofit UNCF. The program, launched in 2021, aims to help HBCUs close a funding gap compared to white or elite institutions and provide long-term financial stability for minority schools.Furthermore, over the years, Scott has donated to diverse causes including an $84 million gift to Girl Scouts, $20 million to Vermont's Champlain Housing Trust, $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, and $275 million to Planned Parenthood. She previously gave UNCF $10 million in the year 2020.","Mackenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

The Chinese economy dipped to its weakest pace in the year to less than 5%, dragged down by sluggish domestic demand and tensions with the US.According to figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, the economy grew 4.8% from July to September, marking the slowest period since the third quarter of 2024. In the previous quarter, it registered a 5.2% growth.Meanwhile, on a quarterly basis, the GDP grew 1.1% in the third quarter, beating the 0.8% increase forecast and revised 1.0% gain in the previous quarter, according to a Reuters report.For the first nine months of 2025, the country’s GDP grew 5.2% year-on-year.However, exports remained relatively strong, as Chinese companies shifted their focus to other global markets, facing higher tariffs from US, under President Donald Trump.Retail sales in September increased just 3% as compared with a year earlier, marking the slowest rise since November, reflecting challenges in consumer spending.Industrial production, exceeded expectations, growing 6.5% in September, compared with forecasts of 5%, providing a rare bright spot in an otherwise sluggish economy.Fixed-asset investment fell 0.5% during the first nine months of the year, marking its first contraction since 2020, according to Bloomberg.Analysts had predicted GDP growth of 4.7% for the quarter.Property investment in the country remained weak, falling 13.9% in the first three quarters weighing down both economic growth and consumer confidence, with momentum further hit by the ongoing US trade tensions.Overall, China’s economy slowed for a second consecutive quarter. While exports and industrial output showed strength, reduced spending by households and companies kept growth subdued.","The economy grew 4.8% from July to September, marking the slowest period since the third quarter of 2024.

The road ahead

With inputs from PTI.

India’s medical education sector is witnessing an unprecedented transformation, with a historic surge in MBBS seats and new medical colleges across the country. Spearheaded by the National Medical Commission (NMC), this expansion aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 2024 pledge to create 75,000 new medical seats over the next five years, aiming to improve healthcare access and address the persistent shortage of trained doctors.According to PTI, NMC Chairperson Dr. Abhijat Sheth described this growth as a major regulatory milestone, noting that, for the first time, all appeals against MARB decisions were resolved without court intervention. In a parallel move to strengthen medical education, the NMC has partnered with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to integrate clinical research into the MBBS curriculum, boosting research infrastructure in medical colleges nationwide.In October 2025, the NMC approved 10,650 new MBBS seats and sanctioned 41 new medical colleges for the 2024–25 academic year. This raised the total number of institutions offering MBBS programs to 816 across India. Including seats under Institutes of National Importance such as AIIMS and JIPMER, India’s total MBBS seat count now stands at approximately 1,37,600.The approvals followed the commission receiving 170 proposals for expanding undergraduate capacity.Of these, 41 were from government colleges and 129 from private institutions. States such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, and Telangana saw significant additions.Data from the NMC and the Medical Assessment and Rating Board (MARB) indicate a steady increase in MBBS seats throughout 2025. Here is a month-by-month run down based on the MARB and NMC data:The NMC began reviewing proposals for new undergraduate medical seats and institutions for the 2025–26 academic cycle. Preliminary evaluations indicated around 1,17,750 MBBS seats across 808 medical colleges, establishing the baseline for expansion.During this period, multiple states, particularly Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, submitted proposals to the NMC and MARB for new colleges and capacity expansions. Review committees prioritised underserved regions, including northeastern and central Indian districts.The NMC announced the first wave of inspections and renewals to finalise the seat matrix ahead of NEET-UG counselling 2025. Provisional letters of permission (LOPs) for college upgrades added approximately 1,800 to 2,000 seats nationally.On September 24–26, 2025, the NMC published an updated seat matrix adding 7,075 new MBBS seats. This increased capacity from 1,17,750 to 1,24,825. The revision included both renewal approvals and newly sanctioned seats across government and private colleges, marking the start of the largest expansion phase since 2020.Between October 10 and 13, 2025, the NMC released another seat matrix revision for NEET-UG 2025. This approved 9,075 new MBBS seats while phasing out around 456 seats due to pending lawsuits or non-compliance. The total number of MBBS seats reached 1,26,600 across 812 medical colleges. Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Karnataka received the largest increases.On October 19, 2025, the NMC formally approved 10,650 new MBBS seats and 41 new medical colleges, bringing the national total to 1,37,600 seats and 816 colleges, as reported by PTI. This approval represents the largest single-year seat expansion in Indian medical education history and advances the government’s target of adding 75,000 new medical seats over five years.The October 2025 NMC report highlights the following state-wise increases:Most of the new colleges and seat expansions are being established in tier-2 and tier-3 cities. This strategy improves geographical access to medical education and reduces regional disparities.The NMC has indicated that further proposals for 2025–26 seat expansions are under review, with the application window opening in early November. If the current pace continues, India is likely to achieve its goal of adding 75,000 new medical seats well before 2029. This expansion represents a transformative moment for India’s medical education landscape, benefiting NEET aspirants and addressing the country’s long-term healthcare needs.","India’s medical education sector is witnessing an unprecedented transformation, with a historic surge in MBBS seats and new medical colleges across the country. Spearheaded by the National Medical Commission (NMC), this expansion aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2024 pledge to create 75,000 new medical seats over the next five years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124698829,imgsize-117242,width-400,resizemode-4/indias-medical-education-sees-historic-surge-as-mbbs-seats-reach-137600.jpg"

Public reception







Poland’s president, Karol Nawrocki, has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.The move is aimed at supporting families, boosting household income, and stimulating the economy.The bill was presented in August. It removes the income tax obligation for families earning up to 140,000 zloty (€32,973) per year. It applies to all parents with legal responsibility for children, including legal guardians and foster parents.According to calculations by the presidency, an average Polish family is expected to be around 1,000 zloty (€235) better off each month due to the new tax relief. However, the full impact of the law will only be visible in the 2026 tax return, which will be filed in 2027.The reform is part of a broader effort to reduce the tax burden on families, increase disposable income, encourage professional activity, and stimulate consumption. Nawrocki made zero personal income tax (PIT) a central promise during his presidential campaign. He first announced the measure in March as part of his ""Contract with the Poles,"" pledging to implement it from the first day of his presidency. After winning the June run-off, he signed the bill in August 8 before sending it to the Sejm, Poland’s parliament.Zero PIT is also part of a package known as the ""tax armour,"" which includes a reduction in VAT from 23 per cent to 22 per cent, the abolition of capital gains tax, and the introduction of a quota-based pension indexation.Experts note that the benefits of the new tax law are likely to be greater for wealthier families. Piotr Juszczyk, chief tax adviser at inFakt, said, “Low-income families, who pay little or no income tax, will gain a negligible amount while those with high incomes will benefit the most.”Families earning 7,000 zloty (€1,648) a month can expect a relief of around 395 zloty (€93) per month, while those earning 12,000 zloty (€2,826) per month could save 913 zloty (€215) monthly, or over 11,000 zloty (€2,590) annually. Families earning the lowest national income will see only minimal savings, and those already below the tax-free threshold will see no change.Public outlook was largely positive. During consultations on 11 September, 476 people participated, with 76% supporting the new law and 66% approving the economic and financial assessment presented by the president. Only a small minority, around 16%, expressed strong opposition.","Poland's president Karol Nawrocki has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.

"Jeffrey Epstein sent nasty emails to billionaire Leon Black to pressurise him for millions, reports claim",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jeffrey-epstein-sent-nasty-emails-to-billionaire-leon-black-to-pressurise-him-for-millions-reports-claim/articleshow/124688939.cms,"



In a series of fiery emails, Epstein piled on the pressure, demanding millions to keep his high-flying lifestyle intact and warning that Black’s kids and advisors were bungling the cash flow like a sitcom of the absurd.New York Times reported Epstein warned that Black’s financial advisors and “retarded” children had created a “really dangerous mess” by attempting to restrict the cash flow, according to the obtained emails.In a November 2-2015 email to the Apollo Global Management founder, Epstein said, “I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with you, I find it very distasteful.”Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were closely associated with Black, who employed Epstein as his wealth management advisor. Black paid Epstein over $150 million for services ranging from tax guidance to managing his art collection, even after Epstein was charged in 2004 for molesting a teenage girl, which resulted in his placement on the sex offender registry.By 2016, Black attempted to reduce the financial support to Epstein, leading to a barrage of demanding emails from Epstein. “So to be clear, my terms are as follows. I will only work for the usual 40 million per year.It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement. 5 million every two months thereafter for six months, i.e., March, May, June.This can begin if I am able in January. I will immediately stop work if the payment is not received,” Epstein wrote. The emails illustrate the strong relationship between Epstein and Black, who were not only close friends but also business associates.Black, aged 74, continued to funnel millions in fees and loans to Epstein until Epstein's arrest in 2019 for his decades-long sex trafficking schemes. Leon Black, chairman and chief executive officer of Apollo Global Management LLC, was eventually ousted from the company in 2021 due to his ties with Epstein, which dated back to 1990.Black has denied any knowledge of Epstein’s illicit activities. Susan Estrich, Black’s lawyer, stated that all payments were solely for legitimate tax and estate planning services, as confirmed by an independent law firm hired by Apollo. “To imply that Epstein somehow had influence over Black is false and patently absurd,” Estrich said.Despite Black’s assertions, one woman accused him of raping her in Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse, although the case was later dropped. Another former girlfriend filed a lawsuit claiming sexual assault, which was dismissed after she received $9.5 million as part of a nondisclosure agreement following their six-year relationship. Additionally, Black allegedly wired hundreds of thousands of rupees to at least three women associated with Epstein for undisclosed reasons.Whit Clay, a spokesman for Black, emphasized that the billionaire “very much regrets” ever making payments to Epstein. The pressure campaign by Epstein appeared to have an effect, as Black continued the financial support until Epstein's legal troubles escalated in 2019.",Leon Black paid Epstein over $150 million for services ranging from tax guidance to managing his art collection.
