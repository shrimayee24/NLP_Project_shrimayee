'Vote Chori Is The Biggest Anti-National Act': Rahul Gandhi Slams BJP In Lok Sabha

SRINAGAR: Days after J&K CM Omar Abdullah described the “vote chori” as an issue of the Congress alone and said the INDIA bloc had “nothing to do with it,” the party on Saturday said being in alliance does not negate a constituent’s political ideology.“Omar Abdullah was present in various meetings of the INDIA bloc, whether they took place in Kolkata or elsewhere. The alliance was very successful in the parliamentary elections, though we have not achieved 100 percent success,” Congress’s Salman Khurshid said responding to question whether Omar is drifting away from the alliance.“Alliance is not a negation of independent political parties. They don’t write off their own identity and own ideology,” Khurshid said at a press conference here.On Dec 15, J&K CM distanced himself from the “vote chori” issue raised by the Congress and said the “INDIA bloc has got nothing to do with it”.Early this week, he repeated the statement in New Delhi.Khurshid said Jammu and Kashmir ’s demand for statehood was a fight for its very existence, describing statehood as an identity that had been taken away.He also questioned the removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name from the rural employment law MGNREGA . “What was the need to change the name of the scheme?” he said, adding that it is an emotive issue for the Congress.Omar echoed his comments, saying no one could erase Gandhi’s legacy, irrespective of whether his name remained attached to the scheme. “Mahatma Gandhi lives in the hearts of the people of India,” he said, describing the original scheme as far-sighted. He accused the NDA government of attempting to weaken the MGNREGA by shifting its financial burden on the states, saying the Centre ultimately wanted to do away with it altogether.","Omar Abdullah was present in various meetings of the INDIA bloc, whether they took place in Kolkata or elsewhere. “Alliance is not a negation of independent political parties.

‘Who named G-RAM G Bill?’



SRINAGAR: J&K Omar Abdullah Saturday praised the Centre for being generous in allocating funds to J&K, but said the same magnanimity had not been shown in the matter of restoring statehood.Omar said he had no hesitation in acknowledging and thanking the Centre’s efforts where it had delivered. “I am not among those who practise politics by deceiving people. Whenever the Centre extends support, I acknowledge it; and wherever there are shortcomings, I also speak about it,” he added.The CM was responding to media persons’ queries about the opposition’s accusations that he praised BJP in Delhi, but criticises it in Kashmir. At a meeting in New Delhi recently, Omar had said the Centre had been generous to J&K, even though, if it wanted, it could have brought his govt to its knees. Opposition parties in Kashmir widely criticised him for the statement, referring to him as “good boy” and alleging that he spoke in different voices in Delhi and Srinagar.Rejecting the criticism, Omar said he did not make statements to please anyone. “I do not say one thing in Delhi and another in Kashmir. I say this (praising Union govt over funds allocation) everywhere --- in public meetings, in official interactions and even on the floor of the Assembly,” he said.Omar said the Centre had left no scope for complaint on issues other than statehood restoration, a commitment it has not fulfilled.Criticising the new rural employment guarantee Bill that has been brought to replace MGNREGA , Omar said the Centre had shifted the financial and administrative burden of the programme on the states.The CM was in Srinagar to review the winter preparedness of the administration.Omar Abdullah poked fun at the renaming of MGNREGA as ‘Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin), or VB-G RAM G, Omar Abdullah said the acronym sounded like a Bollywood movie’s name.“First of all, I am surprised where this name came from,” he said. “I am sorry, but a Bill should have been named after giving it some thought. It reminds me of an old Bollywood movie, ‘Ji Mummy Ji’. I don’t know if you have seen it or not, my nephew has,” he added. “Who named the bill as G RAM G?” he asked. He also criticised the removal of Mahatma Gandhi’s name from the scheme.","Omar said he had no hesitation in acknowledging and thanking the Centre’s efforts where it had delivered.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s helicopter could not land at the Taherpur helipad in West Bengal on Saturday due to low visibility caused by dense fog, an official said.The Prime Minister’s chopper hovered over the helipad for some time before making a U turn and returning to Kolkata airport, the official added. There were no reports of any untoward incident.As of the last update, PM Modi was waiting at the airport for further information on the weather conditions. It was not immediately clear whether he would travel to the venue by road or make another aerial attempt if visibility improves, the official said.Earlier in the day, the Prime Minister arrived in Kolkata at around 10.40 am and proceeded by helicopter to Taherpur in Nadia district. He is scheduled to attend an administrative programme to launch highway projects in West Bengal, followed by a BJP rally titled Parivartan Sankalpa Sabha.People gathered at Taherpur Netaji Park in Ranaghat, Nadia district, on Saturday, waving national flags and chanting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s name ahead of his public address and the inauguration of development projects worth Rs 3,200 crore in West Bengal.The projects include a 66.7 km four lane stretch of the Barajaguli Krishnanagar section of National Highway 34 and the laying of the foundation stone for the four laning of the Barasat Barajaguli section of NH 34, aimed at improving connectivity between Kolkata and Siliguri.According to the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Modi was scheduled to reach Ranaghat at around 11.15 am. The visit was part of an administrative programme to launch highway projects, followed by a BJP rally titled Parivartan Sankalpa Sabha.Ahead of the visit, the Prime Minister criticised the Trinamool Congress government in a post on X on Friday, saying people in West Bengal were benefiting from the Centre’s development initiatives but continued to suffer due to what he described as “misrule of the Trinamool Congress in every sector.”“Tomorrow, on the 20th of December, at noon, I will deliver a speech at the BJP public meeting in Ranaghat. The people of West Bengal are receiving the benefits of the central government's multifaceted projects. However, at the same time, due to the misrule of the Trinamool Congress in every sector of the state, they are becoming victims of suffering. The looting and intimidation by the Trinamool have crossed all limits. That is why today, the BJP is the only hope and trust of the people,” PM Modi said in the post.The West Bengal visit comes amid an intensifying political contest between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress ahead of upcoming electoral battles in the state.After his programme in West Bengal,PM Modi will travel to Assam for a two day visit on December 20 and 21. He is scheduled to reach Guwahati around 3 pm on Saturday, where he will inaugurate the new Bamboo Orchids terminal at the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport, unveil an 80 foot tall statue of Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi, and lay the foundation stone for a 12 lakh metric tonne capacity fertiliser unit at Namrup in Dibrugarh district.During his Assam visit, the Prime Minister will address public rallies in Guwahati and Namrup and visit the Assam state BJP headquarters. On December 21, he will interact with 25 meritorious students as part of Pariksha Pe Charcha during a programme on a cruise on the Brahmaputra river and pay tributes to 860 martyrs of the Assam Movement at Swahid Smarak.Authorities have deployed extensive security arrangements across Guwahati and other key locations to manage the Prime Minister’s schedule and ensure public safety during the visit.","The Prime Minister’s chopper hovered over the helipad for some time before making a U turn and returning to Kolkata airport.

NEW DELHI: The external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said the global economic and political hierarchy has undergone a “very significant change,” suggesting that India has gained a key advantage in human resources at a time when several developed nations are grappling with stagnation and demographic challenges.Addressing the convocation of an institute in Pune, Jaishankar said the cumulative impact of recent global developments has altered the international pecking order.“The cumulative result of all these happenings is that the global economic and, thereafter, political pecking order has actually undergone a very significant change,” he said, according to ANI.Pointing towards the shifts in the international labour market, the minister said India is increasingly becoming a driver of the global workforce.“We have started to surge in trained human resources at the very time when many developed nations are struggling to find them,” he said, adding, “Since demand and supply invariably develop their own equation, we have entered an era of mobility.”The minister also mentioned that this growing cross-border mobility now places new responsibilities on governments. “We need to ensure welfare, including in conflict situations, and the politics of this mobility needs to be managed,” he said, referring to India’s efforts to protect its citizens abroad.Reflecting on the post-colonial global order, Jaishankar said control over national destinies has shifted back to sovereign states, making policy choices a decisive factor. He noted that while China has “gained the most” since decolonisation, India has “done well, especially in the post-reform era,” and even more so over the past decade.In contrast, he criticised the Western economic model, linking current discontent to past decisions.“Western elites consciously chose to shift production to maximise profits. Their competitiveness has eroded over the years, accelerated by their lifestyle,” he said. “Much of the Western world now feels that they have stagnated, a sentiment that has increasingly come to acquire a political meaning.”Concluding his address, Jaishankar told students that national progress is shaped by leadership and governance. In India’s case, he said, “leadership and governance have led to ups and downs in various phases in our economic growth and in our social transformation,” urging them to see themselves as contributors to a “Viksit Bharat” that is increasingly shaping, not just participating in, the global order.", External affairs minister S Jaishankar said the global economic and political hierarchy has undergone a ‘very significant change’ He said India has gained a key advantage in human resources at a time when several developed nations are grappling with stagnation and demographic challenges.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126092509,imgsize-487596,width-400,resizemode-4/s-jaishankar-file-photo.jpg"

After the last landing: Where do planes go to die?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-the-last-landing-where-do-planes-go-to-die/articleshow/126091800.cms,"When planes get stuck

The afterlife of wings

The second act



Civil jets and combat flyers



What is a plane worth?



Do you remember the first time you noticed an aircraft overhead? A metal giant cutting through the sky, growing smaller until it vanished from sight. For some, the feeling never quite leaves.But an aircraft’s story does not end at the horizon.Long after it disappears from view, the plane will fly hundreds, sometimes thousands, of times. And then will come a day when it will not take off in the sky again. The giant, after years of service, carrying people miles and possibilities to the sky, reaches the end of its life.But what happens then?Do planes have a grave, as we humans do? Is it dismantled piece by piece or kept in a museum like a relic from another era?In aviation, an aircraft's death has an official name - decommissioning.But does a plane stop flying, and how do we know it's the end?Aviation expert Harsh Vardhan explains that there are two factors that determine when a passenger aircraft is decommissioned.The first is economic. When the cost of maintenance overtakes the profit an aircraft can generate, it no longer makes financial sense to keep it flying. The second is regulatory. If an aircraft fails to meet mandatory safety standards, it cannot legally remain in service.Once either threshold is crossed, the aircraft’s flying days are over. What follows, however, can take many unexpected paths.In 2023, an unusual sight caught national attention when an aircraft being transported on the back of a truck got stuck under a bridge in Bihar's Motihari. The scrapped Air India aircraft was being moved from Assam to Mumbai. What followed was the crowds of people gathering to make videos, take selfies.This was not an isolated incident. In another case, an Air India plane got stuck under a foot overbridge near Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport in 2021, prompting widespread confusion over how a plane ended up on a city road. Air India later clarified that it was a sold-off decommissioned aircraft being carried away by its rightful owners.Sometimes, decommissioned planes don’t even leave the airport.In November, a forgotten aircraft at Kolkata airport finally met its end after lying abandoned for 13 years. Airport authorities flagged its presence to Air India, and in an internal post to employees, CEO Campbell Wilson revealed that the airline had been unaware of the aircraft’s existence.The plane was eventually moved to Bengaluru, where it will now be used to train maintenance engineers.Not all decommissioned aircraft are this fortunate.For most aircraft, decommissioning leads to dismantling.Expert Harsh Vardhan explains the process of salvaging usable components before the rest is scrapped.He says, ""The people who maintain inventory for old aircraft, they buy that scrap. They buy those components from the scrap aircraft. These are usually bought by specialised scrap dealers for the value of scrap because there are metals, valuable metals, and other parts. So, to the extent, the components that can still be reused later are taken out. They're taken out and bought by these logistics.""What remains is largely unusable.""The rest becomes the hull, which cannot be used in any form. So it is taken by the scrap dealers to scrap it. Since they have valuable metals, they'll be taken and used for different purposes,"" Vardhan adds.Yet, not every fuselage is destined to be melted down.Aircraft bodies often find a second life far removed from runways. Film sets, training facilities, museums, restaurants, and even children’s parks have all housed retired aircraft.Remember the music video of Shah Rukh Khan's 'Gerua' from Dilwale? Or countless Hollywood scenes featuring planes frozen in dramatic stillness? These are often retired airliners repurposed for storytelling.""Some shelves are used for innovative ideas, creating a restaurant or a children's park to display items,"" Vardhan says.Civil and military aircraft serve vastly different purposes in the sky, but their journey after decommissioning follows similar principles.Group Captain Kaushik Sinha explains that the fighter jets of Air Force are retired based on strict technical limits.""Decommissioning is of two types. One is when the engine life of the aircraft ends. Another is based on the airframe hours of the aircraft. Airframe means the body of the aircraft,"" he says.""They also have a certain age. Once they are mature, they can no longer fly. So they are decommissioned,” Group Captain Kaushik Sinha adds.What happens next is carefully regulated.""We have different policies. We send it to a museum where all the young generations can come and see it, so they get motivated for the future. Or if some government or the private sector wants to put it in their place for a display, we have policies in the MoD by which it is approved,"" he says.For decades, these silent machines have sparked ambition in countless young minds.""Some of these policies are for future generations, so that they should get motivated to join the armed forces, the Navy, Air Force, and Army,” the Group Captain adds.The emotional value of an aircraft is impossible to quantify. Its financial value, however, is carefully calculated.Group Captain Sinha explains the process for military aircraft.""Generally, air force aircraft are not sold. They are either donated to museums or a state government takes them to put them on display, at some important road crossing or civil airports, etc. On an occasion where some private entity wants it, then the aircraft fuselages are auctioned,” he says.He adds that India does not follow a uniform scrapping policy: ""In India, we don’t have any standard scrapping policy for aircraft. Since not many Jet aircraft are decommissioned in India, it is decided on a case-by-case basis.""Civil aviation follows a different route.""Most of them are done through the specialised auction agencies. There are international agencies that do this. But some airlines like Air India, etc, have their local departments that do the scrap selling,” aviation expert Harsh Vardhan says.The resale price of a civil aircraft can go up to about $100,000, or roughly Rs 91 lakh.The contrast with manufacturing costs is stark.""It varies,"" Vardhan says. ""For (Boeing) 737, 378, 100, Neo or Indigo, you are talking about $250mn (more than Rs 2,200 crore) list price today. And 787 could even be around $450mn (more than Rs 4,000 crore).""But do the planes have graveyards like us?Yes.In the United States, the Arizona desert serves as a final resting place for thousands of retired aircraft. The dry climate slows corrosion, allowing planes to remain intact until their fate is decided.""Generally, big nations have graveyards for decommissioned aircraft as they scrap many aircraft in a year. These are large tracts of land in a dry area, which prevents corrosion of the airframe of aircraft till the disposal is decided,"" Sinha explains.Harsh Vardhan adds, ""If you see the Arizona Desert, it is full of all the defence and retired aircraft, even civilian aircraft. So not all can be salvaged.""India’s reality is different.“But here, scrap aircraft are either sold by the operator. And many times, if it is just parked and the parking charges are not paid, then airport authorities auction them,” Vardhan says.Whether India needs a similar graveyard remains a debated topic. While Sinha views it as a tribute akin to war memorials, Vardhan believes current systems suffice, given land constraints.After the final landingWhen an aircraft stops flying, it does not simply vanish.It becomes metal, memory, training equipment, museum artefact, or scrap. It becomes a reflection of economics, policy, pride and time.Aircraft are built to conquer gravity, but even they cannot outrun age.Long after their engines fall silent, they continue to carry meaning. And even grounded wings, it turns out, leave trails behind.","In aviation, an aircraft's death has an official name - decommissioning. When the cost of maintenance overtakes the profit an aircraft can generate, it no longer makes financial sense to keep it flying. If an aircraft fails to meet mandatory safety standards, it cannot legally remain in service.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126092108,imgsize-1033799,width-400,resizemode-4/where-do-planes-go-to-die.jpg"

'Global Order Has Changed Forever, No Single Nation Can Dominate All Issues': Says EAM Jaishankar

'

India's talent

, skill has shaped our national brand': Jaishankar

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Saturday said he merely carries out the “vision” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , likening his role to that of Lord Hanuman carrying out Lord Ram’s mission.At an event in Maharashtra's Pune, Jaishankar, a former diplomat, was asked if only “one Jaishankar” is enough for India. He ""corrected"" the question, replying, 'You actually should have asked me 'there is one Modi.'”The EAM said, “That was the question you should have asked me because ultimately, the diplomats… after all, Shri Hanuman finally serves (Lord Ram). So bear it in mind.”Showering praise on PM Modi, Jaishankar added, “Countries are defined by leaders, countries are defined by vision. There are people who execute it. But ultimately today, it is that vision, the leadership, the confidence. That is what makes a difference.”Jaishankar, who served as India’s foreign secretary from January 2015 to 2018, has been the country’s external affairs minister since May 2019, following PM Modi’s second consecutive term win.The BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member was in Pune to attend the 22nd convocation of Symbiosis International (Deemed University).He told the graduating students, “The old stereotypes about India are steadily being put behind. But this evolution in our image is an undeniable reality. Hard figures vouch for this transformation. Among them, the growing number of global capability centres in India, the increasing demand for Indian talent and skills abroad, and the individual successes of people. And this extends equally to us as a collective. Perhaps more than others, India is today defined by its talent and by its skill. All that has helped to shape our national brand.”The minister also called for “doubling down” on the Make in India initiative so that Indian products can make a mark beyond the country’s shores.“Add to that design in India, research in India, innovate in India, or deliver from India, and the same holds true for services as well. We have to upgrade our infrastructure, develop our human resources, and adopt and pursue the right policies. But more importantly, it requires vision, it requires leadership, and it requires execution, all of which we fortunately have today,” he remarked.Students from over 40 countries graduated at the ceremony, and Jaishankar wished them success in their future endeavours.", External affairs minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar likens his role to that of Lord Hanuman carrying out Lord Ram’s mission.

Rahul Gandhi Demands Unified National Response As Parliament Debates India’s Air Pollution Crisis

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday alleged that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had joined hands with “anti-India forces” during his visit to Germany.Party spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia asserted that the Congress MP was part of a larger conspiracy against the country. The BJP also linked Gandhi to US billionaire investor George Soros, repeating earlier allegations of foreign influence.Addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters, Bhatia alleged that Gandhi met individuals hostile to India while abroad.“If anyone meets anti-India forces and insults Bharat from foreign soil, it’s none other than Rahul,” Bhatia charged. He added, “George Soros and Rahul Gandhi are two bodies but one soul.”The BJP spokesperson displayed a purported photograph of Gandhi with Cornelia Woll, president of the Berlin-based Hertie School, claiming it as evidence of his interaction with “anti-India forces in Germany”.Bhatia alleged that Woll is a trustee of the Central European University, which he said is funded by Soros’s Open Society Foundation.Questioning Gandhi’s foreign visits during parliamentary sessions, Bhatia asked, “What kind of anti-India agenda is it that the Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi is hatching a conspiracy against Bharat by joining hands with such anti-India forces?”He further claimed that Gandhi frequently travels abroad during or ahead of Parliament sessions and meets people who are “jealous of India and attack its integrity”.Bhatia also alleged that this was not the first such instance, accusing Gandhi of defaming India during previous foreign visits.“This is not the first time Rahul Gandhi is indulging in such anti-national activities,” he said. “Rahul Gandhi has become Mir Zafar,” the party spokesperson asserted.The BJP reiterated its claim that Soros makes “anti-India statements” and provides funds to create unrest in the country.“George Soros is not an Indian; he is a foreigner. But Rahul Gandhi has taken the oath of protecting the Constitution,” Bhatia said. He added, “These snakelets within India need to be treated. People of the country are demanding it.”The BJP’s remarks come amid Rahul Gandhi’s ongoing visit to Germany, where he toured BMW’s headquarters in Munich. During the visit, Gandhi criticised the Centre over manufacturing, saying India needs to “produce more” and that manufacturing in the country was “declining”.In a video shared by the Congress, Gandhi said India needs to focus more on production-led growth.“Manufacturing is the backbone of strong economies. Sadly, in India, manufacturing is declining. For us to accelerate growth, we need to produce more—build meaningful manufacturing ecosystems and create high-quality jobs at scale,” he said.In another video clip from the visit, Gandhi remarked, “India needs to start producing. Production is the key for the success of any country. And our manufacturing is declining which actually should be going up.”The BJP strongly objected to Gandhi’s remarks, accusing him of running down the country from foreign soil at a time when Parliament was in session.BJP MP and party spokesperson Sambit Patra said the Leader of Opposition carries a “huge responsibility” and must act with restraint while travelling abroad.“The LoP has a huge responsibility. The LoP has to behave in a really responsible manner, especially when the LoP is on foreign soil. Parliament is in session here, several Bills are being discussed in the House and Rahul Gandhi is in Germany to address the Indian diaspora,” Patra said.Referring to Gandhi’s visit to the BMW plant, Patra alleged that the Congress leader praised German manufacturing while portraying India negatively.“Today, we saw Rahul Gandhi visiting the BMW factory in Munich and there, he appreciated their manufacturing and said that he is sad that manufacturing is poor in India,” he said, rejecting Gandhi’s claim and citing official data to assert that India’s manufacturing sector was on a growth path.The BJP’s latest attack also revives allegations made earlier this year, when party spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia accused the Congress and Rahul Gandhi of working with foreign forces to destabilise India.In February, Bhatia had claimed that organisations linked to George Soros were involved in “anti-India activities” and alleged that funding to certain NGOs during the Congress-led UPA government was significantly higher than under the current BJP government.At the time, Bhatia had accused Gandhi of collaborating with foreign forces to weaken India, citing alleged links to Soros-funded organisations.","The BJP has alleged that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had joined hands with “anti-India forces” during his visit to Germany.

Our commerce minister Piyush Goyal Ji has assured me that he is trying his best and it will be done. It is just a matter of time,” Radhakrishnan said.He was speaking at an event organised by the Apparel Export Promotion Council to felicitate exporters. The US levied an additional 25 pr cent tariff on India earlier this year, bringing total tariffs to 50per cent. India’s merchandise exports to the US registered over 22 per cent growth in November despite steep tariffs. India’s textile and apparel exports were recorded at $37.75 billion in the last financial year, registering an annual growth of nearly 10 per cent.Radhakrishnan said Prime Minister Narendra Modi aimed at transforming the sector into a “global powerhouse”, with a target of achieving $100 billion in textile exports by 2030, with the apparel sector contributing 40 per cent.He added that India was now facing competition in textiles and apparel from countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Laos, and that FTAs were important to stay ahead. “We tasted success with the free trade agreement with the United Kingdom and I am sure we will have another FTA with the European Union soon.

Sonia Gandhi Criticises PM Modi Over VB-G RAM G Bill And MGNREGA Rollback

What is VB–G RAM G?

NEW DELHI: Congress Rajya Sabha member Sonia Gandhi, reacting to the VB-G RAM G Bill, criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi , accusing the central government of attacking the interests of the poor by ""running a bulldozer over MGNREGA "".Sonia Gandhi alleged that the Modi government, over the past 11 years, has ""consistently tried to weaken MGNREGA by neglecting the interests of the rural unemployed, the poor and the marginalised, even though the scheme proved to be a lifeline for these sections during the Covid crisis"".""While the Congress played a major role in bringing MGNREGA into existence and implementing it, the scheme was never about a political party. It was about national interest and public welfare. By weakening this law, the Modi government has attacked the interests of crores of farmers, workers and landless rural poor,"" the former Congress chief claimed.The Rajya Sabha MP further said: ""The Congress had a major contribution in bringing and implementing MGNREGA. It was a scheme connected to the interest of the country and the people. The Modi government has attacked the interests of the poor through this.""'VB-G Ram G' bill, which awaits the President's nod, was passed amid fierce protest by the opposition, particularly the INDIA bloc during the Winter Session of the Parliament.On Thursday, rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, speaking in favour of the bill, claimed that the legislation improves substantially on MGNREGA, which was ""riddled"" by corruption and inefficiency.The opposition was demanding that the bill be sent to a parliamentary committee for scrutiny and assailed the government for removing Mahatma Gandhi 's name from the rural employment guarantee scheme.As Chouhan began his reply after Congress MP KC Venugopal's demand for sending Viksit Bharat-Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission-Gramin (VB-G RAM G) Bill to the committee went unheeded, opposition members trooped into the well, tore its copies and continued their protest till the House passed the bill.The government has repealed the two-decade-old Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) with another legislation, titled the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB–G RAM G) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks to replace the MGNREGA with a revamped framework aimed at aligning rural employment and development with the national vision of Viksit Bharat 2047.The Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025 represents a major overhaul of MNREGA. Under the proposed law, the government ""establishes a modern statutory framework aligned with Viksit Bharat 2047, guaranteeing 125 days of wage employment per rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work,"" as per a statement released.","Sonia Gandhi criticises PM Modi over VB-G RAM G Bill and MGNREGA Rollback.

NEW DELHI: The government has ordered a probe into the case of an Air India Express pilot beating up a passenger at Delhi Airport’s Terminal 1 on Friday. The two had a verbal spat between two before Captain Virender Sejwal assaulted the passenger, Ankit Dewan. Why no one, including CISF personnel posted at the entrance, intervened in time, and the matter escalated to such an extent, is being examined.“The ministry of civil aviation has taken serious cognisance of the incident and directed the airline to ground the pilot with immediate effect. A formal enquiry has been ordered. Detailed reports have been sought from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF),” the ministry said on X Saturday. No police complaint has been lodged so far in this case.The Air India Express was “dead heading” to Bengaluru — travelling as a passenger to another place to operate a flight from there — on IndiGo. Dewan was travelling with his family on SpiceJet. After the fight, they went to their destinations. AI Express grounded Captain Sejwal, and he didn’t operate the flight he was rostered to from Bengaluru.What allegedly happened: While Captain Virender Sejwal was at the staff entry gate, CISF personnel directed Dewan to this gate as he was travelling with young children and baggage.He was on one side of the entrance, and the pilot was on the other. “Captain Sejwal was going ahead of his side of the queue being a crew member. Dewan started questioning this in a not very decent language or tone. The CISF personnel asked him not to speak like that. When he did not stop, the captain hit him. The personnel on duty immediately separated them,” said CISF sources.“Our personnel asked Dewan if he wanted to file a police complaint so that they could take him to the airport police station. He gave in writing that he did not want to do so. Both the pilot and Dewan with his family went to their destinations,” CISF sources added.On reaching his destination, Dewan, “a credit card & miles enthusiast”, said on X Friday night: “…one of (AI Express) pilots, Captain Virender Sejwal, assaulted me physically at T1, Delhi Airport. Me & my family were guided to use the security check that the staff uses, because we had a 4-month-old baby in a stroller. The staff was cutting the queue ahead of me. On calling them out, Captain Virender, who himself was doing the same thing, asked me if I was anpadh (uneducated), and couldn't read the signs that said this entry was for staff. A verbal scuffle broke out. Not able to exercise restraint, the AI Express pilot proceeded to physically assault me, leaving me bloody.”Dewan added that he had to “see a doctor” and that his “7-year-old daughter, who saw her father get assaulted brutally, is still traumatised & scared.” “I have no clue how DGCA and Air India Express can allow such pilots to fly. If they can't keep their cool in a scuffle, can they be trusted with the lives of hundreds of people in the sky? How can Delhi Airport get away with such mismanagement, combining staff entry with passengers carrying infants, creating chaos at a sensitive security area? I thought airports were safe places!”An AI Express spokesperson said: “We are aware of an incident at Delhi Airport involving one of our employees, who was travelling as a passenger on another airline, and had an altercation with another passenger. We unequivocally condemn such behaviour. The employee concerned has been removed from official duties with immediate effect, pending investigation. Appropriate disciplinary action will be initiated based on the findings of the inquiry. Air India Express upholds the highest standards of conduct and professionalism, and remains committed to ensuring that its employees act responsibly at all times.”Dewan added on X: “I was forced to write a letter stating that I will not pursue this matter further. It was either write that letter, or miss my flight and throw the 1.2 lakh holiday bookings down the drain. Delhi police, why can't I file a complaint after coming back? Must I sacrifice my money too, to seek justice? Will the CCTV footage disappear in the two days till I make it back to Delhi?""","The government has ordered a probe into the case of an Air India Express pilot beating up a passenger.

NEW DELHI: A Congress MP heading a parliamentary committee has called its meeting on Dec 29 to discuss the 'VB G RAM G' bill and to compare it with the UPA-era MGNREGS, a move being seen as an escalation of political battle over the proposed law and which has drawn protest from the members of governing NDA.The agenda of the standing committee on rural development and panchayati raj includes briefing by the rural development ministry on the subject 'Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission-Gramin (VB G RAM G) Bill' and its comparison with the MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme).Congress MP Saptagiri Sankar Ulaka heads the committee.What has surprised BJP MPs of the panel is that the bill, which was passed by Parliament Thursday, is still awaiting Presidential assent. It will become a law only after its gazette notification subsequent to the nod by the President.BJP MP Vivek Thakur, a member of the panel, was unambiguous in questioning the decision, saying it betrays non-application of mind. It is yet to be notified as a law, he noted.BJP-led NDA members, who are in a majority in the committee, may take up the matter with Speaker Om Birla, who wields overriding powers as it is a Lok Sabha committee.Another BJP member said the committee cannot discuss a bill which was only days before debated and passed by Parliament, and that it can only scrutinise its implementation and make recommendations.He said the move to compare the bill with the UPA-era scheme seems to be deliberate politicisation of the issue, with Congress and other opposition parties one in slamming the new measureThe new law will replace the legislation that underpinned the rural employment guarantee scheme named after Mahatma Gandhi, whose name has now been removed.Ulaka had in Lok Sabha said during the discussion over the bill that it be sent to his committee for scrutiny, a consensus demand by opposition parties and which was turned down by the govt. Ulaka has now also written to the LS Speaker saying that the bill should be sent to his commitee.This is not the first time that the committee's agenda, often a prerogative of the panel's chairman, has drawn protest from BJP members.Its decision to invite activist Medha Patkar and actor Prakash Raj, both of whom are vocal critics of BJP's policies, as witnesses during its meeting in July this year to review the implementation of land acquisition law had sparked angry reaction from members of governing party.BJP MPs were especially upset with Patkar's presence, as they called her ""anti-national"" for her campaign against ""development"" works and had stormed out of the meeting, which came to an abrupt end.","The bill, which was passed by Parliament Thursday, is still awaiting Presidential assent.

SIM-linking stays but government may up auto logout time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sim-linking-stays-but-government-may-up-auto-logout-time/articleshow/126098316.cms,"file photo

NEW DELHI: While the govt is firm that department of telecommunications' (DoT) Nov 28 direction mandating continuous SIM-binding of messaging apps like WhatsApp is a critical security intervention to check cyber crime and misuse of the apps by foreign intelligence agencies to exfiltrate information from India without traceability, there are indications that it may be open to raising six-hour auto-logout limit for web sessions.The six-hour auto-logout norm - which many messaging apps are resisting on ground that ""logging every 6 hours would cause unacceptable inconvenience"" - is exclusive to web or desktop versions of the messaging apps.According to DoT directions, the web service instance of mobile apps must log out periodically not later than six hours, allowing users to relink devices via QR code. ""This specifically targets the long session vulnerability used in cross-border scams, forcing periodic re-authentication that proves control of the device and SIM. Most banking and UPI apps successfully use this auto-logout security feature,"" said an official.Also, the argument of messaging apps that SIM binding will force users to buy international roaming services from Indian telecom service providers every time they travel abroad, seems rather flimsy considering the same users are willing to spend liberally on airline tickets and hotels abroad, said an officer.Govt sources said the six-hour auto logout limit for web versions can be revisited and raised to 12 or 18 hours, but not beyond 24 hours.A third objection - that DoT cannot issue directions to apps like WhatsApp as they are covered under the IT Act - is also weak as these apps are hosted on mobile networks run by the telecom service providers who are also the primary Internet service providers.With cyber fraud losses having exceeded Rs 22,800 crore in 2024 and some defrauded persons being driven to suicide, govt agencies are unanimous that DoT directions are ""proportionate measures to prevent misuse of telecom identifiers, ensure traceability & protect citizens' trust in India's digital eco-system"".Officials said the DOT direction followed warnings from security establishment, with National Security Council Secretariat having raised the issue in Dec 2024 along with directions to DoT to study SIM-binding requirements for instant messaging applications.MHA formed a technical sub-group in Sept 2024 comprising members from DoT, Delhi Police, MHA, MeitY, IB and TRAI, which recommended binding social media and OTT services to mobile numbers. In April 2025, MHA directed IT intermediaries to implement the technical measures including SIM binding and geo-fencing for communication apps like WhatsApp, to mitigate cybercrime threats.""DoT field units too independently echoed these concerns with law enforcement agencies. Also, cellular operators association of India requested SIM binding implementation in Aug 2025, to surb cross-border frauds and ensure national security,"" a security official told TOI Saturday.","The six-hour auto-logout norm is exclusive to web or desktop versions of the messaging apps. Many messaging apps are resisting on ground that ""logging every 6 hours would cause unacceptable inconvenience"" The argument of messaging apps that SIM binding will force users to buy international roaming services from Indian telecom service providers is also flimsy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126098318,imgsize-780272,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), in recent reports, flagged how railways failed to boost its non-fare revenue despite holding vast stretches of vacant land and how dues amounting to Rs 4,087 crore from 269 private siding owners remained unrecovered by different zones till March 2023, pointing to weak monitoring and enforcement mechanisms.CAG audit focussed on two activities of RLDA, the railway entity for development of its surplus land for commercial use and revenue generation, commercial development of vacant railway land and construction of multi-functional complexes (MFC), from 2018-19 to 2022-23. It found that as of March 2023, railways owned 4.88 lakh hectares of land, of which 62,740 hectares was lying vacant, with only 997.8 hectares (1.6%) having been entrusted to RLDA. During this period, the Railway Board had received 188 proposals for 657 hectares, and it entrusted 59 of the 188 proposals to RLDA, following which RLDA awarded 35 sites to developers.It found that despite availability of such quantum of land, RLDA, as of March 2023, could award only 8.8% (87.76 hectares) of land entrusted to it for development. It noticed that several sites were entrusted to RLDA despite unresolved land title issues, encroachments and other encumbrances, resulting in non-monetisation of such sites.It identified systemic and operational issues that had adversely affected timely monetisation of railway land and realisation of revenue.It observed that Railway Board, while processing proposals for entrustment of land to RLDA, should have ensured that the land parcels were free from encroachments and other encumbrances, noting that weak inter-agency coordination in Indian Railways had contributed significantly to delays. ""Alarmingly, none of the awarded commercial sites were developed as of March 2023,"" the report added.In another report, it detected the failure of railway zones to recover dues outstanding from private siding owners.

NEW DELHI: Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audit tabled in Parliament on Thursday flagged serious shortcomings in Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS), pointing to inadequate hospital coverage, long-pending manpower shortages, delayed payments and infrastructure gaps that have affected healthcare access for retired defence personnel and their families.It reviewed the scheme's performance between 2018-19 and 2022-23 and examined functioning of key implementing agencies, including department of ex-servicemen welfare, central organisation ECHS, regional centres, polyclinics and service hospitals.One of the most critical findings was uneven and insufficient geographical coverage of empanelled hospitals, forcing beneficiaries in several regions to travel long distances for specialised treatment. Defence ministry told auditors that it has since simplified empanelment norms and expanded the hospital network to partially address the imbalance.It also flagged chronic manpower shortages, noting categorisation of polyclinics has not been revised since the scheme's launch in 2003, despite a steady rise in the number of ex-servicemen. Staffing levels at central organisation, regional centres and polyclinics have similarly remained unchanged.The ministry informed Parliament that 1,357 additional personnel were sanctioned in Nov 2024 for 23 new and 50 upgraded polyclinics.Shortfalls in medicines, equipment and ambulances were another concern. Auditors recorded instances of delayed medicine supply, outdated equipment, aging ambulances and weak functioning of mobile medical units.The report highlighted delays in payments to empanelled hospitals and reimbursement of beneficiaries' claims, caused by inadequate allocation under MTRE.","Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audit tabled in Parliament on Thursday flagged serious shortcomings in Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme.

From Kolkata Chaos to Delhi Celebration: Lionel Messi’s G.O.A.T India Tour At A Glance

KOLKATA: Football legend Lionel Messi 's India Tour event organiser and the prime accused in the Salt Lake Stadium chaos, Satadru Dutta, has claimed ""influential people"" pressured him to triple the number of access cards for the event. This, he claimed, led to Messi feeling ""unhappy about being touched or hugged"" by random people.Dutta, arrested within hours of the chaos, also told Kolkata police SIT that Messi was paid Rs 89 crore for the India tour, while Rs 11 crore was paid as tax to govt. ""Dutta claimed that Rs 100 crore was spent on the Messi tour, with some funds coming from sponsors and the rest from ticket sales. However, the total amount attributed to ticket sales and sponsors accounts for only 60-70% of the total cost, prompting investigators to doubt his claims,"" a police officer said.Police have seized Rs 22 crore from Dutta's bank accounts and frozen them. SIT carried out a raid at Dutta's residence in Rishra on Friday.Investigators suspect black money may have been used in organising Messi's show. However, it is not yet clear whether the seized amount includes proceeds from ticket sales or funds received from sponsors. Police also said Dutta had not made any specific statements regarding financial irregularities linked to the event.Police said Dutta blamed ""everyone"" around Messi on Dec 13 for the chaos.So far, Bengal police have registered two cases in connection with the incident. Several non-bailable charges have also been filed against Dutta.","Satadru Dutta, the prime accused in the Salt Lake Stadium chaos, has claimed ""influential people"" pressured him to triple the number of access cards for the event.

123-year-old Curzon clock ticks again at Golden Temple,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/123-yr-old-curzon-clock-ticks-again-at-golden-temple/articleshow/126097695.cms,"file photo

AMBALA: For decades, the clock was stuck at 10.08, a mute time-keeper for the lakhs who moved in and out of Sri Darbar Sahib in Amritsar. Dinged up, dented and faded, few ever looked up at it, and fewer still realised it was a keeper of history. Now, it ticks again. A two-year restoration in Birmingham - the same city where it was built it to order for Lord Curzon in 1920-22 - has brought the clock back to life.""It cost us around £80,000 (nearly Rs 96 lakh) to restore the clock and it's ready for installation at Sri Darbar Sahib in Jan,"" Inderjit Singh, representative of Birmingham-based Guru Nanak Nishkam Sewak Jatha (GNNSJ), told TOI.Lord Curzon, who was India's viceroy from 1899 to 1905, and his wife visited Golden Temple on April 9, 1900. Contemporary records note he and his wife were struck by the ""somewhat unworthy appearance"" of a common wallclock hanging inside Sri Darbar Sahib and Curzon expressed his desire to replace it with a more ""fitting timepiece, designed specifically to harmonise with the sanctity of the Sikh religious place"". It took over two years for Birmingham-based Elkington & Co Ltd to craft the specially commissioned clock and ship it to India.The gleaming brass timepiece was presented at Sri Darbar Sahib on Oct 31, 1902, on Diwali and Bandi Chhor Diwas, through the-then Lahore commissioner.It carried the inscription: ""This clock was presented to the Golden Temple at Amritsar by Lord Curzon, Viceroy & Governor General of India, on the occasion of his first official visit, April 1900."" This inscription later proved crucial in establishing the historical significance of the artefact because time rubbed its sheen so badly that it faded into the wallwork. Over time, the clock suffered extensive damage, likely due to a fall from height and subsequent repairs, said sources. Its 10kg brass housing bore dents, cracks, scratches and missing decorative elements. Its original mechanical movement, hands and dial had been replaced decades ago with a mass-produced quartz mechanism and dull aluminium dial.In 2023, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) handed the restoration and conservation of frescos, wall paintings and golden plates of the shrine to GNNSJ, led by Bhai Mohinder Singh. During the conservation work in late 2023, GNNSJ discovered the historic clock concealed under a modern clock on the northeast side entrance.With SGPC's approval, the clock was transported to the UK and Bhupinder Singh Minhas of Birmingham took on the task of getting it restored.""Bhai Mohinder Singh brought it back to India after restoration in Nov. It is fully functional now. We shall reinstall it at the same spot. The firm has supplied special brushes for its cleaning,"" said Inderjit Singh. The aluminium face with hand-painted Punjabi numerals has been replaced with brass face and roman numerals, just the way it was when Lord Curzon handed it over.","The clock was commissioned by India's viceroy Lord Curzon in 1920-22.

VB - G RAM G row: Opposition sleeps outside Parliament in protest - watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vb-g-ram-g-bill-opposition-stages-overnight-protest-in-parliament-over-mgnrega-replacement-video/articleshow/126067758.cms,"Lok Sabha Passes Viksit Bharat G Ram G Bill Amid Protests, Opposition Tears Copies Over Gandhi Name

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties staged a 12-hour overnight dharna in the Parliament complex on Thursday night to protest the passage of the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill, or VB-G RAM G Bill, which replaces the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.The protest came hours after Parliament cleared the Bill amid noisy scenes and walkouts. The Rajya Sabha passed the legislation post midnight by a voice vote, following its approval by the Lok Sabha earlier in the day, even as opposition members demanded its withdrawal and sought its referral to a parliamentary panel.Opposition MPs accused the government of rushing the Bill through without adequate debate and of scrapping a flagship rural employment scheme that, they said, supported crores of poor households. Several members walked out of the Upper House, raised slogans against the government and tore copies of the Bill, prompting repeated warnings from the Chair.Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha deputy leader Sagarika Ghose alleged that the government had “bulldozed” the legislation. “This is an insult to India's poor, it is an insult to Mahatma Gandhi, it is an insult to Rabindranath Tagore. With just five hours' notice, this bill was given to us.We were not allowed a proper debate,” she said.“Our demand was such an important bill should be sent to the Select Committee and let the opposition parties examine it, let the opposition parties discuss it, let all stakeholders discuss it, but no, in a display of tyranny, in a murder of democracy,” Ghose said, announcing the overnight protest. “We are now going to sit on a 12-hour dharna, 12-hour dharna against the manner in which the Modi government has brought this black law against the people of India, against the poor of India, against the rural poor of India. ”Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala described the development as a “sad day for the country's labour force” and alleged that the government had hit the livelihoods of millions. “This is perhaps the saddest day for the labourers of India. BJP government has attacked the livelihood of 12 crore people by repealing the MGNREGA . They have proved that the Modi government is anti-farmer and anti-poor,” he said.Congress leader Mukul Wasnik said the original law was framed after extensive consultations. “When MGNREGA was drafted, consultations were held for 14 months. It was passed by Parliament with consensus. The scheme would put an extreme burden on states. As a result, this scheme will collapse,” he said.DMK leader Tiruchi Siva accused the government of erasing Mahatma Gandhi’s legacy. “Likewise they have removed Mahatma Gandhi's name himself. Without Gandhi there is no freedom, that is the total belief in this country. Even in Britain parliament we are having Gandhi statue, but here in Indian parliament his statue is hidden somewhere, and now the scheme which bore his name, his name has also been removed,” he said.Defending the legislation, Rural Development Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the new law was necessary to address shortcomings in the old scheme and to boost rural development. “This Bill is very necessary as it will help provide employment opportunities, help development of rural India and take the country forward,” he said while replying to the debate in the Rajya Sabha.Chouhan accused the Congress of misusing Mahatma Gandhi’s name for political gains and of disrupting parliamentary proceedings. “I heard the opposition with patience all these hours and expected the opposition to hear my response to the discussion. Making their points, making allegations and running away is like murdering the dreams and ideals of Mahatma Gandhi,” he said.“The entire nation is watching their 'goondagardi' and the opposition is committing the sin of insulting democracy. House 'dadagiri se nahin chalega',” the minister added.He also cited funding figures to defend the government’s record, claiming that while the previous UPA government released Rs 2.13 lakh crore for MGNREGA, the NDA had released nearly Rs 8.53 lakh crore. The opposition, however, maintained that the passage of the Bill without detailed scrutiny set a dangerous precedent and said it would take its protest against the law to the streets across the country.",Opposition parties staged a 12-hour overnight dharna to protest the passage of the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday launched a sharp attack on the Modi government a day after Parliament cleared the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Bill, calling it “anti-state and anti-village by design” and accusing the Centre of dismantling the core of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( MGNREGA ).In a post on X, the LoP in Lok Sabha said the government had “demolished twenty years of MGNREGA in one day”, arguing that the new law was being falsely presented as a reform. “VB–G RAM G isn’t a ‘revamp’ of MGNREGA. It demolishes the rights-based, demand-driven guarantee and turns it into a rationed scheme which is controlled from Delhi,” he wrote, adding that “it is anti-state and anti-village by design”.Rahul said MGNREGA had fundamentally shifted power in rural India by giving workers genuine bargaining leverage. “With real options, exploitation and distress migration fell, wages increased, working conditions improved, all while building and reviving rural infrastructure,” he said.According to him, that leverage was precisely what the government now wanted to weaken. “By capping work and building in more ways to deny it, VB–G RAM G weakens the one instrument which the rural poor had.”Pointing to the Covid-19 crisis, Gandhi said the original scheme proved its value when livelihoods collapsed.“When the economy shut down and livelihoods collapsed, it kept crores from falling into hunger and debt,” he wrote, noting that women had consistently accounted for more than half of all person-days under MGNREGA. He warned that rationing employment would hit the most vulnerable first. “When you ration a jobs programme, it is women, Dalits, Adivasis, landless workers and the poorest OBC communities who get pushed out first. ”The Parliament on Thursday passed the Bill amid noisy protests from the Opposition. While the government insists the legislation will strengthen rural livelihoods, opposition parties, including the Trinamool Congress, have staged demonstrations, accusing the Centre of pushing the Bill through without consensus.","The Parliament on Thursday passed the Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill.

NEW DELHI: The India Meteorological Department has issued a red alert for the next 24 hours, warning of dense to very dense fog across large parts of north India, even as air quality in the national capital and surrounding regions remained in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ category on Friday.According to the IMD, very dense fog is likely to prevail over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with Uttar Pradesh also expected to witness a very cold day. Dense to extremely dense fog has been forecast across Punjab, Uttarakhand and Bihar on December 19 and 20, and over Uttar Pradesh and Haryana during the early morning hours. The weather agency said fog conditions are likely to persist for the next two to three days, raising concerns over reduced visibility, travel delays and road safety.Airport authorities said flight operations were impacted through the day, with 79 departures cancelled, including two international flights, and 73 arrivals cancelled, including two international services. Passengers have been advised to check with their respective airlines for the latest updates before heading to the airport.In Delhi, hazardous air conditions continued, with thick smog blanketing several areas, including Anand Vihar.The Commission for Air Quality Management activated all measures under GRAP Stage IV across Delhi-NCR to curb rising pollution levels.Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed the Air Quality Index at 442 in Ghazipur, 409 in ITO and 447 in Palam, placing these areas in the ‘severe’ category. The city’s overall AQI stood at 330 at 7.47 am, while earlier readings showed levels as high as 358 during the morning hours. At around 8 am, Delhi’s overall AQI was recorded at 387, placing it in the ‘very poor’ category.Authorities advised residents, particularly children, the elderly and people with respiratory ailments, to limit outdoor exposure as pollution continued to pose serious health risks.Dense fog also disrupted aviation operations at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, with flights being operated under CAT III conditions, leading to multiple delays. Delhi International Airport said low visibility was affecting flight schedules.“Dense fog is impacting flight schedules, and operations are currently under CAT III conditions. Our on-ground teams are working in close coordination with all stakeholders to assist passengers and provide necessary support across all terminals. For real-time flight updates, please reach out to your respective airlines. We sincerely regret any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding,” the airport said in a statement.CAT III is a category of the Instrument Landing System that allows aircraft to land in extremely low visibility conditions and requires advanced equipment and specialised pilot training.IndiGo also issued a travel advisory, saying early-morning fog in Delhi and across parts of northern India was disrupting flight operations. “Early-morning fog in Delhi and across parts of northern India is reducing visibility and disrupting flight operations. We seek your understanding, as this is a seasonal occurrence, and flight movements are being managed accordingly to ensure safe and orderly operations.

The most vulnerable regions are concentrated in three broad zones:

Northwest India: Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh — where groundwater recharge exists but indiscriminate withdrawal, driven largely by agriculture, has led to over-extraction.

Bengaluru water crisis

Why is India running out of water?



Rising demand: India’s water demand is expected to outstrip supply by 2030

Agricultural overuse: Water-intensive crops like paddy in Punjab and Haryana

Encroachment of water bodies: Lakes and ponds disappearing, especially in cities like Bengaluru

Climate change: Erratic monsoons and declining river flows

Pollution: Industrial waste, sewage, and mining contaminating groundwater

Weak regulation: Outdated laws like the Easement Act of 1882, which ties groundwater ownership to land

Fragmented governance: Separate authorities for surface and groundwater management

Public apathy: Water treated as a free, unlimited resource

Groundwater overuse and contamination



Nearly 70% of groundwater sources are contaminated

India ranks 120th out of 122 countries on the global water quality index

State and UT-wise classification shows:

Over-exploited (>100%): Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan

Critical (90–100%): Delhi

High stress (70–90%): Tamil Nadu and Puducherry

Moderate to low stress (<70%): All remaining states and UTs, including Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, West Bengal, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and several northeastern states.

The invisible crisis beneath our feet



Behind this lies a darker reality, an informal and often illegal groundwater trade.

In a narrow lane of India, men and women wait quietly with plastic drums lined in rows. Some squat, some sit, with eyes fixed on the bend ahead.Suddenly, the silence breaks. A water tanker reverses into the alley, its engine drowning out the waiting. Young men rush forward, climbing atop the truck, lowering pipes into the tank. Within moments, quiet order unravels into chaos.Hundreds of kilometres away, in rural India, women walk long distances to empty wells, dried-up tubewells and shrinking water bodies, hoping to find a few litres of water.Just because some cities suffered floods doesn’t mean you have water. For a country that supports nearly 17% of the world’s population with just 4% of its freshwater resources, water scarcity has become a daily reality, and not just a distant threat.With India’s population expected to rise from 1.3 billion to nearly 1.7 billion by 2050, the question is no longer whether India is facing a water crisis.But how soon parts of the country will run out!A water crisis occurs when the availability of safe, usable water falls short of demand. The World Bank defines water scarcity as a situation where annual per capita water availability drops below 1,000 cubic metres.India is steadily moving towards this threshold.Despite supporting 17% of the world’s population, India has access to only 4% of global freshwater resources. According to NITI Aayog's Composite Water Management Index (CWMI), the country is facing the worst water crisis in its history, with nearly 600 million people experiencing high to extreme water stress.India’s per capita water availability stood at 1,486 cubic metres in 2021, placing it in the water-stressed category (below 1,700 cubic metres). Government estimates suggest this could fall further to 1,341 cubic metres by 2025 and 1,140 cubic metres by 2050, pushing large parts of the country closer to scarcity.Globally, freshwater reserves have declined sharply over the last two decades, with losses estimated at 324 billion cubic metres every year, enough to meet the annual water needs of 280 million people.According to the Union minister of Jal Shakti releases Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment Report of the Country for the Year 2025, “Groundwater assessment units across India are categorised as safe, semi critical, critical and over exploited, based on the ratio of annual groundwater extraction and replenishment in the phreatic aquifer. The assigned categories aid in planning, management, and regulation of the country's groundwater resources. ”Water consumption worldwide increased by 25% between 2000 and 2019, with nearly a third of that growth occurring in already water-stressed regions, the report stated.Northern India figures prominently among these drying zones, alongside parts of northern China, Central America and the southwestern United States. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, worsening droughts and unsustainable land and water use have accelerated the decline.For India, the implications are stark. Agriculture, livelihoods, urban growth and ecological sustainability all hinge on groundwater, the country’s most heavily used and least regulated water source.Groundwater forms the backbone of India’s water security. According to the 2019 NITI Aayog report, the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) stated that the contribution of groundwater is nearly 62% in irrigation, 85% in rural water supply and 45% in urban water supply.Yet this invisible lifeline is being drawn down faster than it can be replenished. As per the Dynamic Ground Water Resource Assessment 2025, India’s total annual groundwater recharge stands at 448.52 billion cubic metres (bcm).After accounting for natural discharge, the annual extractable resource is estimated at 407.75 bcm. Current extraction has reached 247.22 bcm, pushing the national stage of groundwater extraction to about 60.6%.While the national average may suggest moderate stress, the reality on the ground is far more uneven.Out of the total 6,762 assessment units, around 25% have been categorised as Overexploited, Critical, or Semi-Critical. These are areas where extraction is approaching or exceeding natural recharge, a warning sign that aquifers are under severe stress.States with the highest proportion of over-exploited and critical units include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Delhi. In Punjab, groundwater extraction stands at over 156% of annual recharge. Rajasthan follows closely at 147%, while Delhi’s extraction level exceeds 90%, placing it in the critical category.Urban centres are not immune.Chennai already experienced ‘day zero’ in June 2019, when all four major reservoirs of the big city reservoirs ran dry. People had to line up for hours to wait for a small allocation of water brought in by trucks from other areas.A BBC report, citing UN projections, ranked Bengaluru second after Brazil’s São Paulo, among 11 global cities at risk of running out of drinking water. As water levels drop and summer temperatures rise, cities are imposing restrictions.Lakhs of residents across the 'city of dreams,' Mumbai are too grappling with acute water scarcity. In Bengaluru, authorities have banned the use of potable water for non-essential activities such as washing cars and watering gardens. Yet questions remain over whether fines and regulations alone can avert a full-blown crisis.In rural areas, the crisis manifests differently, in longer walks for water, abandoned wells and failed crops.Experts point to multiple, interconnected causes:India is the largest user of groundwater in the world, accounting for over 25% of global groundwater extraction. The consequences are severe:Groundwater extraction in India is assessed using data from the Minor Irrigation Census and sample surveys conducted by State Ground Water Departments. According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, the country’s total annual groundwater extraction is estimated at 247.22 billion cubic metres (bcm).The agriculture sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 87% of total extraction, or 215.10 bcm. Domestic use contributes 11% (27.89 bcm), while industrial use accounts for the remaining 2% (4.23 bcm).Water-intensive cropping patterns, such as paddy cultivation in Punjab and Haryana, and it continues to strain aquifers, even in regions where rainfall is relatively adequate. As India’s population grows and incomes rise, food demand is expected to surge.According to the NITI report, India’s population is expected to increase to 1.66 billion by 2050. At the same time, per capita income is estimated to increase by 5.5% per annum. With increasing population and purchasing power, the annual food requirement in the country will exceed 250 million tons by 2050. The total demand for grains will increase to 375 million tons including grain for feeding livestock by 2050.”“This will increase the demand for food. The surge in demand for these water-intensive crops will, ceteris paribus, multiply our current agricultural consumption of water,” it added.Despite a national average that masks local crises, groundwater stress is highly concentrated. More than 25% of administrative units fall under over-exploited, critical or semi-critical categories in nine states and UTs: Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Puducherry.These regions face the highest risk of aquifer depletion, underscoring the urgent need for targeted groundwater management, crop diversification and demand-side interventions.Rainfall remains the primary source of groundwater recharge in India, but its distribution varies widely across regions and seasons. Most of the country receives rainfall during the southwest monsoon, while long dry spells dominate the rest of the year.Groundwater levels typically fall before the monsoon and recover partially during and after it. However, CGWB data shows that in 2024, more than 57% of monitored wells recorded a fall in water levels compared to the previous year, with significant declines observed in states such as Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.Geology further complicates the picture.According to the National Compilation on Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025, Karnataka’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 19.27 bcm, while extractable resources stand at 17.41 bcm. While recharge and extractable resources have increased marginally from 2024, extraction has also risen slightly. Overall, the state has seen a modest improvement, with extraction levels dropping from 68.44% in 2024 to 66.49% in 2025.Central Maharashtra, a drought-prone region receiving only 400–700 mm of rainfall annually, remains heavily dependent on groundwater. The state’s annual groundwater recharge is estimated at 33.89 bcm, with extractable resources of 31.99 bcm. Extraction stands at 16.57 bcm, translating to a stage of extraction of 51.79% — a slight improvement from 2024.Punjab remains among the most over-exploited states. Its annual groundwater extraction (26.27 bcm) far exceeds its extractable resource (16.8 bcm), pushing the stage of groundwater extraction to 156.36%.Although extraction has marginally declined from 2024, the state continues to draw far more water than it replenishes, largely due to water-intensive agriculture.Rajasthan’s groundwater situation is similarly alarming. With an annual extraction of 17.10 bcm against extractable resources of 11.62 bcm, the stage of extraction stands at 147.11%. Despite slight improvements in recharge, over-extraction remains entrenched.Delhi’s groundwater extraction stands at 92.10%, placing it in the critical category. While extraction has reduced slightly since 2024, the city remains heavily dependent on groundwater to meet domestic demand.address India’s growing water crisis, the government has rolled out a series of initiatives aimed at conservation, recharge, and equitable access to water. One of the key programmes is the Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), launched in 2019 as a nationwide movement to promote water conservation, groundwater recharge and rainwater harvesting.Another major intervention is the Atal Bhujal Yojana, which emphasises sustainable groundwater management through community participation, improved recharge and regulated extraction.In urban areas, the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0 supports rainwater harvesting through stormwater drainage systems and promotes groundwater recharge via aquifer management plans.The Centre has also launched the Amrit Sarovar initiative, under which 50,000 water bodies, each roughly one acre in size, are being developed across the country to enhance local water storage and recharge.To improve transparency and monitoring, the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has developed a GIS-based public platform called the India Groundwater Resource Estimation System (IN-GRES). The portal visualises groundwater recharge, extraction, rainfall and categorisation at the level of individual assessment units, allowing comparisons with previous years.Yet, even as policies and programmes expand on paper, a parallel and troubling reality persists.India’s water crisis is not just about scarcity, but governance. Groundwater ownership laws dating back to the Easement Act of 1882 allow landowners to extract water beneath their land with few restrictions.Fragmented water management, weak enforcement and limited public awareness have allowed overuse to continue unchecked.While government initiatives, from the Jal Shakti Abhiyan and Atal Bhujal Yojana to large-scale rainwater harvesting and aquifer mapping programmes, aim to reverse the trend, experts may warn that without behavioural change and strict regulation, these measures may not be enough.Water budgeting, which treats water like a financial account, balancing availability against demand is also increasingly being seen as a crucial tool to identify stressed regions before they reach breaking point.Tankers extract water from over-exploited aquifers, frequently without regulation or quality checks, accelerating depletion while raising concerns over contamination.For now, the scenes of tankers, queues and dried wells serve as a warning. India may not be out of water yet, but in many places, it is running out of time. This underground trade, operating largely unchecked risks pushing India towards a long-term groundwater collapse tomorrow.","NITI Aayog has warned that 21 major Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai, face the risk of depleting their groundwater reserves.

Paul Heyman has been one of wrestling's most influential people, shaping eras in ECW and WWE. With his consistent presence both on-screen and behind the scenes on WWE programming, interest in his finances has been rekindled in 2025, raising questions regarding his own wealth and whether or not he even has a combined net worth with his previous wife, Marla Heyman.While entertainment finance outlets regularly estimate Paul Heyman’s earnings, his wife, Marla Heyman, has been able to keep her life quite private, and there are no financial records available to review. Therefore, any conversation about a joint net worth is based on confirmed reporting for Paul Heyman, and the lack of available information is not representative of Marla.According to entertainment finance trackers like Celebrity Net Worth, Paul Heyman's net worth is around $10 million. While not officially verified by WWE or Heyman himself, these numbers are frequently referenced in wrestling media circles.That fortune he has accumulated is largely down to his deep ties to WWE. Wrestling observers associated outlets have covered the subject of Heyman's WWE salary, which was recently reported to be as high as about $2 million per year based on both his onscreen character as well as his offscreen creative prowess.His association with The Bloodline storyline over the past few years has increased this company's cash cow status.Part of Paul Heyman's legacy includes his earlier years with Extreme Championship Wrestling, but not in a good way. Quotes about ECW from court records and wrestling business historians have reported that ECW had declared bankruptcy in the early 00s while also holding a large sum of debt. Though WWE would subsequently purchase ECW's video library and intellectual property and later reinstate the brand's historical significance, this did not equate to a massive paycheck for Heyman personally at the time.Marla Heyman is still not prominent in public financial disclosures. Biographical databases and celebrity background websites have never made clear what her career entailed and what her sources of income were, so assigning an accurate net worth is not possible.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Therefore, any assertions of Paul and Marla Heyman's net worth in 2025 should be taken with a grain of salt. Given the reporting available, the only reasonable conclusion is that Paul Heyman has an independently estimated net worth of around $10 million in addition to whatever Marla Heyman has.Also Read: Paul Heyman reveals his new WWE nickname","According to entertainment finance trackers like Celebrity Net Worth, Paul Heyman's net worth is around $10 million.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon Musk has become the first person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Delhi Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.

NEW DELHI: Air India Express grounded a senior pilot rostered for duty on Friday after he allegedly assaulted a passenger in front of his family at Delhi airport's T1 over the latter being allowed to use a security-check lane where aircraft crew and other staff supposedly get priority.Passenger Ankit Dewan accused Captain Virender Sejwal, en route to Bengaluru by IndiGo to join duty, of leaving him with a bloodied face when he called him out for allegedly ""cutting the queue"". He said the pilot retorted that the lane was meant for staff and asked him if he was ""anpadh"" (illiterate), triggering what was initially a verbal altercation.Also read: ' Are you anpadh': Verbal argument at Delhi airport escalates into physical assault by AIX pilot; how events unfolded Sources said Sejwal, seen in a blood-smeared white shirt in pictures posted by Dewan on his X handle, allegedly struck the passenger when the latter used ""foul language for his ailing mother.""Security personnel intervened and the pilot flew to Bengaluru, but was barred from operating the flight he was to pilot from there. AI Express issued a statement later that Sejwal had been grounded pending an inquiry.Dewan, who describes himself as a ""credit card & miles enthusiast"" in his bio on X, posted on Friday night that he was to board a SpiceJet flight with his wife, daughter and an infant when the fracas took place.The passenger said airport staff guided him and his family to that security-check ""because we had a 4-month-old baby in a stroller"". Dewan wrote that he had to ""see a doctor"" on reaching his destination and that his ""seven-year-old daughter, who saw her father get assaulted brutally, is still traumatised & scared"".""I have no clue how DGCA and Air India Express can allow such pilots to fly. If they can't keep their cool in a scuffle, can they be trusted with the lives of hundreds of people in the sky? How can Delhi airport get away with such mismanagement, combining staff entry with passengers carrying infants, creating chaos at a sensitive security area? I thought airports were safe places,"" he said.Dewan claimed he was forced to write a letter stating that he wouldn't pursue the case. ""It was either write that letter or miss my flight and throw the 1.2 lakh holiday bookings down the drain. Delhi police, why can't I file a complaint after coming back? Will the CCTV footage disappear in the two days till I make it back to Delhi?"" he said.An AI Express spokesperson said the airline ""remains committed to ensuring that its employees act responsibly at all times"".""We are aware of an incident involving one of our employees, who was travelling as a passenger on another airline...

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s joinery from Manipal





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Oracle takes control of data security and algorithm oversight

Deal resolves years of regulatory uncertainty over Chinese ownership





TikTok has secured a rescue deal with American investors, signing binding agreements to create a new US entity that keeps the wildly popular app operational while satisfying national security requirements. The transaction, set to close January 22, comes just two days before a federal ban would have forced TikTok offline for its 170 million American users.CEO Shou Zi Chew announced the agreement in an internal memo, confirming partnerships with Oracle Corporation, investment firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi's state fund MGX. Together, these managing investors will control 45% of the new joint venture, with another 5% going to unnamed new investors. Existing ByteDance investor affiliates hold 30.1%, while ByteDance itself retains just 19.9%.The restructured TikTok will operate under a seven-member, majority-American board with final authority over content moderation and policy decisions within the United States. Oracle assumes responsibility as the ""trusted security partner,"" storing all sensitive US user data in American cloud servers while auditing compliance with national security terms.Critically, TikTok's prized recommendation algorithm—the engine behind its addictive content feed—will be retrained exclusively on US user data to eliminate potential foreign manipulation. Oracle will oversee this process and validate ongoing compliance, though industry observers note questions remain about whether the algorithm has been fully transferred or merely licensed from ByteDance.The agreement caps more than six years of questions about TikTok's future in the United States, driven by concerns that Beijing could access Americans' sensitive data or use the platform to spread propaganda. Congress passed legislation in April 2024 requiring ByteDance to divest its US operations or face prohibition, a law the Supreme Court upheld in January.The deal marks a significant expansion for Oracle beyond traditional enterprise software, positioning the company at the center of one of the world's most influential social media platforms.","TikTok has struck a deal with American investors, including Oracle and Silver Lake, to form a new US entity.

Why Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis thinks the AI startup valuation model is breaking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-google-deepmind-ceo-demis-hassabis-thinks-the-ai-startup-valuation-model-is-breaking/articleshow/126055448.cms,"Big tech vs early-stage hype

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable.

From heritage lanes to high-tech hubs: How Hyderabad Metro is changing the city,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/from-heritage-lanes-to-high-tech-hubs-how-hyderabad-metro-is-changing-the-city/articleshow/126075255.cms,"Hyderabad Metro (File Photo)

Government steps in

Metro’s role in urban mobility

Phase-II hopes

Centre–state engagement and Telangana Rising

Political friction over approvals

Inclusivity and commuter safety

New tracks, old divides

Funding and the road ahead

In Hyderabad, where you live often determines how your day moves.At dawn in the Old City, narrow lanes stir to life, history leaning out of crumbling balconies as two-wheelers squeeze past street vendors. Across town, in the western IT belt, swipe-ins and long commutes dictate an early start.Two worlds—one city. For decades, connected by maps, but separated by access.It is against this backdrop that the Telangana government has moved to take control of Phase-I of the Hyderabad Metro Rail. The decision brings a project built to connect the city’s fragments back into public hands—and raises a more urgent question: can improved public transport bridge Hyderabad’s long-standing divide?Officials have approved the takeover by acquiring Larsen & Toubro’s equity for Rs 2,000 crore and assuming the company’s outstanding debt of Rs 13,000 crore. L&T, which currently holds nearly 90% stake in the operational Metro network, had signalled its intent to exit, citing sustained operational losses, and proposed that the transfer be executed through a government-owned Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV).""We expect the divestment to get completed by the end of the current fiscal FY26,"" L&T said in a filing to BSE.“The takeover process will be carried forward in a carefully calibrated and mutually agreeable manner, duly ensuring all legal and statutory compliances,” chief secretary K Ramakrishna Rao told TOI.The takeover represents a significant shift in Hyderabad’s urban transport landscape. With the Metro coming under direct government control, officials see scope for the system to function not just as a commuter service, but as a wider public utility that improves access to jobs, services and neighbourhoods across the city.Phase 1 of the Hyderabad Metro Rail covers 72 km across three corridors, executed under a public-private partnership (PPP) model. The first corridor opened in Nov 2017, and the final stretch in Feb 2020.Public transport officials have repeatedly warned of the burden on Hyderabad’s roads as the city expands outward.DVS Raju, chief electrical inspector to the Government of India for the Hyderabad Metro project, sees the Metro as critical infrastructure.“Operating one kilometre of Metro is equivalent to replacing seven bus lanes or 24 car lanes,” he said.Raju also highlighted the project’s environmental safeguards, noting that for every tree removed during construction, four to five saplings are planted, and existing trees are translocated wherever feasible as part of the Haritha Haram initiative.Raju said the Hyderabad Metro provides convenient services and meets urban transportation needs. “While it’s true that we faced challenges in the first phase, we are taking cautious steps in planning Phase II,” he added.As Hyderabad continues to grow outward, officials argue that mass transit systems like the Metro provide a way to integrate mobility planning with environmental considerations, while reducing dependence on private vehicles.While Phase-I established a basic network, the proposed second phase of the Metro is expected to significantly expand its reach.Hyderabad Metro Rail Phase-II is planned across five corridors spanning 76.4 km, at an estimated cost of Rs 24,269 crore. Chief minister A Revanth Reddy has submitted proposals to the Centre seeking approval and funding support, proposing the project as a joint venture between the state and central governments.The expansion is designed to improve connectivity between under-served parts of the Old City and major employment hubs in the western and northern parts of Hyderabad. Officials say the intent is clear: enable residents from older neighbourhoods to access employment, education and healthcare facilities more easily, while also improving access to heritage and commercial areas for commuters from newer parts of the city.The Metro expansion forms part of a wider set of infrastructure proposals placed before the Centre under the Telangana Rising framework, which outlines the state’s long-term goal of becoming a $3 trillion economy by 2047.During meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, CM Revanth Reddy sought central approvals and financial backing for Metro Phase-II along with other major infrastructure projects, including the Regional Ring Road, greenfield expressways, and high-speed corridors connecting Hyderabad with ports and cities such as Mangaluru and Rajahmundry.“The state govt has already submitted proposals to the Centre for the expansion of the metro rail by 162.5 km. It is estimated to cost Rs 43,848 crore. The state hasproposed to take it up as a joint venture between the central and state govts,” Revanth told the Prime Minister.The state government has argued that timely approvals are necessary to ensure that these projects progress in step with Hyderabad’s expanding urban footprint.Approval delays have drawn sharp criticism.Congress MLC Vijayashanti has alleged that delays in granting approval for Phase-II may be politically motivated, accusing the Union government of slowing the process despite repeated representations by the state.She urged BJP leaders and central ministers from Telangana to facilitate clearances, arguing that delays ultimately affect city residents who depend on public transport.The debate highlights the complexities involved in executing large-scale infrastructure projects that require coordination between multiple governments.Alongside expansion plans, Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL) has taken steps to strengthen safety and inclusivity across the network. Recently, 20 transgender persons were inducted into HMRL’s security workforce.""The induction of transgender personnel into the security workforce stands as a strong symbol of social empowerment and inclusivity and a significant step towards strengthening women’s safety and public confidence in the metro rail system,"" the release said.Earlier this year, in January, the Telangana government brought 39 transgender persons on board as traffic assistants to assist the city police.Officials noted that women account for around 30% of Metro passengers, and the newly inducted personnel will assist with commuter safety, passenger guidance, baggage screening and maintaining visible security at stations and onboard trains.The initiative reflects efforts to make the Metro system more inclusive while enhancing the sense of safety for daily commuters.Hyderabad’s physical layout reflects its social and economic contrasts.In the Old City, connectivity remains limited and unpredictable. For residents living there, reaching workplaces, hospitals or colleges across town can mean hours on the road. Meanwhile, for newer residential zones, heritage neighbourhoods remain distant destinations, glimpsed occasionally but not lived in.The Metro’s expansion is seen by planners as a key mechanism to narrow this gap—bringing the privilege of access closer to those who need it.The state government has also begun discussions with financial institutions, including the Housing and Urban Development Corporation ( Hudco ), to mobilise funds for Metro expansion. These discussions include financing for related infrastructure projects such as housing schemes, road and radial networks, and proposed greenfield developments.The Metro forms part of a broader infrastructure pitch placed before the Centre under the Telangana Rising framework, which outlines long-term plans to shape the state’s economic future.For the government, approvals must keep pace with the city’s growth.The stakes are high. Beneath the numbers lie everyday struggles—of commuters crossing a divided city, of hours lost in traffic, and of neighbourhoods cut off by uneven development.Hyderabad’s Metro, now at a turning point, is being asked to do more than move people. It is being asked to reconnect a city.","The Telangana government has moved to take control of Phase-I of the Hyderabad Metro Rail. L&T, which currently holds nearly 90% stake in the operational Metro network, had signalled its intent to exit, citing sustained operational losses. Phase-II is planned across five corridors spanning 76.4 km, at an estimated cost of Rs 24,269 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126101205,imgsize-1180038,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/hyderabad-metro.jpg"
"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
