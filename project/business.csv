SC questions TN move to use temple funds for marriage halls' construction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-questions-tn-move-to-use-temple-funds-for-marriage-halls-construction/articleshow/123933142.cms,"NEW DELHI: Questioning Tamil Nadu govt's decision to use surplus funds of temples to build marriage halls, Supreme Court on Tuesday said the assets and premises of religious place should not be used for construction of such halls where vulgar dance and songs might be played.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said that it would not only be dance and music but people would even seek serving of liquor and there will be no control on such activity if it is allowed. The court turned down the plea to stay Madras high court order which had stayed the state govt decision, virtually restraining the state authority not to use temple funds. The court made it clear that spending of even a penny would amount to contempt.HC had quashed the govt orders allowing use of surplus funds belonging to five temples at different locations in Tamil Nadu. The state thereafter moved the apex court against the order of HC.Allaying the apprehension of the court that the temple premises would be misused, the state govt submitted that the construction of marriage halls was for public purpose and added that marrying in temple premises was very normal in the state.Senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Jaideep Gupta said marriage in temples is always performed as per religious ritual without music and dance and sanctity of the religious place would not be violated.The bench, however, asked them why funds should not be used in setting up charitable educational institutions or hospitals.

MobiKwik loses Rs 40 crore in 48 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mobikwik-loses-rs-40-crore-in-48-hours/articleshow/123933014.cms,"GURGAON: Taking advantage of what is believed to be a glitch that blindsided city-based digital wallet company MobiKwik's systems, around Rs 40 crore were allegedly siphoned off over two days, Sept 11 and 12, from the company's account through a blitz of UPI transactions.The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money. Uncannily, this is the second time this has happened to MobiKwik. In Oct 2017, the company was allegedly similarly defrauded of around Rs 19 crore with the money being moved to thousands of personal bank accounts. This time, the glitch happened after the company updated its software earlier this month, investigators said. It apparently allowed Mobikwik users to send much higher amounts of money than their wallet balances. Transactions, the investigators said, also went through if users entered incorrect PINs.Police said how scamsters came to know about this glitch is under probe. Officials said they suspected insiders' involvement. The fraud was reported on Sept 13 by a MobiKwik employee, citing an audit that had detected suspicious transactions on Sept 11 and 12.According to cops, fraudulent transfers over those two hours amounted to Rs 40.2 crore. ""Nearly 5 lakh transactions took place on Sept 11-12, and so far, 2,500 bank beneficiary accounts have been identified. We have managed to freeze Rs 8 crore out of the total fraud amount. This money was deposited in these bank accounts,"" said a source.Five of the arrested men are from Nuh. The other is from Palwal. The accused have been identified as Rehan, Waqar Yunus, Wasim Akram, Mohd Amir, Mohd Ansar and Mohd Sakil. All six have been sent to judicial custody.Police spokesperson Ashok Kumar said if any company employee is found to be involved in the scam, strict action will be taken against the individual. Nuh police on Tuesday, meanwhile, asked people to report by Sept 23 any unexplained cash transfers they might have received in their accounts.""If anyone received transactions on Sept 11 and 12 due to technical security lapses or other reasons via the Mobikwik app or received unauthorised payments through the app and wishes to return them, or has any complaints related to such transactions, they can visit the office of the SP. People from Palwal district and other Mewat areas can also come."" Nuh police said in a statement. They have been charged under Section 318(4) (cheating) and 314 (dishonest misappropriation of property) of BNS. Cops are also coordinating with banks to recover the money and identify others who benefited from the alleged fraud.""The company is undertaking all possible and necessary efforts to recover the amount. However, since the police investigation and recovery efforts have just started, it's not yet possible to ascertain the impact. Based on the preliminary data, as a risk mitigating measure, the FIR was lodged for an amount of Rs 40 crore, out of which, the company has recovered around Rs 14 crore. Thus, the estimated net impact is Rs 26 crore. The company is taking aggressive collection efforts while pursuing legal course of action to recover the full amount over a period of time,"" a company spokesperson told TOI.","The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money.

Daylight Saving Time: Change ends sooner than usual; when will the clocks fall back?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/daylight-saving-time-change-ends-sooner-than-usual-when-will-the-clocks-fall-back/articleshow/123863573.cms,".





Daylight saving time (DST) will end sooner than usual this year on Sunday, November 2, 2025, at 2:00 am local time.With it, Americans will have an extra hour of sleep, and also earlier sunsets in many regions. This year’s change is a day earlier than last year and is the second-earliest possible date for the shift since daylight saving time falls on the first Saturday in November, the earliest possible date is November 1.Experts often remind people to use the extra hour to reset sleep schedules, check smoke detector batteries, and prepare for the shorter days ahead, making the shift a small but useful reminder to prioritize health and safety.Daylight saving time, observed from March to November, was introduced to make better use of daylight. In spring, clocks are moved forward to extend evening daylight, while in autumn, clocks are set back to give more light in the mornings.Under current federal rules set by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, DST begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November. Next year, clocks will move forward again on Sunday, March 8, 2026.Most US states follow DST, but not all. Hawaii and most of Arizona do not observe the change, citing limited benefit due to their climates. The Navajo Nation, which spans parts of Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico, does observe DST to maintain consistent time across its territory. Five US territories, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, also do not follow DST.For many Americans, shifting the clocks requires changes to daily routines. Longer daylight in spring is generally seen as a benefit, while the fall shift brings darker mornings and earlier sunsets, disrupting commutes, outdoor plans, and schedules.","This year's change is a day earlier than last year and is the second-earliest possible date for the shift.

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh called on the armed forces to move beyond traditional notions of warfare and remain prepared for ""invisible challenges"" such as information, ideological, ecological, and biological warfare.His remarks came at the Combined Commanders’ Conference 2025 in Kolkata on September 16, according to a Ministry of Defence press release.Emphasising the rapidly shifting global order, regional instability, and emerging security threats, Singh said constant reassessment of the world’s changes was critical for India’s security. He underlined that the “nature of warfare is continuously evolving,” with recent global conflicts highlighting the need for a “technology-friendly” military.“Wars of today are so sudden and unpredictable that it is extremely difficult to foretell its duration. It can be two months, a year, or even five years. We need to be prepared. We need to ensure that our surge capacity remains sufficient,” the Defence minister said, according to news agency ANI.Terming India’s defence posture an amalgamation of offensive and defensive capabilities, Singh urged commanders to proactively shape strategies and “strive to build the Sudarshan Chakra as envisioned by PM Modi.”A committee has been formed to examine the project and prepare a “realistic action plan,” he said, suggesting a five-year medium-term plan and a ten-year long-term plan to make the vision a reality.He also called for adopting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mantra of “JAI (Jointness, Aatmanirbharta and Innovation)” to drive modernisation, operational readiness, technological superiority, and credible deterrence.Stressing the importance of partnerships, Singh batted for deeper engagement with industry and academia to develop future-ready technologies. He reaffirmed PM Modi’s vision to expand the private sector’s role in building a robust defence innovation ecosystem and making India’s domestic industry “the biggest & best in the world.”Equally vital, he said, was synergy among the Armed Forces and civil agencies. Calling jointness “essential” to confront future challenges, Singh pointed to initiatives such as the creation of Tri-Service Logistics Nodes and a Tri-Service Logistic Management Application to enhance integration.Highlighting India’s growing self-reliance, Singh said: “Operation Sindoor has demonstrated that Strength, Strategy and Self-reliance are the three pillars that will give India the power it needs in the 21st century. Today, we have the capability to face any challenge with the help of indigenous platforms and systems coupled with the indomitable courage of our soldiers. This is the real strength of Aatmanirbhar Bharat .”Reiterating that self-reliance is “not a slogan, but a necessity,” Singh argued that defence indigenisation under Aatmanirbhar Bharat is fueling economic growth, generating jobs, and boosting capacities of shipyards, aerospace clusters, and defence corridors.He announced his approval of the Defence Procurement Manual 2025 to streamline acquisitions, while noting that the Defence Acquisition Procedure 2020 is also being revised to “simplify the processes, reduce delays, and provide operational strength to the forces quickly.”The conference was attended by Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan, Navy Chief Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi, Air Force Chief Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, DRDO Chairman Dr Samir V Kamat, and other senior officials.",Defence minister Rajnath Singh calls on armed forces to move beyond traditional notions of warfare.

anti-conversion laws

after states' responses

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Tuesday asked states, which have enacted anti-conversion legislations and most of which are governed by BJP, to file their responses to pleas challenging stringent provisions in those laws criminalising inter-faith marriages. The laws seek to prohibit conversion through threat, allurement, deceit or influence. At the same time, SC put the onus on individuals to prove their marital ties haven't been forged through deceit.A bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K V Vinod Chandran asked the states which have enacted the anti-conversion laws, also known as 'Freedom of Religion Acts', to respond to the allegations levelled by petitioners, including Teesta Setalvad-led Citizens for Justice and Peace , People's Union for Civil Liberties, women's wing of Communist Party of India - National Federation of Indian Women and Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind.The states which have enacted anti-conversion laws include UP, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, MP, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Haryana, Odisha, HP, Jharkhand, Karnataka and Arunachal Pradesh.Responding to the plea by petitioners for staying the laws, the bench said it will consider freezing them after the states file their responses. It asked the states to file their response in four weeks and posted the matter for hearing after six weeks.Senior advocate C U Singh, appearing for CJP, said the petitioner has sought permission to amend the petition to challenge the changes made in the anti-conversion law of Uttar Pradesh, which now provide for a minimum punishment of 20 years incarceration on conviction under the law. He said getting bail under such stringent laws would be very difficult. The bench permitted the petitioner to amend the petition.Senior advocate Indira Jaising sought transfer of a petition, which is pending in Madhya Pradesh high court challenging the state's anti-conversion law, to Supreme Court. Additional solicitor general K M Nataraj said all petitions pending in HCs could be transferred to SC for adjudication to avoid multiplicity of proceedings on the same issue and for a comprehensive ruling.The court ordered the de-tagging of advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay's plea seeking ban on conversion. The CJI asked how conversion could be banned, leading the advocate to say he was for stringent laws against conversion by marriage based on deceit and allurement.","Supreme Court asks states, which have enacted anti-conversion legislations, to file their responses to pleas challenging provisions in those laws.

KOLHAPUR: A 27-year-old mother of triplets gave birth to quadruplets — three girls and a boy — prematurely through C-section during 33rd week of pregnancy at the Krantisinha Nana Patil Civil Hospital in Satara on Friday evening. Treating doctors said all the newborns weighed between 1.3kg and 1.4kg, significantly below the typical birth weight range of 2.5kg to 3.5kg, and were being cared for in incubators.A full-term pregnancy is considered to be after 38 weeks. ""The newborns are stable. A dedicated team of nurses is closely monitoring their progress,"" a doctor said, adding that the woman was unaware of multiple pregnancy till she developed labour pains.The woman, Kajal Vikas Khakardiya, had delivered triplets five years ago. ""Kajal and her husband, Vikas, work as construction workers and reside in Pune district's Saswad. Originally from Gujarat, the couple has been living in Maharashtra for several years,"" the doctor said.According to the doctors, Kajal had travelled to Koregaon to visit her relatives when she began experiencing labour pains. A local doctor conducted a scan and discovered that she was carrying multiple babies, something Kajal was unaware of.The doctor promptly referred her to the Krantisinha Nana Patil Civil Hospital in Satara, where she was transported by ambulance on Friday morning. After a thorough clinical evaluation, doctors opted for a C-section delivery, given the high-risk attached to such pregnancies.Dr Yuvraj Karpe, civil surgeon of Satara, told TOI, ""Kajal was in her 33rd week of gestation. Quadruplet births are extremely rare, occurring in only one of every five to six lakh cases. She had previously delivered triplets (one boy and two girls). These types of pregnancies carry significant risks, including the possibility of the babies developing anaemia (a condition marked by low red blood cell count), and the mother facing elevated blood pressure levels. ""The doctors said multiple pregnancies were a natural occurrence in the in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) mode or test tube babies. ""The sonography before 12 weeks of pregnancy is very important. Proper scanning helps detect the number of babies conceived,"" Dr Karpe said.Vikas, the father, said, ""I rushed from Saswad to Satara to sign the form required by doctors to carry out the delivery. I was only hoping for everything to go well. The doctors at the hospital are very caring. The other staffers are also taking care of our babies and my wife.""","Kajal Vikas Khakardiya, 27, had delivered triplets five years ago. The newborns weighed between 1.3kg and 1.4kg.

Proper drainage system along arterial and sub-arterial roads

Regular cleaning of the main and service roads

Shuttle services to connect residential areas with offices

BENGALURU: A city-based IT company has decided to move out of its current location — not because of unfriendly policy parameters or power cuts, but potholes.Yes, you read it right. Potholes.Rajesh Kumar Yabaji, the Bengaluru-based CEO of digital trucking platform BlackBuck, has announced on X that his company is on its way out of its Bellandur office, off Outer Ring Road (ORR), after nine years of operations. His post, which read like a breakup note, said: ""ORR (Bellandur) has been our ‘office + home' for the last 9 years.

A torturous commute that takes his colleagues more than an hour-and-a-half one way, on roads that resemble the surface of the moon.Bellandur, which was one of the first localities in Bengaluru to witness rapid growth in terms of office space and residential units as home to global IT giants, is notorious for broken roads, clogged drains, crumbling infrastructure and govt apathy.Worse still, the CEO has little hope of the situation improving in the next five years.Bluntly pointing to the traffic trauma, Yabaji posted, ""Roads full of potholes and dust, coupled with the lowest intent to get them rectified. Did not see any of this changing in the next five years.""While the state govt is yet to react to this grim development, deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar's earlier replies to similar concerns were on the beaten track, saying: ""Bengaluru is not a planned city. Work (fixing) cannot be completed in a single day, [but] we are on the job.""The ORR stretch between Silk Board and K R Puram is an IT corridor that houses more than 500 companies, with nearly a million professionals commuting daily. In fact, the tech parks along the stretch have witnessed a 45% jump in vehicular traffic, compared to last year.What comes across as a practical joke is that Bellandur continues to be the highest revenue generator for the city's civic body.While netizens rallied behind Yabaji for standing by employee welfare, former Infosys CFO and Aarin Capital chief Mohandas Pai interpreted the BlackBuck move as a ""big failure of governance in Bengaluru"".Drawing the attention of the deputy CM, Pai's fervent appeal says: ""Please see, companies are moving out of ORR. Situation beyond hope. Please intervene.""Weighing in on the issue, BJP state president B Y Vijayendra commented: ""The city's infrastructure is choking under pressure. Time, talent, and investment are slipping away because of the govt's apathy. A city built over decades into a global tech hub is now being undone by neglect.""A few netizens, though, trained their guns on Vijayendra, alleging that as the local MLA and MP, he has done little to address the issue.In fact, netizen Shankar summed up Bellandur's woes, saying: ""Bellandur feels like a workplace purgatory. The roads are a mess, pedestrian infrastructure is practically non-existent, the air is thick with dust and greenery is a distant dream. Parking is a daily nightmare and traffic management is so chaotic, you can be trapped for kilometres.""""Greater Bengaluru IT Companies and Industries Association expresses deep concern over the continued infrastructure neglect along ORR. The decision of leading firms to move out highlights the urgent need for govt intervention. We call for a transparent roadmap to improve roads, Metro connectivity, and public utilities, and reiterate our willingness to collaborate with the authorities to restore Bengaluru's status as the tech capital of India.

French luxury conglomerate Kering confirmed Monday that hackers accessed customer data from several of its high-end brands, including Gucci, Balenciaga, and Alexander McQueen, potentially affecting 7.4 million customers worldwide. The cybercriminals, identified as the notorious ShinyHunters group, stole names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and detailed spending records showing individual purchase amounts ranging from thousands to over $80,000.The Paris-based company, which discovered the breach in June, said no financial information including credit card details or bank account numbers was compromised. Kering has notified affected customers and relevant data protection authorities across multiple countries, though it declined to specify which regions were impacted.The Kering incident represents the latest in a wave of cyberattacks targeting luxury brands throughout 2025. The breach occurred in April during a period when hackers also successfully targeted other premium retailers, including Cartier owner Richemont and LVMH brands like Louis Vuitton, which suffered a separate data leak affecting 419,000 customers.ShinyHunters, communicating through encrypted messaging app Telegram, claimed responsibility for the attack and allegedly attempted to extort Kering for ransom payments in Bitcoin.The company denied engaging in any negotiations with the criminals, following law enforcement guidance against paying ransoms.The stolen data poses particular risks for high-spending customers, as detailed purchase histories could make them targets for secondary scams and sophisticated social engineering attacks. Some customer records analyzed showed spending patterns exceeding $30,000 across individual luxury brands.Cybersecurity experts at Google previously warned about ShinyHunters' tactics, which typically involve tricking employees into revealing login credentials for internal systems. The group, also known as UNC6040 by security researchers, has expanded operations significantly, even successfully breaching Google's own systems earlier this year.","Kering confirmed Monday that hackers accessed customer data from several of its high-end brands, including Gucci, Balenciaga, and Alexander McQueen.

‘What does that mean…’: Pope Leo on Elon Musk’s $1 trillion pay package proposal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/what-does-that-mean-pope-leo-on-elon-musks-1-trillion-pay-package-proposal/articleshow/123901281.cms,"Tesla board’s chairperson defends Musk's $1 trillion pay package

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Tesla recently proposed a $1 trillion pay package for the company’s CEO Elon Musk . The pay package has drawn fresh criticism, this time from Pope Leo XIV, who warned it reflects dangerous levels of inequality in society. In a media interview, published by Crux last week as part of a new biography by Senior Correspondent Elise Ann Allen, the Pope said such outsized compensation highlights the widening gap between workers and corporate executives.“Yesterday the news that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world. What does that mean and what's that about?” Pope Leo said. “The Chicago-born linked Musk’s pay deal to growing polarization in both society and the Catholic Church. “CEOs that 60 years ago might have been making four to six times more than what the workers are receiving … 600 times more (now),” he said. He warned that if money alone defines value, “then we’re in big trouble.”Musk’s package has been at the center of debate in recent months. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders called it “grossly immoral” and “insane economics,” while Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm defended it as a reward for “doing things that no one else has done before.”Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas described it as a “good deal” for investors despite the massive number.Musk remains the world’s richest man, though he was briefly overtaken last week by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison after Oracle’s earnings beat expectations.The chairperson of Tesla's board of directors, Robyn Denholm, has defended Musk’s new multibillion-dollar compensation plan. The plan, which could be the largest in corporate history, was unveiled in a regulatory filing last week. In a recent interview with The New York Times, at Tesla’s engineering headquarters in California, Denholm said that Musk's compensation should depend on his ability to achieve ""seemingly impossible goals. "" She stated that Musk is capable of delivering world-changing technology if he is driven by these ambitious targets, even as the company faces a drop in sales and profits.“Putting together any compensation plan, you need to look at what motivates the individual that you’re trying to motivate. And for Elon, it’s doing things that no one else has done before,” Denholm said when asked about Musk’s proposed pay package.",Tesla recently proposed a $1 trillion pay package for the company’s CEO Elon Musk.

NEW DELHI: A woman who delivered a baby at the municipal corporation's Kasturba Hospital in old Delhi in July recently discovered that doctors had inserted a birth control device without informing her or her family and without her consent.""I delivered a healthy baby girl on July 28 through Caesarean section and was discharged in the first week of Aug,"" said Sinky Rajouria, a first-time mother. ""Things were okay until recently when I began feeling pain. I then found a thread hanging out of my body. I told my mother about it and we realised it was from a copper T device. We were shocked since I hadn't asked for it nor was I informed about its insertion.""According to Pawan Singh Rajouria, Sinky's husband, the thread created great discomfort, so they visited the hospital on Monday. ""The OPD doctor told us that he didn't have the tool to sever the thread and asked us to come back the following day.

NEW DELHI: Delhi and Maharashtra have emerged as the major interception hub for cocaine - 'the rich man's drug' - seizures, according to the latest Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) report, unveiled by Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday.In 2024, combined cocaine seizures in Delhi and Maharashtra, were nearly 78 times more than the quantity seized in 2020 and about five times higher than in 2023, the bureau said. The number of registered cases nearly doubled compared to 2020.According to the figures released by NCB, cocaine seizures stood at 19 kg in 2020, which jumped to 364 kg in 2021. Although there was a slight dip to 218 in 2022, the numbers rose again to 292 kg in 2023. However, the most striking increase was in 2024, with seizures soaring to 1,483 kg.Multiple cocaine busts happened in Delhi in 2024. Last July, CBI had intercepted a German national of Indian origin with nearly 6 kg of grade-A cocaine at the Delhi airport. The value of the seized drug stood at around Rs 100 crore in the international market. In Oct, Delhi Police's special cell had seized over 700 kg of cocaine estimated to be worth around Rs 8,000-9,000 crore.Cocaine is a potent stimulant that can produce feelings of euphoria and energy, often referred to as a ""trip"".When consumed, it increases levels of dopamine in the brain, leading to sensations of pleasure and confidence. However, the effects are short-lived, often followed by a severe crash, leaving users craving more. Cocaine's association with luxury and high life has earned it the nickname ""the rich man's drug"", with the street price going up to Rs 20,000 per gram in Delhi and other states.NCB report details other drug seizures as well. In Delhi, the data for 2024 reveals Amphetamine seizures stood at 37.8 kg, Pseudoephedrine seizures amounted to 87.5 kg, and ganja seizures were the highest at 4,903 kg. Additionally, hashish seizures totalled 63.5 kg, and heroin seizures stood at 234 kg.After the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in the use of courier and postal services for drug smuggling, offering traffickers greater anonymity and enabling direct access to consumers, NCB found.Consolidated seizures by various drug enforcement agencies across the country reveal recoveries of 17,420 kg of ganja, 3,391 kg of hashish, 170 kg of heroin and 11,376 kg of acetic anhydride, a key precursor in heroin production. Other major seizures include 297 kg of opium and 987 kg of amphetamine-type stimulants.A notable trend shows a nearly sixfold increase in synthetic drug seizures - such as amphetamines, MDMA, mephedrone and methaqualone - rising from 1,890 kg in 2019 to 11,994 kg in 2024, according to the report.","Delhi and Maharashtra have emerged as major interception hub for cocaine.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Setback for Trump?

U.S. Dollar CRASHES Hours After Trump's Unprecedented Move Against Fed Governor Cook | Details





A federal appeals court has ruled that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can remain in her post, allowing her to take part in this week’s closely watched interest rate meeting, despite President Donald Trump’s attempt to remove her from the board. The decision from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit came on Monday, hours after Trump announced Cook’s dismissal in a letter posted on Truth Social, accusing her of mortgage fraud.“In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, [Americans] cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity,” Trump wrote. “I have determined that there is sufficient cause to remove you from your position.” Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed’s board, has denied the allegations and pledged not to be “bullied to step down.” She has also filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the accusations are unrelated to her role at the central bank and remain unproven.The allegations originated with Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who claimed Cook had listed more than one home as her primary residence in 2021 to secure favourable mortgage terms.The Justice Department has since opened an investigation, with subpoenas issued in Georgia and Michigan, and reports suggesting a grand jury in Atlanta is examining the case. Cook has not been charged, and her legal filing describes the allegations as a pretext to force her out and open a seat for Trump to fill.Legal experts say the case raises fundamental questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve. Governors can only be removed “for cause,” a standard that historically covers proven misconduct or neglect. Trump’s move marks the first attempt by a president to fire a sitting Fed governor in the institution’s 112-year history, and observers expect the dispute could reach the Supreme Court.The legal fight comes as the Fed begins a two-day policy meeting, with markets anticipating a rate cut of at least 25 basis points. Investors are watching closely for signals of further easing as the US economy slows and trade talks with China continue.","Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can remain in her post, despite President Donald Trump's attempt to remove her from the board.

Understanding solar eclipses – Types and what to expect

Total solar eclipse



The Moon completely covers the Sun.

Observers in a narrow zone experience brief daylight darkness.

Spectacular but rare. Partial solar eclipse



Only part of the Sun is covered by the Moon.

Creates a crescent or “bitten” appearance of the Sun.

This is the type occurring on September 21, 2025. Annular solar eclipse



The Moon is farther from Earth and doesn’t fully cover the Sun.

A ring of sunlight remains visible, forming the “ring of fire” effect.





In an extraordinary celestial turn, September 2025 is bookended by two eclipses, a lunar eclipse on the 7th and a solar eclipse just 15 days later. While the Moon recently turned a vivid red in a dramatic lunar display, the sky will offer another rare phenomenon: a partial solar eclipse on September 21, timed just before the equinox. However, this spectacle won’t be visible everywhere, and the UAE is among the regions that will miss it.On September 21, 2025, a partial solar eclipse will occur near the equinox, visible mainly across select regions in the Southern Hemisphere. Unlike a total eclipse, this will be a partial solar eclipse, where the Moon covers only part of the Sun, creating a crescent-shaped sliver of sunlight. Even as a partial eclipse, it provides a rare chance to observe the Sun’s changing face.This event holds additional significance because it closely precedes the September equinox, which falls on September 22, 2025. The equinox is one of two moments in the year when the Sun is directly above the Earth’s equator, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths across the globe. Because of this timing, the eclipse is also being called an ""equinox eclipse"", adding to its astronomical and symbolic intrigue.The event also carries cultural and astrological meaning. This year's Pitru Paksha — a fortnight in the Hindu calendar dedicated to ancestral remembrance and rituals — uniquely begins with a lunar eclipse and ends with this solar eclipse, a rare alignment astrologers consider especially potent. This celestial pairing not only marks an important astronomical event but also deepens the spiritual significance of Pitru Paksha for many observers.Also Read: Saudi National Day 2025 The September 21 partial solar eclipse will be visible only in specific parts of the Southern Hemisphere, offering clear views to skywatchers in select regions.Skywatchers in visible regions must use proper solar filters or eclipse glasses to view the partial eclipse safely.Unlike the lunar eclipse on September 7, which had wide visibility across many countries, this solar eclipse will not be visible in the UAE or most parts of the Northern Hemisphere.Countries that will not witness any part of the eclipse include:This means millions of skywatchers across Asia and the Americas will miss the event entirely — a sharp contrast to the global excitement generated by the earlier lunar eclipse.A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, partially or fully blocking sunlight in specific areas on Earth. These alignments don’t happen frequently in the same place due to the precise positioning required.There are three main types of solar eclipses:Although this particular eclipse is not a total one, its timing, rarity, and symbolic links to the equinox and Pitru Paksha make it a notable event in the 2025 celestial calendar.This will be the last solar eclipse of 2025, concluding a year that featured two solar eclipses","The final solar eclipse of 2025 on September 21 will be partially visible in southern Australia.

Aid meant for relief diverted? Pakistan funding reconstruction of LeT HQ destroyed in Op Sindoor; what intel says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/aid-meant-for-relief-diverted-pakistan-funding-reconstruction-of-let-hq-destroyed-in-op-sindoor-what-intel-says/articleshow/123878923.cms,"Intel Reveals Pak Using Aid To Rebuild LeT HQ Hit In Op Sindoor, Experts Say ‘Time To Strike Again’

Poll Do you believe the reconstruction of LeT's Markaz Taiba is a threat to regional security? Yes, it poses a significant threat. No, it will not impact security.

How India destroyed LeT HQ



Why its reconstruction is a matter of concern?







Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba, which was destroyed in precision airstrikes during Operation Sindoor on May 7. According to ANI, citing an agency dossier, LeT has launched fundraising campaigns under the pretext of flood relief to support the redevelopment project.Moreover, Islamabad has already allocated PKR 4 crore, though the group estimates costs at over PKR 15 crore. The dossier stated that its army and ISI remain involved in sustaining and reviving LeT.Senior commanders Maulana Abu Zar and Yunus Shah Bukhari are overseeing the project, due by February 2026, mirroring past cases where LeT diverted humanitarian aid, including most of the 2005 earthquake relief, to militant infrastructure.This comes amidst Pakistan's continuous assertions on global platforms that it was combating terrorism.The Indian Air Force (IAF), earlier this year, showcased the extensive damage caused to LeT Muridke headquarters during Operation Sindoor, highlighting the precision and reach of the strikes.Muridke, home to LeT’s Markaz Taiba, was identified as a critical target. The strikes hit senior leadership residential areas and office buildings where commanders convened for planning and operations.The IAF showed videos captured directly from the weapons, pointing out the level of devastation within the complex.The airstrikes reportedly killed around a dozen high-value terrorists, including Yusuf Azhar, the IC-814 hijacker, Abu Jundal (also known as Mudassar), the Muridke chief of LeT, and the son of the planner of the 2016 Nagrota attack. The operation, conducted in retaliation for the Pahalgam killings, reinforced India’s ability to carry out precise, high-impact missions inside enemy territory.The ongoing reconstruction of LeT Markaz Taiba headquarters has raised serious concerns regarding regional security, given the facility’s central role in training and radicalizing terrorists. Established in 2000, the complex serves as both a residence for senior commanders and a training ground where recruits are instructed in intelligence gathering, arms handling, and other operational skills. Analysts warn that reviving the facility could strengthen LeT’s operational capabilities and enable the recruitment of new militants.Markaz Taiba functions as the “alma mater” of LeT, providing courses that combine physical and arms training with ideological indoctrination. The center attracts recruits from within Pakistan and abroad, using religious and radicalization programs to cultivate loyalty and operational skills among future militants. Its facilities, including a mosque and guest house financed by Osama bin Laden, underscore the longstanding support the organization has received from international terror networks.The scale of the operation at Markaz Taiba further amplifies the threat. The facility reportedly trains around 1,000 students annually, preparing them for operational roles within LeT. Past evidence has shown that graduates of this center have gone on to participate in high-profile attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, highlighting the direct link between the facility and acts of cross-border terrorism targeting India.LeT’s historical connection with Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus adds another layer of concern. Senior commanders at the facility, including those who oversaw training for the 26/11 perpetrators, have operated under the guidance of the ISI.","Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba.

More Than 150,000 Evacuated in Pakistan Punjab After India’s Flood Alert





Train operations on five rail sections in Punjab have been suspended due to damage caused to railway tracks and infrastructure by ongoing floods and heavy rains in the province, Dawn reported.According to an internal report compiled by the Pakistan Railways (PR) and cited by Dawn, the Narowal-Sialkot section has remained closed since August 27 after floodwater breached a portion of the track. The report said a Girder Span of bridge No 7 near Aik Nullah was also misaligned, allowing floodwater to maintain a high level and overtop the track. Repair works are underway and operations are expected to resume by September 12.The PR report further noted that the Chak Jhumra-Shaheenabad (Sargodha) section was closed for rail traffic on August 29 when an ""exceptionally high flood damaged bridge No 132 & 134 near Chiniot."" Efforts are ongoing to repair or reconstruct the bridge to restore train operations, it added, according to Dawn.Similarly, the Wazirabad-Sialkot section was closed on September 3 after floodwater overtopped the track between Wazirabad-Sodhra Kopra.The Jhang-Shaheenabad section has also been shut since August 28 after flooding breached an area near the Rivaz Railway Bridge over the river Chanab. ""The floodwater is still passing through the breached section, as the train traffic remains suspended,"" the report stated.Dawn further reported that the Khanewal-Shorkot section was closed on September 3 due to high flood levels at Abdul Hakim Bridge No 27 and breaches between Abdul Hakim and Darkana stations. Temporary disruptions were also recorded at Shahdra-Faisalabad, Lahore-Badami Bagh, Uggoki-Sialkot, Port Qasim-Bin Qasim, Kotri-Dadu, Tando Adam-Hyderabad, and Peshawar Saddar-Cant sections due to flooding, embankment cuts, mudslides, and fallen trees, the PR document noted.Meanwhile, the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) also reported widespread damage to its infrastructure. ""As many as 73,724 consumers suffered power disruptions, and of them, 13,073 are still without electricity,"" Lesco Chief Executive Officer Ramzan Butt said in a statement, as quoted by Dawn.

KATHMANDU: On a stroll through Kathmandu’s Thamel district—the beating heart of Nepal’s tourist trade—the presence of China is hard to miss. Shop signs flash Mandarin translations, and even restaurant menus have dish details elaborated in the language. In narrow lanes once dominated almost entirely by Indian backpackers and European trekkers, Chinese tourists now form a noticeable second wave.At Tribhuvan International Airport, the shift has been made official. Alongside a long-standing immigration counter reserved for Indian citizens, a new one has been set up for Chinese travellers, with colourful words saying: 'Celebrating 70 years of Nepal-China friendship'. The gesture complements an existing visa-free regime for Chinese citizens, making their entry smoother than ever in the Himalayan nation.For Mausam Rana, a hotel manager in Thamel, the impact is visible in the guest ledger. “Indians still form the bulk of our clientele,” he said. “But Chinese numbers are rising. Till some time back, our hotel used to have around 15 or 20 Chinese tourists in a month—now it’s double that.With campaigns like 'Visit Nepal' this year and better flight connections, the peak season could bring even more.”Official data seems to confirm what the eye sees. In August, Nepal welcomed 88,680 foreign visitors, a 22 % rise from last year. Indians accounted for 40 %, Chinese 8.5 %, and Americans about 6 %. Himal Gautam, director at department of tourism, Nepal, told TOI, ""In August, a total of 7,533 Chinese tourists visited Nepal in comparison to 6,614 in the same month last year. SImilarly, in May, a total of 8,824 tourists from China visited our country against 8,381 in May last year.Indian tourists have always topped the chart in terms of foreign tourists visiting our country. But we are happy that more tourists are also coming from China and other countries as well.""The new relationship extends beyond tourism. Chinese automakers—BYD, Leap Motors, Omoda, XPENG, Dongfeng Forthing, Great Wall, to name a few, have flooded Kathmandu’s streets with sleek electric vehicles. Taxi driver Sushil Thapa, who has worked the roads for two decades, says Indian cars once ruled. “Now, whole fleets run on Chinese EVs. They’re stylish, affordable, and packed with features.”For Kathmandu-based analysts like Kanchan Jha, the trend is unmistakable. “It reflects a look-beyond-India mindset,” he said. “Our ties with India remain deep, but there is value in cultivating another giant across the mountains.”","In August, Nepal welcomed 88,680 foreign visitors, a 22 % rise from last year.

As Nepal picks up its pieces following the violent protests that left many of the country's iconic buildings as well as hundreds of govt offices and homes badly damaged, an unusual economy is stirring amidst the rubble. Scrap dealers in Kathmandu are bracing for a windfall, as heaps of building material, metal and junk is cleared from vandalised govt complexes, burnt-down car showrooms, and ransacked supermarkets.""The junk largely comprises charred cars, damaged furniture and other metal scrap from torched public buildings,"" an official of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City administration said. ""It will eventually be auctioned to scrap dealers through tenders once cleanup is complete,"" he added.Among the areas that were ravaged in the Sept 8-9 'Gen Z' protests that led to downfall of the KP Sharma Oli government were the historic Singha Durbar, the Supreme Court, office of the attorney general, and the parliament building in Kathmandu. Besides, scores of govt offices in around 250 municipalities were damaged due to vandalism and arson, a spokesperson at the ministry of federal affairs and general administration was quoted as saying by The Kathmandu Post.Biratnagar’s four-storey municipal building was reduced to rubble, while two ward offices were burned. Birgunj saw three of its seven buildings rendered unusable, and 95 per cent of municipal properties destroyed, the newspaper reported.“What happened to the properties was very unfortunate. They should not have been damaged. But then somebody has to now take care of disposal of the mess. Scrap dealers will do that,” said Paban Tamling, a local scrap merchant. He added that business could triple or even quadruple.“Before the protest, the annual business of scrap dealing in Kathmandu was around 2 crore Nepalese rupees. But now, after the vandalism and arson, it would easily cross over 5 crore,” Tamling added.Deepak Jaiswal, who runs the recycling firm 'Thalo Kawadi', echoed the sentiment. “We are waiting for officials to finish assessing the damage and then float tenders. The number of bidders this time will surely increase, as many will try to jump into the business. It sounds odd after such tragic events, but it’s the harsh truth—someone’s loss is another’s business.”","Scrap dealers in Kathmandu are bracing for a windfall as heaps of building material, metal and junk is cleared from vandalised govt complexes, burnt-down car showrooms, and ransacked supermarkets.

Poorest often hit hardest

'Ban fossil fuel lobbying'





PARIS: The extraction, transportation and burning of planet-heating fossil fuels have a huge impact on people's health that starts before they are born and lasts until they die, a report warned Tuesday.Pollution from fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas has been linked to a vast range of health problems, including miscarriages, asthma, cancer, strokes, heart disease and more.""Fossil fuels are a direct assault on health, harming us at every stage of their lifecycle and every stage of our lives, from the womb to old age,"" Shweta Narayan, the author of the new report from the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said in a statement.The alliance, which includes more than 200 organisations representing 46 million health workers around the world, said the report was the first comprehensive global overview of how fossil fuels affect health across lifetimes.Living near coal mines or fracking sites has been linked to higher rates of premature births, miscarriages and other problems during pregnancies, according to peer-reviewed research cited in the report.During childhood, air pollution from fossil fuels is associated with higher rates of asthma and cancers such as leukaemia, it added.Once in old age, people exposed to air pollution have been found to have an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, certain forms of dementia -- and early death.Aside from the health impacts of extracting and burning fossil fuels, transporting them can also pose a threat, such as gas pipe lines leaking into water systems or mass oil spills.Even once the fossil fuels have been burnt, chemicals such as lead, mercury, and ""forever chemicals"" PFAS persist in the soil, water and food chain, the report warned.Extreme weather events made more fierce and common by fossil fuel-driven global warming can compound the impact on health. Hurricanes can knock out health facilities, for example, while smoke from bushfires can cause breathing problems.The immense toll on health often falls on already disadvantaged and marginalised communities in poorer nations, it added.Children and the elderly living near coal mines in the central Indian district of Korba ""struggle with asthma, bronchitis, and TB; families face birth defects, skin infections, and stomach illnesses from contaminated water,"" local health worker Neha Mahant said in the report.""Coal doesn't just generate electricity -- it generates suffering.""""The age of fossil fuels has poisoned our air, broken health, and fractured dignity,"" former UN climate head Christiana Figueres said in a statement linked to the report, urging a swift transition to renewable energy.The Global Climate and Health Alliance's executive director Jeni Miller called for governments to commit to halting new oil, gas and coal projects at November's COP30 UN climate conference in Brazil.""Just as governments once curbed tobacco industry influence, they must now ban fossil fuel lobbying and disinformation,"" Miller said.The alliance also urged governments to stop subsidising fossil fuels, which added up to $7 trillion in 2022, representing more than seven percent of global GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund.Despite repeated warnings about the devastating impacts of human-caused climate change, last year the world again broke the record for most carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels.","Pollution from fossil fuels has been linked to a vast range of health problems.
