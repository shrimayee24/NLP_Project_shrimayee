‘Mahanagar stn was part of Metro plan but dropped later’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahanagar-stn-was-part-of-metro-plan-but-dropped-later/articleshow/128622676.cms,"Lucknow: Did you know that the Mahanagar area of the city was part of the Metro route in the original alignment plan, but was dropped later? A comptroller and auditor general (CAG) report tabled in the state Assembly on Friday revealed that Mahanagar Metro Station, between IT College Crossing and Badshah Nagar, was mentioned in the DPR, but didn't make it to the final list.The CAG report states that in Dec 2013, the central govt had granted pre-approval for Phase-1A of the Lucknow Metro . The DPR, an MOU between the Centre and UP govt, the finance contract with the European investment bank (EIB), and the project agreement with EIB all specified the construction of 22 stations along the 23-km corridor.According to the DPR, Mahanagar station was projected to get the third-highest passenger footfall in 2015 and the second highest by 2020. A source in the Lucknow Municipal Corporation said the area has two separate wards (Mahanagar and Vivekananda Puri) with over one lakh population.However, the audit found that the executing company -- UP Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) -- built only 21 stations, dropping Mahanagar from the alignment. No evidence was produced to show that any proposal for its exclusion was placed before the central or state govts nor any approval was obtained, the report says.The CAG noted that bypassing the sanctioned DPR violated multiple binding documents — DPR, MoU, finance contract, and the project agreement — and deprived the Mahanagar area of a key Metro facility despite projected high ridership.In Sept 2024, the state govt claimed that the change was not concealed, stating that the ministry of housing and urban affairs had notified the alignment with 21 stations after examining it against the original DPR.The CAG found state govt response unconvincing, noting that while the UPMRC informed MoHUA about other major alterations — such as changing the proposed elevated station at Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport to an underground one — it failed to disclose the removal of Mahanagar station. The audit stressed that any deviation from the approved DPR required a separate, explicit approval from the GoI along with justification, which was neither sought nor granted.Reacting to the CAG report, the UPMRC told TOI that station locations were optimised by dropping Mahanagar. It was appropriate to have both stations 'IT Chauraha' and 'Badshah Nagar' closer to Mahanagar. Usually 1km distance has been maintained between each station.","Mahanagar Metro Station, between IT College Crossing and Badshah Nagar, was mentioned in the DPR, but didn't make it to the final list.

1 in 7 stroke patients in India under 45 years: National Registry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-in-7-stroke-patients-in-india-under-45-years-national-registry/articleshow/128631939.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: One in seven stroke patients in India is younger than 45 years. Nearly two in five reach hospital more than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Three months later, more than half either die or suffer significant disability.These findings come from India’s largest hospital-based stroke registry analysis, published in ‘International Journal of Stroke’. The study was led by Prashant Mathur of ICMR–National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (ICMR-NCDIR), Bengaluru, along with investigators of the National Stroke Registry Programme.The analysis reviewed 34,792 stroke cases recorded across 30 hospitals between 2020 and 2022, providing one of the most detailed national snapshots of stroke patterns, treatment gaps and outcomes.The mean age of patients was 59.4 years, but 13.8% were under 45, underlining the growing burden of stroke among younger Indians. Nearly 63.4% were men and 72.1% came from rural areas, reflecting disparities in awareness, prevention and access to timely care.Hypertension was present in 74.5% of patients, making it the dominant risk factor. Diabetes affected 27.3%, smokeless tobacco use 28.5%, tobacco smoking 22.6% and alcohol use 20.2%.The study also noted gender differences — women had higher rates of hypertension and diabetes, while men reported greater tobacco and alcohol use.The time taken to get treatment remained the biggest hurdle, according to the analysis. Only 20% reached hospital within the crucial 4.5-hour window for emergency stroke treatment. In contrast, 37.8% reached hospital after 24 hours. As a result, just 4.6% of ischemic stroke patients received intravenous thrombolysis and 0.7% underwent mechanical thrombectomy, it said. Delayed arrival, imaging delays and non-availability of medicines were key reasons for missing treatment.Ischemic strokes accounted for 60% of cases, while intracerebral haemorrhage made up 34.2%.Dr Manjari Tripathi, head of neurology at AIIMS Delhi, said the numbers reinforced a basic message. “Patients must reach the hospital within three hours. Immediate brain imaging is essential, and, if eligible, thrombolysis should be given without delay. Time is brain — every minute lost means neurons lost, leading to disability and long-term dependence. It is vital that people recognise stroke symptoms and seek emergency care early,” she said.Outcomes remain stark as in-hospital mortality was 13.9%, but by three months, nearly 28% had died, indicating that many patients passed away after discharge. In total, more than half had a poor outcome, defined as death or significant disability. Women were more likely than men to have a disability at follow-up, suggesting possible gaps in rehabilitation and post-discharge care. Recurrent stroke within three months occurred in 1.1% of patients.The authors said stronger control of hypertension and diabetes, tobacco cessation, faster referral systems and better access to acute stroke care — particularly in rural India — were critical. Without improvements in prevention and rapid response, stroke would continue to strike early and leave families coping with avoidable disability.","One in seven stroke patients in India is younger than 45 years.

"Relying on decades-old rulings, SC acquits stepdad of 6-yr-old's murder",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/relying-on-decades-old-rulings-sc-acquits-stepdad-of-6-yr-olds-murder/articleshow/128624819.cms,"Supreme Court of India

New Delhi: A six-year-old girl went missing in 2018. She was last seen with her stepfather. When he was arrested eight days later, he led police to the place where her charred remains were found. Supreme Court found this evidence weak and acquitted him of the murder charge.Finding no other evidence to link the man to the murder except that he was the last person to be seen with the child according to a neighbour and he was the one to lead the police to the victim's bones, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and K Vinod Chandran acquitted him, saying the investigation was botched and left many questions unanswered. ""In the present case, the murder of a six-year-old girl went unpunished and her stepfather was incarcerated on mere conjecture,"" SC said.In the case from Chhattisgarh, what tilted the scales towards the stepfather, Rohit Jangde, was the peculiarity of the interpretation by SC in earlier judgments on the admissibility of a statement by an accused that leads to discovery of fact relating to the crime - in this case, the recovery of the girl's body.More than 65 years ago, SC had ruled that the statement of an accused leading to discovery of facts relating to the crime would be admissible evidence only when it had been made in custody.Justices Kumar and Chandran also relied on a similar interpretation used in a nearly 100-year-old ruling by Calcutta HC.Interestingly in the 1931 judgment, the then CJ of Calcutta HC had expressed anguish that the law permitted reliance on a statement made to police that led to discovery of fact only when the person was in police custody and had termed it absurd, but left it to the legislature to make suitable amends. Relying on these decades-old judgments, SC termed weak the telltale evidence incriminating Jangde.Justice Chandran said even if the evidence was accepted, it would not by itself nail the guilt on the stepfather. ""The knowledge of the accused, which led to the detection of the bone remnants though not acceptable under Section 27 would all the same be acceptable evidence under Section 8, which by itself is a weak piece of evidence. The evidence under Section 8 can only offer corroboration and cannot by itself result in a conviction,"" he said.Acquitting the accused, the bench said, ""The long gap when there was no complaint made about the missing child and the factum of none having questioned the accused, despite the family and police having been told that she went with the accused, tilts the scales in favour of the accused... Pertinent also is that since the corpus delicti was not recovered, there is no time of death specified. We are hence unable to uphold the conviction of the accused, and he has to be necessarily given the benefit of doubt. ""","A six-year-old girl went missing in 2018.

Mamata Banerjee vs Election Commission: Supreme Court Orders Judicial Oversight in Bengal SIR

New Delhi: The Union home ministry on Friday constituted a second empowered committee for West Bengal to fast-track the processing of citizenship requests received under Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA).CAA provides for grant of citizenship to immigra-nts from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh belonging to their six minority faiths - Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi - who entered India before Dec 31, 2014, fearing religious persecution in their home countries.In a gazette notification issued on Friday, the home ministry said West Bengal's new empowered committee - which takes the final call on citizenship applications forwarded by the district-level committee after verification of documents - shall be headed by the deputy registrar general, directorate of census operations of the state.The original empowered committee - set up in accordance with a notification issued by MHA in March 2024 and headed by director, census operations of West Bengal - will continue to be in existence. The new empowered committee, central govt sources told TOI, has been set up as the volume of applications under CAA in the state has increased. Sharing of work is expected to compress the processing time.West Bengal has a significant number of Hindu immigrants, such as those belonging to the Matua community.BJP has been making a major outreach to them to strengthen its electoral prospects in the state.The new empowered committee on CAA allows certain members of the empowered committee as notified on March 11, 2024 - like the jurisdictional foreigners regional registration officer and state informatics officer - to nominate an officer each, not below the rank of under secretary. Other members like an officer of the subsidiary intelligence bureau and postmaster general or a postal officer nominated by him remain the same.Like the original empowered committee, the new panel shall include a representative from the office of West Bengal principal secretary (home) or additional chief secretary (home) and a representative of the jurisdictional divisional railway manager as invitees.","CAA provides for grant of citizenship to immigra-nts from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: With Muhammad Yunus ’ departure from the power centre in Dhaka, steps are under way to “fully restore” all Indian visa services, India’s senior consular official in Sylhet, Aniruddha Das, has confirmed.Aniruddha Roy on Thursday assured full cooperation to strengthen India-Bangladesh relations and said efforts are being made to ease visa services.Speaking at the Sylhet District Press Club, he said medical and double-entry visas are currently being issued, and steps are under way to resume other categories, including travel visas.“Medical and double-entry visas are being issued now, and steps are under way to resume other categories, including travel visas,” BD News24 quoted him saying.He said India-Bangladesh ties are based on mutual respect and shared interests.“India-Bangladesh relations stand on the foundation of mutual respect and honour. The people of both countries will be the principal stakeholders of a stable, positive, constructive, long-term and mutually beneficial relationship,” he said.He added that both countries share cultural links and common goals, and cooperation can help create new opportunities.“We should transform our geographical and cultural proximity, growing economic capacity, and future aspirations into new opportunities through cooperation,” he said.He also said journalists can play an important role in strengthening ties between the two countries.“Through objective reporting and constructive criticism, journalists can further reinforce and strengthen this relationship,” he added.Days earlier, Bangladesh entered a new political phase after Tarique Rahman took charge as the country’s new prime minister. Following the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s landslide victory, securing a two-thirds majority, Rahman invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend his swearing-in ceremony.Prime Minister Modi congratulated Rahman on his party’s victory and later invited him to visit India after he took oath.India-Bangladesh relations had come under strain after Sheikh Hasina ’s exile in August 2024. Ties were affected during the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, particularly after India provided refuge to the former prime minister Hasina. This led to tensions between the two countries, with several reports highlighting diplomatic unease in recent months.India had also expressed concern over incidents of violence against minorities, especially the Hindu community, during the period of unrest in Bangladesh under Yunus’ interim government.","India-Bangladesh relations had come under strain after Sheikh Hasina ’s exile in August 2024.

""Hours after the US Supreme Court delivered a 6-3 verdict invalidating tariffs imposed by Trump, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said, ""Hats off to the US Supreme Court for striking down President Trump’s entire tariff strategy!

What will happen to those concessions? The joint statement announced Zero tariff on many goods that the US will export to India; that India intends to import USD 500 billion worth of goods from the U.S.;that India will not buy Russian oil; that India will address the non-tariff barriers to U.S. goods, and so on,"" the former finance minister said.""What will happen to those promises?

India AI Impact Summit 2026: DGIS Harsh Chhibber Stresses Role Of Sovereign AI In Defence

Despite differences, summit has set stage for cooperation: Indian officials

New Delhi: After a week of packed halls, high-level diplomacy and billion-dollar pitches, several national delegations at the India AI Impact Summit will issue a joint statement on how the world should handle artificial intelligence Saturday, a day later than planned, as the govt works to widen global consensus on the document.The declaration, already backed by over 70 countries, comes amid companies committing to invest more than $250 billion in the country and reinforced India's push to shape global AI agenda for the Global South. Union minister for electronics and IT Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Friday there was ""huge consensus"", with discussions continuing. ""The declaration and its contours will be shared transparently tomorrow,"" he said, adding that India hoped the final signatory count would cross 80.Countries had failed to reach a consensus at the last summit in Paris but there appears to be greater synergy on several issues, among govts and companies.Substantive disagreements also surfaced on global governance. While the UN announced formation of an independent scientific panel on AI, the US delegation warned against centralised global control of generative AI, underlining the difficulty of forging binding global rules.Despite differing views, Indian officials said the summit had laid the groundwork for collaboration rather than confrontation. ""This is about real action, not just paper,"" Vaishnaw said, pointing to bilateral discussions, industry commitments and plans for an expanded AI Mission 2.0.Ashwini Vaishnaw said the scale and diversity of participation underlined global confidence in India's approach. ""World has confidence in India's role in the new AI age. That is very important for all of us,"" he said.According to the minister, over five lakh visitors have attended the summit and the expo, with ""practically every major AI player in the world"" participating.A key highlight, Vaishnaw said, was the acceptance of PM Modi's vision of ""ManavAI"" - AI of the humans, by the humans, for the humans - which places responsible and ethical use of AI at the centre. ""For the first time, discussion on ethical and responsible AI has been brought to the forefront in such a meaningful way,"" he said.Investment commitments also featured prominently. Vaishnaw said infrastructure-related pledges linked to AI, data centres and allied technologies had already crossed $250 billion, while around $20 billion in deep-tech venture investments had been completed. ""Numbers are important, but what is more important is the trust the world has shown in India,"" he said.","India AI Impact Summit will issue a joint statement on how the world should handle artificial intelligence Saturday.

'Global South To Decide Next World Order': Stubb And Rubio Signal Shift, Echoe India's World View

New Delhi: India has emerged as a ""shining beacon"" among Global South nations on AI, but the real challenge now is moving beyond pilots to large-scale, trusted deployment, according to the 'Playbook for National AI Strategy and Implementation' released by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).Based on work across India, Egypt, Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines, the report argues there is no single lever to accelerate AI adoption. Countries instead need a tightly coordinated ecosystem spanning computing, funding, skills, governance and institutional accountability.Saibal Chakraborty, who leads BCG India's tech and digital advantage practice, said India already has a structural edge. ""India has solved a large part of the hard infrastructure and digital public infrastructure problem. Aadhaar, UPI and data centres make it much easier to build AI applications at scale,"" he said. The playbook cites the IndiaAI Mission's facilitation of over 38,000 GPUs, made available at under Rs 60 per hour after centralised govt negotiations with vendors.However, the report flags a financing gap. While India has more than 120 unicorns, private capital largely avoids ""socially sensitive sectors like climate, education and rural solutions"". To address this, the playbook backs govt-led fund-of-funds models for public interest AI use cases.On skills, Chakraborty said scaling artificial intelligence requires senior leadership trust and oversight. Without CEO-level confidence, AI risks remaining stuck in ""cool pilots"" despite strong national ambition","India has emerged as a ""shining beacon"" among Global South nations on AI.

He described ""democratic AI"" as systems that are ""open, transparent, follow the rule of law"" and function as ""a tool for an individual to scale their capabilities, to learn, think, build, create, produce."" In contrast, AI developed in ""autocratic systems"" is ""designed to enhance the central authority, the authoritarian govt,"" rather than empower individuals.Governance, he suggested, is central to the race. Citing Russian President Vladimir Putin's remark that whoever leads in AI will ""win the world,"" Lehane argued that the values embedded in AI systems will shape the global order that emerges.On oversight, he said new rules are inevitable for a general purpose technology. AI safety institutes are emerging in the US and the UK, with India exploring a similar approach.Asked whether OpenAI would support audits of its advanced systems, Lehane said the company is subject to transparency requirements under safety frameworks in US states such as California and New York and works with safety institutes in the US and UK.He drew a distinction between transparency and disclosure of proprietary information, noting concerns about protecting intellectual property. Baseline safety standards can be developed collectively, he said, but countries should retain the ability to deploy AI consistent with societal contexts.

India's talent deep enough to rival challengers: Gor

New Delhi: India formally joined Friday Pax Silica - the US flagship AI and supply chain security initiative that is widely perceived as an antidote to China's influence over critical technologies. Welcoming India, US ambassador Sergio Gor said that the coalition, which comprises some of Washington's closest allies and trusted partners as members, was about ""whether free societies would control the commanding heights of the global economy"" and would define the 21st century economic and technological order.MeitY secretary S Krishnan, US undersecretary for economic growth Jacob Helberg and Gor also signed, apart from the Pax Silica Declaration, a supplementary joint statement that said this partnership signalled a new era in which the world's oldest and largest democracies stood aligned not only in defence of liberty, but in the purposeful pursuit of prosperity and harmony for their peoples.Together, the two aspire to build an AI future that serves their citizens, strengthens their economies and societies, and refle-cts their shared values of freedom, openness, and the rule of law,"" the statement said.Gor's remarks were more revealing as he said Pax Silica was a coalition of capabilities that replaced coercive dependencies with a positive sum alliance of trusted industrial bases. ""India's entry into Pax Silica isn't just symbolic, it's strategic, it's essential.India is a nation with deep talent, deep enough to rival challengers,"" said Gor, who invited India to join the initiative that now has 11 members, on his first day in office last month.For India, Pax Silica is another significant step forward towards the normalisation of the relationship with the US after both sides finalised the framework for an interim trade agreement this month.According to Gor, India brings strength to the coalition as its engineering depth and critical mineral processing capacity offered critical capabilities to the partnership. ""Peace doesn't come from hoping adversaries will play fair. We all know they won't. Peace comes through strength. India understands this. India understands strong borders. India understands this part of the world. That strength, that sovereignty, is exactly what Pax Silica amplifies,"" said the US ambassador, adding discussions with India were on about building supply chains that would not be held hostage.The Pax Silica Declaration seeks efforts to reduce excessive dependencies and forge new connections with reliable partners and suppliers committed to fair market practices, while acknowledging the importance of addressing non-market practices that undermine innovation and fair competition.Welcoming India to ""co-found"" the future, Gor also said the initiative was about whether innovation happens in Bengaluru and Silicon Valley or in surveillance states that use technology to monitor and control their people. ""We choose freedom. We cho-ose partnership. We choose strength. And today, with India's entry into Pax Silica, we choose to win,"" said Gor.The joint statement prioritised economic security, pro-innovation regulation, stronger physical AI stack and free enterprise saying that the two sides shared the belief that a significant risk facing the free world was not advancement of AI, but the failure to lead it.Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stressed that cooperation under Pax Silica would further deepen engagement on critical technologies and supply chain resilience under the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.""Technology cooperation remains one of the central pillars of the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.

'AI Will Create More Than It Destroys': Microsoft India Chief Puneet Chandok Predicts 3-Year Rise

New Delhi: The increasing use of AI language models for information seeking and agentic commerce has put the existing internet business model under pressure, as these companies are crushing publishers, content creators, and small businesses, according to Matthew Prince, chief executive of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare.Explaining the problem, he said that for the past decade, individuals and creators - including researchers and small businesses - have sold subscriptions or shown ads to compensate for their work. But, now AI models scrape and regurgitate information, removing direct interaction between creators and users. ""Google was a great patron, but now things have changed.""For the last 10 years, for every two pages that Google scraped on the internet, they sent back one human visitor. Today, for every 30 pages, they send just one. It has become 15 times harder to get traffic from a Google search. Microsoft performs more poorly - it sends 70 to one. If we look at the pure AI companies, OpenAI takes 37,000 pages from the internet for every one visitor it sends back. In Anthropic's case, it's half a million pages,"" he said.Cloudflare handles almost 20% of internet traffic and works with all foundational model providers. ""The human eyeball traffic, which is the current currency of the internet, is going away. It is never going to return in the same way. We are getting more of our answers from AI than from original sources. And so we have to figure out a new way to compensate creators,"" he said. Prince said the world needs to figure out a new business model for the internet and develop a new rewards system beyond traffic.","Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince says AI models are crushing publishers, content creators, and small businesses.

'India Well Positioned To Lead The World In AI': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman At AI Impact Summit

New Delhi: For years, Europe watched its best AI researchers migrate to the US. India has faced the same challenge - a steady bleeding of top engineering and computer science talent to Silicon Valley. Reversing this flow is central to the global AI race, says Arthur Mensch, co-founder and CEO of French startup Mistral AI. ""Like Europe, India was bleeding talent to the US,"" Mensch said in an interview with TOI. ""The more talent you retain and create value locally, the better.""Founded in 2023 by Mensch, Guillaume Lample and Timothee Lacroix, Mistral AI was created to challenge the opaque, closed nature of ""big AI"" and make frontier models more accessible through open architectures. In just three years, the company has scaled rapidly - reaching a $400 million revenue run rate and targeting over $1 billion in revenue soon. As of last year, it was valued at $14 billion.But for Mensch, the AI race is not just commercial. It is structural - and geopolitical. With Europe heavily reliant on overseas digital infrastructure, particularly US hyperscalers, Mistral has chosen to build its own capabilities.""We don't position ourselves as a sovereign alternative. We position ourselves as a global competitor in the AI race,"" he said. ""But tactically, to have capacity you fully control, you need infrastructure - the servers that run the technology. ""About 60% of Mistral's business comes from Europe and 40% from the rest of the world. Some customers opt for its platform precisely because it can be deployed on their own infrastructure, reducing dependence on hyperscalers.Sovereign AI, he believes, is both a strategic and political necessity. As AI begins to run large parts of the global economy, govts and defence systems cannot risk external control. For businesses, over-dependence weakens negotiating leverage and continuity.India, with one of the world's largest developer pools, has a similar inflection point. ""We've brought many European researchers back to Europe. India has a unique opportunity to do the same. Universities here produce excellent AI and computer science talent. The focus should be on ensuring they innovate and build value here,"" Mensch said. Mistral is currently building commercial partnerships in India, with a local technology centre a possible next step.While rivals such as OpenAI and Anthropic explore IPO paths, Mensch said a listing is ""down the road."" Profitability and global scale would be prerequisites.Mensch argues that much of enterprise AI adoption has stumbled because companies treated GenAI as a collection of tools rather than a platform shift. Early chatbot deployments focused on small productivity gains. ""That doesn't change the bottomline,"" he said. Instead, Mistral focuses on high-ROI use cases that address major sources of business friction.At the core of its strategy is open source. ""If you have access to model parameters, you can deploy wherever you want - including local infrastructure,"" Mensch said. Open models also allow customisation. ""Running a business should not mean over-dependence on a single service provider. I've said it multiple times - Europe cannot become an AI colony of the US.""","'India Well Positioned To Lead The World In AI': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at AI Impact Summit.

'Still battling trauma'

A Pocso court in UP's Banda sentenced to death Friday a former govt junior engineer and his wife for sexually abusing 33 boys over a decade, some as young as three, and selling videos and photographs of their torture on the dark web to customers across 47 countries.Additional district judge PK Mishra said convicts Ram Bhawan (50) and Durgawati (47) inflicted such physical and psychological trauma on the survivors - some required hospitalisation for injuries to their genitals and a few developed squint eyes - that their crimes deserved to be categorised as ""rarest of rare"".""The sheer scale of this victimisation across multiple districts, combined with the extreme moral turpitude of the convicts, marks this as a crime of such an exceptional and heinous nature that it leaves no room for reformation, necessitating the ultimate judicial deterrent to meet the ends of justice,"" says the order. The court directed the UP govt to pay Rs 10 lakh in compensation to each of the 33 victims.Ram Bhawan, who worked in the UP jalkal (waterworks) department, and Durgawati would lure children by offering them access to online video games, money and gifts. They remained active in Banda and Chitrakoot from 2010 till 2020, when Interpol got CBI involved in an inquiry on child sexual abuse content on the dark web.CBI registered an FIR on Oct 31 that year after the trail led to Ram Bhawan and Durgawati.The agency had filed a chargesheet documenting their crimes on Feb 10, 2021.Special public prosecutor Kamal Singh Gautam said the case had an overwhelming amount of evidence of what the children were subjected to.""The survivors are still suffering the psychological trauma caused by the predators"", Gautam said.CBI had medical experts from AIIMS Delhi to examine 25 of the children who suffered severe injuries at the hands of the convicts. The prosecution relied on their reports, digital evidence and the testimonies of the children to build their case and seek capital punishment to those accused in the case.Additional district judge Mishra convicted the couple of offences ranging from aggravated penetrative sexual assault and using children for pornographic purposes to abetment and criminal conspiracy under relevant sections.","A Pocso court in UP's Banda sentenced to death a former govt junior engineer and his wife for sexually abusing 33 boys over a decade.

You are visiting India at

PM Narendra Modi

’s invitation for the AI summit. You have spoken in the past about the gap between States in AI and how some nations are unable to use AI for development because of inadequate infrastructure. In that context, what are your expectations from this summit and the outcome document?

What do you make of India’s focus on inclusive and human-centric AI and the fact that the AI summit is being hosted for the first time in the Global South? What is Sri Lanka’s

position on AI regulation?

Looking back, given the historical scepticism that your party had about India and the Indian government’s recent support for Sri Lanka’s economic recovery, as also assistance after Cyclone Ditwah, how has your vision for India-Sri Lanka ties evolved over the past 18 months?

Your government seems to be doing a tough balancing act, as it looks to secure investments from China while not jeopardising India’s security. As Sri Lanka looks to finalise the SOP for foreign research vessels this year, will it take into account India’s concern that vessels with dual-use military capabilities are not allowed to dock in Sri Lanka?

Negotiations for the Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement remain stalled. You have stressed economic freedom but given the growing economic ties, do you think it might be time now to conclude the agreement?

In an exclusive interview to, Sri Lankan Presidentspeaks about the significance of the AI Impact Summit, backs India’s legitimate security interests in the Indian Ocean and says Sri Lanka would like to resume ETCA talks in a progressive and transparent manner.We congratulate India for bringing this important AI Impact Summit to the Global South. This Summit is significant not only for technology, but for partnership. Sri Lanka sees this as an opportunity for India and Sri Lanka, and the wider Global South to shape AI governance together in partnership. Artificial Intelligence will define competitiveness, public service delivery and economic transformation. For developing countries like mine, access to infrastructure, research networks and human capital development is critical. This is where cooperation matters.For Sri Lanka, this Summit must be about democratizing access to AI infrastructure and turning global principles into practical partnerships for the Global South. Sri Lanka is already putting in place the foundations for AI-driven development – including a national digital public infrastructure framework, an AI governance architecture, sectoral AI committees, and an AI Champions programme to build institutional capability.We are also advancing initiatives to expand sovereign data centre and AI compute capacity, including engagement with hyperscale cloud providers and development of infrastructure to support AI-ready workloads. But for countries like ours, access to global compute ecosystems, research networks, and advanced talent development remains critical. Initiatives such as the Global AI Impact Commons and the Trusted AI Commons are important because they can help democratize AI resources and ensure that innovation is not limited to a few advanced economies The Summit’s real impact will lie in turning principles into practical partnerships, and Sri Lanka stands ready to work with India in doing so. We’re already building on such practical partnerships, for example 25 Sri Lankan tech startups are being hosted by IIT Madras for a six-week residency.India’s human-centric approach to AI aligns closely with Sri Lanka’s own reform and development priorities. Sri Lanka supports a balanced and risk-based regulatory framework that protects citizens while encouraging innovation. Sri Lanka has already enacted robust data protection legislation, strengthened its cybersecurity framework, and is establishing a structured AI governance architecture to guide responsible adoption. Rather than fragmented standards, regional collaboration between Sri Lanka and India can promote interoperability, ethical safeguards and shared learning. AI governance should enable growth, strengthen institutions and expand opportunities. That is best achieved through partnership. We see India as a natural collaborator in building trusted and inclusive AI ecosystems.The first country that I visited after being elected as President was India; and the first foreign leader that I received in Sri Lanka as President was PM Narendra Modi. In recognition of India’s support to Sri Lanka under PM Modi’s leadership including during the economic crisis, we accorded him the highest honour that Sri Lanka bestows upon foreign leaders – the Sri Lanka Mithra Vibhushana. The link between our countries and our peoples is deep, historic, and civilisational. When I visited India as President in December 2024, we adopted the India – Sri Lanka Joint Statement titled ‘Fostering Partnerships for a Shared Future’. Relations between our two countries now cover every area of contemporary relevance for our people. India’s support during Sri Lanka’s economic stabilisation was significant. So was India’s support in the context of Cyclone Ditwah. Our relationship today is about structural integration and long-term growth. India is Sri Lanka’s largest trading partner. India is a significant investor, and is also the largest source of tourism. Just a few days ago, we welcomed a large number of Indians who came to Sri Lanka to watch the T20 World Cup Cricket Match between India and Pakistan. We are exploring expanding cooperation in energy connectivity and renewables; digital systems and public infrastructure; maritime security and Indian Ocean stability and security; ports, logistics and supply chains; skills and human capital development and a range of other areas. We are open to considering all possible cooperation. A stronger Sri Lankan economy complements India’s growth trajectory. When Sri Lanka and India work together, it will strengthen regional stability and economic resilience across the Indian Ocean Region.Sri Lanka maintains an independent foreign policy. At the same time, geography dictates responsibility. We recognise India’s legitimate security interests in the Indian Ocean region. Our security is intertwined. We have signed an Agreement on Defence Cooperation between the two countries. Sri Lanka will not allow its territory to be used in ways that undermine other countries’ security. Stability in the Indian Ocean Region is a shared responsibility, and Sri Lanka will always work closely with India to uphold it.Sri Lanka believes the time is right to re-energise economic engagement with India. Global trade dynamics are shifting. India is expanding its trade architecture. Sri Lanka will explore ways to integrate into this growth environment in a mutually beneficial manner. We would like to recommence discussions on ETCA in a progressive and transparent manner. We are expanding free trade zone capacity and welcome Indian investment.Beyond trade agreements, Sri Lanka and India port partnerships offer tremendous opportunities. Sri Lanka’s ports already serve as major transshipment hubs for Indian cargo. By deepening cooperation we can: position Sri Lanka as a logistics and value-add partner to Indian manufacturing; develop joint ventures in maritime services; strengthen industrial connectivity; and integrate more closely into regional supply chains. Economic integration should create jobs in Sri Lanka, and build resilience for both economies. The direction in which we seek to proceed is clear: deeper cooperation with India, structured integration and shared growth for mutual benefit.","In an exclusive interview to, Sri Lankan Presidentspeaks about the significance of the AI Impact Summit.

However, diphtheria immunity can wane over time, making booster protection necessary. The World Health Organization recommended in 2006 that countries transition from TT to Td, a position later reaffirmed through expert reviews.India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) subsequently advised replacing TT with Td for all age groups, including pregnant women. The shift aims to sustain gains in maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination while strengthening diphtheria protection among adolescents and adults.Tetanus is a serious bacterial infection that causes painful muscle stiffness and spasms and can be fatal if untreated. Diphtheria spreads through respiratory droplets and can lead to severe complications, especially in children and those with declining immunity. The Td vaccine contains purified tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and is designed to boost protection in older age groups.The vaccine has been developed and manufactured by the Central Research Institute (CRI), which functions under the Directorate General of Health Services.

NEW DELHI: As the network of All India Institutes of Medical Sciences expands across the country, artificial intelligence in diagnostics and faster faculty recruitment must go hand in hand, Union health minister Jagat Prakash Nadda said on Friday.Addressing a leadership conclave of Presidents and Executive Directors of newly established AIIMS, Nadda urged institutes to integrate artificial intelligence into diagnostics and clinical decision-making, and to institutionalise telemedicine as a regular component of patient care.He stressed that expansion in infrastructure must be matched by strengthening human resources. Calling for accelerated faculty recruitment without compromising academic standards or quality of healthcare delivery, the Minister suggested holding at least four interview cycles annually. He also emphasised regular conduct of structured recruitment mechanisms such as NORCET and the Common Recruitment Examination (CRE) for nursing and non-faculty staff to ensure timely appointments.The emphasis on hiring comes amid significant staffing gaps. In a recent reply in Parliament, the government acknowledged that nearly one in three faculty posts across AIIMS are vacant, while over 17,000 non-faculty positions — including nurses, technicians and support staff — remain unfilled across 20 operational institutes.The vacancies have raised concerns about service delivery even as patient load rises.Nadda reiterated that patient care, teaching and research must advance in balance, anchored in a patient-centric model. He called for structured patient feedback systems, greater transparency in decision-making and closer collaboration among AIIMS institutions, many of which are at different stages of development.The Minister also directed that Jan Aushadhi Kendras and AMRIT pharmacies be made functional in every AIIMS campus to improve access to affordable medicines. He encouraged collaborative research with premier institutions in areas such as rare diseases, genetic disorders and medical technology innovation.Cautioning that increased capacity should not dilute established standards, Nadda said AIIMS must continue to set benchmarks in healthcare and medical education while preserving its institutional ethos.",Jagat Prakash Nadda urged institutes to integrate artificial intelligence into diagnostics and clinical decision-making.

What next for the Left?

As Kerala heads toward the 2026 assembly elections, a question hangs over the state’s political landscape: what does the future of the Left look like beyond Pinarayi Vijayan For nearly a decade, Vijayan has been the undisputed face of the Left Democratic Front (LDF), steering it through floods, a pandemic, fiscal strain and, in 2021, a historic re-election that broke Kerala’s four-decade pattern of alternating governments. But as the chief minister approaches 81, the conversation within party ranks and among voters has quietly shifted from governance to succession.Kerala remains the only state currently governed by the Left. That makes the 2026 election more than a routine contest; it is a referendum on the future of communist politics in India, and on whether the LDF can renew itself in time to connect with a new generation of voters.At 80, Vijayan remains the central pivot of the LDF’s campaign and governance narrative.His leadership received wide credit for the LDF’s 2021 victory, when the front secured 99 of 140 seats, the first time in four decades that an incumbent returned to power in Kerala.The government has since highlighted welfare expansion, including raising social security pensions from Rs 600 to Rs 2,000, infrastructure spending estimated at nearly Rs 2 lakh crore through budgetary and extra-budgetary resources, and a push towards a “knowledge economy”.Yet, the question is less about performance and more about continuity. “Leadership transition is a structural issue for cadre-based parties,” said a political science professor at Delhi University. “The Left’s strength has always been collective leadership, but electorally, Kerala voters increasingly respond to identifiable faces.”Sherwin, a young freelancer from Thrissur based in Delhi, believes, “If not for Vijayan, the Left possibly won’t be coming back to power.” He highlights another important reason he would rather vote for the Left: “because Congress is always fighting among itself, so I don't think that's a good option.”He adds, “It’s always the least bad option you vote for, not the best, that is the case in politics, I think, everywhere now.”Dhristi, a member of a Left student group, says, “Vijayan is not all that glossy it might look, maybe right now there is nobody to replace him, but that doesn’t make him a good choice.” She adds, “I think it’s time that more young faces are given a chance, just look at the politburo, the people sitting there just have no connection with the ground and the kind of issues youths are facing.”Unlike previous phases in Kerala politics, no widely projected younger leader is positioned as Vijayan’s natural successor. While several senior ministers and party leaders remain influential within the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the bigger partner in LDF, none currently command statewide mass appeal comparable to the chief minister.A member of the Left’s student wing says that projecting a successor prematurely could trigger factional tensions. “The party prefers continuity and collective functioning. The focus is on policies, not personalities,” he said.But electoral politics is increasingly personality-driven. The absence of a clearly visible next-generation face may complicate outreach to first-time voters, particularly in urban constituencies where three-cornered contests are sharpening, with an increasing BJP/NDA footprint.The scale of the youth electorate is becoming clearer. According to official figures cited by AIR News following the publication of draft electoral rolls for the state, over 1,21,000 applications have been received for updates and corrections. Of these, 96,785 were submitted for the inclusion of first-time voters who have turned 18 or sought constituency transfers.For the LDF, engaging Gen Z voters presents both opportunity and challenge. This demographic has grown up in a hyper-connected political environment, shaped as much by social media narratives as by traditional cadre networks.Increasingly, these first-time voters have become the most sought-after political entity that every party wants to sway on their side.Vishnu, a 22-year-old first-time voter from Alappuzha studying in Delhi, said, “Development and jobs matter more to us than ideology. We want to see opportunities in the state so we don’t have to leave Kerala.” Another student from Kozhikode noted that while welfare measures are important, “the conversation online is different, people talk about entrepreneurship, start-ups, global exposure.”The LDF has responded with a renewed focus on digital outreach, alongside its traditional house-visit programme, where leaders, from state-level figures to branch secretaries, are engaging households directly to gather feedback.But Sherwin says, “although there is a very active young group of people working for Left on ground, and they always come up with different schemes of things, but the Congress does the same as well, so I don’t see anything different that they are doing to woo the youths.”If the 2021 assembly verdict was historic for the LDF, the 2025 local government elections served as a reality check.The scale of losses was significant. LDF’s control in grama panchayats fell from 577 to 340, in block panchayats from 111 to 63, and in district panchayats from 11 to 7. In urban Kerala, the slide was steeper: municipal corporations under LDF control dropped from five to one, while municipalities declined from 43 to 29.The most symbolic blow came in Thiruvananthapuram, where the BJP captured the Corporation for the first time, winning 50 of 101 wards. For a front that had dominated the capital’s civic body since 1980, the loss carried political weight beyond numbers.However, vote share data tells a more nuanced story.Despite seat losses, the LDF polled close to 40% of the vote statewide. The UDF secured 43.21%, maintaining a lead but not a landslide margin. The BJP-led NDA’s vote share remained around 16%, marginally higher than in previous local polls, and lower than its 19.4% performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha election. The party’s gains came from concentrated seat conversion rather than dramatic vote expansion.In assembly segment terms, the UDF held leads in 81 constituencies, while the LDF led in 57. However, in 32 constituencies, the margin of defeat for the LDF was between 1,000 and 10,000 votes, indicating that micro-swings could reshape the 2026 map.There were also demographic undercurrents. With minorities constituting nearly half the state’s population, the LDF’s near-40% vote share suggests that it retained a substantial segment of minority voters as well among other sections, even as sections appeared to consolidate behind the UDF in parliamentary-style contests. The data indicates shifts, but not collapse.From the Left’s point of view, the local body verdict reflects three trends:Whether the 2025 results were a precursor to 2026 or a mid-term correction remains an open question.The DU professor argues that anti-incumbency alone does not explain the LDF’s recent setbacks. Instead, “electoral shifts reflect layered dynamics, consolidation of minority votes behind the UDF, sharper arithmetic in urban areas, and the BJP’s targeted expansion”. Adding, at the same time, it seems, after two consecutive terms, the LDF is recalibrating its political messaging amid demographic and ideological churn.That recalibration became visible to the world during the row over Jamaat-e-Islami Hind. The CPM and the BJP accused the Congress-led UDF of accepting support from the organisation.The controversy escalated when senior CPM leader A K Balan warned that a UDF government could allow Jamaat influence over the home ministry and lead to incidents like the 2002–03 Marad riots. CM Vijayan backed Balan’s remarks, though the CPM later described them as his “personal view” after criticism that the rhetoric echoed narratives usually associated with the Sangh Parivar.But, the incident was uncharacteristic of the Left, who compared to much of the country’s political landscape has avoided getting into the arena of communal/polarising rhetoric.Simultaneously, the Left moved to reinforce ties with sections of influential Muslim bodies such as Samastha, including the nomination of Ummer Faizi Mukkam to the Kerala State Waqf Board, a step widely interpreted as calibrated engagement with constituencies seen as distinct from the IUML.On the majority side, the government’s role in facilitating the Global Ayyappa Sangamam, linked to the Sabarimala temple managed by the Travancore Devaswom Board, drew attention given the Left’s earlier strong backing of the 2018 Supreme Court verdict allowing entry of women of all ages. Meanwhile, as the polls approach and Sabrimala snowballs into a larger electoral issue, the Left is increasingly taking a vague stand, with its ministers straightly refusing to give any clarity.Taken together, these episodes reflect the LDF’s attempt to navigate a more polarised landscape, balancing welfare governance with identity-sensitive politics, as it prepares for 2026.Party leaders have acknowledged the need to “learn from the people” and correct gaps in policy implementation and political communication. A statewide house-visit programme has been launched. Parallelly, the LDF has intensified its campaign against what it terms fiscal discrimination by the Centre. Issue-based mobilisation is also being sharpened, including campaigns around MGNREGA allocations and the implementation of labour codes.The deeper challenge, however, is political positioning.The Left’s historical growth in Kerala was rooted in class mobilisation cutting across caste and religion. Recent elections exposed tensions between welfare-driven governance, secular positioning, minority anxieties, and attempts at broader social outreach. A sustainable revival may require clarity in ideological messaging as much as administrative efficiency.The revival question, therefore, is less about arithmetic and more about adaptability.For the Left, 2026 is not merely about retaining power but about redefining relevance. The stakes are national: Kerala is the last state under communist governance. A defeat would mean the absence of a Left-led state government anywhere in India.The immediate strategy appears two-fold: consolidating welfare beneficiaries through grassroots engagement, and countering opposition narratives via coordinated political campaigns and social media mobilisation.But the structural question remains unresolved: can the LDF transition from a leadership model anchored in Vijayan’s authority to one that inspires confidence among younger voters?As Kerala’s electorate expands with tens of thousands of first-time voters, the 2026 contest may hinge less on legacy and more on generational trust. Whether the Left can bridge that gap, organisationally and politically, will determine if its red bastion remains intact or enters a new phase of churn.The question, for now, is simple and unavoidable: After Vijayan, who?","As Kerala heads toward the 2026 assembly elections, a question hangs over the state’s political landscape. What does the future of the Left look like beyond Pinarayi Vijayan? The absence of a clearly visible next-generation face may complicate outreach to first-time voters, particularly in urban constituencies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128605187,imgsize-1044619,width-400,resizemode-4/what-next-for-left-in-kerala.jpg"

Why this conversation matters

Justice comes with hidden costs that those already burdened by the perpetual cycle of poverty, a cycle that shackles every step each day, feel too acutely to ignore. Rights exist. Legal aid is free for them. However, they do not have the privilege of affording the costs, both literal and opportunity-related, associated with recurring court dates. Injustice in any form hits them harder. Some remain under the dark cloud of lack of awareness about their existing rights, while others fear the consequences that may follow if they assert them.Poverty not only strips away social standing, hinders growth, and erodes health, but also robs dignity, striking most brutally at the vulnerable.When poverty forces people from disadvantaged backgrounds to toil relentless hours under harsh conditions just to ensure their child sees a meal on his plate, even if not the future he dreams of but enough to keep hope alive, survival becomes the only priority.Poverty cements their feet and, at the same time, pushes them into legal vulnerability.And when such individuals are confronted with injustice of any sort, whether a wrongful accusation, workplace exploitation, eviction, domestic abuse, discrimination, or even a sudden legal summons, it takes far more than courage to access their own legal rights.To ensure that no person is denied justice merely because they cannot afford legal representation, Article 39A of the Constitution of India, introduced through the 42nd Amendment in 1976, mandates the State to provide free legal aid and ensure equal justice for all.This constitutional vision was institutionalised through the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, under which the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) was established in 1995 as the central body to implement legal aid programs across the country.The legal aid system in India is structured as a nationwide network, from the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) at the Centre, chaired by a Supreme Court judge with the Chief Justice of India as Patron-in-Chief, to State and District Legal Services Authorities, and local Taluka bodies. At the grassroots, paralegal volunteers, drawn from communities, including teachers, social workers, Anganwadi workers, law students, and marginalized groups serve as bridges between citizens and the justice system.The idea being simple yet ambitious, justice should reach the doorstep of the poor.Yet access remains low. Former Chief Justice of India, former Judge of the Supreme Court of India , and former Executive Chairman of the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA), Justice Uday Umesh Lalit, in an interview to Sansad TV, noted after reviewing nationwide data:“Statistics showed that people get legal aid in less than 1% of the cases where justice is required. If we look at how many people are below the poverty line, it is inconsistent that only 1% would need legal aid. Either they do not know it is their right, or they do not have confidence in the system.”That single statistic exposes a deep structural contradiction, a country with millions eligible for free legal assistance sees only a tiny fraction accessing it.Amid the daily struggles of poverty, many people remain unaware of their right to legal aid or free legal services.A roadside vendor narrated how police use court cases to intimidate them. When asked if he knew that legal aid is free, he expressed shock.“I had no idea that legal aid or free legal services existed. I faced a legal problem and couldn’t get the help I needed because I couldn’t afford it. That was the time I felt most helpless. I had to beg for help and money from others, not knowing if justice would ever come.For a poor person, respect is the most important thing. Even being associated with the court or the police scares us. You know what happens to poor people like us, they hardly get justice, and no one supports them, making it hard to trust the system. When we go to file a complaint, we are often intimidated, and we have to endure this. At that time, it feels like all doors are closed,” he told TOI.According to the latest World Bank data, between 2011‑12 and 2022‑23, India lifted roughly 269 million people out of extreme poverty, reducing the poverty rate from 27.1% to 5.3%. Yet around 75 million people still live in extreme poverty, leaving them vulnerable not only to deprivation in food, healthcare, and education, but also to challenges in accessing legal protections and exercising their rights effectively.People living in deprivation often face:For many, even receiving a legal notice or court summons can trigger panic rather than protection. Without awareness or guidance, such notices may be ignored, not out of defiance but confusion or fear, sometimes worsening legal consequences.Advocate Abhipriya Rai explained, “Poverty is not merely an economic condition, it is a legal disability. When a family cannot produce an Aadhaar card, a birth certificate, or a caste certificate, they become invisible to the very systems designed to protect them.”She added that legal vulnerability operates on three levels simultaneously. “they do not know their rights exist.even if they do, they lack the paperwork that activates those rights.even if they reach a forum, they cannot sustain effective advocacy. Each barrier compounds the others.”Legal vulnerability therefore becomes not a separate condition, but a direct extension of economic vulnerability.NGO workers who interact daily with marginalised families consistently observe how poverty quietly erodes agency and confidence.According to Vikash Jha, founder of Bhavishya NGO, poverty often prevents families from even believing their grievances will be heard. Lack of access to nutritious food, clean water, healthcare, and quality education weakens both physical and psychological resilience. He noted that many children from such backgrounds begin working early to support their households, further reducing their chances of awareness about rights or legal remedies.TOI also spoke to Mahendra Singh Rawat, project coordinator at Bhumi NGO, Delhi, who has worked with underprivileged children in shelter homes and slum communities for over three years. He highlighted how poverty affects every aspect of a child’s life:“It is not only financial deprivation, but also limits awareness, opportunities, confidence, and aspirations. Many parents are daily wage workers with unstable incomes. Many children drop out early, and some are pushed into begging or work to support their families”.He further noted that there is lack of awareness about rights and government schemes, absence of proper documentation in some cases, and fear of approaching authorities that further perpetuates lack of access to justice among the poor even when the legal aid framework exists.A Delhi-based cleanliness worker who wished to remain anonymous added: “Demanding better conditions is a privilege daily wage workers like me cannot afford. Even if it badly affects our health, we cannot quit. Nobody cares. I may be useful to the system, but I am not treated as a dignified part of it and I don’t feel that my voice would be heard even if raised.”India’s legal aid framework is widely regarded as one of the most comprehensive in the world. Eligibility typically includes:Services may include legal advice, representation, drafting documents, and mediation, all free of cost.Yet access gaps persist because formal entitlement does not automatically translate into practical accessibility.Although legal representation may be free, justice still carries indirect expenses:Reflecting on these hidden costs, Adv. Abhipriya observes:“A worker who cannot read the summons served to her, who has been told by police to ‘go home and settle,’ does not see the law as a resource. She sees it as a threat. That fear is rational.” On the broader framework, she notes, “India has one of the most elaborate statutory frameworks for protecting the poor in the developing world. But a right that cannot be exercised is not a right. It is a promise that was never kept.”For daily wage earners, a single missed workday can mean a missed meal. Multiple court dates can therefore translate into financial distress, discouraging people from pursuing even legitimate claims.Adv. Abhipriya noted that legal aid, when delivered effectively, has immediate, tangible impacts. The mechanism is more direct than people assume:When a woman who has been illegally terminated recovers her wages through a legal aid lawyer, she has protected her family's food security for months. Similarly, when a family obtains a stay against illegal demolition, children stay in school.She added that legal aid, when delivered well, is poverty alleviation, without a welfare scheme label attached.Between 2015 and 2025, over 1.61 crore citizens received legal aid, while over 40 crore cases were settled through National Lok Adalats, and the Legal Aid Defence Counsel System disposed of nearly 8 lakh criminal cases in three years.Government funding for NALSA for 2022‑23 was Rs. 190 crore, which was increased to Rs. 400 crore for 2023‑24, dropped to Rs. 200 crore in 2024‑25, and rose again by 25 percent to Rs. 250 crore in the Union Budget 2026‑27.Judges and legal experts have emphasised that many eligible people are unaware of free legal aid, with most assuming they cannot access assistance because it is unaffordable.Justice Nagarathna emphasized thatPanel lawyers are often junior, overloaded, and inadequately compensated. Wide disparities persist between legal aid representation and private representation. This is not a criticism of individual lawyers but a systemic design failure.Tribal families in remote areas often cannot reach District Legal Services Authorities, and the digital divide creates additional barriers for accessing online portals.Hon’ble Chief Justice Surya Kant disclosed at the Conference that by September 2025, only 16.93% of the Legal Aid and Advice budget had been utilised, while outreach expenditure had exceeded its allocation. Money meant for representation and aid delivery remained unspent, while funds for awareness were overspent, an inversion of priorities.On World Social Justice Day, observed annually on February 20 by the United Nations, the global spotlight turns to poverty, inequality, exclusion, and human rights. For India, it underscores the urgent challenge of bridging the gap between legal rights and actual access to justice.As harsh as it may sound, society often reserves dignity for those who are affluent and demands subservience from those who struggle simply to survive, educate, and aspire. Poverty does not only deprive, it silences. Understanding how poverty intersects with legal vulnerability is essential not merely for policy reform, but for safeguarding democracy itself.Because access to justice is not just another welfare benefit, it is the foundation that determines whether rights exist only on paper or in reality.","The Constitution of India mandates the State to provide free legal aid and ensure equal justice for all.

The court has also clearly stated that it is written in the Constitution of India that one can build a mosque; it is a right,” he said.On January 2, Kabir informed about the construction of a hospital and a university, along with the Babri Masjid. “A Babri Masjid will be built here, a hospital will be built, a university will be built, and facilities will be created for the benefit of the people,” Kabir said at an event in Murshidabad.",The plea said that any mosque in the name of Babur or Babri Masjid must not be constructed in any place in India on the ground that Mughal ruler Babar was an anti-Hindu invader.

""It will act as a to-do list for establishments to ensure that no evasion on compliances happens for lack of clarity due to transition from the old labour laws to the new labour codes,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.The four labour codes came into force on November 21, 2025, replacing 29 central labour laws with a unified structure.Under the new system, employers must complete seven foundational compliances from the time a business is set up or a new worker joins. Beyond this, establishments are also required to meet four monthly and five annual compliance obligations. The framework further specifies six event-related compliances that become applicable in situations such as workplace accidents, disease outbreaks, employee exits, maternity benefit cases, large-scale layoffs, and lockouts or strikes within factory premises.Officials indicated that the ministry is in the final phase of finalising central rules under the four codes. The government’s intent is to ensure employers begin complying with statutory requirements early, thereby reducing the scope for litigation later.Among the basic obligations are registering the establishment and securing required licences, maintaining key records on attendance, wages, deductions and overtime, fixing wage periods, ensuring minimum workplace safety standards, enrolling eligible workers for social security, and forming work committees along with grievance redressal bodies.Every month, employers must ensure timely wage payments, deposit social security contributions with the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation and the Employees' State Insurance Corporation, and provide wage slips to workers.On an annual basis, establishments are required to file a unified return, revise minimum wages where applicable, renew licences, carry out safety audits, and conduct annual health check-ups for specified employees aged 40 years and above.In event-based scenarios, employers must report workplace accidents or disease occurrences within 24 to 72 hours, clear final dues within two days and gratuity within 30 days, obtain government approval for layoffs, retrenchment or closure in units employing more than 300 workers, extend maternity benefits where applicable, and issue lockout notices to workers and the relevant authority.","The four labour codes came into force on November 21, 2025, replacing 29 central labour laws with a unified structure.

Senior staff are calling the tools ""broken slop generators""

CEO Julie Sweet had already warned: Adapt to AI or leave

Accenture has started tying promotion eligibility to AI tool usage, telling senior managers and associate directors that advancing to leadership roles will require demonstrating ""regular adoption"" of its artificial intelligence platforms. The move follows CEO Julie Sweet's earlier warning that employees unable to adapt to AI would be ""exited"" from the company — and it appears HR is now putting that stance into formal practice. The consulting giant has also begun tracking individual weekly logins to its AI tools for some senior staff, making it one of the more aggressive internal AI mandates seen at a major professional services firm.According to an internal email seen by the Financial Times, ""use of our key tools will be a visible input to talent discussions."" The policy is set to factor into the company's summer promotion decisions, with Accenture's AI Refinery among the tools being monitored.The reaction internally has been less than enthusiastic. Two people familiar with the changes told the FT they considered some of the tools to be ""broken slop generators,"" and one said they would ""quit immediately"" if the rule directly affected them. Staff in 12 European countries and those working on US federal government contracts are exempt from the new policy.The pushback isn't entirely surprising. Executives at three Big Four firms independently told the FT that getting senior managers and partners to adopt AI has proven far harder than with junior staff. Older, more senior professionals tend to be less comfortable with new technology and more attached to how they've always worked.Sweet has made the company's position clear. She previously told investors that Accenture would ""exit"" employees for whom reskilling on AI wasn't a viable path—and the latest promotion criteria appear to be the formal follow-through on that stance.The firm says it has trained 550,000 of its roughly 780,000 employees in generative AI and spends around $1 billion annually on learning and development. It also recently announced partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic.Still, the urgency makes sense given the context. Accenture's share price has dropped roughly 42% over the past year, and the company is betting heavily that its AI-first repositioning—including rebranding its workforce as ""reinventors""—will reverse that slide.","Accenture is tying senior staff promotions to AI tool usage.

Mark Zuckerberg: Product managers at Meta are rebranding themselves after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the earnings call that AI will…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/product-managers-at-meta-are-rebranding-themselves-after-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-said-in-the-earnings-call-that-ai-will/articleshow/128591878.cms,"Meta employees are embracing the title ""AI Builder,"" reflecting a significant shift in how products are developed. This change, highlighted by a product manager's new focus on AI-driven creation, aligns with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision of AI dramatically altering work. Companies like LinkedIn are also redefining roles, empowering individuals to code, design, and manage products with AI assistance.

Zuckerberg set the tone on the earnings call

LinkedIn, Google are making similar moves

Something is shifting at Meta, and it's not just the org chart. Some product managers at the company have started calling themselves ""AI builders""—a quiet but telling sign of how AI coding tools are beginning to blur the lines between who plans products and who actually builds them. It's a small label change, but it points to something bigger: the traditional PM role, long defined by roadmaps and stakeholder meetings, is quietly being rebuilt from scratch.Jeremie Guedj, a Meta product manager with over a decade of experience, announced the change on LinkedIn last week. ""I still can't believe I'm writing this: as of today, my full-time job at Meta is AI Builder,"" he wrote. His official title in Meta's internal systems hasn't changed, but his day-to-day work is now entirely focused on building with AI on what he calls an ""AI-native team."" At least three other Meta employees—a mix of product managers and engineers—also use the term in their LinkedIn bios, as first reported by Business Insider.The shift tracks with what Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the company's Q4 2025 earnings call in January. ""We're elevating individual contributors and flattening teams,"" he said, adding that ""projects that used to require big teams"" are now being pulled off by a single person armed with the right AI tools.He called 2026 ""the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work"" inside Meta.Guedj's new role looks a lot like what that vision looks like in practice—a team where ""humans and AI agents work together, synchronously and asynchronously,"" as he put it.Meta isn't alone here. LinkedIn recently scrapped its associate product manager program and replaced it with an ""associate product builder"" track, explicitly pushing new hires to code, design, and manage products all at once. At Google, at least one product manager told Business Insider that they've been encouraging designers and PMs on their team to ""blur roles a bit.""""AI builder"" isn't an official Meta designation—yet. But as Guedj put it: ""Building has always been my passion. AI gave me the ability to turn ideas into real, working apps. That changed everything.""","Product managers at Meta are calling themselves ""AI builders"" It's a small label change, but it points to something bigger.

US stocks today: Markets jump after Supreme Court strikes down Trump tariffs; investors weigh weak data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-stocks-today-markets-hold-steady-after-supreme-court-strikes-down-trump-tariffs-investors-weigh-weak-data/articleshow/128614720.cms,"US stocks traded with modest gains in tentative trading on Friday after the Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump ’s sweeping tariffs, a move that had previously contributed to market volatility, AP reported.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 128 points, or 0.3 per cent. The S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.5 per cent, supported by a 2 per cent rise in Alphabet shares. Friday’s move puts the Dow on course for a modest 0.1 per cent gain for the period. The S&P 500 is tracking a weekly rise of 0.7 per cent, and the Nasdaq looks set to halt its five-week slide with gains exceeding 1 per cent.Earlier in the session, markets had drifted as investors reacted calmly to economic data that underscored the challenges facing the Federal Reserve but did little to alter expectations for interest-rate policy.The S&P 500 later held a 0.1 per cent gain after swinging between gains and losses. The Dow slipped 19 points, or less than 0.1 per cent, as of 9:59 am Eastern time, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.2 per cent.Treasury yields also showed limited movement following the reports, which highlighted the difficult balancing act confronting the Fed as it navigates slowing economic growth alongside persistent inflation.One report showed the US economy expanded at a 1.4 per cent annual rate toward the end of 2025, down from a 4.4 per cent surge during the summer and “a bummer of a number,” according to Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management.A separate report indicated that the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge accelerated to 2.9 per cent in December from 2.8 per cent in November. An underlying measure, seen by economists as a better predictor of inflation trends, rose to 3 per cent from 2.8 per cent.The Fed faces a difficult policy choice because it lacks tools to simultaneously address slowing growth and elevated inflation. It could lower interest rates to support the economy — as it did last year and as President Donald Trump has been urging — but doing so risks worsening inflation.Fed officials said at their most recent meeting that they want to see inflation decline further before supporting additional rate cuts.Following the data releases, traders continued to expect at least two rate cuts by the end of the year, according to CME Group data, though some shifted expectations for when easing could begin to slightly later in the summer.The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.07 per cent from 4.08 per cent late Thursday, while the two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed policy, held steady at 3.47 per cent.Among individual stocks, Akamai Technologies fell about 10 per cent, one of the market’s sharpest declines, despite reporting stronger-than-expected results for late 2025, as its profit forecast for the upcoming year disappointed investors.The company said it plans to spend a larger share of revenue on equipment and investments, highlighting rising computer memory costs linked to shortages created by the artificial intelligence boom.Comfort Systems was among the gainers, rising 5.4 per cent after reporting stronger quarterly profits than analysts expected. Chief executive Brian Lane said the company is seeing “unprecedented demand.”In overseas markets, European indexes posted modest gains following a mixed session in Asia. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.1 per cent after reopening following Lunar New Year holidays, while South Korea’s Kospi jumped 2.3 per cent to a record high, led by defence contractors such as Hanwha Aerospace amid increased global military spending.","The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 128 points, or 0.3 per cent.

BENGALURU: A 25-year-old woman landed in deep trouble after taking an emergency loan from an online lending app. Fraudsters allegedly morphed her photos in obscene ways, shared them with her family and friends and threatened to make them viral on social media despite her clearing the loan amount. The accused extorted over Rs 1.1 lakh from her and are still demanding more.Ishita (name changed), a resident of New Thippasandra, told police she needed around Rs 10,000 for an emergency. Instead of asking someone, she decided to take a loan from an online app. She searched online, found a link for Loan Mitra app, downloaded it and entered her banking and personal details on Jan 27.The app approved only Rs 4,500 and disbursed Rs 2,700 to her bank account after deducting charges, including interest, and give her a deadline of seven days for repayment. She claimed she repaid Rs 4,500 before the due date. However, the app again disbursed the same amount to her account without her consent and began demanding repayment, Ishita told police.When she explained that she did not apply for the loan a second time and said she would repay the credited amount, the miscreants began threatening and harassing her through multiple phone calls, she said.They morphed her photos and threatened to share them with her contacts.Fearing the embarrassment, she started paying amounts demanded by the fraudsters. By Feb 12, she paid over Rs 1.1 lakh through digital payment apps to 16 UPI IDs provided by the accused.When Ishita ran out of money, she borrowed from family and friends to repay them. After she informed the fraudsters that she no longer had money, they continued calling and sending abusive messages. She switched off her phone in an attempt to avoid them.The fraudsters then created a WhatsApp group, adding her family members and friends from her contact list, and shared the morphed photos and videos. They also called her contacts and asked them to tell Ishita to repay the loan.A senior police officer said after the app was downloaded, it sought permission to access her contacts, photos and videos, which she had to approve to obtain the loan. The fraudsters then accessed her contact list and images and trapped her by offering quick loans without documentation.A case was registered against the fraudsters under Information Technology Act and BNS Section 318 (cheating). The woman provided 13 mobile numbers from which she received harassment calls.","Ishita (name changed) told police she needed around Rs 10,000 for an emergency.

ULHASNAGAR: The first general body meeting after the newly elected civic body assumed office turned stormy on Friday, with corporators across party lines opposing the administration’s proposal to double, and in some cases triple, the annual water tax. After a heated debate, the House unanimously approved a marginal increase while rejecting the steep hike.Municipal Commissioner Manisha Awhale had tabled a proposal recommending a substantial revision of water tax rates. The administration suggested raising the annual levy for RCC houses from Rs 3,600 to Rs 8,000, for sheet-roofed houses from Rs 1,800 to Rs 6,500, and for slum and hutment dwellings from Rs 1,200 to Rs 3,000.Officials also proposed higher charges for property reconstruction, increased built-up area, and other civic services, estimating an additional Rs 90.83 crore in annual revenue.The proposal drew sharp criticism, with corporators citing persistent complaints about contaminated and irregular water supply, leakages, and poor responsiveness by the water supply department.Newly elected members, including BJP corporators Sherry Lund and Kanchan Lund, Congress’ Anjali Salve, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi’s Vikas Kharat, and Savita Torane and Mayur Mayekar, described the water situation in their wards as “serious”.They urged the administration to ensure a clean and regular supply before imposing higher charges. “Provide safe drinking water first, then consider a hike,” several corporators said.Shinde Sena corporator Rajendra Singh Bhullar questioned the rise in MIDC’s water bill arrears, asking whether monthly payments had been made. His queries put the administration on the defensive, with Executive Engineer Ashok Ghule and Additional Commissioner Kishor Gavas facing scrutiny alongside the municipal commissioner.Adding to the disruptions, BJP corporator Sanjay Singh raised procedural objections, alleging that the meeting was “invalid” as elections to posts such as nominated corporators and committee chairpersons were yet to be held.In a bid to break the deadlock, Shiv Sena group leader Arun Ashan proposed a compromise. The House unanimously approved revised annual water tax rates of Rs 4,400 for RCC houses, Rs 2,400 for sheet-roofed houses, and Rs 1,500 for slum and hutment dwellings.The administration’s proposal for a steep hike was voted down, with corporators insisting that improvements in service delivery must precede any major increase in civic charges.","First general body meeting after newly elected civic body assumed office turned stormy on Friday.

KOLKATA: Nissan Motor India (NMI) plans to ride an expanded portfolio of four cars by March 2027 to register a four-fold increase in domestic sales and 40% jump in exports a year later.Speaking to TOI during the unveil of seven-seater MPV Gravite in Kolkata, NMI national strategy officer and sales head Mudit Gupta said the company that had registered consolidated sales of 99,000 units in the domestic and international markets with its sole product, B-segment compact SUV Magnite, hoped to double the sales by March 2028. Incidentally, the consolidated sales (domestic sales of 28,097 units and exports of 71,230 units) registered in 2024-25 was its highest in seven years. In 2025-26, it is on course to register similar figures. Till Jan 2026, it had registered domestic sales of 17,662 units and exports of 69,769 units.""The next 12-13 months will be crucial for the company as we add three products — the Gravite whose deliveries will begin next month; the C-segment five-seater SUV Tekton that will be launched in just over a couple of months with deliveries slated from July and the launch of a C-segment seven-seater SUV in the first quarter of 2027.This will expand our presence from the Rs 6-12 lakh segment at present to over Rs 20 lakh. To increase our reach in the market, we are planning to increase our presence from 150 touchpoints at present to 250 touchpoints by next March,"" said Gupta.NMI hopes to register sales of 1 lakh units each in the domestic and export markets. The company currently exports Magnite and C-segment sedan Sunny to 65 countries. The Sunny is manufactured exclusively for exports.A company spokesperson said both the Tekton and its seven-seater iteration would be exported globally under Nissan's ‘One Car, One World’ philosophy.The new portfolio will also enable Nissan to be on par with alliance partner Renault. While the Nissan Magnite is based on the same vehicle as the Renault Kiger, the newly introduced Nissan Gravite is based on Renault Triber. The Nissan Tekton will be based on the recently unveiled Renault Duster while the seven seater vehicles will also be based on the same vehicles.",Nissan hopes to register sales of 1 lakh units each in the domestic and export markets.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold talks with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in New Delhi on Saturday, with a focus on strengthening cooperation in critical minerals, boosting trade ties, and advancing strategic supply chain partnerships.The visit comes amid India’s push to reduce dependence on China, which dominates global rare earth production, while expanding partnerships with resource-rich nations. Lula, who is leading a delegation of ministers and business leaders, is also expected to explore avenues for deeper economic and industrial collaboration between the two emerging economies.A key outcome expected from the PM Modi-Lula meeting is the signing of a memorandum of understanding on critical minerals, aimed at securing long-term supply chains and strengthening resource cooperation. Officials said discussions will also focus on increasing bilateral trade, which crossed $15 billion in 2025, with both countries targeting $20 billion by 2030.The talks will include efforts to expand cooperation in strategic sectors such as clean energy, mining, aviation, and manufacturing. Recent developments include a partnership between Brazilian aerospace firm Embraer and Adani Group to manufacture aircraft in India, signalling growing industrial collaboration.The leaders are also expected to exchange views on global economic challenges and multilateral trade tensions following tariff measures imposed by the United States in 2025. India has simultaneously strengthened supply chain partnerships with the France, the European Union, and others, while also prioritising Global South partnerships to secure mineral access and shape emerging trade frameworks, according to experts at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water.Brazil remains India’s largest trading partner in Latin America, exporting crude oil, sugar, iron ore, and agricultural commodities. Lula’s visit also includes participation in global technology discussions, and he is scheduled to travel onward to South Korea for talks with President Lee Jae Myung and business leaders.The meeting comes as India seeks to diversify sourcing of rare earth elements, essential for electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, electronics, and defence, from countries such as Brazil, which holds the world’s second-largest reserves.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold talks with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in New Delhi on Saturday.
