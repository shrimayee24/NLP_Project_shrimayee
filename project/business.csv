NEP push ignites DMK-BJP row as Congress watches from sidelines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nep-push-ignites-dmk-bjp-row-as-congress-watches-from-sidelines/articleshow/118657136.cms,"DMK workers protest last week against Hindi ‘imposition’ (PTI photo)

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu’s protest over the withholding of central funds for schemes under Right to Education and Modi govt’s linking of these funds to implementation of the NEP by states, has reignited the “language war”. It’s a full-blown showdown between BJP and DMK for now, but there’s growing anxiety about whether it could force other players to take sides, adding to the already volatile political mix.When CM M K Stalin wrote to PM Modi, demanding release of Rs 2,512 crore for RTE schemes, Centre pointed to TN’s non-implementation of NEP. Stalin shot back, declaring he would not agree to the “imposition of Hindi” even for many more crores. Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan reacted, telling Stalin: “NEP 2020 upholds the principle of linguistic freedom and ensures students continue to learn in the language of their choice.”The north-south dimension of the issue is pronounced. Southern states like Karnataka and Kerala, and even others, take pride in their local languages and are receptive to suggestions that the north is imposing itself further — this, after having cornered political power post-Independence. Stalin’s remarks reflect DMK’s long-standing commitment to a two-language policy — Tamil and English — rooted in the state’s Dravidian ethos and its historical resistance to Hindi dating back to the anti-Hindi agitations of the 1930s and 1960s.The lure of language as a political weapon is evident. Since TN upped the ante, Punjab in the north and Telangana in the south have announced that Punjabi and Telugu, respectively, would be compulsory main languages in schools.The political edge to this spat has left the protagonists wary. While BJP is enthusiastic about Hindi, it also realises it cannot endear itself to the local population in the south by reinforcing its image as the party of north India. It is a key player in the bipolar politics of Karnataka, increasingly strong in Telangana, and is making an eager push in TN, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh by hoping to win over allies.The tightrope walk for BJP was evident when its TN chief K Annamalai alleged DMK was “deliberately misconstruing the NEP for political gains”. It has stressed in the southern states that the DMK’s allegation of Hindi imposition is without a basis as the three-language, which was first rolled out under Congress govts, focuses on the promotion of all Indian languages, rather than a specific one.Congress, meanwhile, has chosen to watch the battle from the sidelines. Party functionaries privately argue there is merit in DMK’s allegations, pointing to how acronyms of central schemes — and even the three new IPC-CrPC laws (Bharatiya Nyaya Samhita) — are chaste Hindi, without English equivalents. They call this new trend insensitive to southern sentiments, warning that it risks rekindling fears of “cultural imperialism”. They believe the row, if protracted, could also touch a raw nerve in the north-eastern states.However, the principal opposition party is mindful that it is a north Indian party and cannot take a position where it is perceived as “anti-Hindi”. This is why AICC has adopted anuanced stance on the language issue. Many point to the historical handicap that national parties like Congress, which must cater to all regions, are saddled with — unlike regional parties, which can pander to very local sentiments.This paradox was m ost evident in the 1990s when Samajwadi Party mascot Mulayam Singh Yadav crossed swords with late DMK neta M K Karunanidhi over the language issue, despite being allies at the Centre. The alliance along “secular vs communal” lines persists even today, though SP has since moderated its Hindi impulses by not joining the issue in recent years.Despite lingering concerns, Congress sources claimed the risk of a blowback is minimal, as language has not been a significant issue in the north for many years. They believe political planks in upcoming elections — like Bihar and Kerala — will revolve around caste census, social justice and anti-incumbency, rather than language.BJP will not make Congress’s tactical silence a big issue because it does not want its southern push to be hurt. But at the grassroots level, it will highlight Congress’s refusal to distance itself from Stalin in the same way it talked up DMK’s anti-Sanatan stand and Congress’s disinclination to disengage itself from it.","Tamil Nadu’s protest over the withholding of central funds for schemes under Right to Education has reignited the ‘language war’ The north-south dimension of the issue is pronounced.

"Viksit Bharat goal realisable, per capita income needs to grow, says Panagariya",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/viksit-bharat-goal-realisable-per-capita-income-needs-to-grow-says-panagariya/articleshow/118654865.cms,"Arvind Panagariya (File photo)

NEW DELHI: India's aim to emerge as a developed country by 2047 is a "" realisable ambition"", said Arvind Panagariya , chairman of the 16th Finance Commission , while also stressing that the country's per capita income would need to grow at 7.3% in dollar terms to achieve the threshold of $14,000 over the next 24 years.""Certainly if we do the right things in the years to come, our prospects of getting to the Viksit Bharat ambition of the PM is very much realisable dream and realisable ambition,"" he said on Saturday in his address at the 49th Civil Accounts Day.He said the country's per-capita income, in 2023-24 dollar terms, is about $ 2,570, which is very low compared to countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, China, United States and other European nations. ""What that means is that India has the advantage that it is feasible even with existing technology, reasonable capital accumulation and skill acquisition to push the per capita income. India because of its current low per capita income has an enormous room for catch up and that catch up gives it the opportunity to grow significantly faster,"" said Panagariya.The Columbia University professor said India has gone on to gradually improve its governance system and a lot of economic reforms that had to be done have been done. He said more reforms need to be done and those will happen and this will enable India to sustain high growth rates.""Today, our per capita income in dollars is about $ 2,500. To get to $ 14,000 in 24 years or by 2047-48, what growth rate do I need for per capita income?.. my per capita income from 2023-24 onward has to grow annually at 7.3%,"" he said, adding that the $14,000 was the threshold set by the World Bank for defining developed countries.Panagariya, who has served as the first chairman of govt think tank Niti Aayog, cited United Nations data which has estimated that population in the country would grow 0.6% by 2050. He said that this would mean that to achieve a 7.3% growth in per capita income, India's GDP will have to grow at 7.9% during the next 24 years.""Our growth rate (in real dollar terms) for the last 21 years was at 7.8%... To get from 7.8% (GDP growth) to 7.9% is entirely feasible. Our prospect of Viksit Bharat is a realisable ambition,"" he said.","India's per capita income would need to grow at 7.3% in dollar terms to achieve the threshold of $14,000 over the next 24 years.

Railways to get most powerful engine for cargo movement in next one month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/railways-to-get-most-powerful-engine-for-cargo-movement-in-next-one-month/articleshow/118654716.cms,"Railways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw with labourers working on a bullet train project

DAHOD (GUJARAT): In the next one month, India will get the country's most powerful and modern rail engine with 9,000 horsepower (HP) that can pull freight trains with a load of 4,500-5,000 tonnes and at top speed of 100 kmph.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, while reviewing the progress of the electric locomotive production at Dahod Workshop on Saturday, said 89% of the engine that is ready for the launch has the Made in India component. This is the first loco factory in Gujarat.“I throw a challenge to engineers and technical professionals to achieve 100% Make in India engines. There is a huge potential for export of these engines. The first loco will be ready for launch in 30-40 days,” Vaishnaw said at the factory.Increasing the speed of freight trains remains a major concern for the railways. To increase average speed of freight trains and faster clearance of tracks to operate more trains, railways needs to deploy more high HP and high-speed locomotives.In 2020, railways had manufactured 12,000 HP electric locomotives at Electric Locomotive Factory in Madhepura (Bihar). But this model has two engines compared to the ones being manufactured at Dahod that have single engines.“So, the new one that will be rolled out will be the most powerful engine of railways in India. Now, the introduction of these 9,000 HP engines will help to bring revolution in freight operations. The locomotives, being manufactured at Dahod will be compatible with digital tracking system, Kavach, green features with 3-phase propulsion system,” a railway official said.Railway ministry said the Dahod workshop will manufacture broad gauge electric locomotives for Indian Railways and standard gauge electric locomotives for the export market.Earlier in the day, Vaishnaw reviewed the progress of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai Bullet Train project, including the upcoming station at Anand and inspected a steel bridge comprising two spans across NH-48. Each span weighs 1,500 tonnes and has been fabricated at a workshop near Hapur in Uttar Pradesh.The jointing of steel members using specialised bolts that has been designed for a 100-year lifespan.The minister also reviewed the progress of the Ahmedabad station redevelopment project.","Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said 89% of the engine that is ready for the launch has the Made in India component.

AI Express starts flights from Hindon Airport,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-express-starts-flights-from-hindon-airport/articleshow/118650224.cms,"NEW DELHI: Residents of Ghaziabad and nearby places now have the option of flying direct to many parts of India from Hindon Airport . Air India Express on Saturday operated it first Kolkata-Hindon-Goa flight, making its 180-seater Boeing 737 MAX the biggest passenger aircraft to operate from this defence enclave. While inaugurating the service, Union aviation minister K Rammohan Naidu said, “One day, I hope to see Hindon to London flights .” The direct connectivity from western UP’s Hindon comes months before the upcoming Noida International Airport at Greater Noida’s Jewar becomes operational later this summer.AI Express , which became the first big airline to operate from both the IGI Airport and Hindon, will start operating 40 weekly direct flights from Hindon to Bengaluru, Chennai, Goa, Jammu and Kolkata by March 22, 2025. For a few days this month starting March 10, the airline will also operate a thrice weekly Hindon-Mumbai flight. The airline sees the entire north/east Delhi NCR, western UP’s Ghaziabad, Meerut and Noida as key catchment areas.Minister Naidu said: “With the addition of Hindon to its growing network, Air India Express is not only strengthening connectivity but also offering greater flexibility across the NCR. The launch of services from Hindon will complement existing operations at IGI Airport, reflecting Govt’s vision of expanding aviation infrastructure to meet the growing demand for air travel.”Commercial operations from Hindon Bega just before Covid in October 2019 when a now defunct airline connected the airport to Pithoragarh. While smaller regional airlines have not been very successful so far in India, Hindon got stable operations when Star Air, the aviation arm of Sanjay Ghodawat group, started operating here. Star Air currently connects Hindon to Adampur, Nanded, Kishangarh, Pune and Bengaluru with its 76-seater Embraer E175 aircraft. AI Express’ 180-seater B737 is the biggest commercial airliner to operate so far from this defence enclave.“Commercial operations to and from Hindon as of now happen from sunrise to sunset. The airport can handle one flight in an hour so the six flights AI Express will have from later this month have been staggered,” said sources.Aloke Singh, AI Express MD, said, “The launch of our operations from Hindon marks another milestone in our network expansion journey. Hindon serves a vast catchment area covering Eastern and Northern geography of the Delhi NCR, besides Ghaziabad and western parts of UP. As the Indian air market grows and matures, metropolitan regions can be served by multiple airports as we see in cities like London, New York and Tokyo. The services from Hindon will complement our extensive operations from Indira Gandhi International Airport, from where we serve 18 domestic and four international destinations. As our fleet crosses the 100 aircraft mark, we continue our journey of expansion and remain dedicated to offering a seamless and affordable flying experience across India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.""","Air India Express on Saturday operated it first Kolkata-Hindon-Goa flight.

Sidney Crosby trade talk: Brian Hayes suggests summer move over deadline deal

Could Crosby have a change of heart before the trade deadline?

Speculation is growing about Sidney Crosby possibly leaving the Penguins to join the Avalanche and reunite with Nathan MacKinnon . TSN analysts Carlo Colaiacovo and Bryan Hayes fueled the discussion after Crosby played alongside MacKinnon at the 4 Nations Face-Off.During a TSN Hockey segment, analyst Carlo Colaiacovo asked insider Bryan Hayes whether Sidney Crosby might reconsider his future with the Pittsburgh Penguins after playing alongside Nathan MacKinnon at the 4 Nations Face-Off.Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon, both former No. 1 picks from Nova Scotia, share a close bond and have showcased strong on-ice chemistry. While Crosby has been a lifelong Penguin, speculation grows about whether he might one day reunite with MacKinnon in the NHL.""I'm, I'm not sure it happens before the trade deadline,"" Hayes said on TSN's OverDrive. ""It feels like an off season move, or sit right like now, if he's gonna eventually conclude.""Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon, both from Nova Scotia, have a well-known friendship, and their on-ice chemistry has often led to speculation about a potential team-up in the NHL.Nathan MacKinnon recently secured his long-term future with the Avalanche by signing an eight-year, $100.8 million contract, making him one of the highest-paid players in the league. With a strong core that includes defenseman Cale Makar, the Avalanche are considered top Stanley Cup contenders, and adding Crosby would only increase their chances of success.Talking about winning with Nathan MacKinnon in the 4 Nations Face-Off, Hayes mentioned that if Crosby contemplates a trade, he would prefer it to be handled discreetly and swiftly.""That's the thing. And... if you're gonna get to that conclusion, do it as quickly as you can,"" Hayes said. ""Yes, like, if it's in the back of your mind that you kind of realize, all right, I don't think I can finish this dance. It's gonna get worse before it gets better. And that's likely what's gonna happen in Pittsburgh.""Also Read: NHL Score: Nathan MacKinnon led the Avalanche past Devils in a 5-1 win with two goals While the thought of Sidney Crosby teaming up with MacKinnon in Colorado is exciting, his deep commitment to the Penguins makes a trade seem unlikely.

Nvidia: How almost $600 billion wipe out in Nvidia market value has been proved Wrong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-almost-600-billion-wipe-out-in-nvidia-market-value-has-been-proved-wrong/articleshow/118604904.cms,"Nvidia's meteoric rise



Remember Mayhem Monday in January 2025, when the biggest AI success story $595 billion vanished from Nvidia’s market value wealth in just minutes. The almost $600 billion wipeout in Nvidia's wealth happened on the day frenzy over DeepSeek sent shockwaves in US and European stock markets. Other than Nvidia, other technology stocks including Google, Apple and Microsoft too lost billions. The launch and popularity of low-cost AI models from China's DeepSeek rattled the technology industry. However, no company was as badly hit as Nvidia.Now it seems that the Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang correctly said that the market hugely over reacted. For, Nvidia has reported a record-breaking fourth quarter for fiscal year 2025, with revenue reaching $39.3 billion, a 78% increase from the same period last year, and net income rising 80% to $22.1 billion. The company's data center revenue nearly doubled, contributing significantly to these results.At the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the ""extraordinary"" demand for Nvidia's latest Blackwell AI chips, which generated $11 billion in revenue this quarter. Despite concerns last month over Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's advancements, Huang emphasized that reasoning models like DeepSeek's R1 require substantially more computing power, potentially up to 100 times more, underscoring the continued demand for Nvidia's high-performance chips.Looking ahead, Nvidia projects first-quarter revenue of approximately $43 billion, indicating sustained growth in the AI chip market. “We will grow strongly in 2025,” CEO Huang asserted at the earnings call.Over the last two years, Nvidia, the poster child of the AI boom, has grown into the second-largest company on Wall Street. While Magnificent Seven stocks added roughly $11 trillion in market capitalization between the debut of ChatGPT in November 2022 and their combined peak in mid-December 2024, with Nvidia adding $2.7 trillion in market value, making it the world's second-most valuable company at $3.2 trillion. Nvidia's stock has surged around 1,800% in the last five years. Magnificent Seven stocks on average more than tripled in that time, while the benchmark S&P 500 has gained about 65%.","$595 billion vanished from Nvidia’s market value wealth in just minutes.

Jimmy Butler is in some hot waters with his Miami stay



Jimmy Butler is making good play as the newest member of the Golden State Warriors



Jimmy Butler might be having a pretty good time after joining the Golden State Warriors , but his professional life is not reflecting on the personal front. Butler is being sued by a South Florida company over a luxury home that he had leased during his tenure with the Miami Heat . Allegedly, there was property damage, as well as multiple other issues, leading to the athlete getting sued for $257,282 in total.Jimmy Butler is being sued by a company named Five Star Marketing and Promotions , according to a lawsuit filed on Feb 26. According to the lawsuit, Butler is being sued for staying in a home for an extra two months. His lease expired in August of 2024, which he signed in August 2022. As per the lease agreement, if the ex-Heat star stayed past the agreed term without written permission from the landlord, he would have to pay double the rent, which would amount to $130,000 per month.The lawsuit also states that Butler caused $125,000 in damages, including mold issues, damaged drywall, and flooring. His pool was not maintained properly, and the HVAC system was malfunctioning. He also allegedly changed the locks to the house, thus preventing the house owner from checking in on his property or having an inspection.Five Star Marketing and Promotions is suing Butler for a total of $257,282. The damage he caused to the property is worth $127,282, plus the two months’ rent that is due. Butler had paid a $130,000 security deposit, which Five Star said they were legally entitled to apply to his outstanding balance, and have not included in the number they are suing the athlete for.Earlier this month, Jimmy Butler was one of the names that was being linked to every possible team. Before the deadline, the Miami Heat finally traded him to the Warriors in a multi-team deal. And he is doing pretty well as the newest forward for the San Francisco team.Unlike his personal woes, his professional front is excelling, as the Warriors are on a 7-1 run since he joined. He has also become the first Warrior in franchise history to have 120+ Points, 30+ Rebounds and 30+ Assists through a player's first six games with the team. Hopefully, his excellence in his professional life can mirror his personal life, and the recent legal issues can be solved without much difficulty.Also Read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Golden State Warriors might bag $186 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form Big 3 with Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler","Jimmy Butler is being sued by a South Florida company over a luxury home that he had leased during his tenure with the Miami Heat.

Opinion divided over US Open's move to downplay mixed doubles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/opinion-divided-over-us-opens-move-to-downplay-mixed-doubles/articleshow/118657930.cms,"US Open (AP Photo)

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

DUBAI: The US Open's decision to cut and change the draw of its mixed-doubles event has divided the locker-room on the men's and women's tours. The Open's plan is to reschedule mixed-doubles as a standalone feature during the qualifying draw, tossing out $1 million in prize-money.This year's mixed-doubles event in New York, perhaps inspired by the vibe of last year's 'Mixed Madness' mela, will feature 16 pairs as against the 32 that make up mixed-doubles draws at Grand Slams. It will be played on August 19-20, three days before the start of the main draw. The qualification process has also been changed, with eight teams earning direct entry courtesy their combined singles ranking, while the other eight teams will be wildcard entries. Rohan Bopanna , still going strong in doubles at almost 45 years, said it was a lost opportunity for doubles specialists, who look forward to playing two events in Grand Slams -- doubles and mixed doubles. ""I don't think any doubles players can really play the mixed doubles. This year's US Open will be the first Grand Slam where we are not playing two events,"" Bopanna told TOI on the sidelines of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis championships here.Bopanna believes doubles is still a popular option for singles players on the ATP Tour. ""All the guys who enjoy doubles play doubles on the circuit,"" Bopanna said. ""The system is such that you can use singles ranking to get into doubles, on the ATP Tour you see a bunch of guys playing doubles and they enjoy it.""Yuki Bhambri, the India No.2 in the individual doubles ranking, said the USTA knew exactly what they were doing when they wrung in the changes. ""Grand Slams especially have always talked about tradition, that's why they never want to shorten matches,"" he said. ""They do that when it suits them, obviously business over (other) interests. The mixed doubles for a lot of countries like Great Britain, India and Australia has been a source of Grand Slam achievement. You're never going to get an opportunity like that with what they've done.""""You're essentially having the singles guys play a practice week,"" the 32-year-old Bhambri said, adding, ""It is obviously a sad day and a loss for a lot of the doubles players. We've all spoken about that, everyone is aware of what they've done and how they've gone about it.""Last year's Mixed Madness exhibition event before the start of the main draw saw a number of high-profile singles players pairing up. American Coco Gauff said she wouldn't be playing the mixed event this time even though she enjoyed being a part of Mixed Madness last year. ""It's an interesting situation because (on one side) some (players) rely on mixed doubles and it's an event that's been there forever. On the other hand, I know they're trying to get more singles players involved, maybe grow the sport,"" Gauff said, ""I most likely won't be participating just because it's not a great time for me, it will take away from the preparation for US Open.""",The US Open has cut and changed the draw of its mixed-doubles event.

“He can't take it anymore”: Tom Brady reportedly fed up with Gisele Bündchen and seeks emotional and physical distance for a fresh start,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/he-cant-take-it-anymore-tom-brady-reportedly-fed-up-with-gisele-bndchen-and-seeks-emotional-and-physical-distance-for-a-fresh-start/articleshow/118657321.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Tom Brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance from Gisele Bündchen

Tom Brady is making a big transition in his life as he gets set to sell his $150 million Miami estate, a home where he previously lived with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. Sources indicate that the sale comes from the emotional pain of watching Bündchen progress with her new life and her boyfriend, Joaquim Valente, and their newborn baby. While Brady has kept his eye on his post-NFL business, the fact that his ex-wife is moving on to a new chapter has reportedly not been easy for him.Sources indicate that 47-year-old ex-New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance between himself and the lingering reminders of his past. While he continues with his work and self-development, the harsh fact of remaining unmarried for close to three years with his former spouse, supermodel Gisele Bündchen, having reestablished life with her lover, Joaquim Valente, has purportedly been challenging. Unloading his $150 million Miami villa seems a part of wrapping that chapter up and opening doors to a new life.Brady and Bündchen, who share their two children, divorced after 13 years of marriage in 2022. Although they remain on good terms for the benefit of their family, the fact that their homes are in close proximity has not allowed Brady to completely move on.The supermodel and her new beau, a jiu-jitsu instructor, now share a lavish waterfront home just across from Brady's compound—a home that was originally part of the ex-couple's future together. Far from representing their aspirations, however, it now serves as a bitter reminder of what he stands to lose.For Brady, the sale of the mansion can be more than a money matter, but a heart matter as well. Leaving a city full of reminders of his own marriage may grant him the time he requires to work on being happy himself and potentially even opening himself to finding another relationship.Though he still hasn't commented publicly on his motivation for selling, those in his inner circle say the switch is about something greater than a piece of property—it's about reclaiming his sense of mind and looking to the future stage of his life.""Every time he looks out across the water,"" an insider told radaronline.com. ""He sees Gisele's refurbished home and perfect life with her martial arts hunk and their new baby, and it gets him down. He can't take it anymore. He wants to sell the house. It reminds him of Gisele. She was the one who dominated the remodeling, and it's her style, her personal touches. He still feels her nuance everywhere.”Also Read: “I’m pretty disappointed”: Rob Gronkowski feels overlooked as Tom Brady makes Raiders moves without considering him Tom Brady has no plans to leave Miami, the city he moved to in 2019 when he joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. However, he is looking to downsize and find a more private residence that allows him to step away from the memories tied to his current home.Despite wanting a fresh start, Brady remains dedicated to co-parenting his two children, Benjamin, 15, and Vivian, 12, with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. His goal is to create a peaceful and comfortable environment where he can focus on his personal well-being while staying actively involved in his children's lives.","Tom Brady is keen on creating some emotional and physical distance from Gisele Bündchen.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.
