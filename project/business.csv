From becoming an IPS officer to leading international banking operations at the Royal Bank of Scotland, what inspired your transition to

politics

?

What approach do you use to appeal to voters? In 2018, Niti Aayog identified Shravasti as one of the most poverty-stricken areas of the country. How do you plan to address this issue?

You are facing a former MP from the Samajwadi Party. How do you assess your chances in the elections?

Does your college friend Asim Arun, now a minister, provide you with insights and feedback now that you have entered politics?

What is your perspective on the possibility of BJP achieving the target of 400 seats?

With a notable legacy from your father, do you believe it has been advantageous to your political journey?

What are your views on AI and Machine learning?

Other than PM Modi, whom do you admire as a politician? What are your interests other than politics?

A seasoned professional with experience across sectors, including international stints, MLChas jumped into the electoral fray as BJP’s Lok Sabha candidate from Shravasti. Son of the former bureaucrat and chairman of Ram Temple Construction Committee Nripendra Mishra, Saket firmly believes that a dedicated politician can catalyze significant change in his/her constituency. In conversation with, he spoke on the issues facing Shravasti and his vision for development . Excerpts:Politics is all about social service. I have served across sectors, and now I want to contribute to the development of the poor and backward areas of India. Upon my return, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ji entrusted me with the task of overseeing the development of backward areas in east UP, which naturally led me towards politics. The party recognized my work and considered me for this role. Unlike in bureaucracy, there is no concern for promotion in politics. A good politician can make a significant difference in his area, unhindered by institutional constraints. At this stage of life, I am not seeking promotions. I am focused on serving the people. My party has been very supportive during this transition. Comfort is not a concern to me. When I was in Singapore, I walked through the deepest areas of eastern UP wearing backpacks during work. The culture within the party, fostered by PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi, emphasizes bringing individuals like me into politics, individuals who have the mindset of serving the people.I have already devised a strategy focusing on two fundamental issues – health and education. I aim to streamline health facilities to make them more accessible to the people, who often face challenges in accessing healthcare services. I am also working on implementing an education policy that ensures that children receive quality education and can compete globally. I plan to attract industries to generate employment opportunities. I aim to establish standard service levels to ensure that the poor receive essential facilities promptly, such as income proof and property rights. Many people are unaware of their rights, and we need to change that. Government services must be provided efficiently, and officials should be held accountable if they fail to deliver.Works done by the double-engine govt will speak for itself. I believe in the power of comparison. People will evaluate the work done over the past 7-8 years by me through the CSR fund and the work done by their elected representatives. No candidate can be compared to PM Modi , who empathizes with the poor and understands their needs. He is a ‘ yugpurush ’. For me, the real issue is whether my efforts are truly improving the lives of the people and if I can connect with them on a personal level.Yes. Asim and his wife have been a constant source of support. They offer valuable feedback and insights. Not just him, even Shashi Tharoor and Amar Patnaik provide inputs. Our college has a history of producing idealistic individuals, which has been beneficial.I believe we will get widespread support, although I cannot predict the exact numbers. The PM has captured the hearts of the people like no other leader post-independence. The opposition is envious of Modi, it only thinks about its interests. The PM focuses on the nation’s development. People understand that only he can lead the country to greater heights.My father’s legacy certainly helped amplify my voice. However, it also comes with the responsibility to uphold a fair and efficient govt. The path to doing the right thing is often challenging, but if I can achieve even half of what my father accomplished, it would be a significant achievement. My experiences abroad have taught me to rise above the shadow of my father and work towards the betterment of society.If elected, I would urge the PM to establish a committee to implement AI and machine learning in the country’s school curriculum. It’s essential to ensure that our children are not left behind in the global arena.I don’t idolize any politician, but I admire BR Ambedkar, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Piloo Modi, Babu Jagjivan Ram, and Kanshi Ram. I follow them to know the tradition of the parliament. I enjoy reading works by Salman Rushdie and Ernest Hemingway. I like reading historical books. I read ‘India Wins Independence’ by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. I also love music and am fond of Kishore Kumar’s songs.","Saket Mishra is the son of former bureaucrat and chairman of Ram Temple Construction Committee Nripendra Mishra.

'International Khan Market gang': Jaishankar on Western media's portrayal of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/international-khan-market-gang-jaishankar-on-western-medias-portrayal-of-india/articleshow/110402600.cms,"'Countries Going To Court For Polls...': Jaishankar Slams Western Media Over 2024 Elections Coverage

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar slammed the Western media and called the anti-India ecosystem the 'international Khan Market gang '. On the portrayal of India by the Western media, Jaishankar said we must ask ""why they are doing it"". He said that just like there's a 'Khan Market gang' in India, there also exists a global extension of it, 'international Khan Market gang'.""In the country today, there is a certain thought process, or entitlement process for which the metaphor of 'Khan Market gang' is a very good description.I want to tell you there is an international Khan Market gang as well,"" Jaishankar said in an interview to news agency ANI.""These are people who are sort of linked, you know, to the entitled people out here. They are socially comfortable with them. They know them. They feel like they advance similar viewpoints. They are essentially a kind of an elitist left-lib thought process. So there's a symbiotic relationship between the two,"" he said.Talking about how they openly endorse leaders and parties , he said, ""When the sales are down in the domestic Khan Market, the International Khan Market gang feels like, I need to pep up these guys and give them support and you can actually see which stories they play up, how do they slant things and in previous elections perhaps even in this one they've actually openly endorsed parties and will openly endorse leaders and openly said that this party or this leader is bad for India.""Jaishankar also claimed that attempt is being made to influence the choices of voters. ""I believe it is election influence certainly...And it's not just them, you know, there's a... See, it's a... press, university, think tank, and in some cases maybe some degree of officialdom at some kind of medium level because the guys up there are very smart. They don't get into this. So there is a very clear attempt being made, a very persistent attempt being made to actually influence the direction of Indian politics and the choices of the Indian voter,"" he said.Asked if his ministry gets riled up over editorials, Jaishankar said it is their job to contest, convince and communicate. ""I don't think we get riled up. But it is our job to contest, to convince and where necessary to communicate. If somebody, some newspaper or some medium whatever you know has a narrative and that narrative is unfair, if that narrative is untruthful, and we often encounter this, if it is very, very slanted, I do not think we should hesitate to call it out,"" he said."," External affairs minister S Jaishankar slammed the Western media and called the anti-India ecosystem the 'international Khan Market gang' He said we must ask ""why they are doing it"" Jaishanksar also claimed that attempt is being made to influence the choices of voters.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110402644,imgsize-1638513,width-400,resizemode-4/110402644.jpg"

""Earlier Indian embassy informed that they have 60 Indians in cooperation with Sihanoukville(SHV)authority and they are assisting with travel documents & other arrangements for their early return home.Indians were lured by promising them jobs with big money but once they land in the alien country, they are forced to work in cybercrime syndicates.

"Ground beneath their feet is red-hot, but Jharia residents just can’t leave",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ground-beneath-their-feet-is-red-hot-but-jharia-residents-just-cant-leave/articleshow/110411378.cms,"With inputs from Divy Khare

JHARIA: The earth beneath your feet is hot as pan, ready to crumble like cookies any moment. You can sense the vibrations of raging flames underneath and watch fumes emanating through cracks and fissures on ground here and there. The air is loaded with a pungent odour of burning sulphur ammonia and bitumen and a waft of colourless, odourless gas braces your face at intervals, pushing you to the brink of losing consciousness.Welcome to Jharia — the city of black diamond for some and the ‘hell on earth’ for others. Boasting the richest reserves of high-quality bitumen used in the production of coke to fuel steel industry, the region is also known for the century-old underground coal fire that has resulted in extreme damage to life and property since 1916.Elections come and go, govts change but little has changed for the residents, most of whom have accepted the impending catastrophe as their fate. “They ask us to relocate to the Belgaria colony, but we have to eat to survive.What are we supposed to do there to earn a living,” asks Santoshi Devi (name changed on request), a woman from among the four families who have refused to vacate their mud shanties in Basti No.7 of Bastakola colliery. She has witnessed her neighbour, Mandalji, a shopkeeper, falling into a crevice on the ground a few months ago and burning his feet completely.People in the locality blame these families and hundreds of those living a few hundred metres far from the fire spot for “risking their lives out of their greed for stealing coal”. “You can see heaps of coal being fired in and around to make coke-coal. They will sell it to the market and earn a living. If they are relocated to Belgaria, the resettlement colony made by Bharat Coking Coal Ltd ( BCCL ), they will lose their livelihood,” said a young man from one of those families who have refused to relocate.Rupesh Kumar, 11, who has stopped going to school now, also engages in picking coal. For the poor in colliery, earning through coal picking depends on number of hands engaged.Jharia Coalfield Bachao Samity president Rajiv Sharma, however, refuses to accept the theory that BCCL has given ample facilities to relocate the people. The Samity wrote a letter to the principal secretary at the Prime Minister’s office last month with a list of suggestions on what must be done for the Jharia residents so that they can relocate. Activists believe underground fire is a ‘trump card’ in the hands of BCCL and govt to displace the people without compensating them adequately.“In the name of underground fire and lurking danger to lives, people are being asked to vacate their land and go to the ‘cage-like-houses’ in Belgaria on which thousands of crores of rupees have been spent by the Jharia Rehabilitation Development Authority without applying mind,” Sharma said.He added that the land losers must be compensated under Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.Sharma’s demand is corroborated by the fire-affected people in other regions of Jharia as well. Coal transport machine driver Anil Kumar Thakur believes the alternate arrangement provided to them is not sufficient. “I have no complaints with the company I work for but what about the govt. They have left us at the mercy of coal companies. Shouldn’t they intervene and set a standard of compensation,” he asked.Thakur has decided to exercise his franchise on Saturday and ensure there is some change.“We can’t say our elected representatives do not come here. Even the Union minister (Prahlad Joshi) had visited. Rahul Gandhi came here to talk to the coal miners but these visits have not solved our problems,” he said.BCCL public relations officer Samiran Dutta said the tenure of the old policy is about to end, and a new draft policy with better provisions is being considered.“The matter has reached the Cabinet after a presentation before the PM. Once it gets approval, we can expect a rehabilitation and resettlement plan that suits the interest of those affected by fire,” he said.",The region is known for the century-old underground coal fire that has resulted in extreme damage to life and property since 1916. Activists believe underground fire is a ‘trump card’ in the hands of BCCL and govt to displace the people.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110411383,imgsize-871303,width-400,resizemode-4/110411383.jpg"

In its guideline released recently on heat-related deaths, NCDC said the diagnosis of hyperthermia-abnormally high body temperature-is dependent mostly on the scene of investigation, circumstances of death, and reasonable exclusion of alternative causes of death.

According to NCDC guidelines, a heat-related fatality is defined as a death caused by exposure to high ambient temperatures or one in which high ambient temperatures significantly contributed to the death. For example, the guideline suggests, a death should be certified as heat stroke or hyperthermia if the body temperature of the deceased was higher than 105°F (40.6°C) just before death.

""In cases where the ante-mortem (before death) body temperature cannot be established but the environmental temperature at the time of collapse was high, an appropriate heat-related diagnosis should be listed as the cause of death or as a significant contributing condition,"" NCDC adds.

Supreme Court stays Uttarakhand HC ambitious relocation plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-stays-uttarakhand-hc-ambitious-relocation-plan/articleshow/110407485.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday stayed Uttarakhand high court's ambitious order that had rejected a 26-acre plot at Haldwani for relocation of the overcrowded HC complex at Nainital and sought an appropriate site from the state to construct a new HC building with 7,000 chambers for lawyers.Appearing for Uttarakhand HC Bar Association, advocate P B Suresh with counsel Vipin Nair took a preliminary yet potent objection to the jurisdiction and power of the HC to direct shifting of HC's principal seat, which can only be ordered by the President after Parliament passes a bill to that effect.Before a vacation bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Sanjay Karol, they argued that HC had power to create circuit or permanent benches at different places in a state with prior approval of the governor concerned. As Centre through SG Tushar Mehta supported the bar association's plea, the bench stayed the May 8 order of the HC.The stay from SC comes two days before the May 26 hearing before a HC bench of Chief Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Rakesh Thapliyal, which had directed the state chief secretary to locate suitable land for establishment of HC complex, residential accommodations for judges, judicial officers and staff, conference hall, chambers for at least 7,000 lawyers, canteen, parking space, along with good medical facilities. SC has provided for 700-odd lawyers chambers .""This exercise shall be completed by the chief secretary within a month and submit a report to the HC by June 7,"" it had said, while asking HC registrar general to put in motion a poll to seek opinions of lawyers and litigants on desirability of shifting the HC complex from Nainital.The state had allotted 26-acre land at Golapur in Haldwani for shifting the HC complex. Finding the land to be surrounded by forest, which formed 75% of allotted land, the CJ-led bench had said the HC ""does not want to uproot any of the trees to make a new HC.""

"NSA: Like defence forces, CAPFs too need 'jointness'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nsa-like-defence-forces-capfs-too-need-jointness/articleshow/110407234.cms,"NEW DELHI: National Security Adviser Ajit Doval on Friday pitched for securing the frontiers on the northern and western side by using technology as a force-multiplier and enhancing engagement with the border residents, while stressing the crucial link between safe borders and India's goal of becoming a $10-trillion economy in the next 10 years.Delivering the annual Rustomji lecture at the BSF's 21st Investiture Ceremony, Doval also floated the idea of "" jointness "" among different central armed police forces (CAPFs), wherein they can interchange roles like border-guarding and internal security etc, given they have similar training, equipment and command structures. ""It is not only for saving money but shall bring about greater homogeneity (among CAPFs ),"" he stated.Clarifying that he was throwing up the idea of interoperability among the central forces in his capacity as a former police officer and not as NSA, Doval said that it has already been operationalised as regards the defence forces .""We have a huge (CAPF) force altogether. They have also got the same types of intermingling duties at many places, whether it's procurement, communications, training, standardisation,"" he said. ""In defence forces, they are thinking of theatre commands... joint command of the theatre, where one officer from the Air Force is probably controlling Army and Navy units for the domain,"" he underlined.While recalling Modi govt's emphasis on border security in the past 10 years, he recalled how the PM spends every Diwali at the farthest frontiers, meeting officials of BSF, ITBP and Army units posted there. Also, the PM's personal interest has ensured that governors of border states and cabinet ministers visit border areas.Citing how Israel recently managed to thwart 99% of the missile attacks from Iran due to technology, Doval pitched for major technological innovations to make the borders impregnable with round-the-clock and reliable systems. Stating that India must not allow vulnerability of its borders to retard its growth trajectory as an economic power, he said BSF needs to be the best rather than the biggest.","National Security Adviser Ajit Doval pitched for securing the frontiers on the northern and western side by using technology.

"Delhi Temperature: Delhi Heat Index Soars to 50°C, Expected to Reach 56°C Amid High Humidity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/feels-like-50c-in-delhi-may-touch-56c/articleshow/110378782.cms,"NEW DELHI: The mercury in Delhi was at a scorching 41 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal, on Thursday, but the real feel was even more, like 50 degrees Celsius.It's not just the air temperature that affects individuals on a sweltering summer day as high humidity levels can make the heat feel even more oppressive. India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) has begun measuring the heat index or feel-like temperature, which considers both temperature and relative humidity, to provide a more accurate representation of the impact of a hot summer day.The heat index is the apparent temperature that people feel outside, an indication of the discomfort level. This exercise of calculating the heat index began on April 1. Till last year, IMD used to give only a heatwave forecast, based on the maximum temperature and its departure from the normal.The city saw the highest heat index of this season so far at 55.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday against the day temperature of 43.4. Thursday's feel-like 50 degrees Celsius is the second highest.""Easterly winds, which bring moisture to Delhi-NCR, have been prevailing in the city for the past two days. Due to moisture-laden winds, the relative humidity has increased and that's why the feel-like temperature was much higher than the actual temperature,"" said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD's Regional Weather Forecasting Centre.However, the heat index is likely to increase on Friday and Saturday as IMD has predicted it to be around 54-56 degrees Celsius in the next 48 hours. ""The wind direction is expected to change to westerly by May 25 evening. The feel-like temperature may dip on Sunday,"" said a Met official.IMD's data shows that the heat index remained below 40 degrees Celsius for the entire April. Since it was low, IMD initially gave the range like 'below 40 degrees Celsius' or 'between 40-50 degrees Celsius' till May 12. It started giving the actual value from May 13. The heat index has remained below 50 on most days so far.As Delhi usually witnesses high humidity in July, the heat index may then rise above 50 degrees Celsius. ""Though it is too early to predict the feel-like temperature for July, the moisture levels are generally high in that month. Heat index is mostly higher than the actual temperature as it takes relative humidity into account,"" said another Met official. IMD will issue the heat index till mid-Aug.The index was introduced by IMD last year on an experimental basis. ""At present, heat index is derived using the heat index equation similar to what is used by National Weather Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, USA. It provides guidance towards additional care to be taken by people to reduce discomfort,"" Union minister of earth sciences Kiren Rijiju stated in a written reply in Rajya Sabha last July.","The heat index is the apparent temperature that people feel outside, an indication of the discomfort level.

and Bangladesh revealed that after the victim's demise, the perpetrator(s) dismembered the body inside one of the washrooms. After killing Anar, the group skinned the body, removed the flesh, and minced it to prevent identification. They then packed the remains into plastic bags and cut the bones into small pieces

The police suspect that after killing Anar, the murderers mutilated the body, segregated the flesh from the bones and mixed those with turmeric powder to delay decomposition.

The remains were then carefully placed into plastic bags for transportation. In an attempt to conceal any evidence of the heinous act, the washroom was thoroughly cleaned using acid before the apartment was vacated.

With help from Bangladeshi security agencies, CID detectives pieced together the events surrounding the murder.

Police suspect that the MP could have been ""lured' into a New Town flat by a woman and then murdered by contract killers.

They discovered that the plan to kill Azim, a representative of Jhenaidah-4 in Khulna division, was made at least a month before the incident.

The main suspect, businessman Md Akhtaruzzaman, also known as Shaheen, is the younger brother of the Kotchandpur Municipality mayor in Jhenaidah. Reports indicate that Shaheen paid contract killers 4 crore Bangladeshi taka to murder the MP.

The investigators have learnt that all the persons involved came from Bangladesh and returned to the country after finishing their job.

Some of them had checked into a hotel in Chinar Park a day before the murder and checked out on May 17 and left the country the same day

NEW DELHI: Investigations have uncovered bone- chilling details surrounding the disappearance and suspected murder of Anwarul Azim Anar , a member of parliament from Bangladesh , who had been missing since May 13 just a day after his arrival in Kolkata.According to the findings, the MP was allegedly killed in a Kolkata apartment, where his body was chopped and then proceeded to dispose the remains by packaging them in multiple plastic bags. Here's what we know so far:The search for the missing MP started when Gopal Biswas, who is a resident of Baranagar in north Kolkata and knows the Bangladeshi politician, reported to the local police. The MP had arrived in Kolkata on May 12 for medical treatment. Anar stayed at the house of Biswas when he arrived.Biswas mentioned in his complaint that Anar departed from his residence in Baranagar on May 13 afternoon to see a doctor. Anar informed that he would return home for dinner.Biswas claimed that the Member of Parliament from Bangladesh has been unreachable since May 17.

Initially, the BMC had earmarked and cleaned a space for them to park their bicycles near Andheri station east and at Churchgate.The dabbawalas had sought a space near five railway stations Andheri, Bandra, Lower Parel, Grant Road and Churchgate. “NGO Waatavaran took up our issue with BMC. Subsequently, Additional Municipal Commissioner (AMC) Sudhakar Shinde supported our cause and instructed officials to provide us with space near these stations. Earlier, we used to park our cycles at parking lots or private places and end up paying Rs 300 to 500 per month. Cycles are parked at random locations too and they end up being stolen,” said Ulhas Muke, president of the Mumbai Dabbawala Association.“A space near the landing of the new skywalk at Andheri east station has been given to us. Similarly, space near some of the other stations, where we have requested, too have been identified, while some are in the process of being identified by the BMC. At some locations, the BMC ward officials have assured us of creating enclosures and sheds for our cycles,” Muke added.Bhagwan Keshbhat, of Waatavaran Foundation said “The dabbawala community’s tireless dedication to delivering meals to Mumbaikars exemplifies a commitment to sustainability. We fostered a dialogue with BMC to advance the agenda of sustainable transportation. AMC Sudhakar Shinde played a key role and directed the administration to allocate dedicated, safe, and secure spaces for bicycle parking.” Earlier in 2022, the Waatavaran Foundation carried out a perception survey of dabbawalas to understand the challenges they face in making deliveries.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

The workers sought a fair opportunity to have a voice on the job and a say in their working conditions.Mercedes-Benz stated that more than 90% of team members participated in the election, with a majority indicating they are not interested in UAW representation for collective bargaining purposes. The company claims to have worked with the NLRB to adhere to guidelines throughout the election process and will continue to do so.The union's filing alleges that four pro-union employees were fired, and the company allowed anti-union employees to solicit support during work hours while prohibiting pro-union employees from doing the same. The company also required workers to attend anti-union meetings, displayed anti-union propaganda, and prohibited the distribution of union materials in non-work areas.Furthermore, the union claims that the company, or its representatives, polled workers about union support, suggested that voting for the union would be futile, targeted union supporters with drug tests, and ""engaged in conduct which deliberately sought to exacerbate racial feelings by irrelevant and inflammatory appeals to racial prejudice.""The NLRB will review the objections, and if it is determined that the employer's conduct affected the election, a new election could be ordered.","The United Auto Workers (UAW) has accused Mercedes of interfering with a union election at two factories in Alabama.

Only one of the cows tested positive for bird flu.Even if bird flu were to end up in consumer beef, the USDA claims that heatingit to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.9 Celsius) will kill it, just as it does E. coli and other viruses.52 herds in US were infected with avian flu in nine of the 50 states as of Wednesday.

Texas power demand breaks May record again as prices soar in heat wave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-power-demand-breaks-may-record-again-as-prices-soar-in-heat-wave/articleshow/110410856.cms,"Record-tying heat

Power demand in Texas broke the record for the month of May for a second time this week on Friday as prices soared ahead of the US Memorial Day long weekend with homes and businesses cranking up their air conditioners to escape a heat wave .The Electric Reliability Council of Texas ( ERCOT ), which operates most of the state's power grid for 27 million customers, said the system was operating normally with enough supply available to meet expected demand over the next week.ERCOT said power demand soared to a preliminary 72,695 megawatts (MW) on Friday, which would top the current record for the month of May of 72,261 MW set last Monday.ERCOT projected usage would break that new record on Monday, Memorial Day, when it forecasts a peak above 76,500 MW.The grid's all-time peak was 85,508 MW on August 10, 2023.Analysts expect ERCOT electric use will top that all-time high this summer with economic and population growth in Texas and demand for power from data centers, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency mining rising fast.One megawatt can usually power about 800 homes on a normal day but as few as 250 on a hot summer day in Texas.In the spot market, next-day power prices at the ERCOT North Hub , which includes Dallas, soared to a two-week high of $141 per megawatt hour (MWh) for Friday, up from $21 for Thursday, according to pricing data on the LSEG terminal.That compares with an average of $31 per MWh so far this year, $80 in 2023 and $66 over the prior five years (2018-2022).Day-ahead prices on the ERCOT website, meanwhile, soared to $654 per MWh for one hour on Friday evening.""May-to-date real-time pricing is 50% higher than in any year since 2010 (except for the 2022 natural gas price blowout). This results in more inefficient natural gas generators chewing through more gas ... to keep the lights on,"" analysts at consultancy EBW Analytics Group said in a note.High temperatures in Houston, the state's biggest city, will hold at 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 Celsius) on Friday and Saturday before rising to 96 on Memorial Day Monday, according to meteorologists at AccuWeather.The normal high in Houston at this time of year is 88 F (31 C).AccuWeather said the forecast high of 95 F for Friday would tie the record for the day set in 1955.ERCOT projected supplies would exceed demand by 5,400 to 42,300 MW over the next week with the 5,400 MW low expected during one hour in the evening of May 26 after the sun goes down and solar panels stop working.That comfortable level of supply is higher than ERCOT forecast earlier on Friday and assumes nothing changes.But things always change - power plants and transmission lines shut and return to service, weather forecasts change and storms cause outages.","Power demand in Texas broke the record for the month of May for a second time this week on Friday.

Louisiana governor signs bill classifying abortion pills as controlled substances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/louisiana-governor-signs-bill-classifying-abortion-pills-as-controlled-substances/articleshow/110410765.cms,"Louisiana's governor on Friday signed a bill making his state the first in the U.S. to classify two abortion-inducing medications as controlled substances, a category that healthcare regulators typically reserve for drugs prone to abuse or addiction.The measure, thrusting Republican-led efforts to restrict abortion back to the political forefront in a presidential election year, was signed into law by Republican Governor Jeff Landry a day after the state legislature sent it to his desk.The bill cleared Louisiana's Republican-majority House of Representatives and Senate by wide margins, even as efforts by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to expand access to abortion pills is facing a legal challenge before the Supreme Court.The new law designates mifepristone and misoprostol, which the FDA approved more than two decades ago as safe and effective for terminating pregnancies, as Schedule IV drugs, meaning they merit greater oversight due to the potential for abuse or dependence.That puts the abortion pills in Louisiana in the same category as anti-anxiety medications Xanax and Valium, though neither mifepristone or misoprostol is considered by the medical establishment to pose a hazard of tolerance or addiction.Still, the reclassification makes it riskier for Louisiana residents, who are already subject to a near-total ban on surgical and medication-induced abortions, to obtain the pills from out of state or order them online without a prescription.Critics say the measure will also make it harder for patients to obtain the drugs when they are prescribed for other uses, such as inducing labor in childbirth, treating miscarriages and reducing the risk of serious bleeding from ulcers.Doctors will need a special license to prescribe the drugs, and those prescriptions are entered into a state database that law enforcement can access without a warrant. Critics say that situation could compromise patient privacy and expose physicians to unwarranted investigation.""It creates more onus, more chaos and confusion for people accessing this medication,"" Kirsten Moore, who heads the nonprofit Expanding Mediation Abortion Access (EMMA) Project, adding that the overall intent is to ""put mifepristone and misoprostol back under lock and key.""The bill makes unprescribed possession of the pills a crime punishable by one to five years in prison and fines of up to $5,000.Although pregnant women are expressly exempt from punishment for violation of the measure, any other person who might help them obtain the drugs, such as friends, family members or healthcare providers, could be subject to prosecution.Women who are not pregnant but obtain the pills to have on hand as a precaution are likewise not exempt.The drug reclassification was added as an amendment to a bill specifically outlawing ""coerced criminal abortion by means of fraud,"" making it a crime for abortion-inducing medication to be administered to an unsuspecting pregnant woman without her consent.Supporters said placing mifepristone and misoprostol under greater regulatory control is intended to curtail their distribution for illicit purposes, such as coerced medication abortions that the larger bill aims to prevent.The measure's chief sponsor, Senator Thomas Pressly, named the bill for his sister whose then-husband slipped abortion drugs he obtained from Mexico into her drinks, causing her serious health effects and causing the premature birth of her daughter, who survived. The husband, whom she divorced, was later convicted in a domestic violence case and sentenced to 180 days in jail.Abortion rights groups decried the bill as part of a larger Republican-driven effort to criminalize abortion since the Supreme Court's conservative majority in 2022 overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that made access to abortion a constitutional right nationwide.That reversal left it up to individual states to regulate abortion largely as they saw fit.The Supreme Court in March heard oral arguments in a case challenging FDA regulations that expanded access to mifepristone, such as allowing the drug to be prescribed by telemedicine and dispensed by mail. In their line of questioning, the justices appeared skeptical about siding with anti-abortion groups on the issue.","Louisiana is the first state in the U.S. to classify two abortion-inducing medications as controlled substances.

Aftermath and safety protocols

Investigations and future precautions

A Singapore Airlines flight from London to Singapore encountered severe turbulence, causing a rapid ascent and descent of 400 feet within a minute, resulting in the death of one passenger and injuries to at least 30 others. The Boeing 777-300ER, which departed from London’s Heathrow Airport, was diverted to Bangkok, where it made an emergency landing.The turbulence hit about 10 hours into the flight, as the plane flew over the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar, a region known for severe weather conditions.The aircraft, carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew members, was at an altitude of 37,000 feet when it suddenly encountered ""sudden extreme turbulence,"" causing it to drop 6,000 feet in about three minutes.Andrew Davies, a 54-year-old passenger from London, recounted his experience during the turbulence to the Wall Street Journal. He was deciding between taking a nap and watching a movie when the seatbelt sign flashed on. Just as he secured his seatbelt, the plane began to drop violently. ""Pillows, plates and cups were thrown in the air. His seat belt tugged at his waist, and he found himself covered in his neighbor’s coffee. Oxygen masks dropped down,"" Davies told the WSJ.The chaos in the cabin was immediate and severe. ""I saw a woman with a deep gash on her head, covered in blood. Flight crew members also appeared bloody and injured, hobbling around trying to help passengers,"" Davies added. An elderly passenger, identified as Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old British national with a history of heart problems, likely suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by the crew to perform CPR for 20 minutes, they were unable to revive him.The plane's abrupt altitude change was documented by FlightRadar24, which reported a ""rapid change in vertical rate, consistent with a sudden turbulence event."" The turbulence was likely clear-air turbulence (CAT), which is difficult to detect and can occur without warning. ""Developing thunderstorms often have strong updrafts, a zone of upward moving air, that rises very rapidly, sometimes at more than 100 mph, and can leave pilots little time to react if it occurs directly in front of the plane,"" explained Dan DePodwin, Senior Director of Forecasting Operations at AccuWeather.Former pilot Marco Chan noted the turbulence likely occurred within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, notorious for thunderstorms. ""With turbulence of such magnitude, it is likely the [Singapore Airlines] flight was navigating through difficult thunderstorms,"" he said.Following the incident, Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong expressed condolences and assured that the airline was providing necessary support to affected passengers and their families. ""We are very sorry for the traumatic experience that everyone on board SQ321 went through,"" Goh said.Of the injured, 18 were hospitalized, with seven in critical condition. The Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok treated 71 passengers. The incident has renewed calls for strict adherence to safety protocols, emphasizing the importance of wearing seatbelts at all times during a flight. ""It is a matter of life and death,"" said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.This event marked the first fatal incident involving Singapore Airlines in almost 25 years. The airline, recognized as one of the world's leading carriers, has a strong safety record, with its last major accident occurring in October 2000.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the US and Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau are investigating the incident. Preliminary findings suggest that climate change may be increasing the frequency and intensity of turbulence events. ""For clear-air turbulence, climate change is increasing the temperature difference across the jet stream between the cold poles and the warm tropics,"" explained Dr Paul Williams, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading.As investigations continue, the aviation industry is urged to enhance real-time weather data sharing and improve safety protocols to better prepare for such unpredictable turbulence events.(With inputs from agencies)","Singapore Airlines Flight SQ321 was flying from London’s Heathrow airport to Singapore.

Trump no longer a taboo for some Valley investors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-no-longer-a-taboo-for-some-valley-investors/articleshow/110407266.cms,"SAN FRANSISCO: In 2021, David Sacks, a prominent venture capital investor and podcast host, said former President Donald Trump 's behaviour around the Jan 6 riot at the US Capitol had disqualified him from being a future political candidate.At a tech conference last week, Sacks said his view had changed. ""I have bigger disagreements with Biden than with Trump,"" the investor said. Sacks said he and his podcast co-hosts were working on hosting a fundraiser for Trump, which could include an interview for their ""All In"" show. They also extended an invitation to President Joe Biden , he said, but the Trump camp was more open to it.Such public support for Trump used to be taboo in Silicon Valley , which has long been seen as a liberal bastion. But frustration with Biden, Democrats and the state of the world has increasingly driven some of tech's most prominent venture capitalists to the right.Some investors, like Chamath Palihapitiya of Social Capital, backed Democrats in the past. (He is set to co-host the fundraiser for Trump alongside Sacks.) Others, like Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz and Shaun Maguire of Sequoia Capital, have criticized Biden without expressing support for Trump. Much of Silicon Valley , including prominent donors like investors Reid Hoffman and Vinod Khosla, remains loyal to Democrats.Peter Thiel, the investor who backed Trump in the past, has said he is disillusioned with politics and plans to stay out of the 2024 race.Thiel's loud and enthusiastic support for Trump in 2016, which included a $1.25 million donation, came as a shock. Even more surprising to some in the industry was the way that, after Trump won the election that year, the world seemed to blame tech companies for his victory. The resulting ""techlash"" against Facebook and others caused some industry leaders to reassess their political views, a trend that continued through the social and political turmoil of the pandemic.During that time, Democrats moved further to the left and demonized successful people who made a lot of money, further alienating some tech leaders, said Bradley Tusk, a venture capital investor and political strategist who supports Biden.That feeling has hardened under Biden. Some investors said they were frustrated that his pick for chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, has aggressively moved to block acquisitions, one of the main ways venture capitalists make money. They said they were also unhappy that Biden's pick for head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, had been hostile to cryptocurrency companies.The startup industry has also been in a downturn since 2022, with higher interest rates sending capital fleeing from risky bets and a dismal market for initial public offerings crimping opportunities for investors to cash in on their valuable investments.","Venture capital investor David Sacks says former President Donald Trump disqualified him from being a future political candidate.

This special conference aims to address the city's escalating rodent problem by bringing together leading specialists in urban pest management .The announcement follows a notable increase in cases of human leptospirosis in the city, a disease spread through contact with the urine of animals, particularly rats. With an estimated three million brown rats residing in New York City as of August 2023, the issue has reached a critical point.In a recent press release, Mayor Adams emphasized the importance of understanding the enemy to defeat it, sayingg, “The best way to defeat our enemy is to know our enemy.” The summit will gather experts from Boston, New Orleans, and Seattle to share insights and strategies on urban rat management.""New Yorkers may not know this about me – but I hate rats, and I’m confident most of our city’s residents do as well,"" Adams expressed. He highlighted that rat sightings have decreased by nearly 14% in the city's Rat Mitigation Zones over the past year, but stressed that efforts to combat the rodent issue are far from over.Kathleen Corradi , New York City's first director of rodent mitigations, also known as the ""rat czar,"" voiced the city's pride in hosting the event. She pointed out the surprising lack of research on urban rats and their management despite their prevalence in cities. “Despite being our closest urban counterparts, there is surprisingly limited research on urban rats and their management,” Corradi noted.In an effort to further tackle the rodent population, the New York City Council introduced a bill last month that would require the Health Department to use salty pellets to sterilize both male and female rats in two neighborhoods as part of a pilot program.However, not everyone is supportive of the city's approach. Animal rights activists from PETA have criticized Mayor Adams for “villainizing rats” and urged him to “show kindness and respect for all New Yorkers.” PETA plans to send the mayor an 'empathy kit' that includes a ‘rats have rights’ mug and a ""step-by-step guide to cultivating compassion.""","New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced the upcoming National Urban Rat Summit.

Should we be worried?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kp-2-flirt-new-covid-19-variant-covid-in-us/articleshow/110405709.cms,"NEW DELHI: The latest Covid-19 variant , designated KP.2 and colloquially known as the ""Flirt"" variant, has become the dominant strain in the United States , according to recent reports. This variant has garnered significant attention due to its increased transmissibility and potential resistance to existing vaccines . Health officials are closely monitoring the situation and urging the public to stay vigilant.Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, has emphasized the importance of booster shots and adherence to preventive measures. ""The KP.2 variant is more contagious and poses a greater risk of reinfection,"" he said. ""It is crucial for everyone, especially those at higher risk, to get their booster shots and continue practicing safety measures like wearing masks and social distancing.""The KP.2 variant, part of the family of ""FliRT"" variants, exhibits mutations that allow it to spread more easily among people. While initial data suggests that current vaccines still provide some protection against severe illness and hospitalization, there are concerns about the variant's ability to evade immune responses, a CNN report said.In response to the emergence of KP.2, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is ramping up efforts to distribute updated vaccines tailored to combat the new variant. Additionally, public health campaigns are being intensified to educate the public on the importance of vaccination and booster doses.The scientific community is also conducting extensive research to understand the full implications of the KP.2 variant. Studies are underway to determine its impact on vaccine efficacy and to develop strategies to counter its spread.Public health officials are emphasizing the importance of staying informed about the KP.2 variant. Clear and accurate communication is vital to ensure that people understand the risks and take appropriate actions to protect themselves and their communities. The CDC and other health organizations are leveraging various platforms to disseminate information and counter misinformation.The emergence of the KP.2 variant serves as a stark reminder that the Covid-19 pandemic is far from over, and continued vigilance is necessary to protect public health.","The latest Covid-19 variant is designated KP.2 and colloquially known as the ""Flirt"" variant.

Implementation of all IMF conditions, experts believe,would put an extraordinary burden on the people, and some conditions carry implications for bilateral relations as well.“Based on the preliminary findings of this mission, staff will prepare a report that,subject to management approval, will be presented to IMF’s executive board for discussion and decision,” said Nathan Porter, the IMF mission’s chief, ahead of leaving Islamabad.Porter said Pakistan would have to continue progress towards low and stable inflation by appropriate monetary and exchange rate policies; improve public service provision through state-owned enterprise (SOE) restructuring and privatisation; and promote private sector development by securing a level-playing field for investment and stronger governance.The IMF mission had quietly landed in Pakistan on May 10 and held meetings with Pakistani authorities and other key stakeholders, including US ambassador to Pakistan Donald Blome.Pakistan’s incumbent govt is struggling to maintain economic stability amid rising political temperatures.

3-year-old booked for electricity theft in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/3-year-old-booked-for-electricity-theft-in-pakistans-khyber-pakhtunkhwa/articleshow/110327584.cms,"(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: A 3-year-old toddler was booked for electricity theft in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province after an FIR was filed against the minor, as reported by ARY News.The Peshawar Electric Supply Company (PESCO) and the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) filed the complaint , leading to an FIR against the minor. The child was brought before the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, where his legal representative asserted that the judge dismissed the case after receiving an affidavit.Officials from WAPDA and PESCO expressed uncertainty regarding the child's involvement in the alleged offense.This incident follows a significant revelation last month, where power theft within Power Distribution Companies (DISCOs) reportedly caused a loss of PKR 438 billion to the national treasury. Sources indicated that these losses were a considerable portion of the total annual billing of PKR 723 billion.The power division identified the poorest performing DISCOs, highlighting companies in Hyderabad, Sukkur, Peshawar, Quetta, and Tribal areas for their records. On April 7, the Punjab energy department raised concerns about power distribution companies overcharging government institutions, which it labeled a burden on the provincial exchequer.The department noted that Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO), Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO), Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), and Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) were overcharging government departments.The department reported that there are over 102,000 electric connections across provincial departments, with a significant discrepancy between actual consumption and billed amounts. For the financial year 2022-23, the provincial departments consumed electricity worth over PKR 1.91 billion but were billed PKR 76 billion.In response to this issue, the federal government approved the deployment of Federal Investigation Officers (FIA) to electricity distribution companies (DISCOs) to curb power theft and enhance revenue recovery. This measure was in line with demands from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as reported by ARY News.","A 3-year-old toddler was booked for electricity theft in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.
