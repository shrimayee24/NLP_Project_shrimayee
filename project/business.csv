Supreme Court Directs Dogs Be Shifted From Schools, Bus Stands To Shelters; Petitioner Breaks Down

'Stray dogs not to be released back to site from where they are picked up'





Also read:

NEW DELHI: Noting that India continues to report one of the world's highest rabies-related mortality rates and there has been an alarming increase in dog-bite incidents, making public places unsafe, Supreme Court Friday directed that stray dogs be removed from premises of educational institutions, hospitals, sports complexes, bus stands and depots, and railway stations. The court made it clear the authority concerned will face consequences for non-compliance.A bench of Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria said the ""menace of dog bites"", particularly in public and private institutions that serve as spaces of learning, healing and recreation, is a matter of human safety, and govts are under an obligation to protect life and health of citizens.In its order, the bench mentioned incidents of dog bites which grabbed headlines recently, including a Welsh entrepreneur being bitten during a morning run in Bengaluru and two coaches (from Kenya and Japan) being bitten in Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. Similar incidents in educational institutions, railway stations and hospitals were highlighted, including at Kannur railway station, where a rabid stray reportedly bit 18 people on a platform.It shall be the responsibility of the jurisdictional municipal body/authority to forthwith remove every stray dog found within the premises of an educational institution, hospital (public or private), sports complex, bus stand/depot (including inter-state bus terminals) or railway station, and to shift such animal/s to a designated shelter, after due sterilisation and vaccination, in accordance with the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023,"" the bench said.""Stray dogs so picked up shall not be released back to the same location from which they were picked up. We have consciously directed the non-release of such stray dogs to the same location from which they were picked up, as permitting the same would frustrate the very effect of the directions issued to liberate such institutional areas from the presence of stray dogs,"" it said.No sooner had the bench read out the operating part of its order in open court than animal activists and dog lovers urged it not to sign the judgment and requested it to grant them a hearing. However, the bench turned down the request.It directed that the management or administrator of such institutions shall designate a nodal officer for the upkeep and cleanliness of premises, and ensuring that stray dogs do not enter or inhabit the campus. ""The recurrence of such incidents, particularly within institutional spaces meant for learning, healing and recreation, reflects not only administrative apathy but also a systemic failure to secure these premises from preventable hazards,"" the bench said.The situation calls for immediate judicial intervention to safeguard the fundamental right to life and safety of citizens, especially children, students, patients and sportspersons, it said.The directions, SC said, are being issued in continuation of and in furtherance of its order, dated Aug 22, to ensure that the menace of stray dog attacks within institutional areas is curbed through effective preventive and administrative mechanisms. ""The primary objective is to safeguard the fundamental right to life and safety of citizens...while ensuring compliance with the principles embodied in the ABC Rules, framed under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,"" it said.It also directed chief secretaries of states and UTs to implement its direction and file status reports after eight weeks. The Animal Welfare Board has been directed to file a report on the nationwide status of sterilisation and vaccination drives as well as formulation of uniform standard operating procedures for prevention of dog-bite incidents. ""Any reported non-compliance of any of the above directions shall be viewed very seriously and may invite penalties/consequences including but not limited to the initiation of suo motu contempt proceedings against erring officials,"" the bench said.It said the administrative heads of these institutions shall through their respective local or municipal authorities, under the overall supervision of the district magistrate, ensure that premises are secured by fencing, boundary walls, gates and other such structures, or administrative measures as may be necessary to prevent the ingress of stray dogs.","India has one of the world's highest rabies-related mortality rates.

India inks $1 billion deal for 113 Tejas engines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-inks-1-billion-deal-for-113-tejas-engines/articleshow/125171071.cms,"HAL Celebrates Maiden Flight of the First Tejas Mk1A Fighter Jet Manufactured at its Nashik Facility

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: India on Friday inked an over $1 billion (Rs 8,900 crore) deal with US major General Electric (GE) for another 113 jet engines to power the much-delayed indigenous Tejas Mark-1A fighters, which may to some extent assuage the Trump administration amid the still raging tariff tensions between the two countries.The delivery of the 113 new GE-F404 engines to defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) will take place in the 2027-2032 timeframe, which will add to the ongoing but also delayed supply of 99 such engines ordered under a Rs 5,375 crore deal inked in Aug 2021.With the new engine deal being inked in Bengaluru, HAL chief D K Sunil exuded confidence about the delivery of single-engine Tejas Mark-1A fighters finally beginning to the IAF. “We have 11 Tejas aircraft ready, including four fitted with the new GE engines. We are moving towards certification, and the aim is to deliver the first 10 jets to IAF by the end of March next year,” he told TOI.While the delay in the supply of the initial 99 engines was one of major reasons that hit the Tejas Mark-1A production, the jets have also been hobbled by pending trials of Astra beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, the advanced short-range air-to-air missiles (ASRAAM) and laser-guided bombs as well as their integration with the Israeli-origin Elta ELM-2052 radar and fire control system.The IAF is keeping its fingers crossed. Down to just 29 fighter squadrons (each with 18 jets) when 42.5 are authorised, the force is banking upon the 180 `improved’ fourth-generation Tejas Mark-1A fighters to shore up its depleting numbers.Pakistan already has 25 fighter squadrons and is slated to get at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation Chinese stealth jets in the near future. China, in turn, has more than four times the number of fighters, bombers and force-multipliers as compared to India.The first contract for 83 Tejas Mark-1A fighters was inked in Feb 2021 for Rs 46,898 crore, while another 97 were ordered for Rs 66,500 crore on Sept 25 this year. Deliveries of the initial 83 jets, however, are yet to begin.“Engines have the most lead time. Keeping that in mind this time, we started negotiations for the 113 new engines with GE even before we inked the 97 Tejas contract with IAF. So, we were able to close this deal so early,” Sunil said.As for the Tejas weapon trials, the HAL chief said, “Results of the data from the trials involving Astra and ASRAAMs are being analysed. Next, during Nov and Dec, we plan to begin the bombing trials. If GE delivers 10 engines in time, we don’t see any reason for delay in handing over 10 aircraft to the IAF by the end of this fiscal.”At present, HAL has four of the initial 99 engines, with the fifth slated to come later this month. As the supply stabilises, GE has promised to deliver 20 engines every year.HAL, in turn, has stated it will scale up production to 20 Tejas per year, and then to 24-30 per year, with the third production line now fully functional in Nashik to add to the two existing ones at Bengaluru, apart from private sector supply chains.Parallelly, HAL is negotiating the co-production of the more powerful GE-F414 engines in the 98 Kilonewton thrust class in India, with 80% of transfer of technology for around $1.5 billion, for the Tejas Mark-2 fighter.“Six rounds of talks on the technical terms and conditions with GE have taken place till now, which will be followed by the commercial negotiations. HAL hopes to conclude all negotiations by March 2026,” a defence ministry official said.","The delivery of the 113 new GE-F404 engines to defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics will take place in the 2027-2032 timeframe. The first contract for 83 Tejas Mark-1A fighters was inked in Feb 2021 for Rs 46,898 crore, while another 97 were ordered for Rs 66,500 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125171093,imgsize-534524,width-400,resizemode-4/pic-60.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday said that no one can blame the pilot-in-command of the Air India Boeing Dreamliner that crashed moments after taking off in Ahmedabad and killing 260 people. The apex court told the 91-year-old father that his son, Sumeet Sabharwal, is not to be blamed and ""you should not carry the burden on yourself. ""The bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi, told the 91-year-old father, ""You should not carry burden on yourself. The pilot is not to be blamed for the plane crash. It was an accident. There is no insinuation against him even in the preliminary report.""It also issued a notice to Centre and directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) on the plea of the father of pilot Sumeet Sabharwal.The statement from SC came as it was hearing a petition by Pushkaraj Sabharwal, whose son Sumeet Sabharwal was the pilot-in-command of the Air India flight.The petitions were filed after aircraft accident investigation bureau (AAIB) in its preliminary report mentioned that the fuel supply to both engines was cut off shortly after takeoff.Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, who appeared for the pilot's father, highlighted a news article published in Wall Street Journal on Captain Sumeet Sabharwal.""It was nasty reporting only to blame India,"" the bench responded.The apex court read out a paragraph from the article that included the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board's July 12 preliminary report and asserted nowhere it is said that the pilot is to be blamed for the accident. It only refers to the conversation between the two pilots of the plane, the top court said.""The scope of the AAIB investigation is not to blame but to suggest preventive measures to avoid future tragedies. If necessary, we will clarify that the pilot cannot be blamed,"" the bench said.The Supreme Court listed the matter for further hearing on November 10.Last month, the father of Pushkaraj Sabharwal Federation of Indian Pilots filed a petition demanding for a court-monitored inquiry headed by a former apex court judge.The 91-year-old demanded a ""fair, transparent and technically robust"" investigation into the incident.""An incomplete and prejudiced inquiry, without identification of the exact cause of the accident, endangers the lives of future passengers and undermines aviation safety at large, causing a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution,"" his plea said.","Supreme Court says no one can blame the pilot-in-command of the Air India Boeing Dreamliner that crashed moments after taking off in Ahmedabad.

Accommodated request twice, AG not being fair to court: CJI





NEW DELHI: Unaffected by the rebuke from Supreme Court for seeking reference of petitions challenging the validity of the Tribunal Reforms Act to a five-judge bench half-way through the final hearing in the matter, attorney general R Venkataramani made a fresh request for adjournment on Thursday, upsetting CJI B R Gavai, who wondered why the top law officer wasn't being direct enough to seek adjournment of the hearing beyond Nov 24, when a new CJI assumes office.Venkataramani, who had already been granted two adjournments to enable him to participate in an international arbitration proceeding, through ASG Aishwarya Bhati, requested the bench to adjourn the hearing scheduled for Friday to Monday.The CJI, who on Nov 3 had refused to accept the Centre’s application seeking reference of the case to a five-judge bench and termed it as an attempt to drag the matter beyond his retirement date of Nov 23, told Bhati that the AG is “not being fair to the court” despite the bench, also including Justices K Vinod Chandran and Vipul Pancholi, accommodating his request for adjournment twice in the past.“If you want to have the hearing after Nov 24 (when Justice Surya Kant takes over as CJI), you should frankly say that,” the CJI said, adding that “every now and then it is told to us that the AG is busy with international arbitration and yet the Centre comes out with a midnight application seeking reference of the case midway through the final hearing to a five-judge bench.”“We have highest regard for the office of the highest law officer.But when we were practising in HCs, we used to give up cases if we were engaged in a part-heard matter before any bench to enable the HC to complete the hearing as scheduled,” CJI remarked. Though the CJI reluctantly agreed to adjourn the case to Monday, he pointed out that the bench needed enough time to write the judgment. The petitions before SC challenged the provisions of the Tribunal Reforms Act which put in place a uniform tenure of four years for the chairperson and members of different tribunals, even though SC had ruled that the tenure should be of five years.On Nov 3, the bench had said, “We did not expect the Union govt to indulge in such tactics. After we have heard the petitioners fully, the Union govt cannot be permitted to take the plea for reference to a larger bench.” However, it clarified that “if on consideration of the arguments, we arrive at a conclusion that the matter involves substantial questions of law requiring reference to a 5-J bench, we will do so”.","Attorney general R Venkataramani made a fresh request for adjournment on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Observing that sale or purchase of immovable property is a distressing and traumatic task fraught with risk of fraud as it is still regulated by colonial laws, Supreme Court on Friday said the time has come to reform the procedure to make it simpler, transparent and fraud free by use of technology and making property registration a conclusive proof of ownership.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi said property laws have long witnessed dichotomy between registration and ownership as registration does not confer ownership and this leads to massive litigation, which is 66 per cent of all civil disputes in the country. It said the problem could be addressed by achieving convergence of conclusive titling with registration, which is now possible due to technological advancement.Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Narasimha said more than a century has passed and the country must dare to think and look for alternatives. The efficiency and transparency with which immovable property is bought and sold is demonstrative of a nation’s institutional maturity and a testament of the confidence and trust its citizens repose in the integrity of its legal framework, he said. The judgement can be a turning point in bringing much needed reform in transaction of real estate propertiesSC passed the order while quashing the Bihar govt’s decision to make ‘jamabandi’ — holding allotment — of a land mandatory before its transfer or sale.The court appreciated the intention of the state to synchronise the registrable document with real-time land holding but said the process of mutation and the process of survey and settlement are nowhere near completion.“Under these circumstances and considering the nascent stage at which the empirical data is translated as mutation into the relevant records, and the fact that for this purpose survey and settlement are to be conducted, interlinking and restraining registration till jamabandi is effected would be illegal, as it has a direct impact on the right and freedom to purchase and sale property,"" the bench said.SC said the present legal framework for purchase and sale of immovable properties suffers from several systemic deficiencies that undermine reliability, transparency and efficiency. It asked the Centre and the Law Commission to examine use of technology such as Blockchain in sale or purchase of property as it would address the problems related to fake and fraudulent property documents, land encroachments, role of intermediaries etc.“Fortunately, due to technological advancement this process is duly and more accurately achievable. We have incorporated emerging technologies as instruments of institutional reform. Blockchain technology has garnered particular attention for its potential to transform land registration into a more secure, transparent and tamper-proof system,” the bench said.“It is suggested that adoption of the technology would ensure immutability, transparency and traceability, thereby minimising fraud and unauthorised alterations. The technology is said to offer an alternative paradigm by encoding land titles, ownership histories, encumbrances, and by recording transfers on a ‘Distributed Ledger’ in an immutable and time stamped form,” it said.SC said each entry, once validated into the ‘Distributed Ledger, becomes part of a cryptographically linked chain of information that cannot be retroactively altered without detection, and this cryptographic immutability could perhaps address the structural fragility of the Indian record keeping system. “The Blockchain design could integrate cadastral maps, survey data and revenue records into a single verifiable framework, which, while maintaining a transparent audit trail, is accessible to multiple departments and the public,” it said.","Supreme Court says time has come to reform the procedure to make it simpler, transparent and fraud free by use of technology. Justices P S Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi said property laws have long witnessed dichotomy between registration and ownership as registration does not confer ownership.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125167691,imgsize-530906,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"
'Up and functional': Airports Authority's update on technical glitch in Delhi; flight operations to be normal soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-300-flights-hit-technical-snag-triggers-chaos-at-delhi-airport-key-developments/articleshow/125157720.cms,"Massive ATC System Breakdown At Delhi Airport Disrupts Flights; Airlines Urge Patience And Care

What failed: AMSS breakdown and impact on flight-plan distribution

Scale of disruption: Number of flights delayed and average wait times

From automated to manual

Restoration efforts and status updates

Airlines update passenger advisories

The Airports Authority of India said that the air traffic control messaging system (AMSS) at Delhi airport was ""up and functional"", after a technical glitch disrupted over 800 flights. However, it said that due to ""some backlogs, there may be some delays in the normal functioning of automated operations"".""The AMSS systems are up and functional now. Due to some backlogs, there may be some delays in the normal functioning of automated operations, but the situation will be normal soon,"" it said in a post on X.Chaos erupted at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport on Friday after a glitch in the AMSS system caused over 800 flight delays, PTI reported citing sources. At least 20 flights have been cancelled, according to the report. The Mumbai airport also issued a statement announcing that its air traffic was impacted due to the malfunction.The glitch occurred in the AMSS system that prompted the ATC to abandon automation and switch to manual procedures. The slowdown began showing network-wide effects from Thursday afternoon.As India’s busiest hub, IGIA typically manages about 1,500 aircraft movements a day with peak rates near 60–70 per hour in normal conditions, leaving little slack when automation falters.The problem started at the Automatic Message Switching System, a system responsible for transferring the flight plan data to the air traffic controllers' screens, which crashed. This caused the controllers to process each data manually, significantly delaying the arrival and departure process. The disruption that began to impact the operations since Thursday 3pm, had been occurring since Wednesday evening.The technical failure has affected more than 100 flight operations as per PTI. The glitch has largely increased the wait times for all the passengers at the airport. The airport officials have assured the passengers that resolution efforts are under way.Air traffic control oversees aircraft movements in the sky and on the ground, keeping safe separation and efficient air traffic flow. The system that ingests flight plans, tracks positions, and streams real-time data to controllers’ consoles is automated. The Auto Track System presents this live picture to controllers for sequencing departures, arrivals, and taxi movements, while the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS) relays high-volume flight plans, weather, and operational notices between ATC and airlines each day.Since these automated layers went down with technical failures, controllers were forced to shift to manual methods—noting flight details by hand, calculating separation standards, and coordinating via voice circuits—which preserves safety but greatly reduces throughput and creates operational choke points compared with normal automated rates.Announcing the expected delays due to manual processing, Airport Authority of India shared a post on their X on Friday stating, ""Flight operations at Delhi Airport are experiencing delays due to a technical issue in the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS), which supports Air Traffic Control data. Controllers are processing flight plans manually, leading to some delays. Technical teams are working to restore the system at the earliest. ""Delhi Airport also shared the announcement on its Instagram. It assured the passengers of addressing the matter on a priority basis and asked them to stay in touch with their respective airlines for further advisories. ""We regret the disruption being experienced at IGIA due to a technical issue at ATC that is affecting flight operations. This matter is being addressed on priority with close coordination among ATC, DIAL, and other stakeholders. Passengers are requested to follow updates from their airlines regarding revised schedules. Thank you for your cooperation,"" it wrote.Following the disruptions, various airlines issued advisories for their respective flyers. IndiGo announced that the AMSS system is being resolved and shared a link for the passengers to check the latest flight status before flying. ""Customers with upcoming departures are advised to check the latest flight status before starting their journey and to arrive at the airport a little earlier than usual to allow additional time for travel formalities,"" IndiGo wrote.SpiceJet assured its flyers that, amidst the delay chaos, its ground staff is present at the airport to assist the passengers. ""Our crew and ground teams are assisting passengers and working closely with the authorities to minimise the impact and resume normal operations as soon as possible,"" they wrote further, asking the passengers to keep checking the flight status.Air India, while regretting for the delay, also asked the passengers to keep in touch with the updates about their flights so that they could efficiently manage their travel time. ""Our cabin crew and on-ground staff at the airport are extending immediate assistance to reduce passenger inconvenience,"" they wrote, ""We request you to check your flight status before heading to the airport.""Akasa Air announced the longer wait times at the airport for the passengers as the situation was beyond their control. ""This may lead to longer wait times at the airport and delays for some of our flights. While this situation is beyond our control, we sincerely regret the inconvenience to your travel plans and seek your understanding during these times,"" read its post on X.Air India Express also shared a notice asking for patience and advising passengers to check the flight status before heading to the airport. ""Our Cabin Crew and Airport Services teams are doing their best to assist you,"" the notice read, ""Before heading to the airport, please check your flight status.""The delays for departing flights, as reflected on Flightradar24.com, showed around 50 minutes from the Delhi airport.","A technical glitch at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport caused over 800 flight delays.

Sprinkling being done across city to suppress dust: Sirsa

NEW DELHI: As smog thickens in Delhi and people complain of burning eyes, scratchy throats and breathing problems, are the official air quality monitors accurately reflecting the capital's air quality? A ground check by TOI at several stations found glaring inconsistencies and questionable practices that may be influencing readings.At Anand Vihar - a pollution hot spot - the area around the monitoring unit was being repeatedly doused with water using high-pressure hoses. The practice, officials on site said, was part of routine dust suppression. Experts said such measures can distort readings.At Dilshad Garden, the AQI was in 'poor' zone but better than most other spots in the afternoon. The station is deep in a forested patch of a medical institute - covered by trees and away from the city dust and traffic.Similarly, the Mandir Marg station stood within a green belt and remained largely inaccessible, while at ITO, the monitor was located next to a regularly sprinkled stretch.At Lodhi Road, two stations barely a few blocks from each other, gave readings that differed by as much as 80 points at the same time.These observations raise serious questions over the credibility and representativeness of the capital's air quality network.Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa, however, defended the data. ""How would we suppress the dust? It's natural, through sprinkling. It is being done throughout the city, including around stations. We are successfully able to control pollution,"" he said. Experts, meanwhile, warned that excessive sprinkling near stations is ""unethical"" and could mislead both policymakers and the public.""These are state-of-the-art stations approved by all relevant agencies, designed to capture air quality over a two to three kilometre radius,"" said M P George, former additional director, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). ""They measure a well-mixed air package, so cleaning one small patch doesn't change the bigger picture."" He added that while there's no concrete study linking water sprinkling to altered AQI readings, such actions increase humidity and are more cosmetic than corrective. ""In fact, they can be counterproductive - higher humidity promotes secondary particulate formation. Sprinkling near monitors serves no scientific purpose.""Manoj Kumar from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) agreed that sprinkling may briefly lower particulate levels near sensors but said it doesn't change overall air quality. ""The worst pollution peaks occur in early morning and late evening, when sprinkling doesn't happen. So, while readings may look cleaner for a few hours, overall exposure remains hazardous,"" he said.Sunil Dahiya, founder of Envirocatalysts, said there was no evidence of post-collection data tampering but the choice of locations - often inside green or shielded areas - and nearby sprinkling clearly influence results. ""Such practices give a false sense of safety and prevent citizens, especially vulnerable groups, from taking precautions. They also distort forecasting and policy responses.""Environmental activist Bhavreen Kandhari went a step further, calling it a case of ""cleaning data, not air."" ""These sensors measure pollution through light scattering. When mist or water is sprayed nearby, it suppresses dust and alters humidity, creating an artificially 'clean' AQI that may appear 50-90% better for a few hours. It's detectable - sudden humidity spikes and abrupt PM2.5 drops are red flags. When this happens under official watch, it's data distortion, not management,"" she said.Lawyer and environmentalist Akash Vashishtha said air pollution control must be rooted in accuracy, not optics. ""Prevention, control and abatement can only work when data is truthful. Hiding reality doesn't bring relief - it delays real solutions. The govt must ensure monitors are placed in representative, high-footfall and industrial areas, not in pockets of greenery,"" he said.",A ground check by TOI at several stations found glaring inconsistencies and questionable practices that may be influencing readings.

KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress MP Kalyan Banerjee fell victim to cyber fraud , with around Rs 56 lakh siphoned off from his bank account using another 'dormant' account linked to him.The bank has filed a complaint with Kolkata Police's cybercrime unit, reports Dwaipayan Ghosh. Between 2001 and 2006, when Banerjee was the MLA from Asansol South, an account was opened in his name, along with other legislators, at a public sector bank's legislative assembly sub-branch, which is under the high court branch. All his allowances as an MLA were deposited into this account.Banerjee, who is now an MP from Serampore, stated that there were no transactions in this old account for a long time, rendering it a 'dormant' account. The fraudsters exploited this account for their scheme. Banerjee said the manager of the HC branch called him up on Thursday to inform him about the fraud.Police suspect that using the MP's photo and mobile number, Rs 56 lakh was transferred from his Kalighat branch account to the 'dormant' account, and subsequently, the entire amount was withdrawn. ""The fraudster forged a PAN and Aadhaar card by superimposing a different image on the apparently genuine documents.

Massive ATC System Breakdown At Delhi Airport Disrupts Flights; Airlines Urge Patience And Care

Flights & security nods managed manually; delays affect arrivals too





NEW DELHI: Delhi airport's aging air traffic control (ATC) software crashed Friday after a glitch the previous evening remained unresolved, delaying 800-odd departures and arrivals at India's busiest civil aviation facility by up to two hours. The ripple effect forced carriers to cancel around 100 flights across routes through the day.Airports Authority of India, accused of going slow on the software upgrade necessary for operations at the scale of Delhi airport, said late Friday that the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS) system was back to being fully functional. ""Due to some backlogs, there may be some delays in the normal functioning of automated operations, but the situation will be normal soon,"" it said.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation ordered a probe into the AMSS glitch. Officials ruled out the possibility of a cyber attack triggering the chaos. Several airlines warned that some of their flights scheduled for the weekend could feel the after-effect of Friday's mayhem.With aircraft unable to land on time in Delhi, operations were affected in many other airports, including Mumbai.AMSS is used by airlines to file flight plans 24 hours in advance for arrivals and departures from Delhi as well as for aircraft overflying Delhi airspace.With the automated system going on the blink, all flight plan information had to be fed manually into the database. A new Air Traffic Services Message Handling System (ATSMHS) is being installed.Delhi airport currently handles about 1,550 flights daily and hundreds of aircraft overfly Delhi airspace. Manual processing of data, which isn't immune to errors, takes four times longer. For the better part of Friday, tracking site Flightradar24 showed Delhi as the most disrupted airport in terms of delayed flights.AAI wrote on X Friday night that the AMSS issue was detected on Thursday. ""Immediately, a review meeting was conducted and necessary directions were given to address the issues. The original equipment manufacturer was engaged and additional staff deployed to manually process flight plans for ATC system to ensure uninterrupted and safe air traffic operations...We regret the inconvenience caused to airlines and passengers,"" it said.Amid the chaos, IndiGo advised passengers travelling to and from Delhi to check ""the latest flight status and arrive a little earlier than usual to allow additional time at the airport"". Air India warned of ""delays and longer wait times at the airport and onboard aircraft"". Representatives of multiple airlines said the Delhi AMSS system had a history of glitches.""We have been hearing about the new AHMS system, but it is taking too long to install. In India, we need to file flight plans with different flight information regions (FIRs) - Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai - according to the region where a flight is operating. There should be a central flight plan submission FIR. Also, the new software should have been installed five years ago,"" an official said.",Delhi airport's aging air traffic control (ATC) software crashed Friday after a glitch the previous evening remained unresolved.

Will coordinate with organisations & depts for shelter maintenance: MCD



NEW DELHI: Following the Supreme Court order on removal of strays from public spaces, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) said the primary responsibility for restricting their entry into such premises will rest with the heads of the institutions, reports Vibha Sharma.An MCD official said Supreme Court categorically instructed in-charges of these establishments to ensure fencing and prevent feeding or entry of stray dogs on the premises. ""In case strays are found, MCD will arrange for their immediate capture and transfer to shelters. A direction is expected soon from Delhi govt to all departments and institutions,"" the official added.The MCD currently operates 20 Animal Birth Control (ABC) centres through 13 NGOs, each deploying a vehicle per zone for catching stray dogs, in addition to the vehicles provided by the corporation itself. However, councillors have flagged that 2-3 centres, including those in Timarpur and Rohini, remain non-functional, increasing the workload on others. Officials said notice has been issued to the NGOs concerned to restart full-fledged operations or risk their sites being re-allotted to other agencies.Mayor Sardar Raja Iqbal Singh said, ""MCD will enhance coordination with animal welfare organisations and departments concerned to ensure the establishment and maintenance of shelters across the city.The goal is to keep Delhi a safe, compassionate, and well-organised city, where the welfare of both citizens and animals is ensured.""Residents, meanwhile, alleged that the Delhi govt has been ""merely filing affidavits and replies in court is happening on the ground"".Saurabh Gandhi, resident of Rana Pratap Bagh and general secretary of the United Residents of Delhi (URD), said, ""In our colony, 2 dogs dangerously attacked several elderly residents and children last month. We repeatedly complained to the MCD veterinary department to comply with the SC order. After much delay, they picked up an attacking dog on Oct 22 but released it back on Oct 29. Out of desperation, we have now filed an appeal in the Supreme Court. ""In line with earlier SC directions to establish designated feeding spots for stray dogs, MCD said it has identified 292 locations across 80 wards, where signboards are being installed. To accommodate aggressive or biting dogs, MCD's veterinary department has earmarked a 2.5-acre plot in Dwarka Sector 23 for constructing a dedicated shelter home. Although budgetary provisions were made, work has been pending for a long time. ""A meeting may soon be convened with the Commissioner to issue fresh directions to the engineering wing to accelerate the project,"" an official said.MCD has yet to release this year's budget for sterilisation and immunisation of stray dogs for the ongoing financial year (2025-26). The civic body reimburses NGOs and veterinary professionals Rs 1,000 per dog for sterilisation and vaccination, with payments released after a joint inspection team verifies the procedures - typically within 2-3 months.Former Union minister Vijay Goel welcomed the court's intervention as ""a step in the right direction"". ""When two foreign coaches were bitten by stray dogs at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, India's image was damaged. Stray dogs should be removed not only from public places but also from residential colonies, parks, tourist spots, airports, court premises, and other public areas. I appeal to dog lovers to adopt or feed them at shelter homes so that society remains both safe and sensitive,"" he said.","MCD says responsibility for restricting entry into such premises will rest with heads of institutions.

Delhi Smog Worsens Two Days After Diwali, AQI Hits Very Poor Levels

A 'mix' no one asked for

Borewells to plug gap

Hidden toll on health

Scores of plaints, one reply

NOIDA: Every winter, as toxic smog shrouds Delhi-NCR, air pollution dominates headlines and dinner-table conversations. Masks return, air purifiers hum and social media fills with outrage. But in Sector 7x, a cluster of 43 high-rise societies home to over one lakh residents, another crisis unfolds quietly, every day of the year. One that doesn't cloud the horizon, but flows from the tap.Residents say the high level of total dissolved solids (TDS)-a measure of soluble hydrogen carbonate ions, chloride salts, sulphates, magnesium, etc-in the tap water supplied by Noida Authority leaves skin dry and dull, damages appliances, causes stomach ailments and forces them to spend thousands of rupees on water cans and filters.Across multiple societies, water samples have shown TDS readings between 1,000 and 3,500 mg/L - and in at least one case, more than 6,500 mg/L. The safe and acceptable limit for drinking water, as set by the Bureau of Indian Standards, is 500 mg/L.""We talk about clean air every winter as if it's the only environmental crisis,"" Amit Gupta, a resident of Prateek Wisteria in Sector 77, said. ""For us, water is the bigger emergency.It has been for nearly a decade.""Sector 7x was marketed as a premium residential area with gleaming towers, landscaped parks and wide roads. Developers promised 24x7 Ganga water that draws from the Upper Ganga Canal. Residents say what they got instead is a concoction of groundwater blended with 30% Ganga water.""The groundwater here is naturally high in minerals. Combined with inadequate treatment, the result is hard, salty, undrinkable water. RO filters clog and turn black within one or two months, requiring frequent replacements. I end up spending Rs 4,000 to Rs 6,000 every year just to keep the RO systems functioning,"" VK Gupta of Supertech Capetown in Sector 74 said.RO-filtered bottled water costs Rs 30-Rs 90 for a 20-litre can. For large families, that adds up to several thousand rupees a month.Fed up with the apathy, Civitech Stadia (Sector 79) residents last month commissioned a private laboratory, Amlo Laboratories Pvt Ltd in Sector 10, to test the water. The report, dated Oct 27, found TDS was 6,538 mg/L, a level experts classify as unfit for drinking without industrial-grade purification.A similar test of water samples at Prateek Wisteria by Evergreen Enviro Testing LLP, based out of Surajpur Site B, in Aug recorded the TDS level at 1,711 mg/L.Each test report, shared with the Noida Authority and reviewed by TOI, tells a version of the same story: excessively hard water, above permissible limits, unsuitable even for daily chores.In an open letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Gupta argued that officials were deflecting blame by suggesting societies were choosing to use borewells over piped water supplied by Noida Authority. ""Why would anyone voluntarily use borewell water when it has such high TDS?"" he wrote. ""We don't choose it. We are forced into it.""Gupta claimed the Authority is mandated to supply Ganga water for six hours a day. ""Yet most societies receive three to four hours at best, which is inadequate to meet the needs of the families.""Low water pressure and supply shortage too leave several societies on the brink. At Antriksh Golf View 2 in Sector 78, residents say they have ordered 20-25 private tankers a day for nearly three months at a staggering expense. A single tanker of 20,000 litres costs between Rs 1,350 and Rs 2,000.""The dream of living in a high-rise comes with an asterisk here: buy your own water,"" Ranjan Samantaray of Antriksh told TOI.While the social media debates focus on particulate matter, doctors warn that prolonged consumption of high-TDS water can contribute to kidney strain, gastric irritation and mineral imbalance. Hard water can cause dry skin, dandruff and hair fall.Rajesh Yadav, a resident of Civitech Stadia, says complaints of stomach-related illnesses are routine. ""We use RO water even for cooking. We don't trust what comes from the tap,"" he said. ""People in Delhi-NCR worry about what they breathe. We also worry about what we drink.""Some have taken to posting photographs of brownish tap water on resident WhatsApp groups - water that stains clothes, scales geysers, corrodes bathroom fittings and clogs washing machines.""The symptoms of contaminated water show up at the dermatologist's clinic or kitchens lined with empty water cans. Hair fall is so common in these parts of the city. So many families have had to install water softeners for bathroom showers and kitchen sinks. My neighbour just spent Rs 7,000 on a new geyser as the old one leaked due to hardness,"" Bharat Bhushan of Sector 78 said.By residents' count, dozens of complaints have been filed on the CM portal, Noida Authority helpline and social media. RWAs have held protest meetings. But nothing has changed.RP Singh, general manager of Noida Authority water department, disputed the residents' claims. ""The TDS in our supplied water is within standard limits (of 500mg/L). But we will look into the matter,"" he said. Residents say they have heard this line before.","Sector 7x was marketed as a premium residential area with gleaming towers, landscaped parks and wide roads.

CJI questions renewal clause in tribunal law



NEW DELHI: Attorney general R Venkataramani apologised on Friday to Supreme Court following CJI B R Gavai deploring the Centre's plea for referring to a five-judge bench midway through hearing on challenges to the validity of the Tribunal Reforms Act and two days later excoriating a request for adjourning a scheduled hearing.Venkataramani appeared before the bench through video conference and said, ""I am tendering a volley of apologies for inconveniencing the court. I will appear before the bench in person on Monday and present my submissions on the validity of the Tribunal Reforms Act.""The AG said, ""I will explain why the government has taken a particular stand. However, the concerns raised by the petitioners who have challenged the validity of certain provisions can be taken into consideration and, if possible, ironing out of creases can be done. The Supreme Court can tell us the creases...""The bench of the CJI and Justice K Vinod Chandran said on Thursday itself it had told additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati that it would accommodate Attorney general R Venkataramani's request for absence on Friday and that he could present his arguments on Monday.""But, on Monday either you (the AG) leave international arbitration or entrust Bhati to argue the case,"" the chief justice said, clarifying that no further request for adjournment would be entertained.The tribunal reforms law prescribes uniform tenures of four years for the members and chairpersons of various tribunals, including NCLT, NCLAT, CAT, CESTAT, APTEL, TDSAT, ITAT, and DRT. One of the major grievances of the petitioners, as articulated by senior advocate Arvind Datar, was that because of the short tenure of appointments, the tribunals which discharge important adjudicatory functions do not attract youngsters and only retired persons apply for the posts.He said the promise of renewal of tenure would destroy the independence of tribunals and pleaded that a robust independent tribunal system is needed. CJI Gavai agreed with the view and asked, ""If the tribunal members and chairperson are dependent on the government for the renewal of their tenures, then would it not impinge upon the independence of judicial functions of the tribunals?""",Attorney general R Venkataramani apologised on Friday to Supreme Court.

NAGPUR: Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis will inaugurate Saturday a 100-bed women's and child hospital at Aheri in southern Gadchiroli, marking a major milestone in public health infrastructure for the tribal-dominated pocket that was once a Maoist stronghold.The inauguration of Women's Hospital and Newborn Baby Centre, built at a cost of Rs 83 crore, is aimed at strengthening maternal and child healthcare in one of the most remote regions of Maharashtra.The opening comes amid intensified crackdown that led to the surrender of several rebels, including that of Maoist top gun Mallojula Venugopal Rao alias Bhupathi along with several cadres in Gadchiroli.Collector Avishyant Panda said the hospital project represents a coordinated effort between the state govt and district administration. ""Civil construction was funded by the state govt, while the district administration financed the equipment and furniture,"" Panda said.The hospital will serve as a lifeline for five southern talukas of Gadchiroli - Aheri, Etapalli, Bhamragad, Sironcha, and Dhanora - where patients earlier had to travel long distances to Chandrapur or Nagpur for advanced maternity care.

Thousands have committed suicide. Aren't these individuals responsible for all of this, having promoted the betting demon that is tearing society apart?""Speak a few good words for the good of society and to help the youth reach higher positions.

.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said that a land deal involving his son Parth Pawar has been cancelled amid allegations of irregularities in the transaction.Addressing reporters after meeting chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, Pawar said his son and his business partner were unaware that the land in Pune, which their company had agreed to purchase, belonged to the government.“The concerned land is a government land which cannot be sold. Parth and his partner Digvijay Patil were not aware of this fact. How the registration (of its sale) was done and who is responsible will come out in the probe being headed by ACS Vikas Kharge, who will submit his report in a month,” he said.Pawar maintained that transparency and adherence to the law remain his top priorities.“I have never flouted any rules in my 35-year political career. If anyone from my family or anyone close to me does something wrong, I will never support it. I have gathered all information about the case and spoken to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. I told him he can order a probe.”He confirmed that the sale documents and related transactions “have been cancelled,” and that affidavits to this effect have been submitted to the registering authorities.“Not a rupee has changed hands in the deal,” he said.He added: "" I want to make it clear that neither I nor my office made any phone calls, gave any help, or had any role or knowledge about this transaction at any stage.""Pawar further said that he has directed all officials under him not to succumb to any pressure, even if someone uses his name to influence a decision.""There is no transaction in the related case as yet. FIR has also been registered in the said case. Who had put pressure on officers, who were involved, who had carried out the transaction, everything will be investigated,” he added.In a formal statement issued, Pawar clarified that the deal was only an agreement to purchase land and no payment had been made by Parth or his firm, Amadea Enterprises LLP.""My son Parth says that the proposed deal was within the ambit of the law and was completely above board. However, in public life, we must not allow even the suspicion of wrongdoing. Since allegations of wrongdoing have been made, he has agreed to cancel the deal. The required document for cancellation of the sale deed has already been submitted to the registering authority,” the statement read.He reiterated that neither he nor his office made any calls or provided assistance at any stage.“I have always worked within the limits of law and rules. Every decision I take is based on fairness and legality. These principles apply equally to everyone, including my family members,” Pawar added. He further emphasised that the NCP and its members hold themselves to “the highest standards of probity and accountability.”The controversy erupted after reports surfaced that a company linked to Parth Pawar had agreed to buy 40 acres of government land in Pune’s Mundhwa area, valued around Rs 1,800 crore for Rs 300 crore, allegedly bypassing due procedures and stamp duty.Following preliminary findings, the state government suspended a sub-registrar and registered an FIR against three individuals, including a company partner and a government official.CM Fadnavis said that the inquiry will determine whether any irregularities occurred. He further added that “strict action will be taken if wrongdoing is established.”Meanwhile, political reactions have intensified. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that government land reserved for Dalits had been sold “at a throwaway price” to a minister’s family member, calling it “land theft.” He also questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s silence on the issue.Pawar further said that an inquiry committee has been appointed to investigate the matter and urged anyone with relevant information or evidence to come forward and present it before the panel.“The government has appointed an inquiry committee to look into the matter. Anyone who has information or evidence should present it before the committee. The truth will emerge through this process, and if anyone is found responsible for any wrongdoing, action will be taken,” he said.","Ajit Pawar says land deal involving his son Parth Pawar has been cancelled amid allegations of irregularities in the transaction.

Bihar polls: Record voter turnout in Phase 1 triggers guessing game — will it help or hurt Nitish Kumar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-polls-record-voter-turnout-triggers-guessing-game-will-it-help-or-hurtnitishkumar-mahagathbandhan-nda-election-narendra-modi-tejashwi/articleshow/125165511.cms,"‘Do Not Like MLA, But…’: Gaya Voters Face ‘Nitish’ Dilemma, Reveal Bihar Poll Mood

What history tells about high voter turnout

What analysts feel

Is SIR responsible for high voter turnout?

NEW DELHI: High voter turnout in the first phase of polling in Bihar assembly elections on Thursday has raised many eyebrows, curiously wondering whether it will favour the Nitish Kumar-led incumbent government or is it a sign of aggressive anti-incumbency voting.For 121 assembly seats, Bihar recorded 64.66 per cent voter turnout, which was an 8.5 per cent jump from the 2020 assembly elections. The enthusiastic voting has led both alliances - NDA and the Mahagathbandhan - interpreting the surge to their advantage.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday asserted that the record turnout in the first phase of Bihar assembly polls was proof that people have reposed their trust in the ""track record of Narendra and Nitish"".""Yesterday, the voters of Bihar broke all records. Never before in the history of the state has there been such a high poll percentage. Much of the credit goes to mothers and sisters, the Maatri Shakti (mother power), who turned up in large numbers to raise the turnout to nearly 65 per cent. It is evident that they all have trust in the track record of Narendra-Nitish,"" PM Modi said. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, the INDIA bloc's chief ministerial candidate, said, ""I salute the people of Bihar for the bumper voting.I can now confidently say you have affirmed the victory of 'Mahagathbandhan'.""Jan Suraaj founder Prashant Kishor also hailed voter turnout and claimed it to be a sign of the people's yearning for a change. ""After November 14, when votes will be counted, Bihar will have a new regime.""Rashtriya Janata Dal feels that the high voter turnout is a confirmation to Tejashwi Yadav's bet to the chief ministerial post.Riding on the anti-incumbency wave, RJD scion's 's campaign revolving around the promise of Ek Parivar, Ek Naukri; MAA Yojana; free electricity up to 200 units; farm loan waivers; expanded scholarships; and a return to the old pension system. His last moment effort to roll out Rs 30,000 to women on Makar Sankranti is also seen as a counter to NDA.After the first phase of the elections, Tejashwi claimed that the people of Bihar have voted for change.“Today, Bihar has voted for change in the first phase. Every citizen has stepped out to end the 20 years of darkness and lit the flame of transformation, bringing a wave of happiness, prosperity, and peace across the state,"" Tejashwi said.RJD supremo patriarch Lalu Prasad Yadav drew a parallel between politics and roti while advocating for a regime change in Bihar.""We must keep flipping the roti when it is on the hot tawa, otherwise it will get burnt. Twenty years is enough. A Tejashwi (Yadav) led government is important for a new Bihar,"" he said, sharing a photo with son Tejashwi and wife and former Chief Minister Rabri Devi. The veteran leader and his family cast their votes at a polling booth in Patna.Historically, high voter turnout is a sign of regime change in Bihar. People have traditionally lined up in polling booths when they desire for change.In 1980, the voter turnout surged almost 7 per cent in favour of Congress after a three-year rule of Karpoori Thakur-led Janata Party government and a president's rule.In 1990, voter turnout rose from 56.3 per cent to 62 per cent — a 5.8 per cent increase that saw the ousting of Jagannath Mishra-led Congress government and Lalu Prasad Yadav from Janata Dal took oath as chief minister.However, in 2005, turnout dropped by 16%, yet it again brought a change of guard, with JD(U)’s Nitish Kumar taking office for the first time.In 2010, voter turnout rose from 46.5 per cent to 52.7 per cent, giving Nitish Kumar another chance as chief minister due to his promising work earning him the name of ""Sushashan Babu.""Political analyst Kumar Vijay feels that the cash rollouts and social security schemes announced by Nitish, just ahead of the elections, might have worked in favour of NDA in the first phase of polls. He, however, said that votes ""will translate more in favour for JD(U) within the NDA"" -- which seemed to lag behind ahead of the elections.""Women voter turnout in the first phase of the elections was very encouraging. It seems that Mukhya Mantri Mahila Rojgaar Yojana, which gave Rs 10,000 to the bank accounts of 75 lakh women, free electricity upto 125 units and increased pension to Rs 1,100 may have worked out for the incumbent government,"" Kumar Vijay said while talking to The Times of India.""Even after 20 years of Nitish Kumar's rule, surprisingly, anti-incumbency was not visible,"" he added.He further said that Mahagathbandhan's rozgaar promise may not have worked in the first phase of the elections.""Employment pitch by Tejashwi does not seem to impress voters. RJD's promise to transfer Rs 30,000 under Mai Bhain Yojana till January 14 also did not work as it was only a promise, while NDA government had already transferred Rs 10,000,"" he said.Meanwhile, Kumar Vijay said that migrants labpureres in north Bihar, who returned home for Chhath festivities and have not yet gone back to their places of work, are the ""X factor"" in the assembly polls and may incline more towards Prashant Kishore's Jan Suraaj.""Jan Suraaj made migration a huge issue in the run up to the elections. Migrant laboureres in north Bihar, who returned home for Chhath festivities and have not yet gone back to their places of work, are the 'X factor' in the assembly polls and may incline more towards Prashant Kishore's Jan Suraaj.""Months before the assembly elections, the Election Commission conducted a voter list purification drive - Special Intensive Revision - which led to a significant correction in the state’s electoral roll.Following SIR, the final list included 7.42 crore eligible voters — 18 lakh more than the 7.24 crore names in the draft roll, but 47 lakh fewer than the 7.89 crore names recorded before the revision exercise.In the Magadh region, the voter base grew by an average of 2.6 per cent, with Patna district registering the highest increase at 3.4 per cent, adding around 1.6 lakh new voters to the rolls. This might be the responsible for the higher voter turnout.In the 2020 Bihar assembly elections, the battle across these 121 seats turned out to be one of the most tightly contested phases. The Mahagathbandhan — comprising the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress, and Left parties — managed to secure a slender edge by winning 61 constituencies. The ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the BJP and JD(U), was close behind with 59 seats.Now, the second phase of assembly polls will be held on November 11, and the votes will be counted on November 14.While the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), comprising of BJP, JD(U), HAMS, LJP (RV), and others, is looking to retain power for a second term, the Mahagathbandhan, comprising Congress, RJD, left parties, and VIP, is looking to get back to power. Jan Suraaj party has also made a debut in the electoral fray, contesting in more than 200 seats on its own.In the 2020 assembly election, NDA won 125 seats, while the Mahagathbandhan secured 110 seats. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) emerged as the single largest party with 75 seats, followed closely by BJP with 74 and JD(U) with 43.","For 121 assembly seats, Bihar recorded 64.66 per cent voter turnout, which was an 8.5 per cent jump from the 2020 assembly elections. The enthusiastic voting has led both alliances - NDA and the Mahagathbandhan - interpreting the surge to their advantage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125165546,imgsize-1355521,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well” Facebook-parent Meta made a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup in June. The move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability.

Delhi airport flight delay: What has caused the technical glitch affecting hundreds of flights across India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/delhi-airport-flight-delay-what-has-caused-the-technical-glitch-affecting-hundreds-of-flights-across-india/articleshow/125150625.cms,"Massive ATC System Breakdown At Delhi Airport Disrupts Flights; Airlines Urge Patience And Care

What caused the ATC glitch at Delhi airport

How air traffic control systems work

Why delays spread beyond Delhi

What passengers experienced

What this reveals about aviation infrastructure





Hundreds of flights were delayed at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport this morning after a technical failure in the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system forced controllers to manually process every departure and arrival. The breakdown, which began Thursday evening, disrupted operations at India's busiest airport and caused cascading delays across several other key airports.Controllers lost access to automated flight plan data when the Automatic Message Switching System (AMSS) crashed, slowing operations to a crawl at an airport that typically handles over 1,500 flight movements daily. Airlines including IndiGo , Air India, SpiceJet, and Akasa Air warned passengers of extended delays, with some departures held up for over 53 minutes by mid-morning Friday.The Airports Authority of India said technical teams were working to restore the system but provided no timeline for when normal operations would resume.The problem originated in the Automatic Message Switching System, which automatically transmits flight plan data to air traffic controllers' screens. When AMSS failed Thursday at 3 PM, controllers could no longer receive this information automatically and had to manually compile flight plans using available data.This manual process is significantly slower than automated systems, reducing the number of flights that can be processed per hour. ""Such a glitch is uncommon and has not happened earlier,"" one official familiar with the situation said. ""Since each task before a flight departure is being done manually, there is chaos at Delhi ATC currently.""The system had been experiencing issues since Wednesday evening, according to sources, but the full impact became apparent Thursday afternoon when the automated messaging system went down completely.Air traffic control manages the movement of aircraft both in the air and on the ground, ensuring safe distances between planes while maintaining efficient traffic flow. Modern ATC relies heavily on automated systems that process flight plans, track aircraft positions, and provide real-time data to controllers.The Auto Track System displays this information on controllers' screens, allowing them to coordinate takeoffs, landings, and aircraft movements. AMSS serves as the communication link between ATC and airlines, transmitting thousands of messages daily about flight plans, weather updates, and operational changes.When automation fails, controllers must revert to manual procedures—writing down flight details, calculating separations, and coordinating through voice communication. While these backup procedures maintain safety, they cannot match the speed of automated systems, creating bottlenecks that slow operations significantly.The disruption at Delhi had far-reaching effects. As a major connecting hub for North India, delays here affect the entire regional network. Aircraft scheduled to fly onward from Delhi were grounded. Planes meant to arrive and depart again sat waiting. Crew duty time limits were affected, and passengers missed connections.Flight tracking data showed 513 delayed flights on Thursday and 171 more by Friday morning. Each delay compounded the next as aircraft queued for manual clearances that normally happen automatically within seconds.The manual processing created congestion both on the ground and in the airspace, as controllers could only handle a fraction of their usual workload. Airlines faced operational challenges largely beyond their control, with ground teams attempting to manage passenger concerns while waiting for the technical issue to be resolved.Passengers reported confusion and frustration as delays mounted without clear information about when flights would depart. Many waited both at gates and inside aircraft that had already boarded.IndiGo initially posted a detailed explanation on social media describing the AMSS outage as ""the backbone of pre-flight and in-flight communication between ATC and airlines."" The airline later deleted the post but continued to advise passengers to check its website for updates on their flights.Air India issued a travel advisory stating that the ""technical issue with the ATC system in Delhi is impacting flight operations across all airlines"" and was ""beyond our control."" The airline said cabin crew and ground staff were providing assistance to reduce inconvenience.One reporter on an IndiGo flight said the captain announced that ""all aircraft are delayed"" and that ""ATC systems are down,"" affecting all Delhi departures with no update on how long repairs would take.The incident highlights the aviation industry's heavy reliance on automated systems. AMSS is not cutting-edge technology but essential infrastructure that operates invisibly until it fails. When it does, the impact is immediate and widespread.While backup procedures exist to maintain safety, they cannot replicate the efficiency of automated systems. The scale and complexity of modern air traffic make manual operations a necessary fallback but an inadequate substitute for normal operations.This wasn't the first major disruption at Indian airports this week. On Thursday, Air India and several other carriers experienced delays due to a third-party connectivity network outage that affected check","Hundreds of flights were delayed at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport.

US Shutdown Triggers Massive Political War, Trump Mulls Mass Layoffs; Dems Call Move 'Dirty Trick'





Online job search platform Indeed is reportedly eliminating a very small number of roles, Business Insider reports. The latest job cuts come four months after the company announced to lay off over 100 employees in July earlier this year. The BI report quotes a statement from Indeed where it says “To better align our team structure with business priorities, we've reorganized several functions and made the difficult decision to eliminate a very small number of roles”.However, no details about the roles impacted are known yet.As part of an ongoing restructuring effort by its parent company – Japan’s Recruit Holdings, Indeed has reduced its global workforce to around 11,000 employees. As mentioned above, in July, Indeed and its sister company Glassdoor together laid off about 1,300 employees. The cuts then mainly affected the US-based teams working in research, people operations, and sustainability.In an internal email to staff at the time, Recruit Holdings and Indeed CEO Hisayuki “Deko” Idekoba said, “AI is changing the world” and stressed the need for the company to evolve quickly. “Delivering on this ambition requires us to move faster, try new things, and fix what's broken,” Idekoba wrote. “To achieve our company priorities, it requires creating a structure and culture to support them.”This marks the second round of layoffs at Indeed in two years. In May 2024, the company had already let go of around 1,000 employees, or about 8% of its workforce at the time.","Online job search platform Indeed is reportedly eliminating a very small number of roles.

Triumph of surgery: Delhi doctors save boy with rare artery disease after years of heart failure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/triumph-of-surgery-delhi-doctors-save-boy-with-rare-artery-disease-after-years-of-heart-failure/articleshow/125178115.cms,"



NEW DELHI: For nearly four years, a 12-year-old boy from Vrindavan lived on the edge — his heart was failing, his kidneys were starved of blood, and he could barely breathe or sleep lying down. Once a cheerful child who studied up to Class 3, he had to drop out of school as his health steadily worsened. Multiple hospitals refused to operate, calling his case too risky. But in a remarkable medical turnaround, doctors at a private Delhi hospital not only saved his life but restored him to normalcy — and back to school.The boy was suffering from Juvenile Takayasu Arteritis, a rare, life-threatening inflammatory disease that affects the aorta — the body’s main artery — and its branches. The condition caused severe heart failure and uncontrolled hypertension, cutting off blood supply to vital organs. By the time he arrived at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital on July 31, 2025, his heart function had dropped to just 15%, and both renal arteries were nearly blocked.“He was in an extremely critical state,” said Dr N. N. Khanna, Advisor to Apollo Group of Hospitals and Senior Consultant, Interventional Cardiology & Vascular Interventions, who led the case.“His abdominal aorta was severely narrowed, both kidneys were at risk of failure, and his heart could not pump enough blood to sustain the body. Surgical correction carried an unacceptably high risk.”Faced with this challenge, the Apollo team — comprising interventional cardiologists, transplant surgeons, nephrologists, rheumatologists, and critical care specialists — chose an unconventional path. Instead of open-heart surgery, they performed a high-risk, minimally invasive, catheter-based procedure to restore blood flow.Using advanced intravascular imaging and precision-guided stents, the doctors reopened the blocked aorta and renal arteries, easing pressure on the heart and improving kidney circulation. “Within 24 hours, his breathing normalised, oxygen support was withdrawn, and for the first time in four years, he could lie down and sleep peacefully,” said Dr Khanna.Over the next few days, his swelling subsided, energy returned, and his blood pressure stabilised. At follow-up, doctors confirmed that his heart function had significantly improved and kidney perfusion was normal.Takayasu Arteritis — often called the “pulseless disease” — causes inflammation and narrowing of major arteries, sometimes leading to stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. It is exceedingly rare in children and often diagnosed late, as its symptoms — fatigue, breathlessness, and high blood pressure — mimic other conditions. Without timely treatment, it can cause irreversible organ damage or death.“The goal was not just survival but to give him a normal life — and that’s what we achieved,” said Dr Khanna.Today, the young survivor from Vrindavan — once too weak to walk or play — attends school again, laughs easily, and dreams of a future that once seemed out of reach.","The boy was suffering from Juvenile Takayasu Arteritis, a rare, life-threatening inflammatory disease that affects the body's main artery.

The Nasdaq Composite ended slightly lower on Friday but posted its sharpest weekly loss since early April, as investors questioned how long the artificial intelligence boom could sustain recent market highs.The index slipped 0.21% to 23,004.54, bringing its total weekly fall to around 3%, while chipmakers and technology shares led the declines.Despite this pullback, the Nasdaq has surged more than 50% since April, when US President Donald Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs, with AI optimism lifting markets to record levels.However, sentiment cooled this week after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was quoted by The Financial Times as saying that China may surpass the US in the AI race.“We’re seeing this AI selloff continue after the comments we had about China winning the AI race,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut, as per news agency Reuters.He added that the sector’s weakness reflected “a recalibration of multiples” and some investors taking profits after a strong run.The S&P 500 rose 0.13% to 6,728.81, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.16% to 46,987.10, both rebounding late in the session after reports suggested progress in ending the longest federal government shutdown in US history.The global equities index MSCI (.MIWD00000PUS) slipped 0.07%, and the STOXX 600 in Europe lost 0.55%, as weak trade data from China renewed worries over slowing global growth.Chinese exports fell 1.1% in October, the steepest decline since February, underscoring the damage from Trump’s tariffs and denting investor confidence across Asia.In the bond market, US treasury yields edged down after surveys pointed to worsening consumer sentiment.The University of Michigan’s preliminary index for November dropped to 50.3, the lowest since June 2022, driven by record-low views of current economic conditions amid concerns over the shutdown.The 10-year Treasury yield eased slightly to 4.091%.The US dollar weakened against major currencies, with the dollar index slipping 0.11% to 99.57.The euro firmed to $1.1563, while the yen weakened to 153.45 per dollar.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
