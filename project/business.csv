"In global election season, AI avatars & deepfakes in the fray",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-global-election-season-ai-avatars-deepfakes-in-the-fray/articleshow/110131731.cms,"First major ethical test

Boosting transparency

Much like it took Imran Khan to win a Cricket World Cup for Pakistan, it took this allrounder-politician to sensitise the world on how AI could influence elections. Imprisoned by Pakistani govt, he was not allowed to physically campaign across the country in the general elections in early 2024. However, much to the delight of his supporters and angst for the opposition, Khan started to appear across the country, addressing rallies, exhorting voters and declaiming against the govt.The election resulted in massive wins for independent candidates backed by him, turning the electoral results on their head. The twist in the tale: while Khan was firmly confined behind bars, it was his AI avatar which was roaming the country, canvassing for the candidates!2024 is the year of democracy around the world, with elections in India, US, Indonesia and many other countries. It also promises to be the year when AI will experience its first major ethical test – on whether AI, including the deepfakes it helps generate, can help democracy or help subvert it. While deepfakes existed before GenAI, products like Sora and Stable Diffusion have democratised the production of deepfakes, making them easier, faster and cheaper to make at scale.We are also at peak social media , with TikTok, WhatsApp and the like making global distribution of deepfakes a piece of cake. Case in point – Bangladesh, where an opposition leader was shown to be lax about his support for Palestinians – a disastrous position to take in the country. A fake voice of Biden urged people not to vote in the US primaries.Deepfakes, born of an AI technology called generative adversarial networks (GANs) are not new; since 2013 they have been overwhelmingly abused for revenge and celebrity porn. However, of late, the world has discovered a new use case: subverting democracy. In India, we have already seen instances of this happening in the ongoing elections – fake videos of the home minister, deceased politicians rising from their graves, Bollywood stars ‘criticising’ the prime minister.Many elections are fought on emotive grounds, and such fake discourses and narratives can heavily influence voting. While authorities are alive to this threat and have banned the same, I believe that we need much stronger legal remedies, a crackdown on social media spreading these, and a well-articulated educational campaign for the electorate to detect what is genuine and what is fake.There is a silver lining to this worrisome cloud, however, with AI also having the promise to boost transparency, inclusivity, and efficiency in polls. AI can monitor and analyse data real-time, identifying irregularities indicating fraudulent activity. AI can improve the security of electronic voting systems, and threat detection algorithms can identify and thwart potential cyber threats . GenAI can help educate and sensitise voters through hyper-personalised and hyper-local content on candidates and manifestoes in their local dialect at scale with much lower costs, thus empowering even the less moneyed candidates.AI as a technology is twofaced: it has huge promise, but also immense destructive power. We need to take the good and minimise the bad for humans and our democracy to thrive in the upcoming age of AI. Jaspreet Bindra has worked at Microsoft, Tata Group, and Mahindra Group. He is an AI expert and adviser, and recently did a Masters in AI & Ethics from Cambridge University","2024 is the year of democracy around the world, with elections in India, US, Indonesia and many other countries. It also promises to be the year when AI will experience its first major ethical test – on whether AI, including the deepfakes it helps generate, can help democracy or help subvert it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110131768,imgsize-1309791,width-400,resizemode-4/110131768.jpg"

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: In an unusually frank reaction, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday said that many nations in the West want to ""influence India because many of these countries feel that they have influenced this world for the last 70-80 years"".Speaking at an event organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the EAM said there are western countries that ""actually feel that they influenced the world for the last 200 years, how do you expect someone who's been in that position to give up those old habits so easily?""The minister was responding to a question on allegations made against India by Canada and the US of poll interference, and conducting operations on foreign soil.Jaishankar said these countries ""are seeing an India which is not in a sense compliant with their image of how India should be"".""Western media in some cases have openly endorsed candidates and political parties, they don't hide their preference ... they will reputationally damage you, somebody will bring out an index and put you down in that ... they want a certain class of people really to rule India. And I think they are disturbed when the Indian population feels otherwise,"" he said.""Countries which have to go to court to decide the result of their election are giving us lectures about how to conduct the election,"" the minister added, to a round of applause. Jaishankar was making a veiled reference to the ongoing legal battle by Donald Trump to overturn the 2020 election results, which he lost to Joe Biden.The EAM also spoke about the prevailing tense situation in PoK where there has been sporadic violence and civil unrest.""Today, there are certain ferments happening in PoK ... the analysis of it is very complex but definitely I have no doubt in my own mind that someone living in PoK is comparing their situation with someone living in J&K and saying how people there are progressing nowadays. They know the sense of being under occupation or being discriminated badly...it (PoK) has always been India and it will always be India,"" he said.The minister added that till Article 370 was invoked, there wasn't much discussion about PoK.""In 1990's, some pressure was put on us by Western countries and then at that time Parliament unanimously passed a resolution on PoK, after public interest in this country receded ... When we actually moved on Article 370 and finally put an end to what was a temporary provision of the Constitution, which should never have continued for that long and which was in a way fueling the separatism, violence and terrorism,"" said Jaishankar.On the topic of China and rising border tensions, Jaishankar said the deployment of forces at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China is ""abnormal"" and the security of the country should not be disregarded.""After 1962, Rajiv Gandhi went to China in 1988 in many ways that were the key step towards normalising the ties (with China) ... there was a clear understanding that we will discuss our boundary differences but we will maintain peace and tranquillity on the border. And the rest of the relationship will carry on,"" the minister said.Since then, it has been the basis of the relationship with China, he said.""What changed now is what happened in 2020. In 2020, the Chinese, in violation of multiple agreements, brought a large number of forces to our border and they did it at the time when we were under COVID lockdown,"" he said.Jaishankar said ""India responded by counter deployment of forces"" and for four years now, forces have been deployed ahead of the normal base positions at Galwan.""This is a very abnormal deployment along the LAC. Given the tension between the two countries... As Indian citizens, none of us should disregard the security of the country...it is today a challenge,"" he said."," external affairs minister S Jaishankar said many nations in the West want to ""influence India"" He was responding to a question on allegations made against India by Canada and the US of poll interference, and conducting operations on foreign soil.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAMAmrita (25) never thought that she would find herself in a quandary at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport on May 8 after hospital authorities in Oman asked her to quickly take a flight to see her critically-ill husband one last time. Now, the woman from Karamana in Thiruvananthapuram is grappling with a tragedy due to the unexpected strike by Air India Express employees.The cancellation of flights stopped her emergency travel to Oman and her husband Nambi Rajesh (40), an IT project manager based in Muscat, succumbed to his illness on Monday. The undeclared strike by Air India Express employees last Wednesday left numerous passengers, including Amrita, stranded. She shared her plight with the media. Despite her desperate pleas to company representatives at the airport, no one came to her aid so that she could see her husband one last time.Amrita's mother, Chitra, recounted with teary eyes how her daughter begged them repeatedly, in vain. Chitra expressed her frustration and disappointment saying airline officials were unsympathetic. ""Because of their strike, my daughter could not see her husband. This is outrageous. We lost our sole breadwinner,"" she told TOI.Amrita is a BSc nursing student and mother of two children, aged five and three. The family is uncertain about their future in the wake of this tragedy. Chitra said they intend to take legal action against the airline and seek compensation for their loss.Earlier, Amrita's family had immediately booked tickets for her on an Air India Express flight on May 8. But flight cancellations thwarted her trip. Despite being notified of her scheduled departure on May 9, she was unable to travel due to the unavailability of flights on that day.Subsequently, she encountered difficulties in securing tickets on another flight as the ticket fare was not refunded. Rajesh's health deteriorated again on Monday and he died at the hospital.Chitra said Rajesh's mortal remains will be brought home on Wednesday. The family will decide on his last rites after Amrita's sister, who is pursuing medical education in Georgia, returns. ""The funeral may be held at the crematorium in Karamana day after tomorrow,"" she added.Meanwhile, the airline informed the family that ticket fare could be refunded. But the family made it clear that the airline is responsible for Amrita's current situation and they will file a case against the firm.","Amrita (25) never thought that she would find herself in a quandary at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport.

Indian Astronaut: Indian astronaut set to reach space station this year: US envoy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-astronaut-set-to-reach-space-station-this-year-us-envoy/articleshow/110127939.cms,"NEW DELHI: An Indian astronaut is likely to reach the International Space Station (ISS) on an American mission this year, US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said on Monday. The US diplomat also said the joint Indo-US satellite NISAR , considered to be the world’s most expensive satellite, will also be launched by year-end.Garcetti said the Indian govt has also suggested the name of the astronaut who will fly to the ISS.He, however, did not reveal the name, telling a news channel that the “Indian government has indicated who that astronaut is. I’ll let them, you know, announce that at the proper time”. Nasa administrator Bill Nelson, during his visit to India last year, had also indicated about the US helping train and send an Indian astronaut to the ISS by the end of 2024. “The selection of the astronaut will be done bu Isro. Nasa won’t be a part of it. Details of the mission are being worked out by Isro,” Nelson had said.Since its first modules launched at the end of 1998, ISS has been orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 400 km. Five space agencies of the US, Russia, European countries, Canada and Japan have collaborated on the development and operations of the ISS, and astronauts from 18 countries have gone to the space station till now. It will be a big opportunity for an Indian astronaut to visit the ISS as the space station is going to be retired by 2030, when Nasa plans to crash it into the ocean.In a video post, Garcetti, who completed his one year as the US ambassador to India, said, “From the seabed to the stars, the US-India relationship is reaching new heights, including all the way to space where this past year we made huge strides in NISAR (NASA-ISRO SAR mission), the first satellite that Nasa and Isro are making together. It will blast off later this year so that you know, babies like Teigen (giving an example) will enjoy a future... and will be happy one day when we put him in space.”India and the US have been working on the development of the world’s most expensive earth imaging satellite NISAR since 2014.The total cost of the satellite project is $1.5 billion, which comes to around Rs 12,500 crore in Indian currency. NISAR will use its advanced radar imaging technology to map the elevation and movement of Earth’s land masses and ice sheets four to six times a month, at a resolution of 5-10 metres. The main aim of the satellite is to observe the most complex natural processes of the planet, including ecosystem disturbances, ice-sheet collapse, as well as earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides.","An Indian astronaut is likely to reach the International Space Station (ISS) on an American mission this year, US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti said on Monday.

"Billboard collapse: Authorities in blame game; GRP gave nod without checks, BMC mum for 2 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/billboard-collapse-authorities-in-blame-game-grp-gave-nod-without-checks-bmc-mum-for-2-years/articleshow/110128972.cms,"Massive Dust Storm, Rain Hit Mumbai, 35 Injured, 100 Trapped As Iron Hoarding Falls On Petrol Pump

MUMBAI: After the horrific gigantic hoarding crash in Ghatkopar claimed 14 lives, questions are being raised as to where the buck stops. Mumbaikars are bewildered by the collective negligence of govt authorities that allowed this mishap to occur.GRP granted permission to the agency to erect this billboard on its land without ascertaining if it was following civic guidelines on size and dimension - BMC turned a blind eye during its construction, then served notice last week, a full two years later - by which time Monday's disaster was in the making.On Tuesday, GRP said it had started the process of removing the hoarding after BMC's May 2 letter, but the collapse occurred before it could be completed.On May 2, the N ward office had written to GRP, asking it to revoke permission given to the advertising agency, Ego Media Pvt Ltd, and remove all its hoardings. The missive arose from a complaint by former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya in April about Ego Media's involvement in cutting and poisoning trees that used to block its hoardings.""Permission was given to Ego Media to erect hoardings under then GRP commissioner Quaiser Khalid for 10 years on rental basis,"" GRP said. Four hoardings and the BPCL petrol pump (on which the hoarding collapsed) are managed by the Railway Police Welfare Fund Association.Ghatkopar resident Salim Pathan told TOI that in Aug 2023, he submitted written complaints to BMC and GRP about the danger posed by illegal hoardings. GRP denied receiving a complaint. While BMC allows a hoarding size of maximum 40x40sqft, the collapsed hoarding measured 120x120sqft. ""But, BMC made no mention in its letter that the dimension was an issue,"" said a GRP officer.Sources in GRP said the hoardings were certified as ""structurally safe and stable"" by a structural consultant in April 2023. The hoarding that crashed had even made it to the record books for being the largest in Asia.RTI activist Anil Galgali said GRP was equally responsible for the tragedy, and police and the state govt must take action against errant officers. DG (railway police) Dr Pradnya Sarvade will be filing a report before the state about the incident. After Monday's crash, the District Disaster Management Authority wrote to GRP, asking them to immediately remove the other three hoardings in the area.The rule book does affix accountability. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare said if GRP has possession of the land, it would be state land and BMC permissions would be applicable. So, the civic body was right in issuing a notice to GRP to remove it. Sections 328 and 328A of the BMC Act deal with civic permissions for hoardings to exhibit advertisements on premises other than one's business premises. The conditions ""require NOCs from the landlord or cooperative housing society, from the police commissioner (traffic) in case of illuminated hoardings, from the civil aviation dept if the hoarding is in funnel area, the Mumbai heritage committee if in heritage buildings or precincts, from MCZMA if in CRZ areas, structural design and stability certificate from a licensed engineer, a certificate under Shops and Establishments Act"".On March 1, 2018, Bombay HC had held that even for a hoarding to be erected on Airports Authority of India land in Juhu, the advertising agency had to get permission from BMC as the competent authority.In its defence now, BMC claims that it was hamstrung by the fact that to avoid payment of licence fee and seek licence from it, railway police had in July 2021 said GRP falls within the definition of railways. It claimed ward officials had been ""pursuing the matter"" with GRP. On May 13, the day of the tragedy, the N ward officer wrote a letter to the agency, saying the hoarding had been erected without permission since April 2022, adding that it owed BMC over Rs 6 crore. It instructed the agency to remove its eight hoardings in the area within 10 days.Meanwhile, Thane Congress prez Vikrant Chavan alleged an unholy nexus between the administration and political leaders of being partners in advertising agencies that install massive hoardings. BJP MLA Sanjay Kelkar demanded action against errant officials who permit such structures.(With inputs by Manoj Badgeri)",Mumbaikars are bewildered by the collective negligence of govt authorities that allowed this mishap to occur.

A bench of Justices A S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said that this amounts to criminal contempt of court as the SC had earlier rejected DDA's application seeking permission for cutting the trees.""Every tree is important for Delhi,"" the bench said and asked Panda to identify the ""junior-level officers"" who permitted the contractor to cut the trees.It was admitted by Panda that not only trees on DDA-controlled land was cut, but trees on ridge under Delhi govt forest department were also felled. It asked the DDA vice-chairperson to remain present in court on Thursday with data on the number of trees felled as well as the officers responsible for this.In the Buddha Jayanti Park digging case, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati informed the court that no trees have been felled and that only dead trees were removed to make way for digging the soil for laying down of pipeline that would bring irrigation water to the park.She said after the visit of PM Narendra Modi and Japanese PM to the park last year, the footfall had increased and to maintain the greenery, the plan for providing wastewater for the gardens inside the park by laying pipelines for 5 km was prepared. ""So, it all started after the PM's visit,"" the bench said.The bench asked whether the CPWD, which is carrying out the pipeline laying work, had taken the opinion of experts to determine which is a dead tree or branch before removing them. Referring to the affidavit filed by NGO 'New Delhi Nature Society' alleging felling of trees, the bench said it was not satisfied with CPWD's response.From the CPWD affidavit, the court found that the project was initiated on oral instructions from the ministry and asked Bhati to inform the court as to who that officer was. The bench asked CPWD to file a response to its queries in two weeks and posted the matter for further hearing on July 10.",Supreme Court asked DDA vice-chairperson Subhasish Panda to restore the greenery in southern ridge's Satbari area.

Death sentence clause in SC/ST Act valid? Top court to examine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/death-sentence-clause-in-sc/st-act-valid-top-court-to-examine/articleshow/110127100.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to examine the validity of a provision of the SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 that mandates imposition of capital punishment on a person if false and fabricated evidence given by him leads to conviction, imposition of death penalty and execution of a SC/ST community member.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and K V Viswanathan was hearing a challenge to the rarely used provision on the ground that it is not consistent with the ""rarest-of-rare"" benchmak set by SC for awarding capital punishment.A five-judge SC bench in the Bachan Singh case on May 9, 1980, had ruled that death penalty could be imposed by courts on persons convicted only in 'rarest of rare' murder cases involving extreme brutality. The SC had said, ""... for persons convicted of murder, life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an exception... concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law's instrumentality. That ought not to be done save in rarest of rare cases when the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed.""PIL petitioner and advocate Rishi Malhotra pointed out to a bench of Justices Kant and Viswanathan that Section 3(2)(i) of SC/ST Act provided that if an innocent member of a SC or ST community was ""convicted and executed in consequence of such false or fabricated evidence, the person who gives or fabricates such false evidence, shall be punished with death"".He informed the court that Section 303 of the Indian Penal Code, which imposed mandatory death sentence on a person who committed a murder while serving life sentence for another murder, was struck down as unconstitutional by another five-judge bench in Mithu vs Punjab case in 1983 by applying the Bachan Singh judgment ratio.Justice Kant said SC/ST Act is not one of those archaic colonial laws but one enacted by Parliament in 1989. ""The provision may have been consciously enacted to send a strong message not to implicate people belonging to poor and marginalised sections of the society in criminal cases,"" Justice Vishwanath said the norm is life sentence and capital punishment is an exception. Malhotra argued that Bachan Singh case 'rarest of rare' jurisprudence was further developed over the decades by the SC to make imposition of death penalty a rarity by vesting discretion with the judiciary to decide the quantum of punishment for a gruesome murder by examining several aspects relating to the crime, accused, circumstances, and most importantly amenability to reform.Attorney general R Venkataramani told the court that since the IPC, CrPC and Evidence Act has undergone reforms, he would consult the govt about introduction of reforms in other penal laws. The bench said that would be better and posted the matter for hearing in July.The court repeatedly asked whether there are instances of persons suffering the death penalty under Section 3(2)(i) of the SC/ST Act. Both the AG and Malhotra said they have not come across a single case.","Supreme Court agrees to examine validity of a provision of the SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.

""We are working on ways in which trade can be facilitated. But countries which no longer have any dollars cannot be left without trading. They also want to buy and sell goods. There are solutions we are working out,"" Sitharaman added.Sitharaman cautioned on the F&O segment after highlighting the shift that has taken place in household savings from the post office and bank deposits to mutual funds and capital markets. She said that these savings have provided a counterbalance to whimsical foreign portfolio flows.Last year, Sebi had come out with a study which showed that nine of 10 individual traders in the equity F&O segment incur net losses. Following the study, Sebi chairman Madhabi Puri Buch had expressed surprise at the number of investors continuing to participate in the segment despite knowing the odds were not in their favour.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said.

Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Michael Cohen: Trump knew checks were for hush-money and not legal work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/michael-cohen-trump-knew-checks-were-for-hush-money-and-not-legal-work/articleshow/110132111.cms,"‘Lying to Them’

Michael Cohen came under a plodding cross-examination Tuesday by Donald Trump ’s lawyer, who sought to undermine his earlier testimony that he participated in a hush money scheme to help the former president influence the 2016 election.Trump attorney Todd Blanche questioned Cohen at Trump ’s hush money trial for about two hours, focusing on how his decade-long devotion to Trump soured after he pleaded guilty to federal crimes in 2018 and went to prison.Blanche depicted Cohen as a fawning acolyte who turned into a vengeful media hound and made $3.4 million on two books, along with profits from a podcast and merchandise sales — all devoted to condemning Trump as a criminal who should go to jail.Blanche asked Cohen if he was “obsessed” with Trump, serving as his fixer and lawyer for a decade until after the 2016 election.“I wouldn’t use the word obsessed, I admired him tremendously,” Cohen told a Manhattan state jury. But Cohen added: “At the time, I was knee-deep into the cult of Donald Trump.”Blanche sought to undermine the credibility of Cohen, who paid $130,000 in October 2016 to adult film star Stormy Daniels after she claimed she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier. Cohen said Trump directed him to make the payment to influence the election.False PremiseCohen testified Tuesday that Trump’s reimbursements to him in 2017 were all based on the false premise that he provided legal services, not a reimbursement. Trump is accused of falsifying business records to conceal the nature of the payments.Blanche reviewed some of Cohen’s social media posts and podcast statements that belittled Trump, sometimes in crude terms. He called his former boss “a Cheetos-dusted cartoon villain” and a “dictator d____ bag.”Earlier, as prosecutor Susan Hoffinger ended her questioning of Cohen, she asked him about what Trump told him after FBI agents raided his home, office and hotel suite in April 2018.Cohen said Trump told him: “Don’t worry, I’m the president of the United States. There’s nothing here. Everything is going to be OK. Stay tough. Everything is going to be OK.”In August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to tax evasion, lying to a bank and campaign finance violations. He told the jury that was the “worst day of my life.”Cohen later pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a Trump hotel project in Moscow. He returned to Congress in February 2019, and apologized for his earlier false testimony.He said he apologized to the American people for “lying to them, for acting in a way that suppressed information that the citizenry had a right to know in order to make the determination of the individual who was seeking the highest office in the land.”Cohen was also shown a series of checks, invoices and other Trump Organization documents that are central to the trial.He testified that he sent bogus invoices for legal services to get repaid, as part of an agreement with Trump’s company.“Was this invoice a false record?” Hoffinger asked.“Yes, ma’am,” he said.“Did each of those monthly invoices you submitted make the same false representation?”“Yes, ma’am.”National EnquirerThe testimony buttressed earlier witness accounts and documents outlining an alleged hush money scheme that began with an August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower involving Trump, Cohen and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker.Pecker agreed to publish positive stories about Trump, attack his rivals, and alert Cohen to any salacious stories about Trump and women that could hurt his campaign, Cohen and Pecker both testified.Cohen gave extensive testimony about his efforts to stay in Trump’s good graces as the hush money plan was playing out. The former lawyer said he knew all along that paying Daniels off was part of a plan to influence the election.“Why, in fact, did you pay that money to Stormy Daniels?” Hoffinger asked.“To ensure that story did not come out, did not affect Mr. Trump’s chances of becoming president of the United States,” Cohen said.“On whose direction did you commit that crime?” Hoffinger asked.“On behalf of Mr Trump,” he said.Cohen, who prosecutors say is their last witness, will return to the stand Thursday when the trial resumes.","Trump attorney Todd Blanche questioned Michael Cohen for about two hours.

Putin visits Xi as US threatens China sanctions over ties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/putin-visits-xi-as-us-threatens-china-sanctions-over-ties/articleshow/110132102.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is heading to China for the first foreign visit of his new term, underlining the vital importance of the relationship as Beijing faces growing US pressure to curtail support that’s helping Moscow continue its war in Ukraine.Putin, 71, who extended his nearly quarter-century rule in tightly controlled March elections, will visit Beijing starting May 16, as well as the northern city of Harbin where he’ll take part in the opening ceremony of the eighth Russian-Chinese Expo.He is likely to prioritize countering the US warnings to China over trade with his country at talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping .The two leaders, who declared a “no-limits friendship” just weeks before Putin invaded Ukraine, have met more than 40 times since Xi came to power in 2012. China, which has helped Russia weather unprecedented US and European sanctions imposed over the Kremlin’s invasion of its neighbor, has faced increasing US threats of retaliation.The world’s second-largest economy has become an indispensable ally for Russia, which relies on China as a market for its energy and supplier of its wartime needs. That’s put Putin in a sometimes awkward position, with Beijing wary of his nuclear sabre-rattling and mindful of the need to keep unfettered access to the US-led global economic system.Putin’s decision to make Beijing his first foreign destination since his inauguration last week shows that “China is without a doubt our main partner,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, which advises the Kremlin. “In some aspects, we’ve no other alternative.”The visit comes just days after Putin appointed Andrey Belousov, an economist and technocrat, as his new defense minister, replacing the long-serving Sergei Shoigu in a signal the Russian leader sees an extended conflict ahead. Several other prominent officials, some with experience working with China, kept their current roles. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who oversees Russia’s relations with the OPEC+ group of oil-exporting nations, retained his position, while adding oversight of the nation’s economy to his responsibilities.In addition to a one-on-one meeting with Xi, Putin also will be joined by both Belousov and Shoigu for closed-door talks, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said, according to the Interfax news service. Novak, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina are among a host of other officials that will also participate in talks, he said.In recent weeks, the US has stepped up warnings to Chinese banks and exporters about consequences if they help to bolster Russia’s military capacity.In December, the Treasury Department announced it would impose secondary sanctions on banks that facilitate deals in which Russia procures semiconductors, ball bearings and other equipment necessary for its military — even if they’re unaware they’re doing so.Banking transactions between Russia and China in general have now hit obstacles, according to Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center and an expert on Russia-China ties. “The chilling effect of US policy is already there,” he said.The two leaders and their top officials could look for solutions such as designating smaller banks with no exposure to the US financial system to handle transactions with Russia, said Gabuev.The Chinese ambassador to Russia, Zhang Hanhui, said in an interview with Russian state TV last week that US sanctions have caused “some disturbance” in trade between the two countries. He added that the “two sides are actively holding consultations and striving to find effective solutions as soon as possible.”In a written interview with China’s official Xinhua News Agency published Wednesday, Putin said he was confident in the economic relationship with Beijing.Driven by Russian oil and gas sales and purchases of electronics, industrial equipment and cars, Moscow’s trade with China hit a record $240 billion in 2023, more than double the $108 billion reached in 2020.Despite the growing economic ties, China’s exports to Russia were down 13% in April from a year earlier, the second month in a row of an annual decrease, according to Chinese customs data. Russian media reported that Chinese banks in late March began blocking payments from companies in Russia buying components for electronic assembly.“It has become a tradition for the two heads of states to visit each other in the first overseas trips of their respective new presidential terms,” a display of mutual trust, said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.However, Beijing doesn’t want to be seen as tied to Russia’s war machine, he said. “China wants to build a multi-polar world with partners including European nations — as President Xi’s recent trip showed — not just with Russia,” said Wang, who was also a former Chinese diplomat to the European Union. Xi traveled to France, Serbia and Hungary last week, seeking to promote China as a reliable partner.On the energy front, negotiating a new supply contract with China will be on the agenda. Russia has all but lost its position in the European gas market in the wake of the invasion, and gas giant Gazprom PJSC sees China, the world’s largest energy importer, as a replacement.Currently, Gazprom ships natural gas to China through just one route, the Power of Siberia pipeline. Deliveries have been growing gradually and are planned to reach an annual record of 38 billion cubic meters next year. They are set to increase by a further 10 billion cubic meters, with supplies starting from 2027, under a separate contract signed in 2022.Russia’s ambition is to reach another agreement with China, with one option being a potential new Power of Siberia 2 link through Mongolia, which could lift Gazprom’s eastbound deliveries by 50 billion cubic meters a year.While Putin and Xi may discuss the contract when they meet, the Russian side does not expect a final agreement this time around, according to a person familiar with the matter.Even if China and Russia did agree on a new deal, Gazprom’s flows to the Asian nation wouldn’t exceed half of what it used to ship to Europe, and would be less lucrative, with the price for Russian gas to China lower than for remaining European clients through at least 2027, according to an economic outlook prepared by the Economy Ministry.Yet another source of worry for Russia is Ukraine’s bid to rally international support for a June conference in Switzerland aimed at promoting Kyiv’s demand for a Russian troop withdrawal from occupied territory as a pre-condition for any peace agreement.“The key here is whether China attends or not,” said Lukyanov from the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy. “Moscow takes into account the risk that the conference will create the impression on the world stage that everyone is for peace except Russia.”Still, China is continuing to sell more than $300 million a month of dual-use components to Russia identified by the US and its allies as essential for making weapons such as missiles, drones and tanks, according to a study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace published May 6.Providing components rather than weapons allows Beijing to claim plausible deniability, while supporting Russia diverts American resources away from the Indo-Pacific where China and the US are in competition, the study said.For China, “they don’t want Russia to lose” the war in Ukraine, Carnegie’s Gabuev said.","Vladimir Putin will visit Beijing starting May 16, as well as the northern city of Harbin. He is likely to prioritize countering the US warnings to China over trade with his country.

Patrick Riordan said it appears the truck ""traveled toward the center line"" and the two vehicles sideswiped, causing the bus to swerve off State Road 40, a straight but somewhat hilly two-lane road that passes through horse farms. The bus crashed through a fence, struck a tree and rolled over in a field, Riordan said.The driver of the pickup was also injured and taken to the hospital, Riordan said.The bus ended up on its side, with its windows smashed and its emergency rear door and top hatch open. The truck came to a stop at the side of the road, with its air bag blown and extensive damage to its driver's side.Federal statistics show that vehicle crashes were the leading cause of job-related deaths among farmworkers in 2022, the latest year available. They accounted for 81 of 171 fatalities.There is no immediate indication that weather was a factor. It also was not immediately not known if the bus had seat belts.Authorities in several states have been pushing for greater regulations for the safety of farmworkers, who are overwhelmingly migrants. It is unknown if all the workers on the bus were migrants.The Labor Department announced new seat belt requirements for employer vehicles used for farmworkers on temporary visas, among other worker protections that take effect June 28. The Florida Fruit & Vegetable Association has been opposed, calling the seatbelt requirement ""impractical.""State law requires seatbelts for farmworker transport using smaller vehicles, weighing less than 10,000 pounds.""We will be closed today out of respect to the losses and injuries endured early this morning in the accident that took place to the Olvera Trucking Harvesting Corp.,"" Cannon Farms announced on its Facebook page. ""Please pray with us for the families and the loved ones involved in this tragic accident. We appreciate your understanding at this difficult time.""Cannon Farms describes itself as a family-owned operation that has farmed its land for more than 100 years. The company now focuses on peanuts and watermelons, which it sends to grocery stores across the U.S. and Canada.No one answered the phone at Olvera Trucking on Tuesday afternoon. The company had recently advertised for a temporary driver to bus workers to watermelon fields. The driver would then operate harvesting equipment. The pay was $14.77 an hour.It wasn't immediately clear if the workers who were on the bus are migrants, but a Department of Labor document shows Olvera recently applied for 43 H-2A workers to harvest watermelons at Cannon Farms this month. The company again offered a base rate of $14.77 an hour, with promises of housing and transportation to and from the fields.The H-2A program allows U.S. employers or agents who meet certain regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals into the country to fill temporary agricultural jobs. Florida farms employ more H-2A workers than any other state, about 50,000 a year, according to the Florida Fruit & Vegetable Association.Andres Sequra, a director of mission and ministry for AdventHealth hospitals, told reporters that the injured workers who could be visited by chaplains ""were in good spirits for what they have been through.""""We were able to provide support, presence, prayer when it was asked of us,"" he said.","The converted school bus was transporting 53 farmworkers when it collided with a 2001 Ford Ranger.

"Alice Munro, Canadian Nobel Prize-winning author, dead at 92",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/alice-munro-canadian-nobel-prize-winning-author-dead-at-92/articleshow/110126773.cms,"'Shame and embarrassment'

OTTAWA: Nobel Prize-winning Canadian writer Alice Munro , whose exquisitely crafted tales of the loves, ambitions and travails of small-town women in her native land made her a globally acclaimed master of the short story, has died at the age of 92, her publisher said on Tuesday.Munro had died at her home in Port Hope, Ontario, said Kristin Cochrane, chief executive officer of McClelland & Stewart.""Alice's writing inspired countless writers ... and her work leaves an indelible mark on our literary landscape,"" she said in a statement.The Globe and Mail newspaper, citing family members, said Munro had died on Monday after suffering from dementia for at least a decade.Munro published more than a dozen collections of short stories and was honored with the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2013.Her stories explored sex, yearning, discontent, aging, moral conflict and other themes in rural settings with which she was intimately familiar - villages and farms in the Canadian province of Ontario. She was adept at fully developing complex characters within the limited pages of a short story.""Alice Munro was a Canadian literary icon. For six decades, her short stories captivated hearts around Canada and the world,"" Canadian Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge said on the X social media network.Munro, who wrote about ordinary people with clarity and realism, was often likened to Anton Chekhov , the 19th century Russian known for his brilliant short stories - a comparison the Swedish Academy cited in honoring her with the Nobel Prize.Calling her a ""master of the contemporary short story,"" the Academy also said: ""Her texts often feature depictions of everyday but decisive events, epiphanies of a kind, that illuminate the surrounding story and let existential questions appear in a flash of lightning.""In an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation after winning the Nobel, Munro said, ""I think my stories have gotten around quite remarkably for short stories, and I would really hope that this would make people see the short story as an important art, not just something that you played around with until you'd got a novel written.""Her works included: ""Dance of the Happy Shades"" (1968), ""Lives of Girls and Women"" (1971), ""Who Do You Think You Are?"" (1978), ""The Moons of Jupiter"" (1982), ""Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage"" (2001), ""Runaway"" (2004), ""The View from Castle Rock"" (2006), ""Too Much Happiness"" (2009) and ""Dear Life"" (2012).The characters in her stories were often girls and women who lead seemingly unexceptional lives but struggle with tribulations ranging from sexual abuse and stifling marriages to repressed love and the ravages of aging.""Last month I reread all of Alice Munro's books. I felt the need to be close to her. Every time I read her is a new experience. Every time changes me. She will live forever,"" leading Canadian author Heather O'Neill said in a post on X.Munro's story of a woman who starts losing her memory and agrees to enter a nursing home titled ""The Bear Came Over the Mountain,"" from ""Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage,"" was adapted into the Oscar-nominated 2006 film ""Away From Her,"" directed by fellow Canadian Sarah Polley.Canadian novelist Margaret Atwood , writing in the Guardian after Munro won the Nobel, summarized her work by saying: ""Shame and embarrassment are driving forces for Munro's characters, just as perfectionism in the writing has been a driving force for her: getting it down, getting it right, but also the impossibility of that. Munro chronicles failure much more often than she chronicles success, because the task of the writer has failure built in.""American novelist Jonathan Franzen wrote in 2005, ""Reading Munro puts me in that state of quiet reflection in which I think about my own life: about the decisions I've made, the things I've done and haven't done, the kind of person I am, the prospect of death.""The short story, a style more popular in the 19th and early 20th century, has long taken a back seat to the novel in popular tastes - and in attracting awards. But Munro was able to infuse her short stories with a richness of plot and depth of detail usually more characteristic of full-length novels.""For years and years, I thought that stories were just practice, 'til I got time to write a novel. Then I found that they were all I could do and so I faced that. I suppose that my trying to get so much into stories has been a compensation,"" Munro told the New Yorker magazine in 2012.She was the second Canadian-born writer to win the Nobel literature prize but the first with a distinctly Canadian identity.

Pakistan's Gwadar port exposes China's Belt and Road failure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-gwadar-port-exposes-chinas-belt-and-road-failure/articleshow/110100113.cms,"'Investors thought Gwadar would become Dubai'

China investing heavily in its Belt and Road network

Gwadar performs worse than other new ports

CPEC hampered by political, economic instability

China learning from its mistakes in Pakistan

Unsustainable investment pushes countries into debt

In November 2016, Gwadar port symbolized stability, peace and prosperity for Pakistan — at least according to then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.""This day is the dawn of a new era,"" he told the opening ceremony crowd, which had gathered to witness a row of Chinese trucks arriving to load cargo onto the first-ever container ship to pass through the port.It was the official launch of the port's operations nearly a decade after its completion. The ceremony also marked the start of the prestigious China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), part of China's global collection of infrastructure projects and trade networks known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Yet today, nearly eight years later, this new era has yet to dawn. A DW analysis shows what went wrong.The idea behind the CPEC was to connect China's western Xinjiang province with the sea via Pakistan. This would shorten trade routes for China and help avoid the contentious Malacca Strait choke point, a narrow waterway between Malaysia and Sumatra that links the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Pakistan, meanwhile, would benefit from increases in trade, infrastructure and industry along the 2,000-kilometer corridor (1,240 miles), all financed by China.In addition to the already established port of Karachi, Gwadar was chosen to connect the corridor to the global shipping network. The small fishing city lies near the Iranian border, some 500 kilometers away from Karachi.Gwadar's recently built deep-sea port, completed in 2007 and handed over to a Chinese operating company in 2013, was to become the heart of the CPEC. It would be integrated into a new special economic zone that would transform Gwardar into a bustling port city.The port has potential, said Azeem Khalid, an assistant professor of international relations at COMSATS University Islamabad who studies Chinese investments in Pakistan. ""It is a natural deep-sea port which can host bigger ships than Karachi. It sits at the crossroads of the global oil trade. And it would consolidate China's regional interests,"" he told DW.At home, China has already proven it can transform sleepy fishing villages into economic powerhouses. Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone, is the best example. In just four decades, the city's population grew from around 60,000 inhabitants to more than 17 million today.""Back then, investors thought Gwadar would become the next Dubai,"" said Khalid.Pakistan is not alone in pursuing this vision. All over the world, governments are hoping to boost their economies through new and expanded ports and other infrastructure projects — and Chinese banks are more than willing to provide financing. Chinese companies often build and operate the ports as well.DW has collated information on at least 38 ports that have been built with Chinese investment since 2000; an additional 43 ports are planned or in construction. Seventy-eight existing ports also have Chinese stakeholders, DW found.These deals are lucrative for China, said Jacob Mardell, a former analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a German think tank, and a journalist covering the BRI.""This model almost kind of acts as a subsidy for Chinese companies,"" he told DW. He explained that Chinese banks loan money to governments that then give that money to Chinese construction companies and pay the loan back to the bank over time. This means the money essentially never leaves China, ""while the bill is ultimately footed by taxpayers in other countries.""One common pattern appears to be building new ports relatively close to already established ones, as is the case with Gwadar and Karachi. The new ports are often meant to supplement or replace the older, less efficient ones over time.This is also the case in Cameroon and Nigeria, for instance. In Cameroon, the newly built port of Kribi is set to replace the congested and far too shallow port of Douala, while in Nigeria, the port of Lagos is supplemented by the just-opened Lekki deep-sea port, less than 100 kilometers away. Both ports were financed and built by Chinese state-owned companies.Similarly, in 2017, the government of Sri Lanka granted China a 99-year lease and majority stake in its relatively new Hambantota port, which was originally intended to supplement the country's main port of Colombo.Lekki port received 26 ships in 2023, its first year of operation, according to ship tracking and maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic. It's a modest number compared to bigger ports — but Gwadar, despite being completed in 2007, has only logged 22 ships in its best year to date. It has also failed to attract any regularly scheduled deep-sea shipping lines.This means Gwadar processes almost no cargo that could generate income for Pakistan — or, for that matter, for the Chinese operating company. And it's no wonder: Gwadar is operating at very limited capacity. The port's three berths, where loading and unloading takes place, can handle 137,000 standard 20-foot shipping containers per year. In contrast, Karachi and its 33 berths can handle the equivalent of 4.2 million 20-foot containers per year.While ports like Kribi or Lekki are comparatively small, they outshine Gwadar, the supposed new centerpiece of trade for South and Central Asia.Khalid told DW that although Gwadar has the potential to eventually surpass Karachi, a lack of investment is holding it back. A $1.6 billion (€1.5 billion) expansion was promised in 2015, but little progress appears to have been made at the port since then. Much of the supporting infrastructure, including roads and railways needed to transport cargo to and from Gwadar, is also missing.Publicly, investors like the China Pakistan Investment Corporation still claim Gwadar port is ""becoming a focal point for trade and investment in the region."" But the empty port site suggests the opposite.Mardell and Khalid said that behind the scenes, both Pakistan and China have become disillusioned with the project.""Jobs promises were not met. Industrial promises were not met. The business opportunities for Pakistanis were not met,"" said Khalid. ""They [China] promised nine special economic zones. Not one is fully functional to date.""The of development in Gwadar broadly mirrors the situation in the rest of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. ""CPEC has had problems since its inception,"" said Mardell.Some of these problems are specific to the border region of Balochistan, where Gwadar is situated. It is among the poorest regions of Pakistan and has strong separatist militias that commonly carry out attacks, including some that have specifically targeted Chinese nationals. In turn, the militias have been violently suppressed by the Pakistani military.At the national level, Pakistan has been experiencing a severe economic crisis in recent years, and the country is still struggling to stabilize politically after the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022.""Since the political and security situation in Pakistan has deteriorated more recently, that's hampered CPEC even more,"" said Mardell.On the Chinese side, Mardell thinks decision-makers might have miscalculated.""When it comes to investment decisions, the Chinese are famously not risk-averse,"" he told DW. He says ""basically unlimited"" state backing for state-owned investment and construction companies, coupled with the political will to rapidly step up competition with Western economies, has led China to fund even very risky projects in less stable countries worldwide.""I just don't think they fully understood the situation in Pakistan going in,"" said Mardell, though he believes this might change for other projects going forward. ""I think they've learned from their mistakes with the BRI and with CPEC, and they're probably more reluctant to commit capital nowadays.""In the last few years, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, China's spending on BRI projects has slowed. But while the country may now be more selective in which projects it funds, it is starting to invest more again, with total BRI investment amounts having reached pre-pandemic levels.Still, countries like Pakistan are now stuck paying back large amounts of debt to Chinese lenders. ""Pakistan has to pay billions of dollars back in loans, because of reckless investments in the name of CPEC,"" said Khalid.Similar cases have previously led to criticism that China is conducting debt-trap diplomacy, allowing partner countries to go into unsustainable amounts of debt to gain political influence.Moreover, part of the revenue from the newly built projects also goes back to China.""China gets the lion's share of everything,"" Khalid said, referring to CPEC investments. With Gwadar port, for instance, 90% of the quite limited revenue goes to the Chinese operating company. The Pakistani government receives 10%, while nothing goes to the Balochi regional government.Mardell said that the CPEC and Gwadar port with it will likely continue despite all its issues.""There's no way that China will lose face and admit that it's a disaster. And pulling out of CPEC and abandoning Pakistan isn't an option now. They're in too deep, and Pakistan is too important an ally,"" he said.Instead, he thinks it's likely China will continue to drag its feet on large investments in Pakistan, but still show token amounts of effort to keep the project going.Yet, he said, there's still a chance for Gwadar. ""If the situation in Pakistan changes for the better, then maybe CPEC will make progress.""","Gwadar port was to become the heart of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The idea was to connect China's western Xinjiang province with the sea via Pakistan. Pakistan, meanwhile, would benefit from increases in trade, infrastructure and industry. But despite being completed in 2007, Gwadar has only logged 22 ships in its best year to date.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110101231,imgsize-834597,width-400,resizemode-4/110101231.jpg"
US says Boeing can be prosecuted for 737 MAX crashes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-says-boeing-can-be-prosecuted-for-737-max-crashes/articleshow/110131014.cms,"- Multiple inquiries, audits -

SAN FRANCISCO: The US Justice Department on Tuesday said Boeing can be prosecuted for two subsequent 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people approximately five years ago.Boeing breached obligations under an agreement that had shielded it against legal proceedings for the accidents, department officials said in a letter to a federal court in Texas.Boeing told AFP ""we believe that we have honored the terms of that agreement"" and said that it plans to defend itself.US officials said in their letter that Boeing breached its obligations under a deferred prosecution agreement (DFA) by ""failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the US fraud laws throughout its operations.""Such a breach would mean Boeing can be prosecuted for any violation of federal law related to the crashes, according to US justice officials.The government is evaluating how to proceed in the matter and has directed Boeing to respond by June 13.US officials also plan to confer with families of people who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashes.""We will engage with the Department with the utmost transparency, as we have throughout the entire term of the agreement,"" Boeing said in a statement to AFP.It said this also included ""response to their questions following the Alaska Airlines 1282 accident.""The dramatic mid-flight blowout on January 5 of a fuselage panel on an Alaska Airlines plane precipitated the departures of a series of top Boeing officials -- including CEO Dave Calhoun, who is set to step down at year's end.It also resulted in reduced production of the 737 MAX.The US Federal Aviation Administration was sharply criticized after the crashes of two Boeing 737 MAX planes in 2018 and 2019.But as Boeing faces multiple inquiries and audits in the United States and abroad, it has repeatedly assured critics that it is working ""with full transparency and under the oversight"" of FAA regulators.The DPA required Boeing to pay $2.5 billion in fines and restitution in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecution for charges it defrauded the government during the certification of the MAX.A federal judge in Texas early last year rejected a challenge by relatives of Boeing 737 MAX crash victims to the aviation giant's US criminal settlement, ruling against ordering changes to the controversial January 2021 DPA.The families have argued that Boeing's role in what they have called the ""deadliest corporate crime"" in US history merit criminal conviction of the company and top brass.","US Justice Department says Boeing can be prosecuted for two subsequent 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people approximately five years ago.

Biden bans Chinese bitcoin mine near US nuclear missile base,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-bans-chinese-bitcoin-mine-near-us-nuclear-missile-base/articleshow/110126602.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Monday ordered a company with Chinese origins to shut down and sell the Wyoming cryptocurrency mine it built a mile from an Air Force base that controls nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles.The cryptomining facility, which operates high-powered computers in a data center near the FE Warren base in Cheyenne, ""presents a national security risk to the United States ,"" the president said in an executive order, because its equipment could be used for surveillance and espionage.The New York Times reported last October that Microsoft, which operates a nearby data center supporting the Pentagon, had flagged the Chinese-connected cryptocurrency mine to the federal Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, warning that it could enable the Chinese to ""pursue full-spectrum intelligence collection operations."" An investigation by the committee identified risks to national security, according to the president's order.The order did not detail those risks. But Microsoft's report to the federal committee, obtained last year by the Times, said, ""We suggest the possibility that the computing power of an industrial-level cryptomining operation, along with the presence of an unidentified number of Chinese nationals in direct proximity to Microsoft's Data Center and one of three strategic-missile bases in the US, provides significant threat vectors.""Now, the mine must immediately cease operations, and the owners must remove all their equipment within 90 days and sell or transfer the property within 120 days, according to the order, which cites the risks of the facility's ""foreign-sourced"" mining equipment. A vast majority of the machinery powering cryptomining operations across the United States is manufactured by Chinese companies.Cryptomining operations are housed in large warehouses or shipping containers packed with specialized computers that typically run around the clock, performing trillions of calculations per second, hunting for a sequence of numbers that will reward them with new cryptocurrency. The most common is bitcoin, currently worth more than $60,000 apiece. Crypto mines consume an enormous amount of electricity: At full capacity, the one in Cheyenne would draw as much power as 55,000 homes.Chinese-owned cryptocurrency mines have boomed in the United States since the facilities were effectively banned in China in 2021. While some cryptomining has since restarted in China, Chinese crypto entrepreneurs are drawn to the United States for its relatively cheap electricity and well-developed legal system.The Times found Chinese-owned or -operated bitcoin mines in at least 12 states, including Arkansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming, that together use as much power as 1.5 million homes. Some are owned by people or companies with links to the Chinese government or the Communist Party. Until recently, the main supplier of equipment for the mines operated from an office in a Communist Party facility on Hainan Island, the Times found.Biden's order comes on the heels of his signing a bipartisan bill in late April banning the social media app TikTok in the United States unless its Chinese owner sells it.This is also the second time in recent weeks that Chinese-owned cryptomining operations have been targeted by elected officials.This month, Arkansas' Republican governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders , signed two laws restricting foreign ownership of cryptomining operations in the state. The legislation prohibits cryptomine ownership by foreign nationals from China, Iran, Cuba and other countries subject to State Department rules known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.Arkansas has seen a large influx of bitcoin mining operations in recent years. In October, the Times reported that Chinese investors with ties to the authoritarian government were operating at least three mines in Arkansas. A former employee connected to the operations wrote of scouring ""over 200 target mining sites"" in more than 10 states.The laws restricting ownership of cryptomining operations in Arkansas are intended to amend last year's so-called Right to Mine law, which offered broad protections to the industry by limiting local regulation, and set off a fierce backlash among residents near the mines. One of those operations, with connections to the Chinese nationals, is the target of a lawsuit by residents who say the incessant whine from the thousands of fans cooling the computers has ruined their lives and depressed property values. In addition to new restrictions on noisy operations, the amended law requires cryptomines owned in any part by foreign nationals subject to the arms regulations to completely divest within one year.Biden's order is directed at an offshore company called MineOne Partners Limited and related MineOne entities registered in Delaware. A lawsuit against MineOne filed by a Wyoming cryptocurrency company compelled the disclosure of its owners, which included Chinese nationals. In 2022 Bit Origin Ltd., a former Chinese pork producer that pivoted to cryptocurrency mining, became a partner in a MineOne entity and built the mine, which began operating in early 2023.Li Jiaming, president of Bit Origin Ltd., was not immediately available to comment. In an interview last year, Li said investors had chosen the site because they had secured a contract with the local power company to supply its electricity, not because of its proximity to the base or the data center.","Chinese-owned cryptocurrency mines have boomed in the United States since the facilities were effectively banned in China in 2021.

First crewed flight of Boeing spacecraft delayed again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/first-crewed-flight-of-boeing-spacecraft-delayed-again/articleshow/110126586.cms,"WASHINGTON: The first crewed launch of Boeing 's Starliner spaceship to the International Space Station has been postponed again due to a technical snafu, the company said Tuesday.The next attempt will be May 21 at the earliest.The high-stakes mission was already called off last week, with two astronauts strapped in and ready to fly.That was because engineers detected a problem with a valve that regulates liquid oxygen pressure on the Atlas V rocket meant to propel Starliner into orbit.The valve was replaced and a new launch date of May 17 was set.But a new problem emerged -- a small helium leak in a part of Starliner called the service module, which holds instruments used to control and operate the spacecraft .Engineers need to carry out tests as they try to fix the problem, Boeing said in a statement.""Helium is used in spacecraft thruster systems to allow the thrusters to fire and is not combustible or toxic,"" Boeing said.Liftoff from Florida is now scheduled for 4:43 pm (2043 GMT) on May 21.Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have returned to Houston as teams work to fix this new glitch and will return to Florida over the next few days, Boeing said.The mission has already faced years of delays and comes at a challenging time for Boeing, as a safety crisis engulfs the century-old aerospace titan's commercial aviation arm.NASA is banking on Starliner's success in order to achieve its goal of certifying a second commercial vehicle to carry crews to the International Space Station.Elon Musk's SpaceX achieved the feat with its Dragon capsule in 2020, ending a nearly decade-long dependence on Russian rockets following the end of the Space Shuttle program.","The first crewed launch of Boeing's Starliner spaceship to the International Space Station has been postponed again.

"Trump hush money trial: Appeals court upholds gag order, Cohen gives more testimony",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-hush-money-trial-appeals-court-upholds-gag-order-cohen-gives-more-testimony/articleshow/110125906.cms,"NEW YORK: New York appeals court on Tuesday upheld the gag order in Donald Trump's hush money trial , finding that the judge ""properly determined"" that Trump's public statements ""posed a significant threat to the integrity of the testimony of witnesses and potential witnesses in this case as well."" Trump had asked the state's intermediate appeals court to lift or modify the gag order, which bars him from commenting publicly about jurors, witnesses and others connected to the case, including Judge Juan M.Merchan's family and prosecutors other than District Attorney Alvin Bragg.At an emergency hearing last month, just days before the trial started, Trump's lawyers argued that the gag order is an unconstitutional curb on the presumptive Republican nominee's free speech rights while he's campaigning for president and fighting criminal charges.In its ruling, the five-judge appeals panel noted that Trump wasn't claiming that the gag order had infringed on his right to a fair trial. Rather, Trump's lawyers argued that prohibiting him from commenting restricted his ability to engage in protected political speech and could adversely impact on his campaign.The appeals court ruled that Merchan ""properly weighed"" Trump's free speech rights against the ""historical commitment to ensuring the fair administration of justice in criminal cases, and the right of persons related or tangentially related to the criminal proceedings from being free from threats, intimidation, harassment, and harm.""Trump's fixer-turned-foe Michael Cohen returned to the witness stand Tuesday, testifying in detail about how the former president was linked to all aspects of the hush money scheme that prosecutors say was an illegal effort to purchase and then bury stories that threatened his 2016 campaign.Trump, the first former U.S. president to go on trial, was joined at the courthouse by an entourage of GOP lawmakers that included House Speaker Mike Johnson and others considered vice presidential contenders for Trump's 2024 campaign. Their presence was a not-so-subtle show of support meant not just for Trump, but also for voters tuning in to trial coverage and for the jurors deciding Trump's fate.As proceedings began, Johnson held a news conference outside the courthouse, using his powerful pulpit to attack the U.S. judicial system. It was a remarkable moment in American politics as the person second in line to the presidency sought to turn his political party against the rule of law by declaring the Manhattan criminal trial illegitimate.""I do have a lot of surrogates, and they're speaking very beautifully,"" Trump said before court as the group gathered in the background. ""And they come ... from all over Washington. And they're highly respected, and they think this is the greatest scam they've ever seen.""Cohen, meanwhile, resumed his place on the witness stand as prosecutor Susan Hoffinger worked to paint him as a Trump loyalist who committed crimes on behalf of the former president.Cohen told jurors that he lied to Congress during an investigation into potential ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign to protect Trump. He also described for jurors the April 2018 raid by law enforcement on his apartment, law firm, a hotel room where he stayed and a bank where he stashed valuables.""How to describe your life being turned upside-down. Concerned. Despondent. Angry,"" he said.""Were you frightened?"" Hoffinger asked.""Yes, ma'am.""But he said he was heartened by a phone call from Trump that he said gave him reassurance and convinced him to remain ""in the camp.""He said to me, Don't worry. I'm the president of the United States. There's nothing here. Everything's going to be OK. Stay tough. You're going to be OK,'"" Cohen testified.Cohen told jurors that ""I felt reassured because I had the president of the United States protecting me ... And so I remained in the camp.""But their relationship soured, and now Cohen is one of Trump's most vocal critics. His testimony is central to the Manhattan case.Cohen testified that after paying out $130,000 to porn actress Stormy Daniels in order to keep her quiet about an alleged sexual encounter, Trump promised to reimburse him. He said Trump was constantly apprised of the behind-the-scenes efforts to bury stories feared to be harmful to the campaign.Jurors followed along as Hoffinger, in a methodical and clinical fashion, walked Cohen through that reimbursement process. It was an attempt to show what prosecutors say was a lengthy deception to mask the true purpose of the payments. As jurors were shown business records and other paperwork, Cohen explained their purpose and reiterated again and again that the payments were reimbursements for the hush money. They weren't for legal services he provided or for a retainer, he said.It's an important distinction, because prosecutors allege that the Trump records falsely described the purpose of the payments as legal expenses. These records form the basis of 34 felony counts charging Trump with falsifying business records. All told, Cohen was paid $420,000, with funds drawn from a Trump personal account.""Were the descriptions on this check stub false?"" Hoffinger asked.""Yes,"" Cohen said.""And again, there was no retainer agreement,"" Hoffinger asked.""Correct,"" Cohen replied.Trump has pleaded not guilty and also denies that any of the encounters took place.During his time on the witness stand, Cohen delivered matter-of-fact testimony that went to the heart of the former president's trial: ""Everything required Mr. Trump's sign-off,"" Cohen said. He told jurors that Trump did not want Daniels' account of a sexual encounter to get out. At the time, Trump was especially anxious about how the story would affect his standing with female voters.A similar episode occurred when Cohen alerted Trump that a Playboy model was alleging that she and Trump had an extramarital affair. ""Make sure it doesn't get released,"" was Cohen's message to Trump, according to testimony. The woman, Karen McDougal, was paid $150,000 in an arrangement that was made after Trump received a ""complete and total update on everything that transpired.""""What I was doing, I was doing at the direction of and benefit of Mr. Trump,"" Cohen testified.Prosecutors believe Cohen's insider knowledge is critical to their case. But their reliance on a witness with such a checkered past - Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payments - also carries sizable risks with a jury.The men, once so close that Cohen boasted that he would ""take a bullet"" for Trump, had no visible interaction inside the courtroom. The sedate atmosphere was a marked contrast from their last courtroom faceoff in October, when Trump walked out of the courtroom after his lawyer finished questioning Cohen during his civil fraud trial.Throughout Cohen's testimony Tuesday, Trump reclined in his chair with his eyes closed and his head tilted to the side.

US imposes sanctions after aborted sale of Russian tycoon stake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-imposes-sanctions-after-aborted-sale-of-russian-tycoon-stake/articleshow/110124800.cms,"WASHINGTON/FRANKFURT: The US Treasury has sanctioned a web of Russian companies it said were used to disguise ownership of a $1.5 billion industrial stake controlled by a Russian tycoon , warning Western companies to steer clear of such deals.The step concerns a recently aborted bid by Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) to buy a roughly $1.5 billion euro industrial stake linked to Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska , said a person with direct knowledge of the case.A spokesperson for Raiffeisen said that the US Treasury announcement validated the bank's earlier decision to ""walk away"" from the deal.""Treasury will continue to take action to ... stop evasion by the Kremlin and its oligarch enablers,"" said US Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson.""Anyone still doing business in or with Russia should be skeptical of any supposed divestment schemes that involve shell companies or proxies linked to sanctioned oligarchs. Corporate sales and acquisitions can be abused for money laundering and sanctions evasion.In its announcement, the US Treasury described a web of companies linked to a $1.5 billion sale as an ""attempted sanctions evasion scheme"" to unfreeze a stake using ""an opaque and complex supposed divestment"".RBI had wanted to buy a stake in Vienna-based construction group Strabag from a company Strabag identified as being controlled by Deripaska, who has denied any current links to Strabag and dismissed Western sanctions against him as misguided and based on false information.Reuters had earlier reported that the plan had come under fire from the US Treasury because Deripaska is sanctioned.The attempt to pursue the deal exacerbated tensions between Washington and RBI, which is already under scrutiny from US sanctions enforcement agency OFAC, sources told Reuters.US officials long suspected Deripaska would benefit from the sale, sources have told Reuters and some Austrian officials also privately cautioned against the deal, believing it could be declared a breach of sanctions, people with direct knowledge of the matter had told Reuters.In the Tuesday announcement, the US Treasury said that Deripaska had coordinated with a Russian national, who owned a Russia-based financial services firm, to sell Deripaska's frozen shares in a European company.It said that a Russian company, Iliadis, was set up to acquire another company, Rasperia, which held Deripaska's frozen shares. The individual and Russian companies involved are now sanctioned.Strabag is one of Europe's biggest construction firms and built the Olympic stadium for the Sochi winter games and luxury apartments in Moscow.Two years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, RBI's continued Russian presence underlines the ties between Moscow and Vienna - whether via Russian gas pipelines or Vienna serving as a hub for cash from Russia and former Soviet states.","The step concerns a recently aborted bid by Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International to buy a roughly $1.5 billion euro industrial stake linked to Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska.

Pak protestors call off march in PoK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-protestors-call-off-march-in-pok/articleshow/110126325.cms,"ISLAMABAD

: Protesters seeking subsidised wheat flour and reduction in electricity tariffs called off their demonstration in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) on Tuesday after days of clashes with police and Rangers, a paramilitary force, in which four people were killed and over 100 injured.The Awami Action Committee (AAC), an alliance of civil rights groups in the region, said the govt has accepted all its demands and called on protesters to return to their homes and businesses.On Monday, Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif had approved $82.6-million to help meet most of their demands, which included subsidies on flour and electricity prices.Shaukat Nawaz Mir, the alliance’s head, however, demanded financial compensation for the families of three protesters and a police official who were killed in the violence that lasted for four days. The protesters were killed on Monday evening after the Rangers, en route to Muzaffarabad, opened fire on them when they were attacked, a local govt official said.The recent protests coincided with the visit of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission to negotiate a new long-term loan with Pakistan. The global lender has already warned that social unrest triggered by high cost of living could weigh on policy implementation, adding that fiscal slippages could present a challenge for the govt.","Protesters were seeking subsidised wheat flour and reduction in electricity tariffs.

Pakistanis own properties worth USD 12.5 billion in Dubai: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistanis-own-properties-worth-usd-12-5-billion-in-dubai-report/articleshow/110125151.cms,"ISLAMABAD: With cash-strapped Pakistan running from pillar to post to get loan, its rich nationals own between 17,000 to 22,000 properties worth USD 12.5 billion in Dubai, according to the leaked data used by an international consortium of journalists to access details of properties in Dubai, it emerged on Tuesday. According to Dawn.com, the leaked data provides a detailed overview of hundreds of thousands of properties in Dubai and information about their ownership or usage, largely from 2020 and 2022.It was obtained by the Centre for Advanced Defence Studies (C4ADS), a non-profit organisation based in Washington, DC, that researches international crime and conflict.The data was then shared with Norwegian financial outlet E24 and the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which coordinated an investigative project with media outlets from around the world. Titled 'Dubai Unlocked', the collaboration includes 74 partners from 58 countries.The website reported that the details of ""an astounding volume of leaked property data that includes over 17,000 properties listed as belonging to Pakistani nationals up to the spring of 2022"" were known to journalists from scores of media outlets around the world.It stated that while 17,000 Pakistani citizens are listed owners in the 2022 leak, academics using the data and additional sources put the actual number of Pakistani owners of residential property in Dubai at 22,000.They further estimate that the apartments and villas may have been worth more than USD 10 billion at the start of 2022, but with the more than 25 per cent increase in property prices over the last two years, the real worth of Pakistanis' residential properties in Dubai could now be well above USD 12.5 billion.""If we have the data you are talking about, as well as the information on residence status, we will make sure those who are eligible to pay tax in Pakistan on rental income or capital value are doing so,"" Malik Amjed Zubair Tiwana, chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), was quoted as saying by the news portal.""It may be a sensitive matter, and perhaps the law will have to change, but with political will we will go all out against tax evaders. The government is prepared for this.""He added that ""citizenship has no importance in tax law"" as taxation is linked to residence status. ""We have been trying to get information from the immigration department of Dubai to determine tax status, but it has not materialised.""Ali Rahim, tax lawyer and former Karachi Tax Bar Association president, said that the entire world income of resident Pakistanis is liable to be taxed in Pakistan, but they can get credit against their total tax payment for any taxes paid abroad.Pakistani residents (those in the country for more than 183 days per year) with assets abroad have to value them at the current exchange rate and pay one per cent tax on that if the value of the asset is more than Rs 100 million. This law is being challenged in the high courts and the Supreme Court.Non-resident or overseas Pakistanis are only liable to pay tax on income generated in Pakistan. They are not required to file a wealth statement or declare overseas assets.Dawn also clarified that a mere mention of someone in the data is not evidence in itself of financial crime or tax fraud. Nor does the data contain information such as residence status, sources of income, tax declarations of rental income or capital gains. In fact, several of those approached for comment on their properties said they were declared to the tax authorities.""But it does paint an astonishing picture of contrasts. Pakistan, a developing country teetering on the edge of economic collapse, begging international lenders and friendly countries for lifelines in single digit billions, features prominently in the data,"" according to the website.","Leaked data shows Pakistanis own between 17,000 to 22,000 properties worth USD 12.5 billion in Dubai.

Imran Khan asks Pak Army chief to apologize him for his 'illegal' abduction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-khan-asks-pak-army-chief-to-apologize-him-for-his-illegal-abduction/articleshow/110121489.cms,"LAHORE : Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan , who has been in jail since August last in different cases, on Tuesday asked Army chief General Asim Munir to apologize to him for his ""illegal"" abduction and for backing the 'London Plan' and vowed not to cut a deal with the powerful military. ""On the morning of May 9, 2023, my illegal abduction from the High Court was part of the London Plan (to topple the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government and impose a hybrid system led by the Sharif family on the country), for which General Asim Munir should apologize to me,"" Khan said on X.It is believed that his family is running his social media account.Criticising Gen Munir, Khan said: ""It is the misfortune of this country that a self-proclaimed King (Gen Munir) has taken hold of all the decision-making. I am currently in prison because if I am free, it will challenge the power of that one person.""Khan said the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) - the media wing of the armed forces - and the Chief of Army Staff are making threatening political statements and involving the army in politics which is tarnishing the image of the army.The powerful Army, which has ruled the coup-prone country for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy.ISPR DG Maj-Gen Ahmed Sharif last week said that any dialogue with the PTI could happen only if it ""earnestly apologizes publicly in front of the nation, promises to adopt constructive politics, and forgoes politics of anarchy"".Khan said when political statements and press conferences are held, political parties have the right to respond to them.""When the government is given to people lacking democratic mandate, the country becomes an epicenter of corruption and chaos. The chaos that is seen in (Pakistan-occupied) Kashmir today is likely to spread across Pakistan. Form 47 (fake result) non-democratic governments have been established in the entire country.""When a government is elected democratically, it is backed by the people. People value their elected government and if any issues arise, it is resolved through dialogue,"" he said, adding that people place no trust in the imposed governments in Gilgit-Baltistan, PoK, Punjab, and Pakistan; hence the widespread unrest and frustration.He said further backlash will ensue against Form 47 governments when the budget is announced.He further said an artificial set-up has been imposed on the people in the country.""This government has absolutely no authority. An unconstitutional institution like SIFC (Special Investment Facilitation Council, an initiative of the army) has been imposed on Pakistan and no one dares to question it. It was established with the sole purpose of bringing investments, while the Pakistan Business Council has openly stated that investors are withdrawing their investments instead of investing in the country.""On the one hand, the nation was misled with the false hopes of the agricultural revolution and on the other hand, wheat importation to embezzle billions of rupees, has devastated the wheat farmer economically,"" he added.Khan said in this bogus setup, the government is given to those who have all their wealth lying outside in the form of dollars.""A leader has to make sacrifices and this group of Nawaz and Zardari will not sacrifice under any circumstances nor will they bring their money back to the country. General Musharraf and later ISI provided details to everyone including me on their looted money and today they have been imposed on us and their corruption charges are being cleared. The purpose of imposing this fake system on the nation is only to increase the power of this one man (Gen Munir) who has destroyed the entire country for his personal power,"" he said and vowed not to cut a deal with the military.""This country is my country and I will never leave it. Moreover, any deal is also out of the question. Pakistan is being run in a dictatorial manner. Our total revenue is 13.9 trillion rupees, while we have to pay 9.8 trillion rupees annually as interest. The country can never progress with such a punitive use of coercive measures,"" Khan said.","Imran Khan has been in jail since August last in different cases. He has asked Army chief General Asim Munir to apologize to him for his ""illegal"" abduction. Khan said the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) and the Chief of Army Staff are tarnishing the image of the army.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110121730,imgsize-37074,width-400,resizemode-4/110121730.jpg"

International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has warned that Pakistan’s high political uncertainty and resurgence of social tensions could undermine economic stabilisation policies in the cash-strapped country.“Downside risks remain exceptionally high. While the new government has indicated its intention to continue the SBAs (standby arrangement) policies, political uncertainty remains significant,” the IMF said in a staff report on Friday.Pakistan had narrowly averted a sovereign debt default last summer.The economy has now stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to 17% in April from a record 38% in May last year.IMF officials are expected to visit Pakistan this month to discuss a new loan programme. The Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition govt likely to seek at least $6 billion and request additional financing.According to the global lender, while Pakistan did “broadly achieve its narrow objectives, the challenges ahead remained uncomfortably high and would require sustained efforts to address them”.The report said that Pakistan’s fiscal and external vulnerabilities remain very high, including debt sustainability and refinancing risks. “Pakistan’s capacity to repay the IMF hinges on strong policy implementation,” the report stated.
