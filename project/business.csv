'Retired judges not keen on heading tribunals': Union minister Jitendra Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/retired-judges-not-keen-on-heading-tribunals-union-minister-jitendra-singh/articleshow/124022859.cms,"Union minister Jitendra Singh (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Union minister Jitendra Singh said Saturday that administrative members had to be allowed to head Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) benches as not many retired judges and senior judicial officers were keen to accept post-retirement assignments in the tribunal. Addressing the 10th All India Conference of CAT, Singh said the job offer was not attractive or they had more lucrative avenues at hand.""We can't talk much about this because if we do then judges will get angry. If a common man gets angry, then the judge can reprimand him. But if a judge gets angry, no one can reprimand him,"" he said.CJI BR Gavai said govt must improve the service condition of judicial and administrative members of CAT to attract more retired judges and judicial officers to take up the assignments.CAT comprises a chairman and members who can be drawn from the judicial field or administrative side, the latter usually being experienced public administrators.Ahead of his remarks on CAT administrative members being averse to ruling against govt, the CJI said, ""nowadays one does not know how his statement would be portrayed in social media"". He was reflecting on his recent brush with the untamed communication medium's portrayal of his remarks while dismissing a PIL seeking restoration of the decapitated idol of Lord Vishnu at Khajuraho.The CJI's remark appeared to be a riposte to Singh who said though late Arun Jaitley was against making administrative members head the bench on the ground that they would not know how to write judgments, he was convinced by 2-3 senior bureaucrats that senior civil servants, after a service of 30-35 years, are well acquainted with service laws and can write judgments. ""We brought an amendment allowing administrative members to head CAT benches,"" the minister said.The CJI also said judges must exercise their powers with humility and responsibility. Referring to a two month-old incident of a young lawyer fainting in the courtroom after being rebuked by a Bombay HC judge, Justice Gavai said, ""Due to conduct of some judges, there is discontent among lawyers. A young lawyer lost consciousness after being browbeaten by a HC judge. Lawyers and judges are equal partners in the justice delivery system and both need to collaborate for efficient functioning of the justice delivery mechanism. ""CJI Gavai, law minister Arun Ram Meghwal, Singh and attorney general R Venkataramani were on the same page on rising litigation in CAT despite its 95% disposal rate. All three agreed that bureaucrats need not authorise appeal against every CAT judgment. The CJI suggested a screening mechanism through a nodal officer to eliminate unnecessary filing of appeals, to which both Meghwal and Singh agreed.Singh said the govt had fixed 40 indices for categorisation as 'aspirational districts', a concept which he said is being replicated in other countries.",Union minister Jitendra Singh said administrative members had to be allowed to head Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) benches.

Poll Do you think Paramjit's detention is justified based on his past infraction? Yes, he should face consequences. No, the punishment is too harsh.

Kept inside airport for five days, taken to emergency room

'We are lost,' says Paramjit's brother





Paramjit Singh, an Indian who immigrated to the US more than 30 years ago, has been detained by the ICE and kept in custody for over a month now. Paramjit is a green card holder and has been doing business in Fort Wayne, Indiana, for the last three decades. He was detained at Chicago O'Hare Airport on July 30 as he was returning from a trip to India, as he makes trips to India several times a year.Singh's attorney Luis Angeles toldthat his detention was absolutely illegal and that the government is increasing his health risks as Singh has a brain tumor and heart issues.But why was Singh arrested in the first place? His attorney and family members said that the government cited an incident from the past when Singh used a pay phone without paying. It was a ""minor infraction for which he has already taken full accountability, served his time, and paid his debt to society,"" Angeles said.Also read: EB-5 investment visa cap reached for 2025, green card route paused till September 30 Narrating the harrowing details of what happened since Singh was detained, his family members revealed that he was kept inside the airport for five days. His health condition deteriorated to the point where he had to be taken to the emergency room. His family was not notified about his health and they only came to know when the ER bill was sent to them.""As a lawful permanent resident (green card holder), Mr Singh should never have been detained in the first place, as he has always followed the rules to the letter. We often hear the mantra of ""follow the rules"" to achieve legal status in this country. Well, that's exactly what he did: he entered the United States lawfully, adjusted his status properly, built his American dream through hard work, and has been a significant contributor to his community,"" his attorney said.Paramjit’s brother Charanjit Singh told WPTA that they were trying to post the bond after he won the bond hearing, but alleged that the DHS was using delaying tactics to keep him in detention. ""We're just trying to post the bond, we're just trying to speak to someone, trying to communicate with someone. We're lost,"" the brother said.","Paramjit Singh, an Indian who immigrated to the US more than 30 years ago, has been detained by the ICE and kept in custody for over a month now.

"Rs 70,000 crore schemes to regain India's maritime power",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rs-70000-crore-schemes-to-regain-indias-maritime-power/articleshow/124020212.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

NEW DELHI: In a move to build India’s maritime power, reduce dependence on foreign ships and be future-ready to face any supply chain disruption, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced three schemes entailing govt investment of over Rs 70,000 crore to boost the shipbuilding sector. These are a part of the govt’s agenda to propel India into the top 10 countries globally for both shipbuilding and ship ownership, and increase three-fold the share of global port cargo at Indian ports.At present, India ranks 16th globally in both shipbuilding and ship ownership, and only 7% of Indian-owned ships are built in India. Data also shows that the share of export-import (EXIM) cargo carried on Indian ships has declined sharply from 41% in FY1988 to just 5% in FY2023.In his address at Bhavnagar on Saturday, PM Modi said this has resulted in India paying approximately Rs 6 lakh crore annually to foreign shipping companies for their services—an amount nearly equivalent to the country’s defence budget.While the government will provide financial aid to shipbuilders under the Rs 25,000-crore Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Scheme, the Rs 25,000-crore Maritime Development Fund will enable players to get long-term and low-cost financing.The third scheme — Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SDS), worth Rs 20,000 crore — will focus on providing capital assistance for greenfield shipbuilding mega clusters, through infrastructure support for common maritime facilities and land connectivity; capital aid to existing shipyards for capacity expansion; and establishment of an apex body for capability development.Sources said the programme has been finalised after drawing from the experience of major maritime nations such as China and South Korea, which have become top players in shipbuilding on account of govt-led financial support and cluster-based development. The schemes, having the potential to create nearly two crore direct and indirect jobs, are set to get Cabinet approval in the next two weeks.Officials said the SDS is crucial as it seeks to support the Indian shipbuilding industry in capacity and capability creation, and provide credit risk covers, something available in other countries. At present, only eight out of 61 shipyards in India are large or very large.On May 14, TOI had reported that the government has identified four land parcels of 2,000-3,000 acres each in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu for developing greenfield shipbuilding and repair hubs.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced three schemes to boost the shipbuilding sector.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over the appreciable jump in states’ debt highlighted by the CAG, Congress said the public debt of states has tripled in the last decade, rising from Rs 17.57 lakh crore in 2013 to Rs 59.60 lakh crore in 2022. The party said the states are victims of “coercive federalism” being followed by the Modi government which is not sharing revenues with them as desired, accusing the centre of playing “cess politics”.AICC spokesman and Rajya Sabha MP Randeep Surjewala said the public debt of states now amounts to 23% of the combined GSDP of 28 states, but the states are being stripped of their fiscal independence through the Modi government’s handling of the GST Compensation Cess and arbitrary central levies. He said this has resulted in “double jeopardy” for states of mounting debt and shrinking revenues.“Rs 1,70,000 crore is collected every year from ‘cesses and surcharges’, but the centre keeps it without sharing anything with states. ‘Compensation Cess’ was created to pay the states for GST losses, which ended in June 2022. Now, the same cess is only used to repay Central loans. Beyond Oct 2025, there is no constitutional mandate to continue with it, yet the Centre wants to hold it exclusively,” he said, demanding that the Centre share the cess with the states for the coming ten years.Surjewala said there appears to be a deliberate attempt to cripple the states and hollow out their functionality, to unionise power in the hands of the Centre. “This is ‘coercive federalism’ that seeks to convert the states into ‘glorified municipal committees’,” he added.The Congress MP warned that post rate cuts, GST collections will dip steeply in the future, with the shortfall likely to be Rs 40,000 crore as per the Centre and Rs 80,000 crore as per the SBI, while other estimates peg it at Rs 1.5-2.5 lakh crore. “The states will lose half or more of this, but neither GST nor Cess will flow to them,” he said.",The public debt of states has tripled in the last decade.

Most PAPs seek girls and those aged 0-2 years, leaving older children and those with special needs under-placed. As many as 2,554 children adopted in FY 2024-25 were girls, accounting for 56% of all adoptions in India.""One reason is, more girls are given up than boys, making them available for adoption,"" said Vinita Bhargava, formerly with Cara as its founder member.A senior women and child development (WCD) dept official said, ""Some parents believe girls are more caring and affectionate, and are more likely to look after their parents in old age. Some feel girls adapt more easily to family life. Social awareness and single women often preferring to adopt girls are other reasons.""Many PAPs believe it is easier to build emotional connections with infants and younger children. The official said, ""For some, adopting younger children provides greater scope to shape their values, personality and upbringing. Others want to experience the entire parenting journey - from infancy to adulthood.""For older children, adoptions become trickier. ""Children above seven are harder to place, though many older children are legally free and waiting,"" said social worker Jayprakash Jadhav from Arun Ashray Charitable Trust, a specialised adoption agency registered with Cara. For children with special needs, challenges increase. According to a WCD ministry report, only 364 kids with special needs were reserved for adoption in 2024. The WCD official said, ""Adopting older children and those with special needs may involve challenges like attachment issues, behavioural concerns or certain medical requirements.""","Over 36,000 prospective adoptive parents (PAPs) are on the waiting list at present.

NEW DELHI: Counting sports facilities as community resources, Supreme Court has said these cannot be concentrated in the hands of the rich and elite in urban areas even though many youngsters from poor rural backgrounds have stormed into the national sporting arena by the dint of their talent and resolve.While finalising the constitution of All India Football Federation on Friday, a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi said, ""It is also necessary to ensure that sporting facilities and opportunities are not concentrated in the hands of the urban economic elite, and that the revenues from sporting events, intellectual property and media rights are so distributed to subserve and encourage accessible and affordable sport in our country. ""Writing the judgment, Justice Narasimha said the time is ripe to recognise that sporting ""facilities and opportunities"" are ""material resources of the community"", and the regulating bodies of different sports as ""the institutions of national life"".""As 'places of public resort', sporting institutions and bodies must remain accessible, not just for pursuing sport, but also for its administration.

""Unlike rights that can be enforced through law, fraternity is not amenable to judicial command; it must be nurtured through lived experiences of unity, trust, and shared endeavour.

NEW DELHI: Government said Friday it had taken note of the US state department statement announcing revocation of sanctions waiver for Chabahar Port , adding that it is examining its implications for India.India has been actively working with Tehran since 2015 to develop Chabahar Port in Iran, as it provides India an alternative and reliable maritime access route into Afghanistan, and to Central Asia utilising the Zaranj-Delaram road it built in Afghanistan.Looking to isolate Iran, the US earlier this week revoked the sanctions exception issued in 2018 under Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act (IFCA) for Afghanistan reconstruction assistance and economic development, effective Sept 29, 2025.“Once the revocation is effective, persons who operate the Chabahar Port or engage in other activities described in IFCA may expose themselves to sanctions under IFCA,” said the state department, leading to concerns in India about how the decision might impact India’s involvement in developing the port that is also important to counter China’s expanding presence in the region. India has committed to providing a Line of Credit worth $250 million in rupee equivalent for the development of Chabahar Port.","India has been actively working with Tehran since 2015 to develop Chabahar Port in Iran.

Kapoor directed Yes Bank to invest in ADA Group companies despite warnings, and funds were allegedly siphoned out.

MUMBAI: The CBI Thursday filed a chargesheet against Anil Ambani, chairman of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group, along with Rana Kapoor, co-founder of Yes Bank, and the latter's wife, Bindu, and daughters, Radha Kapoor & Roshni, for fraudulent loan transactions that resulted in a loss of Rs 2,797 crore to the bank.The chargesheet says the bank under Kapoor's directions invested in debentures and commercial debt paper issued by ADA's commercial finance (RCFL) and home finance (RHFL) companies despite a credit ratings agency placing them ""under watch"" for poor performance. It says the funds were subsequently siphoned out and, in a ""quid pro quo"", the Yes Bank promoter's family-run firms received massive loans from ADA companies.CBI has previously investigated several others for defrauding Yes Bank, including DHFL's erstwhile promoters Kapil Wadhawan and his brother Dheeraj Wadhawan.In a press release issued on Thursday, the CBI said it had filed a chargesheet pertaining to two cases related to fraudulent transactions between Anil Ambani's group companies, Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd (RCFL) and Reliance Home Finance Limited (RHFL), and Rana Kapoor, his wife Bindu Kapoor, and their daughters Radha Kapoor and Roshni Kapoor and companies owned by them.The chargesheet named Anil Ambani, Rana Kapoor, Bindu Kapoor, Radha Kapoor, Roshni Kapoor, RCFL, RHFL (now Authum Investment & Infrastructure Ltd), RAB Enterprises Pvt Ltd, Imagine Estate Pvt Ltd, Bliss House Pvt Ltd, Imagine Habitat Pvt Ltd, Imagine Residence Pvt Ltd, and Morgan Credits Pvt Ltd. The chief vigilance officer of Yes Bank had lodged complaints with the CBI in 2022 against the Anil Ambani-led companies and Rana Kapoor.According to the CBI, Yes Bank invested approximately Rs 2,045 crore in non-convertible debentures and commercial debt paper issued by RCFL and Rs 2,965 crore in non-convertible debentures and commercial papers of RHFL. These investments were made with the approval of Kapoor, despite Care Ratings placing ADA Group's financial companies ""under watch"" due to deteriorating financial standing and adverse market assessment. The CBI said Anil Ambani was the chairman of ADA Group and also served as a director of Reliance Capital Ltd, the holding company of RCFL and RHFL.The CBI stated that ""funds invested in RCFL and RHFL by Yes Bank were subsequently siphoned through multiple layers, demonstrating a systematic diversion of public money."" The investigation revealed a ""conspiracy between Rana Kapoor and Anil Ambani"" and that ""as quid pro quo, Anil Ambani, the then Chairman of ADA Group, obtained credit facilities from RCFL and RHFL at concessional rates for Rana Kapoor's loss-making family entities, i.e. , companies owned by Bindu Kapoor, Radha Kapoor and Roshni Kapoor.""The CBI further stated that the ""fraudulent arrangement resulted in a massive wrongful loss to Yes Bank amounting to Rs 2,797 crore and corresponding unlawful gain to RCFL, RHFL and other companies of ADA Group, as well as companies owned by Rana Kapoor's family members.""Additionally, Reliance Nippon Mutual Funds (RNMF), another subsidiary of Reliance Capital Ltd, on instructions from Anil Ambani, invested Rs 1,160 crore during 2017-18 in non-convertible debentures of Morgan Credits Pvt Ltd, an entity owned by Rana Kapoor's family.","CBI files chargesheet against Anil Ambani, Rana Kapoor, and Kapoor's family for fraudulent loan transactions.

Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive'

What is changing?

“America’s loss will be India’s gain”

Offshoring will accelerate

More talent will return to India



US voices of concern



Trump's H1B Visa Shock: How It Will Hurt America, Not Just India | I Witness

The India angle







US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a hefty fee of $100,000 on H-1B visas has triggered widespread debate.Indian industry leaders, political voices and community representatives have all weighed in, warning that the move could backfire on the US while benefiting India.On Friday, Trump signed a proclamation introducing a mandatory fee of $100,000 on H-1B visas, effective from Sunday.Currently, H-1B filing fees range from $2,000 to $5,000, depending on the employer's size. The visas, valid for three years and renewable, are widely used by American companies to bring in highly skilled foreign professionals, many from India.Trump defended the decision as a measure to protect American jobs, arguing that outsourcing firms have used the programme to replace US workers with cheaper foreign talent. He described it as both an economic and national security issue.Former Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant was among the first to react strongly. “Donald Trump’s 100,000 H-1B fee will choke US innovation, and turbocharge India’s. By slamming the door on global talent, America pushes the next wave of labs, patents, innovation and startups to Bangalore and Hyderabad, Pune and Gurgaon,” he wrote on X.Kant argued that India now has an opportunity to harness the expertise of doctors, engineers and scientists who may otherwise have chosen to work in the US.Infosys veteran and investor Mohandas Pai said the cost would discourage fresh applicants. “It has got limited application, because... it doesn’t apply to all the H-1B visas which are already there. So there could be only impact for anybody applying in future, new applications will come down. Nobody’s going to pay $100,000, that is very true,” Pai was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.He added that US firms will increasingly shift work offshore, boosting India’s Global Capability Centres.“Now what will happen is everybody will work to increase offshoring... because it doesn’t make sense, first, you don’t get talent, second the costs are too high. That will happen over the next maybe six months to one year,” he said.Entrepreneur and Snapdeal co-founder Kunal Bahl also weighed in, saying the new rules would prompt many skilled professionals to return home.“Because of the new H-1B rules, a tremendous number of talented individuals are going to be headed back to India,” he wrote on X.“It will no doubt be tough in the beginning to move base, but will work out for them given the tremendous opportunities in India. The talent density in India is going up”, he added.In a separate post, he shared his personal account and wrote, “In 2007, sitting at my desk in Microsoft I got an email that my H1B visa was rejected. It was crushing and numbing at that moment, but life-changing eventually when I moved back to India. To those impacted today, be positive. There is something much bigger & better in store for you.”The move has also faced backlash within the US. Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi called it “reckless” and “unfortunate,” saying America risks cutting itself off from high-skilled workers who have historically powered its economy, according tor PTI.Community leader Ajay Bhutoria, based in Silicon Valley, warned that such a fee would deter top global talent, adding that it could weaken the region’s technology ecosystem.While Indian professionals looking to work in the US face an additional barrier, experts believe the long-term impact could be positive for India. With higher visa costs deterring mobility, companies may expand operations in India itself, fuelling growth in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and Gurgaon, as Kant pointed out.As Pai noted, salaries for H-1B workers are already high, often above $100,000, so the perception that the programme imports cheap labour is misplaced. Instead, the new rules may end up shifting innovation and startup growth to India.Data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) shows how significant Indian and global firms are in the H-1B ecosystem. For FY2025, Amazon topped the list with 10,044 approvals, followed by TCS (5,505), Microsoft (5,189), Meta (5,123), Apple (4,202) and Google (4,181).Other major beneficiaries included Cognizant, JP Morgan Chase, Walmart, Deloitte, Infosys, LTIMindtree and HCL America. Experts warn that the $100,000 fee could affect both Indian IT services and US tech giants that rely heavily on this talent pool.Trump’s proclamation may score political points domestically, but experts hav cautioned that it could erode America’s competitive edge. As Amitabh Kant summed up, “America’s loss will be India’s gain.”For India’s tech sector, this may well be the push that accelerates its transformation into a global innovation hub.","US President Donald Trump's decision to impose a hefty fee of $100,000 on H-1B visas has triggered widespread debate.

ESPN planned a transition before Molly Qerim’s contract expired

Salary expectations and ESPN’s financial focus played a key role

Molly Qerim’s sudden exit from ESPN’s First Take left many fans surprised, given her strong presence and years of consistency as co-host alongside Stephen A. Smith. But new details have shed light on the decision, showing that it was less about controversy and more about timing, business priorities, and financial realities at the network.Burke Magnus, ESPN’s head of content, recently addressed the matter, clarifying that Qerim’s contract was already set to expire by the end of the year. According to him, the company had long been considering a shift. “She was going to come off First Take either way and that was something [where] we had already crossed that bridge,” Magnus explained.He emphasized that the network wanted to expand Qerim’s versatility by getting her involved in other projects, rather than tying her exclusively to one show. Importantly, he praised her character and work ethic, stating, “She’s an awesome person,” while noting, “You know, it’s business.”Behind the scenes, salary dynamics also influenced the decision. With Stephen A. Smith recently signing a $105 million deal averaging $21 million per year, ESPN executives were reluctant to commit major dollars to Qerim’s role. While respected, her co-hosting duties were seen as replaceable by someone who could perform the same function at a lower cost.Reports indicate ESPN is now preparing for a 30- to 45-day casting process to find Molly Qerim’s successor, though no replacement names have been officially revealed.Also Read: ""Early next year"": Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s wedding could arrive sooner than fans expecte For loyal viewers, Molly Qerim’s departure marks the end of an era.

Intel's $20 billion mistake now becomes survival strategy

XElectron Techno Review: Turn Any Wall Into a 200-Inch Screen





Twenty years after Intel rejected buying Nvidia for $20 billion, the roles have completely flipped: Nvidia is investing $5 billion in its struggling former takeover target and rescue Intel through a strategic chip partnership. The deal announced Thursday sees Nvidia purchasing Intel stock at $23.28 per share—a 6.5% discount—while the companies collaborate on PC and data center processors. Intel will embed Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics into consumer chips and manufacture specialized processors for Nvidia's AI systems.The partnership crystallises one of tech's most dramatic power shifts. Intel, once Silicon Valley's undisputed chip king with double Nvidia's revenue as recently as 2022, now has a market value under $100 billion. Nvidia has exploded to over $4 trillion, making it the world's second-most valuable company.Back in 2005, then-Intel CEO Paul Otellini pitched acquiring Nvidia to his board, recognizing that graphics chips might revolutionise data centers. Directors balked at the unprecedented price tag and Intel's poor acquisition track record, instead backing an internal project called Larrabee that burned hundreds of millions before collapsing in 2009.Nvidia seized the moment Intel missed. While Intel clung to traditional processors, Nvidia anticipated the AI revolution, developing specialised chips perfect for machine learning before ChatGPT made headlines. When tech giants raced to build AI infrastructure, they turned to Nvidia's ready-made solutions.Today, Nvidia approaches $200 billion in annual revenue—soon earning more each quarter than Intel generates yearly. Its data center business alone dwarfs entire chip companies.Intel has desperately chased the AI wave through acquisitions like Nervana Systems ($400 million) and Habana Labs ($2 billion), but gained little ground against Nvidia's dominance. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who replaced the ousted Pat Gelsinger this year, admits Intel won't compete with Nvidia's high-end systems ""anytime soon.""The Nvidia partnership represents pragmatic surrender disguised as collaboration. Intel acknowledges it needs the company it once could have owned to remain relevant in computing's AI-driven future.""This historic collaboration tightly couples Nvidia's AI stack with Intel's x86 ecosystem,"" said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, diplomatic language for Intel's dependence on its former potential acquisition target.The investment follows recent lifelines, including government backing and SoftBank's $2 billion injection as Intel struggles to fund its manufacturing ambitions.Intel shares jumped 22% after Nvidia announced $5 billion investment in the chipmaker.",Intel rejected a $20 billion bid for Nvidia in 2005.

Soon after the Trump administration issued an executive order imposing a $100,000 fee on all H-1B visa applications, a move that has caused significant concern within the Indian IT industry, former NITI Aayog CEO and G20 Sherpa, Amitabh Kant, has stated that the new fee will ultimately serve to “choke US innovation and turbocharge India's.”In a post on X, Kant argued that by “slamming the door on global talent,” the US is pushing a massive wave of development toward India's major tech hubs.“America’s loss will be India’s gain,” Kant wrote, adding that the move presents an opportunity for India's best doctors, engineers, scientists, and innovators to contribute to the nation's growth and its vision of a “Viksit Bharat.”“By slamming the door on global talent, America pushes the next wave of labs, patents, innovation and startups to Bangalore and Hyderabad, Pune and Gurgaon,” he said, as these cities are home to offices of global tech giants like Google , Microsoft, and Infosys.“India’s finest Doctors, engineers, scientists, innovators have an opportunity to contribute to India’s growth & progress towards #ViksitBharat. America’s loss will be India’s gain,” he emphasised.President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose a $100,000 fee per H-1B visa petition for workers outside the US. The order, which takes effect on September 21, 2025, accuses companies of using the H-1B visa programme to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour.“Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields,” the order said.The new policy aims to direct higher prevailing wage levels for H-1B workers and prioritise those who are high-paid and highly skilled, signaling a dramatic shift in US immigration policy.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose a $100,000 fee per H-1B visa petition for workers outside the US.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

In response to the White House proclamation on H-1B visas, major US firms including Amazon , Meta, Microsoft, and JPMorgan have issued urgent advisories asking employees on H-1B visas to return to the US before the Sept 21 deadline.Microsoft’s advisory, shared shortly after the proclamation, warned of the risk of being denied re-entry into the US if employees travel abroad. “While the proclamation does not reference H-4 dependents, we also recommend that H-4s remain in the US,” the company said. The note also added that while “there is other content about the pause in processing H-1B petitions for individuals who are outside the US,” the company does not interpret this to immediately affect extensions of H-1B status or changes of status for those already in the country.The company urged overseas staff to make immediate travel arrangements to return before the deadline. “This guidance is being positioned as a precaution to avoid disruptions to personal and professional plans,” the note said.

Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’



New Yorkers too busy to notice Richard Branson with a mic



Billionaire’s rejections spark laughter and praise online

British billionaire Richard Branson, best known as the adventurous founder of the Virgin Group, recently experienced an unusual moment on the bustling streets of New York City. While promoting his latest initiative, Doorbell of Dreams, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews, only to be repeatedly ignored. Despite his global fame and media presence, New Yorkers brushed past him as though he were just another man with a microphone or a street performer. The incident, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly went viral on Instagram, sparking amusement, admiration, and lighthearted commentary online. What began as a fun campaign to encourage everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas turned into an unexpected lesson in humility, showing that even billionaires are not immune to everyday rejection, unpredictability, public scrutiny, or the realities of life outside celebrity circles.During a lighthearted promotional event, Branson attempted to stop pedestrians for quick interviews. Despite his global reputation, most passersby ignored him, hurrying along as though he were just another stranger with a microphone.The unusual moment, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly gained traction on Instagram, showing the tycoon facing rejection after rejection.This unexpected moment wasn’t just a publicity stunt; it was part of a campaign to promote “Doorbell of Dreams.” The initiative, launched by Branson in partnership with Squibb’s startup HelpBnk, invites everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas in under 60 seconds.What makes the concept unique is its accessibility. Through a specially designed video doorbell, aspiring entrepreneurs can present their ideas, with the hope of receiving mentorship, guidance, or even investment. Originally launched in the UK, the project recently expanded to New York, where Virgin Hotels partnered as a venue for participants. The street interviews were meant to spark curiosity among locals and draw attention to the campaign.The video shows Branson politely approaching strangers with the question, “Can I ask you a question?” But instead of engaging, people brushed him off. One woman walked by without so much as a glance, while another looked briefly at him before rushing away, clearly preoccupied with her own thoughts and errands.For a man who has conquered industries from airlines to space travel, being ignored on the sidewalk was a rare and humbling experience. Squibb, amused by the scene, remarked, “A bit of rejection is healthy.” Branson laughed at himself and replied, “I’m not doing too well, am I?” Eventually, a passerby did agree to share his dream, stating his goal was to achieve financial independence, help others, and contribute positively to the world in meaningful ways.Once uploaded, the clip drew widespread attention on social media. Many users were stunned that a man of Branson’s stature could blend so seamlessly into the crowd. One viewer commented, “Richard Branson getting rejected? Unbelievable!” Another wrote, “Imagine ignoring one of the world’s most inspirational entrepreneurs who’s just asking you a simple question.”The rejections, however, were not seen as embarrassing but rather refreshing. Viewers praised Branson’s good-natured attitude and willingness to step into unfamiliar situations despite his status. A popular comment read, “This is what humility looks like. Sir Richard Branson has every reason to stay in his comfort zone, but he still pushes himself.”","Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’ While promoting his latest initiative, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews.

UAE mirrors US Fed's rate cut

Impact on borrowing costs, sectoral outlook

Real Estate: Falling mortgage rates may reignite demand in Dubai’s property market, especially among first-time buyers and investors seeking leveraged exposure.



Retail and Tourism: Lower interest rates can boost disposable income and spur consumer demand, supporting domestic consumption and inbound travel.



SMEs and Corporates: Easier access to cheaper financing may encourage business expansion, especially for small and medium enterprises and capital-intensive industries.





Why the UAE Dirham is pegged to USD





What is a currency peg?





Reduced exchange rate risk in trade and investment



Greater price stability in imported goods



Enhanced investor confidence due to currency predictability





Behind the Fed's move

Slowing job gains



A slight uptick in the unemployment rate, although it remains relatively low



Moderated economic growth in the first half of 2025



Elevated inflation, particularly in core categories









In a significant shift aligned with the US Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy easing, the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has reduced its base interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.15%, effective September 18, 2025. The rate cut marks the UAE’s response to changing global economic signals and is expected to lower borrowing costs, potentially stimulating sectors like real estate, tourism, and small business growth, while also impacting savings and investment preferences.On September 18, 2025, the Central Bank of the UAE lowered the Base Rate applicable to the Overnight Deposit Facility (ODF) by 25 basis points, from 4.40% to 4.15%. This move directly followed the US Federal Reserve’s decision the previous day to reduce its Interest Rate on Reserve Balances (IORB) by the same margin.The UAE’s base rate, which serves as a floor for overnight money market interest rates, is anchored to the Fed’s IORB. Given the UAE dirham’s long-standing peg to the US dollar, changes in US interest rates are typically mirrored in the Emirates to maintain monetary stability.In addition to adjusting the base rate, the CBUAE announced that it would maintain the spread for borrowing short-term liquidity from the central bank at 50 basis points above the base rate across all standing credit facilities.This is the first interest rate cut in the UAE since the Fed’s last policy shift in December 2024, when rates were reduced to a range of 4.25%–4.50%. With the current adjustment, the Fed’s target federal funds rate now stands at 4.00%–4.25%, the lowest level since November 2022.The UAE’s rate cut is expected to translate into lower borrowing costs, with wide-ranging implications for consumer spending, business investment, and credit activity.Key sectors likely to benefit:Conversely, traditional savers and fixed-income investors may feel the downside. Returns on fixed deposits and bonds are likely to decline, pushing individuals and institutions toward riskier asset classes such as equities or real estate.Stock markets, especially those rich in growth and dividend-paying companies, are expected to benefit from the rate environment, although volatility may persist due to lingering global macroeconomic uncertainties.The UAE’s monetary policy is heavily influenced by its currency peg to the US dollar, a regime that has been in place since 1997. The exchange rate has been fixed at 1 USD = 3.6725 AED, offering a stable foundation for trade, investment, and macroeconomic planning.The peg plays a crucial role in simplifying oil trade transactions, given that oil exports are globally priced in US dollars. This alignment shields the UAE from exchange rate volatility and enhances confidence among international investors.A currency peg, or fixed exchange rate, is a mechanism by which a country’s central bank maintains its currency’s value at a constant rate against a foreign currency or a basket of currencies. The primary benefits include:As of 2024, 12 countries peg their currencies to the US dollar, with the UAE being one of the most prominent examples in the Middle East.Because of this peg, monetary policy independence in the UAE is limited. The Central Bank typically aligns its interest rate decisions with the Fed to maintain the stability of the peg and prevent capital flight or currency arbitrage.The US Federal Reserve’s rate cut on September 17, 2025, was its first of the year, driven by growing signs of a cooling labor market and persistent political pressures, including tariff-related inflationary concerns.According to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), recent economic data pointed to:The Fed emphasized that further policy adjustments will be contingent on incoming data, the evolving economic outlook, and risk assessments. This suggests a cautious but flexible approach to monetary easing in the months ahead.","The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has reduced its base interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.15%, effective September 18, 2025.

Indian-origin Australian Labor leader Parwinder Kaur is going viral for her recent speech amid anti-immigrant protests in her country as she said Indians are more Australians and South Asians share deep ancestral links with Aboriginal Australians. Kaur made the speech in parliament on September 9 where she cited DNA and genetics study,“As per DNA evidence, and it goes back not just a few generations but approximately 141 generations, the people and the community who were targeted, particularly because of the number of migrants in this country, which is my community, the South Asian community, or the Indian community in general, has genes that are integrated in the very first people of this nation,” she said.Kaur said some Aboriginal Australians carry up to 11 per cent of their ancestry from Indian migrants. Indian genes have been integrated into the very first people of this nation, Kaur said adding that the debate as to who is more Australian and how that should be defined should stop. ""...because if we are looking for evidence, the evidence is very, very clear,"" Kaur said.Then she cited documents and claimed that 8.6 million Australians were born overseas.Migrants hold nearly half of Australia's STEM jobs, she said, adding that over 40% of doctors and 35% of nurses were trained overseas. ""By 2050, migration will make the Australian economy 40% larger than it would otherwise be....These are hard facts that migrants do not take from Australia; they make Australia,"" she said.Kaur drew flak as critics claimed that she suggested that Indians are more Australian than the Whites.""This woman only migrated to Australia in 2007.

'India's Biggest Enemy...': PM Modi Roars After U.S’ H-1B Fee Jolt; Gives This Message To Trump

Viral videos show panic on board



Tech firms urge caution



Steep hike from current fee







A wave of panic gripped Indian H-1B visa holders and applicants across the United States on Saturday, with scenes of chaos unfolding at airports after US President Donald Trump signed a proclamation imposing an unprecedented USD 100,000 fee on H-1B visa petitions.At San Francisco International Airport, several Indian passengers allegedly disembarked from an Emirates flight just minutes before takeoff, fearing they might not be able to return to the US if they left. The flight was reportedly delayed for over three hours as ground staff scrambled to manage the sudden exits.Videos circulating on X and Instagram, though not independently verified by TOI, showed a cabin packed with Indian nationals. Passengers could be seen in panic after news of the H-1B visa fee hike began spreading.“An international flight packed with Indians (coming for Durga Puja) from Bay Area had completed boarding & was due to leave SFO Airport, when the news about H-1B visa new rules just broke out. Indians aboard panicked, pleaded to get off the plane,” one X user posted.The proclamation has triggered widespread anxiety in the Indian diaspora.Several major US firms — including Microsoft, Amazon and JP Morgan — reportedly urged employees on H-1B visas to return to the US before September 21 or avoid international travel altogether to prevent potential visa complications.Currently, the cost of filing an H-1B petition ranges between USD 2,000 and 5,000, depending on employer size and other factors. Trump’s order has raised it to a staggering USD 100,000 for new petitions, a move experts say could devastate Indian professionals and companies that rely heavily on the visa programme.The H-1B visa, particularly popular among Indian tech workers, is typically issued for three years and renewable for another three years.","U.S. President Donald Trump signed a proclamation imposing an unprecedented USD 100,000 fee on H-1B visa petitions.

US President Donald Trump’s decision to increase visa sponsorship fees has triggered concern from the US Chamber of Commerce, which warned of widespread consequences for workers, families, and businesses. Trump signed an Executive Order raising the fee for companies sponsoring H-1B applicants to $100,000, a sharp jump from the current level of around $2,000 to $5,000.“We’re concerned about the impact on employees, their families, and employers. We’re working with the Administration and our members to understand the full implications and the best path forward,” the Chamber of Commerce said in response.The proclamation, which takes effect immediately, stipulates that the total fee for three years of H-1B sponsorship will amount to $300,000, according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The move is part of Trump’s broader effort to crack down on immigration, with the White House arguing that the visa system has been exploited to undercut American workers. Trump said the H-1B programme, designed to bring in specialised, high-skilled talent, had been abused to replace Americans with “lower-paid, lower-skilled labour,” undermining both economic and national security.India, which has long been the largest beneficiary of the H-1B programme, reacted with concern.“This measure is likely to have humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families,” External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, adding that the government hoped “these disruptions can be addressed suitably by the US authorities.” New Delhi has instructed its missions to assist Indian nationals attempting to return to the US before the new rules come into force.Industry groups have also warned of major disruption. Nasscom, representing India’s $283 billion IT sector, said: “A one-day deadline creates considerable uncertainty for businesses, professionals, and students across the world. Policy changes of this scale are best introduced with adequate transition periods, allowing organisations and individuals to plan effectively and minimise disruption.”Indians account for more than 70 per cent of H-1B visa holders, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The sudden fee hike is expected to affect Indian technology companies most severely, with both Indian and American industries now weighing the implications as they look for ways forward.","The US Chamber of Commerce has warned of widespread consequences for workers, families, and businesses.

Aid meant for relief diverted? Pakistan funding reconstruction of LeT HQ destroyed in Op Sindoor; what intel says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/aid-meant-for-relief-diverted-pakistan-funding-reconstruction-of-let-hq-destroyed-in-op-sindoor-what-intel-says/articleshow/123878923.cms,"Intel Reveals Pak Using Aid To Rebuild LeT HQ Hit In Op Sindoor, Experts Say ‘Time To Strike Again’

Poll Do you believe the reconstruction of LeT's Markaz Taiba is a threat to regional security? Yes, it poses a significant threat. No, it will not impact security.

How India destroyed LeT HQ



Why its reconstruction is a matter of concern?







Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba, which was destroyed in precision airstrikes during Operation Sindoor on May 7. According to ANI, citing an agency dossier, LeT has launched fundraising campaigns under the pretext of flood relief to support the redevelopment project.Moreover, Islamabad has already allocated PKR 4 crore, though the group estimates costs at over PKR 15 crore. The dossier stated that its army and ISI remain involved in sustaining and reviving LeT.Senior commanders Maulana Abu Zar and Yunus Shah Bukhari are overseeing the project, due by February 2026, mirroring past cases where LeT diverted humanitarian aid, including most of the 2005 earthquake relief, to militant infrastructure.This comes amidst Pakistan's continuous assertions on global platforms that it was combating terrorism.The Indian Air Force (IAF), earlier this year, showcased the extensive damage caused to LeT Muridke headquarters during Operation Sindoor, highlighting the precision and reach of the strikes.Muridke, home to LeT’s Markaz Taiba, was identified as a critical target. The strikes hit senior leadership residential areas and office buildings where commanders convened for planning and operations.The IAF showed videos captured directly from the weapons, pointing out the level of devastation within the complex.The airstrikes reportedly killed around a dozen high-value terrorists, including Yusuf Azhar, the IC-814 hijacker, Abu Jundal (also known as Mudassar), the Muridke chief of LeT, and the son of the planner of the 2016 Nagrota attack. The operation, conducted in retaliation for the Pahalgam killings, reinforced India’s ability to carry out precise, high-impact missions inside enemy territory.The ongoing reconstruction of LeT Markaz Taiba headquarters has raised serious concerns regarding regional security, given the facility’s central role in training and radicalizing terrorists. Established in 2000, the complex serves as both a residence for senior commanders and a training ground where recruits are instructed in intelligence gathering, arms handling, and other operational skills. Analysts warn that reviving the facility could strengthen LeT’s operational capabilities and enable the recruitment of new militants.Markaz Taiba functions as the “alma mater” of LeT, providing courses that combine physical and arms training with ideological indoctrination. The center attracts recruits from within Pakistan and abroad, using religious and radicalization programs to cultivate loyalty and operational skills among future militants. Its facilities, including a mosque and guest house financed by Osama bin Laden, underscore the longstanding support the organization has received from international terror networks.The scale of the operation at Markaz Taiba further amplifies the threat. The facility reportedly trains around 1,000 students annually, preparing them for operational roles within LeT. Past evidence has shown that graduates of this center have gone on to participate in high-profile attacks, including the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, highlighting the direct link between the facility and acts of cross-border terrorism targeting India.LeT’s historical connection with Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus adds another layer of concern. Senior commanders at the facility, including those who oversaw training for the 26/11 perpetrators, have operated under the guidance of the ISI.","Pakistan is financing the reconstruction of Lashkar-e-Taiba’s (LeT) Muridke headquarters, Markaz Taiba.

EU Chief Kaja Kallas To India: Rethink Moscow Ties Or Risk Free Trade Agreement With European Union





The UK has carried out its first deportation under a new returns treaty with France, with home secretary Shabana Mehmood calling it an “important first step” in efforts to curb illegal English Channel crossings.“This is an important first step to securing our borders. It sends a message to people crossing in small boats: if you enter the UK illegally, we will seek to remove you,” Mehmood said Thursday. She added that the government would continue to challenge “last-minute, vexatious” attempts in court, and stressed that Britain would continue to provide refuge through “safe, legal and managed routes — not dangerous crossings. ”According to UK home office sources, the deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August. He was flown on a commercial flight to Paris under the “one-in, one-out” deal signed with France. Once returned, he will be offered a voluntary repatriation scheme to India; refusal would bar him from applying for asylum and could result in enforced removal.The pilot agreement, which began in August and will run until June 2026, allows the UK to deport migrants who arrive illegally while accepting an equal number from France through a new safe and legal asylum pathway, subject to strict eligibility and security checks.The first arrivals under this reciprocal route are expected in Britain in the coming days.Official data show that 2,715 Indian nationals were in UK immigration detention as of August — more than double last year’s figure, an increase of 108 per cent. The deported man is among the first group of migrants held by UK Border Force since the treaty came into force.According to the home office, more than 35,000 people with no right to remain were removed from the UK in the past year, with returns of foreign criminals up 14 per cent and asylum-related removals up 28 per cent.","The deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August.

Air India issues advisory







A cyberattack on a third-party service provider has disrupted check-in and boarding systems at several European airports. London’s Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin airports are suffering widespread flight delays and cancellations, airport authorities confirmed on Saturday. Air India also issued a travel advisory for passengers flying out of London’s Heathrow.According to Brussels airport, the cyberattack rendered automated check-in and boarding systems inoperable, forcing airlines to switch to manual processing, which significantly impacted operations.“This has a large impact on the flight schedule and will unfortunately cause delays and cancellations of flights,” the airport said in a statement on its website. “The service provider is actively working on the issue and trying to resolve the problem as quickly as possible,” it added.By 10:30am on Saturday, 10 departing flights from Brussels Airport had been cancelled and 17 others were delayed by over an hour, according to airport spokesperson Ariane Goossens, reported Politico.London’s Heathrow airport also issued a statement, attributing the disruption to a “technical issue” at a third-party supplier, Collins Aerospace.The provider of check-in and boarding systems for multiple airlines worldwide, is facing a technical issue that could lead to delays for departing passengers.A spokesperson for Collins Aerospace said the company had become aware of a ""cyber-related disruption"" affecting their MUSE software at certain airports, and added that they are ""actively working to resolve the issue and restore full functionality to our customers as quickly as possible.""""The impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations,"" they added.Passengers were advised by the affected airports to check with their airlines before heading to the airport.Berlin Airport published a notice on its homepage warning travellers of longer waiting times at check-in, citing a technical issue at a system provider operating across Europe. It added, “We are working on a quick solution.”Frankfurt Airport, however, confirmed it had not been affected by the disruption.An official from Zurich airport’s operations control centre confirmed that the airport remains unaffected by the issue.The extent of the cyberattack is yet to be disclosed. Airports across Europe continue to monitor the situation closely.Air India, which operates flights from London Heathrow, issued a travel advisory warning of possible delays. In an update on X, the airline said, “A third-party passenger system disruption at Heathrow may cause delays in the check-in process. Our ground teams in London are working to minimise inconvenience. Passengers flying with us from London today are advised to complete their web check-in before arriving at the airport to help ensure a smooth experience. ”The airline assured passengers that additional staff were on the ground in London to manage the disruption.Authorities and airlines across Europe have not disclosed the extent of the cyberattack or given a timeline for restoring full operations, though airports said they continue to monitor the situation closely.","A cyberattack on a third-party service provider has disrupted check-in and boarding systems at several European airports.

'Forget Free Trade Pact': Top EU Diplomat Sounds Warning To India Amid Trump Tariff War





BRUSSELS: The European Union should slap new sanctions on Russia's exports of liquefied natural gas, its shadow fleet of aging oil tankers and major energy companies over its war on Ukraine, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday.""It is time to turn off the tap"" on LNG, von der Leyen said in a video statement outlining her commission's new sanctions proposals. They must be endorsed by the 27 EU countries before they can enter force.""I now call on member states to quickly endorse these new sanctions. We want Russia to leave the battlefield and come to the negotiation table, and this is the way to give peace a real chance,"" she said.The bloc has already agreed on 18 packages of sanctions against Russia, but getting final agreement on who and what to target can take weeks.More than 2,500 ""entities"" including banks, ministries, energy companies and officials have already been hit.The officials include President Vladimir Putin and his associates, scores of Russian lawmakers and several oligarchs. Travel bans and asset freezes are the most common measures.Energy revenue is the linchpin of Russia's economy, allowing Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.Von der Leyen insisted that EU sanctions are having an impact. ""Russia's overheated war economy is coming to its limit,"" she said, noting in particular constant high inflation in Russia.In a separate statement, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the aim is to usher in ""a full prohibition of Russian LNG imports by January 2027"".Europe is the biggest buyer of Russia's LNG cargoes, taking about half of what Russia exports. Russian LNG took up about 16% of the EU's total LNG imports last year. EU members Hungary and Slovakia have opposed any phase out and could pose an obstacle to the sanctions move.The commission also proposed targeting 118 additional vessels from Russia's shadow fleet of ships transporting oil, bringing the total hit to over 560.""Major energy trading companies Rosneft and Gazprom Neft will now be on a full transaction ban, and other companies will also come under an asset freeze"" if the measures are endorsed, the head of the EU's executive branch also said.Part of the plan would be to go ""after those who fuel Russia's war by purchasing oil in breach of the sanctions,"" she said. Von der Leyen said that the commission wants to ""target refineries, oil traders, petrochemical companies and third countries including China"".The sanctions would also include export restrictions on ""items and technologies"" that can be used on the battlefield. A further 45 companies in Russia and elsewhere would be hit, for ""providing direct or indirect support to the Russian military industrial complex"", the commission president said.Kallas added that another idea is to make it easier to go after people involved in abducting Ukrainian children. Russia has faced international condemnation over the deportation of Ukrainian families, including many children, since 2022.""Tearing children from their families and deporting them to re-education camps is beyond description. We will not let Russia weaponise childhood itself,"" Kallas said in a post on social media.","EU should slap new sanctions on Russia's exports of liquefied natural gas, its shadow fleet of aging oil tankers and major energy companies.
