Visuals of former Andhra Pradesh chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy's office-residence have emerged showcasing unprecedented grandeaur of a luxurious seaside mansion on Rushikonda hill in Visakhapatnam.The coastal property, which critics call Andhra's ',' features four extensive blocks spread across 10 acres.The Rushikonda structure, which Chandrababu Naidu 's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) says was initially proposed as Reddy's camp office, now features lavish interiors with gold accents, Italian marble floors, premium furniture, bright chandeliers and bathtubs.The facility boasts comprehensive infrastructure including well-constructed roads, drainage networks, substantial water supply and a 100 KV electrical substation.Similar to Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal's ',' Andhra Pradesh's new administration faces uncertainty regarding the building's utilisation. The renovation of Kejriwal's official residence at Flagstaff Road, Civil Lines - which the BJP used effectively against him in elections - cost Rs 33 crore, up from the initial Rs 7.9 crore estimate.According to TDP, the project's purpose changed multiple times during development - initially presented as a luxury hotel, then proposed as the chief minister's camp office, and later suggested as a tourism venture.Despite receiving CRZ (Coastal Regulatory Zone) approval from central authorities in May 2021, concerns exist about the extensive demolition of Rushikonda hill during construction.The project, initially presented as a premium hotel with a Rs 91 crore budget, has reportedly exceeded Rs 500 crore upon completion, according to TDP assertions.The Comptroller and Auditor General's report suggests that including furnishings would significantly increase the total cost.","Jagan Mohan Reddy's seaside mansion on Rushikonda hill in Visakhapatnam features four extensive blocks spread across 10 acres.

The Union law ministry has asked a district court in Ahmedabad to deliver a summons issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to billionaire Gautam Adani over alleged securities fraud and a $265 million bribery scheme, according to a letter dated Feb 25, seen by Reuters.The summons, issued under Hague Service Convention that does not allow the serving of legal documents directly to defendants in India, would require Adani or his legal counsel to appear in the case in the US, said Indian lawyers.Adani and the law ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Adani Group has, in the past, termed the allegations ‘baseless’ and vowed to seek all possible legal recourse’. The summons does not imply an extradition risk for the businessman, according to a lawyer. “Extradition proceedings only come in to the picture if the US court issues warrants of arrest,” said Malak Bhatt, founding partner at NM Law Chambers.However, Arshdeep Khurana, a criminal lawyer in India, said, “The summons seems to be for appearance in a court in New York. If service is effected through the Indian court, the respondents will have to appear.""","The summons would require Adani or his legal counsel to appear in the case in the US.

NEW DELHI: Govt told the Lok Sabha on Wednesday that 13,000 more general tickets than the daily average were sold at New Delhi railway station on Feb 15, the day 18 people died because of a crowd rush. “On Feb 15, approximately 49,000 general tickets were issued from New Delhi railway station, which were 13,000 more than the daily average number of tickets sold during the previous six months,” railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in a written reply to TMC member Mala Roy.The minister, however, stressed that “to cater to this extra” (demand), five Kumbh special trains , each with room to accommodate 3,000 passengers, were operated from NDLS. He also pointed out that “unreserved tickets issued from a particular station on a particular date may or may not be for that station and date”, in a reference to the usual practice of passengers buying tickets well ahead of the travel date.Five trains were sufficient for 15,000 extra passengers,” the minister said. Railways has since transferred the divisional and additional divisional managers of Delhi along with the station director and senior divisional commercial manager pending completion of an inquiry into the crowd rush.Roy had asked for “details of average general rail ticket sale in New Delhi railway station per day during the last six months; the number of general rail ticket sale from New Delhi railway station on Feb 15, 2025; and whether sale of tickets was abnormally high, and, if so, the reasons thereof ”.In his reply, Vaishnaw gave details of how unreserved tickets can be procured through various ticketing counters and not necessarily at the station counter. “Unreserved tickets for distance up to 199km can be procured on the same day while advance period for procuring unreserved tickets for a distance of 200 km and above is three days.Further, from a railway station, unreserved tickets can be issued for the journey originating from any of the cluster stations defined in the system, viz from New Delhi railway station, unreserved tickets can be issued for the journey originating from any of the 57 stations of Delhi area,” he said.","13,000 more general tickets than the daily average were sold at New Delhi railway station on Feb 15, the day 18 people died because of a crowd rush.

BENGALURU: Forget Chandrayaan, Isro. If you really want to test lunar terrain, just get your mission vehicles to take a drive down Bellandur's crater-riddled roads! This was the new cry that echoed in the IT hub Wednesday.With deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar scheduled to visit Bellandur at 4pm, hundreds of residents hit the road at Devarabeesanahalli near Sakra Hospital. Waving placards that read, ‘No Need for Moon Mission, Isro — Just Drive Here!', frustrated residents chanted ""Beku beku, road beku."" That Shivakumar did not turn up only left them angry and frustrated.""This road has been in a terrible condition for the last six months,"" said Kusum Sahay , an elderly resident, adding, ""There are no pavements for pedestrians, and stepping out of a car itself is a challenge.""Venkat, another resident, fumed over the neglect of one of the city's key localities. ""We are the creme de la creme of Bengaluru, yet infrastructure here is cringe-worthy. This is a major road connecting Koramangala and Indiranagar — how hard is it to fix it quickly?""A resident of Mantri Espana highlighted the daily struggle. ""We moved here two years ago hoping things would improve, but nothing has changed. Just yesterday (Tuesday), I took my father to an eye hospital — a seven-minute drive took 20 minutes because of these crater-sized potholes. For elderly people, walking to Sakra Hospital is impossible. We are forced to take cars even for short distances, and that just adds to the traffic chaos.""Kanchana Ganeshan, another protester, recalled how she used to cycle on the lake road four years ago. ""Now, I wouldn't dare. What used to be a smooth ride turned into a bone-rattling nightmare. Every day, travelling just seven kilometres is an ordeal.""Rajesh Narka, representing Bellandur Rising 2025 initiative, called for swift action. ""Bellandur is home to some of the biggest IT hubs, yet the roads are in a shambles. We take pride in our city, but we cannot be expected to tolerate this mess. If the govt really wanted to fix this, it wouldn't have taken long.""Joginder Yadav, a resident, pointed to the irony of last-minute patchwork before the DCM's scheduled visit. ""BBMP suddenly laid gravel and sprinkled water just because a minister was expected. Illegal parking, footpath encroachments and lack of traffic lights make things worse. We pay our taxes — we contribute to nation-building. Even though many of us are migrants, the govt should remember ‘Atithi Devo Bhava' and give us basic infrastructure in return,"" he said.","Hundreds of residents hit the road at Devarabeesanahalli near Sakra Hospital.

The creator of the symbol, Thiru Udhay Kumar, is the son of a former DMK MLA.""The second of four children, Udaya Kumar was born to N Dharmalingam, a contractor, and Jayalakshmi in 1978 in Chennai. While doing his bachelor's in architecture from Anna University, he designed posters and publications that helped him define his calling — visual design.""I realised Indian scripts don't have their design repertoire. After two years of trying to create something new in Tamil typography, I realised that I shouldn't work on my own. I needed expert guidance and hence, came to Industrial Design Centre at IIT-Bombay,"" Kumar told TOI in an earlier interview.Designing the simple-looking Indian rupee symbol did not come easy for Udaya Kumar.""I spent endless nights on trial and error. The symbol had to have universal design features while staying Indian in spirit,"" Kumar told TOI.That explains the propensity of his symbol towards the Latin letter form, 'R' for rupee, and the stroke across the top curve, parallel to the 'shirorekha', the line heading the alphabet in Devanagari script. ""Most international currencies have double strokes such as the Australian dollar, Korean yen, the Euro or the Lira.

NEW DELHI: Diplomatic ties between India and Bangladesh may have nose-dived since Sheikh Hasina’s ouster last year, but the military relationship continues as before. The navies from the two countries have just concluded a combat exercise and coordinated patrol in the Bay of Bengal this week.The bilateral 'Bongosagar’ exercise, in which Indian destroyer INS Ranvir and Bangladeshi frigate BNS Abu Ubaidah took part, facilitated “collaborative responses to shared maritime challenges” and enhanced interoperability between the two navies, an officer said on Thursday.The latest edition of the annual exercise, which began in 2019, involved a range of complex operations encompassing surface firing, tactical manoeuvres, underway replenishment, communication drills, and VBSS (visit, board, search and seizure) operations.“The exercise provided a wonderful opportunity for both navies to develop closer links in tactical planning, coordination and information sharing for undertaking seamless maritime operations,” the official said.“The enhanced synergy of operations between the two navies is a testament to the shared commitment of countering global security challenges towards enhancing security and stability in the region,” he added.India has steadily stepped-up military ties with Bangladesh, which incidentally acquired its first-ever diesel-electric submarines from China a few years ago, to counter Beijing’s strategic inroads into the country. Around 50-60 Bangladesh Army officers, for instance, attend specialized courses in Indian military establishments every year.Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had recently said that India and Bangladesh consider each other “strategically important” neighbours and any kind of “animosity” between the two countries is not in the interest of either. The relationship between the two militaries is “very strong” and “we are able to exchange notes whenever we want,” he said.Gen Dwivedi, however, had expressed “concern” over reports that a Pak Army-ISI delegation recently visited areas in Bangladesh close to the `Chicken's Neck’ or the Siliguri Corridor in West Bengal.“I had used the word epicenter of terrorism for a particular country (Pakistan). Now those countrymen, if they go to any other place and they happen to be our neighbour, as far as I am concerned, I should be concerned about it. That they should not be able to use that soil to send terrorists to India,” he said.Also read: 'Sheikh Hasina coming back as PM': Awami League leader thanks India, says Bangladesh youth 'made mistake'","The navies from the two countries have just concluded a combat exercise and coordinated patrol in the Bay of Bengal.

The century-old Dravidian movement protected Tamil and its culture through awareness and protests.""Meanwhile, BJP's Tamil Nadu chief K Annamalai criticised the DMK government's decision, stating, ""The DMK government's state budget for 2025-26 has replaced the Rupee symbol, which was designed by a Tamilian and adopted nationwide as part of our currency.

While traveling from India to Dubai, people are curious about the legal restrictions on carrying gold. Whether you are carrying gold for personal consumption or as a gift, it is important to know the customs rules and duties to prevent any legal issues. India has certain regulations regarding the amount of gold you can carry, and carrying more than that can lead to heavy fines or confiscation. In this comprehensive guide, we'll take you through the main customs rules, gold duty rates, and advice on avoiding running afoul of Indian laws while carrying gold. Stay updated to make your trip smooth and problem-free.As per the CBIC guidelines, Indian passengers returning from Dubai after a stay of more than six months can bring up to 1 kg of gold with them. However, as per Economic Times report, this is allowed only if they pay the applicable customs duty. The gold can be in the form of jewelry, coins, or bars. It is important for travelers to carry proper documentation, such as purchase invoices, that provide details on the price, purity, and date of purchase. These documents are required for verification during customs clearance at Indian airports, ensuring the process goes smoothly and in compliance with regulations.Men returning to India from Dubai are allowed to carry up to 20 grams of gold, with a maximum value of Rs 50,000, duty-free. If they exceed this limit, customs duty will apply.Women are allowed to bring up to 40 grams of gold, valued at Rs 1 lakh, without paying customs duty. The gold can be in the form of jewelry, bars, or coins for personal use. Any quantity over this limit will incur customs duty.Children are also allowed to carry up to 40 grams of gold as gifts or for personal use, provided they show proof of relationship and proper invoices.The customs duty on gold can vary depending on how long a traveler has stayed in Dubai.Travelers staying in Dubai for more than six months may also benefit from a reduction in customs duty, with a remission of 12.5% and an additional 1.25% social welfare surcharge on gold brought back to India.The customs duty for gold bars and coins depends on their weight.The customs duty is calculated based on the international price of 24K gold on the day of import. Customs officers assess the value of the gold and apply the corresponding duty rate. To avoid complications, it’s crucial to have accurate invoices and certificates for purity and weight. As per reports from Economic Times, If the proper documentation is not provided, the traveler may face penalties, including confiscation of the gold.If you’re carrying more gold than the duty-free limit allows, you must declare it at the airport. Passengers should use the Red Channel for declaring goods and paying any applicable customs duty. The Green Channel is only for those who are carrying goods within the permissible limits. As per the Customs Act, 1962, failing to declare excess gold can lead to confiscation, penalties, and possible legal action.","Men returning to India from Dubai are allowed to carry up to 20 grams of gold, with a maximum value of Rs 50,000, duty-free.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi chief minister's Office (CMO) on Thursday announced that its official X handle, which was ""not properly handed over"" by the outgoing AAP government, has now been restored to the new BJP-led administration of Rekha Gupta .The controversy erupted last month after the handle was renamed "" KejriwalAtWork "" following the BJP’s victory in the February 5 assembly elections. The BJP, which won 48 of the 70 seats, accused former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of ""hijacking"" the official account and sought Lt Governor VK Saxena’s intervention.In a statement on X, the Rekha Gupta-led CMO said, ""The previous government had not handed over the @CMODelhi handle properly. As per X’s rules, this handle is now under the Chief Minister's Office and will share official updates.""Earlier, the CMO had formally requested X to restore control of the handle.

NEW DELHI: India and Mauritius upgraded their ties to an Enhanced Strategic Partnership as PM Narendra Modi held formal talks with his counterpart Navinchandra Ramgoolam, reaffirming commitment to a free, open and secure Indian Ocean and pledging full support for the security of Mauritius’s Exclusive Economic Zone, including through increased deployment of ships and aircraft.Modi also advanced the vision of ‘Mahasagar’ ( Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions) for the Global South, 10 years after he announced India’s ‘Vision Sagar’ (Security and Growth for All in the Region) from the same strategically located Indian Ocean country that, he said, connects India to the wider Global South.It shall encompass the ideas of trade for development, capacity building for sustainable growth, and mutual security for a shared future. Under this, we will extend cooperation through technology sharing, concessional loan and grants,” Modi said, describing Mauritius also as a special partner in the region.Modi’s meeting with Ramgoolam was followed by signing of eight agreements and several announcements, including construction of a new Mauritius Parliament building by India, which Modi said would be a gift from the “mother of democracy”.India had last year welcomed the UK-Mauritius agreement for Mauritian sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago, which houses a US-UK military base, and Modi reiterated India’s “firm support” for Mauritius on this issue. Ramgoolam thanked Modi for his personal support and engagement with global representatives on this issue, according to a joint statement that described the two countries as natural partners.“We fully respect the sovereignty of Mauritius with regard to Chagos. We will extend our cooperation through forums such as the Colombo Security Conclave, Indian Ocean Rim Association, and Indian Ocean Conference,” Modi said in his media statement after the meeting.India also announced a rupee-denominated line of credit amounting to Rs 487 crore for undertaking the replacement of water pipelines in Mauritius. “It is the first-ever Indian rupee-based line of credit that’s being extended by India to any country and, therefore, a significant development,” foreign secretary Vikram Misri said.Modi laid special emphasis on defence and maritime security cooperation, calling it a key pillar of the strategic partnership and committing to fulfil all the needs of the local coast guard. “India shall also assist in setting up of the police academy and National Maritime Information Sharing Centre in Mauritius. Cooperation will be further strengthened in white shipping, blue economy, and hydrography,” he said.According to the joint statement, Ramgoolam thanked Modi for “unwavering support” to Mauritius in protecting its vast EEZ through provisioning of defence and maritime assets, regular deployment of ships and aircraft, conducting joint maritime surveillance, hydrographic surveys and patrolling, bilateral exercises and information sharing and training support, “thereby emerging as a significant security provider for Mauritius”.The representatives also agreed to deepen cooperation towards securing the EEZ of Mauritius, including through enhanced utilisation of a new runway and jetty on the Agalega islands that India has built amid increasing Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean.The representatives called for ratifying the protocol on amendment of double taxation avoidance agreement, which was signed last year, at the earliest “to harmonise with international standards on treaty abuse, after ongoing discussions are concluded”. Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said Mauritius had sought some clarification and those had been addressed by India at a very high level. “Our aim is to set at rest all doubts and provide satisfaction to our friends and colleagues from Mauritius that they have a good and a solid agreement on this front… we very much hope that Mauritius will complete its internal processes at the soonest, and the protocol will come into force very quickly,” he added.",Modi also advanced the vision of ‘Mahasagar’ ( Mutual and Holistic Advancement for Security and Growth Across Regions) for the Global South.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel has flagged that the housing and urban affairs ministry may not be able to spend over Rs 50,000 crore of the Centre’s allocation for the second phase of its urban rejuvenation scheme , AMRUT, even after the tenure ends in March 2026. It has also highlighted how the ministry is unable to utilise funds for the National Urban Digital Mission (NUDM) as the cabinet has not yet approved it, despite it being announced in the last budget.The panel, in its report on the ‘Demand for Grants for 2025-26’ tabled in both Houses of Parliament on Wednesday, stated that the public bus transport scheme, which was announced in the 2021-22 Budget, was approved by govt only in Aug 2023 as the PM-eBus Sewa Scheme . The funds under this scheme were, “for the first time, actually spent during the financial year 2024-25”.Similarly, the NUDM, which was announced as a new scheme in the July 2024 Budget with an allocation of Rs 1,150 crore for FY 2024-25, has yet to receive cabinet approval. “The funds allocated thus remained unutilised,” it said.On fund utilisation under the AMRUT 2.0 mission, which was launched in Oct 2021 with the target to make cities ‘water secure’ and provide functional water tap connections to all households in all of about 4,852 urban local bodies and universal coverage of sewerage and septage management in 500 AMRUT cities, the panel observed that the size of the scheme was Rs 2.8 lakh crore, including the central share of Rs 76,760 crore for five years (2021-22 to 2025-26). However, only Rs 13,172 crore central assistance has been disbursed so far since the inception of the scheme and the total outlay for 2025-26 is Rs 10,000 crore.“Accordingly, post proposed budgetary allocation of Rs 10,000 crore, the remaining amount of the central share for the mission will be Rs 52,651 crore. The committee has observed that even after the utilisation of the proposed budgetary allocation of Rs 10,000 crore in the FY 2025-26, the mission which is ending in 2026 still has to spend 68% of its centre share of Rs 76,760 crore,” it added.In its report, the panel on PM-eBus Sewa Scheme, which targets to deploy 10,000 electric buses, mentioned that the ministry has informed that the total demand of buses so far tendered for aggregation stands 6,518 from 13 states and four UTs. Flagging concerns, it said the eligibility of buses per city based on the 2011 census may not provide the correct parameter for their allocation.It added that the central assistance (CA) of Rs 24, Rs 22 and Rs 20 per km proposed to be provided for 12, 9 and 7 metre buses is less and may result in increased financial burden on municipal corporations. Similarly, the condition of fixed assured kms of 160, 180 and 200 for 7, 9 and 12 metre respectively needs to be revisited as many municipal buses operate only for 150-160 kms daily.","A parliamentary panel has flagged that the housing and urban affairs ministry may not be able to spend over Rs 50,000 crore of the Centre’s allocation for the second phase of its urban rejuvenation scheme.

NEW DELHI: In past five years, barely 1,525 driving licenses (DLs) were cancelled for committing traffic violations , despite all the talk about efforts to catch violators through digital capture. While 50% of the cancellations occurred in Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Bengal reported only three each, followed by four in Haryana.Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari provided these details in a written response to a question in Rajya Sabha this week quoting data from Sarathi portal, the centralised database for drivers.In reply to a query raised by BJP MP Medha Vishram Kulkarni, the minister said Assam, Bihar, Kerala, UP and Rajasthan recorded cancellations of 104, 158, 119, 105 and 94 DLs, respectively. Only 15 licences were cancelled in Maharashtra.As per the ministry, 463 DLs were cancelled for speed, rash and negligent driving in TN, Rajasthan, Bihar and Gujarat. In UP and Uttarakhand, all 105 and 47 licences respectively were cancelled for use of mobile phones while driving. Total 42 licences were cancelled for overloading of goods and passengers while in 35 cases DLs were cancelled for not wearing helmets.TN is the only state where 14 licences were cancelled for jumping traffic signals and 261 DLs were cancelled for providing fake information to obtain licence. On reasons for such miniscule cancellation of DLs, ex-Delhi deputy transport commissioner Anil Chhikara said, “ While authorities have power to cancel DLs of habitual violators, our RTOs have little time to deal with these cases.”","50% of the cancellations occurred in Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Bengal.

CHENNAI: Opening a new front in the battle of languages, the Stalin govt in Tamil Nadu unveiled Thursday a logo for the state budget to be presented Friday, using the Tamil letter “roo” — which signifies “roobai”, Tamil for rupee — to replace the rupee symbol (₹).Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and TN BJP chief K Annamalai criticised the CM, saying the ‘₹’ symbol, designed by D Udhayakumar, son of former DMK MLA N Dharmalingam, was endorsed by M Karunanidhi, and Stalin was being “stupid”.State planning commission vice-chairman J Jeyaranjan said the rupee symbol was in Devanagari script and it was decided to drop it and use the Tamil letter “roo”. Sharing an old picture of former CM M Karunanidhi appreciating Udhayakumar for the design, Annamalai said on X, “What father endorsed, son rejects.”Sitharaman posted on X: “If the DMK has a problem with ‘’, why didn’t it protest back in 2010 when it was officially adopted under the Congress-led UPA govt, at a time when DMK was part of the ruling alliance at the Centre?” DMK MLA and state planning commission member N Ezhilan countered: “BJP is playing a double game. For a long time they claimed to be giving importance to the mother tongue, and now, when our CM has used ‘roo’ in Tamil for rupee, they are opposing it.”Calling it an “example of language and regional chauvinism”, Nirmala Sitharaman said, “This is more than mere symbolism. It signals a dangerous mindset that weakens Indian unity and promotes secessionist sentiments under the pretence of regional pride.”Udhayakumar, a professor at IIT Guwahati’s design department who designed the official rupee symbol, such a debate was unnecessary. “I used the Devanagari script as the base to design the rupee symbol. It was a competition back then, and I had to stick to the rules of the competition. Devanagari is a script that is used not just by the Hindi language but also by Sanskrit and some minor languages. So, restricting the debate to Tamil vs Hindi in this issue is unnecessary, I think,” Udhayakumar said.Former Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan joined the chorus. “Let Stalin change his name to a Tamil name. To hide all the failures of his govt, this drama continues... DMK always talks of separatism and with an anti-national mindset, they are against national integrity,” she said. Sitharaman said the Tamil word “rupaai” has links to Sanskrit.“The Tamil word rupaai itself has deep roots in the Sanskrit word ‘rupya’, meaning ‘wrought silver’ or ‘a worked silver coin’. This term has resonated across centuries in Tamil trade and literature, and even today ‘rupaai’ remains the currency name in Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka.”Saying the rupee symbol is internationally well-recognised and serves as a visible identity of India in global financial transactions, Sitharaman asked, “At a time when India is pushing for cross-border payments using UPI, should we really be undermining our own national currency symbol?” Sitharaman added that removing “a national symbol like the rupee from the state budget document goes against that very oath that all elected representatives and authorities take under the Constitution — to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of our nation”.Congress steered clear of the controversy triggered by Tamil Nadu’s decision to replace the symbol of rupee which is in Hindi with Tamil letter for “Ru” in the official logo for the state’s budget. Congress kept mum on the issue that played non-stop on television channels on Thursday.Though allies, Congress has chosen to strike a balance between its political partnership and prudence, as DMK has taken a lead in triggering debates around its core issues. Congress has not spoken yet on the three language controversy that DMK has espoused in recent weeks with a strong attack on the Modi govt and BJP.Karnataka deputy CM D K Shivakumar was nominated on Thursday to represent the state in a March 22 meeting convened by Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin in Chennai to firm up a joint strategy against the Union govt’s proposal for population-based delimitation .Shivakumar was picked despite him advocating a nuanced approach to Stalin’s invitation, suggesting he differed with CM Siddaramaiah, who backed the campaign immediately after meeting a TN delegation in Bengaluru. Sources said although Stalin wanted Siddaramaiah to attend the meeting, the latter chose to depute Shivakumar because of a knee injury and some prior commitments.Telangana CM A Revanth Reddy on Thursday termed the proposed population-based delimitation of constituencies an imposed “limitation for southern states” that the region would counter through concerted action, starting with TN counterpart MK Stalin’s March 22 strategy meeting in Chennai.Revanth, who along with Stalin has been among the more vocal opponents of the Union govt’s plan, confirmed he would attend the Chennai conclave. “BJP does not have much representation from the southern states and hence wants to take revenge on these states after its (electoral) defeats in south India,” he said.","Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin releases ‘Economic Survey Report 2024-25’ Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and TN BJP chief K Annamalai criticised the CM, saying the ‘₹’ symbol was endorsed by M Karunanidhi, and Stalin was being ‘stupid’","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118996832,imgsize-126654,width-400,resizemode-4/118996832.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India has identified 388 illegal Indian immigrants in the US since US President Donald Trump launched his mass deportation campaign and all of them have returned to their home country, TOI has learnt. These include the planeloads of illegals who landed in Amritsar and those who returned from third countries, mostly Panama, with help from the International Organisation for Migration .Verification of nationality is an ongoing process, and more are expected to be deported sooner than later, but not before their nationality is confirmed like in the past. For India, whether it’s a million or a few thousand, there’s no way of knowing conclusively how many Indians are living illegally in the US as they become Indian only after verification.While extremely large figures - ranging from 200,000 to 700,000 - have been bandied around about the number of Indian illegals in the US, the government has maintained it has no data about the number of “undocumented” Indian immigrants residing in the US.“The reason is that these immigrants have legally exited India but have either overstayed their US visa validity or have entered the US illegally or without valid documents,’’ said MoS (MEA) Kirti Vardhan Singh, responding to a written question in the Rajya Sabha earlier.Various Indian agencies closely scrutinise the list of persons identified for deportation by the US and only those who have been verified to be Indian nationals are accepted for deportation. Foreign minister S Jaishankar had said in his statement in Parliament that it is the obligation of all countries to accept their nationals living abroad illegally but it is subject to an “unambiguous” verification of their nationality. India has been accepting deportees from the US for the past couple of decades, with the maximum number – 2042 – in 2019. Last year, it took back 1368 illegal Indians.For the Indian government, the real issue remains the need for a crackdown on what Jaishankar had described in his statement in Parliament last month as the illegal migration industry. He had said that law enforcement agencies will take action against agents facilitating illegal migration on the basis of information provided by the deportees.","India has identified 388 illegal Indian immigrants in the US since US President Donald Trump launched his mass deportation campaign.

Kin of victims killed while assisting police in anti-Naxal operations could receive a total compensation of Rs 15 lakh, though the amount in case of permanently disabled is proposed at Rs 8 lakh and for grievously injured, at Rs 4 lakh.The policy promises enhanced financial incentive to surrendered Maoists (doubled to Rs 50,000), including raised compensation for different categories of surrendered weapons and for leading the police to IEDs and arms/explosives dumps.Turning in a light machine gun (LMG) may get the Maoist Rs 5 lakh, up from Rs 4.5 lakh; an AK-47, Rs 4 lakh instead of Rs 3 lakh; and a .303 rifle, Rs 1.5 lakh instead of Rs 1 lakh. Reward of Rs 3 lakh-12 lakh are proposed for new ranks of Maoists, including zonal/sub-zonal committee commander, militia company commander and communication team commander, etc.For rehabilitation of surrendered Maoists and their family members, the policy — which also covers Maoists from outside the state but engaged in LWE activities within Chhattisgarh — offers free education, quota-based admissions as well as scholarships, besides an annual grant up to Rs 25,000 for education in private institutions.The policy proposes jobs and self-employment opportunities as well as preference in govt schemes. Male Maoists undergoing reverse vasectomy will be reimbursed under the policy. Maoists who aid police shall also be eligible for govt jobs.","Chhattisgarh has come out with a comprehensive policy for surrender of Maoists as well as their relief and rehabilitation.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare has recommended that the age criterion for Ayushman Vay Vandana Cards, meant for senior citizens, be reduced to 60 years and above from 70, irrespective of socio-economic status, for wider coverage.The committee, headed by Rajya Sabha MP Ram Gopal Yadav, has also suggested revising healthcare coverage under Ayushman Bharat PM Jan Arogya Yojana from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per family annually. The Centre recently expanded ABPMJAY to cover six crore senior citizens aged 70 and above belonging to 4.5 crore families under AB-PMJAY Vay Vandana scheme.The recommendations have been made in “163rd report on demands for grants 2025-26 (demand no. 46) of the department of health and family welfare” that was tabled before both Houses of Parliament on Wednesday. In addition, it recommends proactive monitoring of fund utilisation by states, coupled with targeted support to address any implementation challenges.The parliamentary committee said the release of funds to states and UTs should be linked to their performance in terms of card creation, hospital admissions, and beneficiary feedback, ensuring that funds are directed to areas of greatest need and impact.“The committee has come across instances of delay in settlement of claims of empanelled hospitals under ABPMJAY and that the package rates have not been reasonably revised in many states, resulting in inconvenience caused to the patients due to denial of treatment by many empanelled hospitals,” it said.Therefore, states and UTs which have not revised package rates “may be persuaded to revise these on similar lines of rates revised by some of states in 2022”, the committee said. On initiatives like ‘Aapke Dwar Ayushman’, the panel said the campaign should not be confined to the creation of Ayushman cards as this is not the only objective of the scheme.Rather, it recommended that the department of health should make efforts to ensure establishing robust healthcare infrastructure and service delivery in tribal and rural areas",The committee has also suggested revising healthcare coverage under Ayushman Bharat PM Jan Arogya Yojana from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh per family annually.

Other violations including improper procurement practices and unauthorised distribution of mobile phones and inducements, were also cited.The President’s order says Sharma’s educational qualification certificates were repeatedly sought during his first term (2017-2022) but were not provided until his tenure ended.

BHUBNESHWAR: In a major relief for investors swindled by Rose Valley chit fund scheme , a PMLA court in Bhubaneswar on Thursday ordered the reimbursement of Rs 332 crore to victims in Odisha.“The special court has released Rs 332 crore of proceeds of crime for restitution to lawful investors,” an Enforcement Directorate official said.ED’s Bhubaneswar division had attached Rose Valley’s bank assets worth Rs 332 crore between 2014 and 2015. The current valuation of these deposits stands at about Rs 450 crore, a source said.The chit fund scheme operated in Odisha, West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura. In Odisha alone, the group fraudulently collected Rs 476 crore, returning only Rs 130 crore to investors. ED had attached Rs 332 crore in bank deposits from the remaining Rs 346 crore.Assets Disposal Committee , constituted by Calcutta HC on May 15, 2015, will oversee the distribution of funds among affected investors. “About 31 lakh Rose Valley Group depositors have registered their claims via www.rosevalleyadc.com,” an ED source said. ED urged investors who have not yet submitted their claims to do so promptly.The agency filed its chargesheet in 2016 against the group chairman Gautam Kundu and his associates.

BENGALURU: In the gold-smuggling case involving Kannada actor Ranya Rao , CBI has left the “accused” column blank in the FIR filed on Thursday, causing ripples in political and bureaucratic circles.The omission gives the agency the flexibility to summon any individual, especially as Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) strongly suspects the involvement of a syndicate in the racket. DRI has documented a series of gold-smuggling cases, including two significant busts in quick succession, both pointing to a well-coordinated network operating between Dubai and India.Opening a new front, Enforcement Directorate (ED) registered a money-laundering case in Delhi and raided Ranya’s Lavelle Road flat along with five other locations in Bengaluru on Thursday. “Assisted by their Bengaluru counterparts, ED officers raided offices linked to Ranya’s husband in Adugodi, Indiranagar, and Koramangala.Several documents and electronic gadgets were seized during the day-long raid,” a source said. On Mar 6, two foreign nationals were arrested at Mumbai airport with 21.2 kg of gold worth 19 crore, just days after Ranya was caught smuggling 14.2 kg of gold into Bengaluru. Subsequent searches at her home led to further recoveries. The scale and frequency of these operations suggest an intricate network potentially involving foreign nationals and possibly high-ranking government officials.The CBI’s probe, under sections 7 and 12 of Prevention of Corruption Act, has raised the stakes. The case could expose deep-rooted corruption within govt circles, particularly officials allegedly aiding such illegal activities.",CBI has left the ‘accused’ column blank in the FIR filed on Thursday.

Raipur: Seventeen Naxalites including the senior Maoist commander Dinesh Modiyam of divisional committee member rank surrendered before Bastar police and CRPF in Chhattisgarh on Thursday. They carried a cumulative cash reward of Rs 24 lakh.Dinesh had reportedly surrendered about ten days ago with his wife and their child and the police have shown them along with other surrendered cadres.The former cadres said to police that they were disappointed with the ""hollow"" and ""inhuman"" Maoist ideology, exploitation of innocent tribals by senior cadres and increasing influence of security forces, Bijapur Senior Superintendent of Police Jitendra Kumar Yadav told reporters in a press briefing.Police said that the most prominent figure to surrender was Dinesh Modiyam, the DVCM of the Gangaloor Area Committee, who had a cash reward of Rs 8 lakh bounty on his head. He surrendered with his wife Jyoti Tati, an ACM with Rs 5 lakh bounty.Surrender of Dinesh along with 16 others is being considered as a big blow to Maoist formation while their spokesperson Samta had already issued a statement accusing Dinesh and wife of eloping with the money of the formation and having surrendered before the “enemies”.Dinesh Modiyam, the surrendered DVCM, made an emotional appeal to his former comrades. He wrote a letter and read it out in the press conference in Bijjapur stating that he has himself written it, “For 20 years, I walked the path of violence and was with the Maoist organization, I thought I was fighting for the rights of Naxalites but it only brought suffering to our people. I urge my brothers and sisters still in the forests to lay down their arms, join the mainstream, and build a better future for our families and villages with the support of the government.”The big Maoist commanders force innocent youths to join the ranks in the name of jal-jungle-jameen and are misleading them, he said, adding that their ideology is full of violence and extortion of money from contractors.“They wish to oppress the tribals and make them slaves and when the villagers object then they get brutally killed. The small cadres often die of hunger, illness. I came out from the darkness to spend a good life in the mainstream and I have got a new life. I appeal to the Maoist cadres to shun the path of violence and come out of the forest to live a normal life and avail the benefits of govt’s surrender and rehabilitation policy,” Dinesh said.Among those who surrendered include a Divisional Committee Member (DVCM), two Area Committee Members (ACM), two Militia Platoon Commanders, a Janatana Sarkar President, DAKMS (Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Mazdoor Sangh) President, KAMS (Krantikari Adivasi Mahila Sangathan) President, two Janatana Sarkar Vice Presidents, a Platoon Deputy Commander, four Janatana Sarkar Members, one GPC (Gram Panchayat Committee) Member.The surrender was facilitated through coordinated efforts by the District Reserve Guard (DRG), Bastar Fighters, Special Task Force (STF), CRPF battalions (85th, 196th, 199th, 222nd), and COBRA units (202, 204, 205, 206, 210). Senior officials, including DIG Dantewada Range Kamalochan Kashyap, SP Bijapur Jitendra Kumar Yadav, and multiple CRPF and COBRA commandants, were present during the formal surrender event.Each surrendered Maoist was given an immediate cash incentive of Rs 25,000 under the state government’s surrender policy.","Seventeen Naxalites including senior Maoist commander Dinesh Modiyam surrendered before Bastar police and CRPF in Chhattisgarh on Thursday.

Little known byrnihat

NEW DELHI: India was the fifth most polluted country in the world in terms of air quality, with Byrnihat in Meghalaya being the most polluted metropolitan area globally last year, according to IQAir’s 2024 World Air Quality Report released Tuesday.Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) which was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards. High air pollution level in the little-known Meghalayan city can be attributed to rapid industrialisation, unregulated emission, construction and deforestation.Though India improved its overall ranking from third most-polluted in 2023 to fifth last year, it had the dubious record of having six of the world’s 10 most polluted cities and 13 of the 20 most polluted cities globally, with Delhi being the most polluted capital in the world in 2024.The report that analysed a critical pollutant particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) data from over 40,000 air quality monitoring stations across 8,954 locations in 138 countries, finds Chad — a central African country — as the most polluted country last year, followed by Bangladesh, Pakistan, Congo and India by exceeding the WHO standards of acceptable limit of that pollutant multiple times.Only seven countries — Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Estonia, Grenada, Iceland and New Zealand — met WHO annual average PM2.5 guideline level of 5 µg/m3.As far as India is concerned, the report finds that the country with the annual average PM2.5 concentration of 50.6 µg/m3 in 2024 reported more than 10 times higher than the WHO PM2.5 annual guideline and over 26% higher than the acceptable limit of the hazardous pollutant as per Indian national ambient air quality standards.The report shows that India saw a 7% decline in PM2.5 concentrations in 2024, averaging 50.6 µg/m3 compared to 54.4 µg/m3 in 2023, but the capital, New Delhi, maintained consistently high pollution levels, with annual average of 91.6 µg/m3, nearly unchanged from 92.7 µg/m3 in 2023.“Overall, 35% of Indian cities reported annual PM2.5 averages exceeding 10 times WHO guideline,” it says. In 2024, air quality data was reported from 371 cities across 11 countries, with India being the most monitored, hosting more than half of central and south Asia region’s stations. The region was home to the top nine most-polluted cities in the world with six of them in India last year.Citing Air Quality Life Index released by University of Chicago in 2023, IQAir’s report noted that air pollution remains a significant health burden in India, reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years.PM2.5, which is smaller than 2.5 micrometers, is considered the most hazardous air pollutant. It can be deposited in lungs, causing respiratory problems and other health issues.","Byrnihat reported an annual average PM2.5 level of 128.2 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) It was more than 25 times higher than WHO-recommended level and over three times more than Indian ambient air quality standards.

Wayne Gretzky was sued for $10M over alleged false claims about a Weight Loss Gum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzky-was-sued-for-10m-over-alleged-false-claims-about-a-weight-loss-gum/articleshow/118879580.cms,"Image via TNT

What is the current status of the lawsuit

Wayne Gretzky, widely regarded as one of the greatest hockey players of all time, found himself at the center of a legal controversy in 2022 when he was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product. The lawsuit, filed by entrepreneur Steven Sparks in Los Angeles, alleged that Gretzky falsely promoted OMG Gum as a weight loss aid, claiming it helped him lose 35 pounds. Sparks, an investor in the product, argued that this statement artificially inflated the value of the company, leading to significant financial damages when the claim was revealed to be untrue.According to the lawsuit, Steven Sparks originally invested in OMG Gum because of its purported benefits and Wayne Gretzky's endorsement. The gum was marketed as a weight loss supplement, with Wayne Gretzky allegedly stating that he personally used it to shed excess weight. Sparks contended that this claim helped boost the product’s credibility and value, ultimately leading him to increase his financial involvement.However, Sparks later learned that Wayne Gretzky’s weight loss statement was false. As a result, he claimed that the company’s value plummeted, and he suffered substantial monetary losses. In response, Sparks filed a $10 million lawsuit against Gretzky, accusing him of fraud and deceptive business practices.While Gretzky was not the creator of OMG Gum, he was closely linked to its promotion. His status as a sports icon and public figure likely contributed to the product’s perceived legitimacy, demonstrating the significant influence that celebrity endorsements can have on consumer and investor decisions.This case highlighted concerns about the responsibilities of celebrities when endorsing products, especially those related to health and wellness. Investors and consumers often rely on such endorsements, assuming that public figures genuinely support and use the products they promote.As of now, there have been no major updates on the outcome of Sparks’ lawsuit against Wayne Gretzky. It is unclear whether the case was settled privately, dismissed, or remains ongoing. If proven, the allegations could serve as a cautionary tale for both investors and celebrities regarding the risks of false advertising and misleading promotions.Also Read: “A scumbag”: Brad Marchand a tongue-in-cheek answer when asked about coming back together with Sam Bennett Gretzky has not publicly commented in detail on the accusations, but the case remains an example of how endorsements, especially from high-profile figures, can have serious legal and financial consequences.","Wayne Gretzky was accused of making false claims about a weight loss product.

"Facebook's ex-COO Sheryl Sandberg 'lied' about boarding flight that crash-landed, claims former employee Wynn-Williams' book",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/facebooks-ex-coo-sheryl-sandberg-lied-about-boarding-flight-that-crash-landed-claims-former-employee-wynn-williams-book/articleshow/118919496.cms,"What Sheryl Sandberg said about taking the San Franciso flight that crash-landed

What Wynn-Williams wrote on Sandberg’s post

Sheryl Sandberg , former COO of Meta, allegedly fabricated a story about narrowly escaping disaster by claiming she had planned to board Asiana Airlines Flight 214 , which crash-landed in San Francisco over a decade ago, killing three and injuring nearly 200 people. This accusation, according to a report in New York Post, comes from Sarah Wynn-Williams , a former subordinate who served as director of public policy under Sandberg for six years at Facebook (as the company was then called). Wynn-Williams makes the claim in her new memoir, Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism, asserting that Sandberg, once Mark Zuckerberg ’s second-in-command, lied about almost being on the ill-fated flight.“Do people really lie about dodging plane crashes?” Wynn-Williams muses in her book. “Why would she? It’s not like Sheryl craves the spotlight.” She adds, “After that, I could never look at Sheryl the same way.”The flight in question departed from Incheon International Airport near Seoul, South Korea, on July 6, 2013, carrying 307 passengers and crew. During its approach to San Francisco International Airport, the Boeing 777-200ER descended too low and too slow, resulting in a catastrophic crash landing. Emergency crews responded swiftly, and most passengers evacuated before flames engulfed the aircraft. Tragically, three people perished—one killed by a rescue vehicle in the chaos — and 187 were injured, many with spinal or head trauma.Shortly after the incident, Sandberg posted on Facebook, claiming she, her family, and several Facebook colleagues had originally intended to take Flight 214. “We switched to United so we could use miles for my family’s tickets,” she wrote. “Our flight was due to arrive at the same time, but we landed about 20 minutes earlier.” In subsequent posts, she reassured followers of her safety and noted that Samsung executive David Eun, a friend who was on the flight, had survived. “Serious moment to give thanks,” she concluded. The post rapidly gained attention, amassing over 3,000 likes in its first hour.Wynn-Williams, however, disputes Sandberg’s account. In her memoir, she recalls seeing news reports suggesting Sandberg and other team members, including then-director of global communications Debbie Frost, were slated to be on the flight—information she says the staff only learned from Sandberg’s post. Skeptical, Wynn-Williams contacted Frost, who allegedly called Sandberg’s claim “totally weird,” pointing out that Sandberg “always flies United” and that Asiana was never an option. “I don’t know why she posted it or tagged us all,” Frost reportedly told her.Frost, when approached by The Post, directed inquiries to her Threads account, where she wrote, “Everyone’s got their own take, but a lot of these stories are blown out of proportion or just didn’t happen.” Wynn-Williams’ book also includes other provocative allegations, adding fuel to the controversy surrounding Sandberg’s tenure.","Sarah Wynn-Williams served as director of public policy under Sheryl Sandberg for six years at Facebook.

Amid the ongoing debate over Tamil Nadu’s language policy, an old video of Google CEO Sundar Pichai has resurfaced online, adding fuel to the controversy. The video, which has now gone viral, features Pichai mentioning that he learned Hindi in school. A tweet accompanying the clip states: “Sundar Pichai, who comes from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, says—‘I learnt Hindi in school’. Sundar Pichai was born in 1972 and learnt Hindi during Congress rule. Clearly, Hindi was the third language in Tamil Nadu.”The resurfaced video comes at a time when DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran is facing backlash for claiming that Pichai studied under Tamil Nadu’s two-language policy and credited the system for his success.Sundar Pichai was born into a Tamil Brahmin family, with his mother, Lakshmi, working as a stenographer and his father, Regunatha Pichai, an electrical engineer at British conglomerate GEC. He pursued metallurgical engineering at IIT Kharagpur, where he excelled academically, earning a silver medal and securing a scholarship to study at Stanford University.Moving to the United States, Pichai completed his MS in engineering and materials science at Stanford. He briefly worked at Applied Materials before pursuing an MBA at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, which he completed in 2002.Pichai’s career at Google began in 2004, following a short stint at consulting firm McKinsey. He initially worked in product management and development, contributing to projects like Google Toolbar and playing a key role in developing the Chrome browser.His leadership quickly gained recognition, and by 2008, he was named vice president of product development. He was promoted to senior vice president in 2012 and, by 2014, became Google's product chief, overseeing the Android operating system along with other major services. His rise within the company set the stage for his eventual leadership at Google and its parent company, Alphabet.","An old video of Google CEO Sundar Pichai has resurfaced online.
