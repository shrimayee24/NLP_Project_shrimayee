If you walk the stage, appear adorned with glory’s grace;





If not, it is better not to appear before the audience.

Poet Kaviyarasu Kannadasan once attended a cultural function at a college. The students presented their poems before him, after which Kannadasan took the stage and recited his own, which were met with thunderous applause. When the clamour subsided, Kannadasan revealed a secret. Before the event, he had swapped his poem with a student’s. What the audience wildly appreciated as his creation was, in fact, the work of an unassuming student. He left them with a profound question:A similar incident unfolded a few years ago at the New York subway. A violinist played for 45 minutes, earning just $30 from passersby. He was Joshua Bell, one of the world’s most celebrated musicians, performing with a 3.5-million-dollar violin. Days earlier, he had performed to a packed Boston theatre, with tickets sold at a premium. The Washington Post orchestrated this experiment to demonstrate how extraordinary talent often goes unrecognised in mundane settings.In our lives, too, artists are often dismissed or disrespected. Consider theplayers at weddings, tirelessly serenading the crowd. They arrive at the wedding halls at the wee hours and play through the ceremony, as guests rush for food. Recently, at one such gathering, a singer with a mellifluous voice sang some of Ilaiyaraaja’s timeless classics —and. After each song, he glanced at the audience, searching for applause but his soulful music dissolved among the chatter of guests eager for. I walked up to him and praised his talent. He did not utter a single word but nodded his head. Did I see a tear quickly wiped by a wink, as he moved to the next song?As elusive as it is, fame may also be a path paved with struggles for some, thrust upon some without merit, and withheld from countless talented souls. I was curious about what Valluvar had said about being famous. One of the couplets under the chapter titled ‘Fame’ intrigued me:At first glance, this couplet seems harsh. Does Valluvar decree that one must already possess fame before facing an audience? How does one attain glory without first enduring the toil of obscurity? History brims with examples of artists who never lived to see their genius celebrated — Van Gogh, who never sold a painting in his lifetime, and Emily Dickinson, whose poetry lay unpublished when she was alive.Some scholars interpret the couplet as a call to be born with fame or not at all. But this misreads Valluvar, who championed equality at birth. Upon deeper reflection, I realised Valluvar wasn’t speaking about artists yearning for recognition, but those in positions of power — politicians and people in high positions — who appear before the public. The common man looks up to them. Valluvar, through this couplet, warns such people: ‘When you are appearing before the people, you better stand tall with deeds of kindness and acts demonstrating ethics.’This understanding is liberating. For the artist, the pursuit of fame need not overshadow the sanctity of their craft. The journey of creation, with its struggles and triumphs, is itself a testament to the indomitable human spirit. Even if fame remains elusive, the artist’s path leaves an indelible mark.","Bharathi Bhaskar explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text 'Thirukkural' Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116287226,imgsize-72358,width-1000,height-562,resizemode-75/116287226.jpg"

But police met with little success as their houses were locked and phones switched off.Jaunpur Kotwali inspector Mithilesh Kumar Mishra said Atul's mother-in-law Nisha and her son Anurag had left their house on a motorbike Wednesday night. When some reporters camping there asked where they were going, Anurag replied his mother was unwell.SEE ALSO: Bengaluru techie suicide: Judge 'asked' for Rs 5 lakh to 'settle the case', says father According to neighbours, the Singhania family had moved in two months ago.

Atul, 34, took his life in his Bengaluru apartment early Monday amid a prolonged legal battle involving divorce, child custody, and a Rs 3.3 crore demand from his estranged wife Nikita Singhania. According to the FIR filed by Atul's brother Bikas, his estranged wife and her family allegedly demanded Rs 3 crore to drop police cases against him and Rs 30 lakh for visitation rights to see his four-year-old son. Bengaluru police registered a case against Nikita, her mother Nisha, brother Anurag, and uncle Sushil Singhania.His lawyer Dinesh Mishra said Thursday he was earning a monthly salary of Rs 84,000 and the family court in Jaunpur had ordered him in July to pay Rs 40,000 a month as maintenance for his son, which he might have found burdensome.Read more: Atul was ordered to pay nearly half his salary as maintenance for his son, says lawyer Atul left behind a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video detailing alleged harassment by Nikita and his in-laws, and accused the family court judge of bias.

Atul might have found the Rs 40,000 payment steep.

""I suspect that his wife and others might have demanded more money from him, forcing him to think that they were blackmailing or extorting him. This very thought could have driven him to take the extreme step."" Atul and Nikita met through a matrimonial site and got married on April 26, 2019, in Varanasi.

HYDERABAD: Indian students studying in Canada have reported receiving emails asking them to resubmit crucial documents such as study permits, visas and educational records, including marks and attendance.The request from Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), a government department that deals with foreign students, caused widespread panic among international students, many of whom hold visas with up to two years' validity.The development comes as IRCC tightens its policies to regulate the influx of international students, introducing stricter financial requirements and exploring potential caps on student admissions. ""I was a bit shocked when I received the email. My visa is valid until 2026, yet I was asked to submit all my documents again,"" said Avinash Kaushik, a postgraduate student from Hyderabad studying in Surrey, British Columbia. ""They even want proof of attendance, marks, where we are working part-time, etc.,"" he added.Last week, a similar surge in such emails was reported among students from Punjab.

NEW DELHI: Chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran on Friday cautioned against suggestions to impose "" billionaire tax "", arguing it may drive away capital from the country and impact investment.""Effects of public policy are often asymmetric. Taxing capital less may not make them invest, but taxing capital more will drive away capital. It's easy to drive capital out, but it is a lot harder to bring back in"" he said at an event. Govt's top economist also raised questions over some of the findings of the studies by economist Thomas Piketty and argued that India had managed to successfully bring a large number of people out of extreme poverty.""Equality of access and opportunities matter more for public policy than equality of outcomes, relatively. Individual skills, attitudes and efforts matter,"" Nageswaran said, while warning that enforcing equality through regulation hurts small businesses as had been seen earlier.He said that a part of Piketty's calculations was based on wealth created in stock markets, but recent evidence suggested that investments in shares had now extended extensively to smaller towns and cities. He also said that there was evidence to suggest that the gap between the top 20 companies and the others was coming down.As Piketty pressed for levy on super-rich across the world and using taxes across countries to fight climate change, Nageswaran countered by saying there was no guarantee wealthy nations would part with the funds.Shamika Ravi, member of the economic advisory council to PM, said that lower taxes had improved compliance, as was evident from the tax department statistics, and suggested that during the decades of high taxes in India there may have been greater evasion.

SC grants prospective bail to ex-WB minister Partha in teachers' jobs 'scam',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-grants-prospective-bail-to-ex-wb-minister-partha-in-teachers-jobs-scam/articleshow/116301624.cms,"SC order points to prospective bail as a new concept

NEW DELHI: Seeking to balance the rights of an accused with the gravity of offence he has been charged with, Supreme Court on Friday granted prospective bail to former Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee from Feb 1 in a money laundering case related to the teachers recruitment 'scam' and directed the trial court to decide on framing of charges and record statements of vulnerable witnesses by then.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan struck an innovative balance to tackle the classical dilemma in administration of justice - while the accused can't be kept in custody indefinitely as that would amount to punitive detention, scales of justice cannot be balanced if affluent and influential accused obstruct probe or tamper with evidence.As part of the reconciliation of the two imperatives, the Supreme Court bench said Partha Chatterjee could continue as an MLA but would not be appointed to any public office during pendency of the trial.The restraint on holding public office is significant as it marks the crystallisation of the judicial reasoning first witnessed in SC's dismay over re-appointment of Senthil Balaji as minister in Tamil Nadu soon after apex court released him on bail in a money laundering case.The order also pointed to the emergence of prospective bail as a new concept as it was only on Thursday that a different bench, while upholding the bail plea of an accused in a money laundering case, ruled that he would not come out for another two months.Chatterjee's right as an accused and his bail plea must be juxtaposed with broader societal harm caused by his alleged action of taking bribe to recruit undeserving candidates as teachers while depriving thousands of deserving candidates their future, the bench said. While passing the prospective bail order, the bench also cited the statement of Arpita Mukherjee, a co-accused in the case, fearing threat to her life from Chatterjee.Prior to release of Chatterjee on bail, the bench said the trial court must decide on framing of charges before Dec 31 and ""fix a date within the second and third week of Jan for recording statements of such prosecution witnesses who are most material or vulnerable. All such witnesses, especially those who have expressed apprehension of danger to their lives, will be examined on these dates"".Asking Chatterjee and his counsel to cooperate with the trial court in recording witness statements, the bench said if the trial court framed charges against him, he would have the right to appeal against it. However, it restrained the appellate court from staying the trial during pendency of the appeal against framing of charges.Fixing an outer limit of Jan 31 for completion of recording of statements of vulnerable and important witnesses, the bench said while Chatterjee would be released on bail on Feb 1, his bail would be cancelled if he was found to have influenced or threatened witnesses directly or indirectly. SC asked him to appear without fail before the trial court on every hearing, and attempts to delay or stall the trial would entail cancellation of bail.Between the cases involving Balaji and Chatterjee, SC may have restored the convention followed until recently when politicians, even powerful ones, resigned as soon as they were chargesheeted. This was followed across the spectrum - those who quit include BJP stalwart L K Advani and RJD boss Lalu Prasad - until others like Manish Sisodia, Anil Deshmukh, Satyendar Jain, Arvind Kejriwal, among others, held on to their respective offices. The repercussions of the court drawing the line afresh may have implications for many who are in office while on bail as well as those who are fancying a return.",Partha Chatterjee could continue as an MLA but would not be appointed to any public office during pendency of the trial.

Judging a woman's virtue based on her attire impermissible: HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judging-a-womans-virtue-based-on-her-attire-impermissible-hc/articleshow/116301147.cms,"Representative image

KOCHI: Judging a woman or making conclusions about her virtue or modesty based on her dress is unpardonable and impermissible in any civilised society, as such judgments stem from rigid patriarchal notions, Kerala high court has held.A bench of justices Devan Ramachandran and M B Snehalatha made this observation while setting aside a family court verdict that granted custody of two children to their father and ruled that the mother was unworthy of their care. The family court concluded that she was of loose morals, as alleged by her husband - on the grounds that she wore ""revealing dresses"", posted pictures on dating apps, spent time with male friends, used abusive language towards her husband and hired a 'hacker' to access her husband's computer.Regretting that such observations were made on the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution, the division bench granted the custody of the two children to their mother. The bench acknowledged how deeply rigid gender roles and patriarchy have permeated society, and emphasised that ""unwritten dress codes"" have a lasting impact on women's lives with the sexualisation and policing of women's clothing starting as early as school. No one has the right to judge a woman based on her attire or her choices in life. Clothing is a form of self-expression and part of an individual's identity or aesthetic expression, it added.HC also noted that the mother celebrated her divorce with a close group of friends, and termed it unfortunate that the ex-husband submitted photographs of her celebrating as part of evidence, and the family court even took that into consideration. The notion that a woman should be sad about a divorce and only happy in marriage is so deeply ingrained that it requires no further explanation, the bench observed, stating that personal opinions must not influence judgments.","Kerala high court sets aside a family court verdict that granted custody of two children to their father and ruled that the mother was unworthy of their care.

SC faults trial judge's move against IPS officer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-faults-trial-judges-move-against-ips-officer/articleshow/116301067.cms,"Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: Ending a 20-year-ego battle between a judicial officer and an IPS officer, Supreme Court Friday quashed summons and bailable warrants issued by a trial judge to then Kurukshetra SP Bharti Arora to show cause why 'her role in letting off an accused in a narcotic drug case be not investigated'.A bench of Justices B R Gavai, Prashant Mishra and K V Viswanathan said the judicial officer issued 7 summonses to her, who was probing the Samjhauta train bomb blast at that time, in a span of 10 days acting in a 'predetermined manner' and forgetting that ""no one would be condemned without being heard"".Justice Gavai said the trial judge ignored Arora's plea that after coordinating the investigations in the train blast case, she was tasked to maintain law and order at a place where the situation had deteriorated due to an agitation.When repeated summonses were being issued to Arora in 2008, who took voluntary retirement in 2021 as IGP, the judicial officer was transferred out on May 26, 2008 and directed to relinquish charge immediately, the judge kept the matter for hearing on May 27, 28, 29 and 30 and on the last day proceeded to type the order but kept in sealed cover to be pronounced by the successor judge.The bench termed this a grave error. ""It is a well-settled principle of law that justice should not only be done but should be seen to be done,"" the bench said, while expressing surprise at HC's decision to uphold the May 30, 2008, order.

But as he claimed innocence before then SP Arora, she ordered an inquiry, and it was found that three persons had planted the drugs on the person arrested. She released the arrested person and ordered proceedings against the three.When a closure report for the case was sent, the special judge rejected it and ordered fresh inquiry, which too returned the same finding as that of the SP. Apparently enraged, the judge rejected that closure report, acquitted the three and convicted the person earlier arrested.

Neuro-robot offers help in epilepsy treatment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/neuro-robot-offers-help-in-epilepsy-treatment/articleshow/116300990.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Around 15 million people in India suffer from epilepsy - a common brain disorder that causes seizures - and about 20%-30% among them are drug resistant. The Neuroscience Centre at AIIMS, Delhi, has devised a unique treatment method using an advanced neuro-robot that can 'pop' the brain and provide succour to millions who don't respond to epilepsy drugs and aren't fit for surgery.The neuro-robot implants multiple electrodes into a patient's brain in a bloodless procedure to identify the area from where the seizures get triggered. Then, the seizures are reproduced again by stimulating the electrodes to reconfirm the point of focus. Finally, the faulty part is burnt or ablated, causing a popping sensation in the brain, thus, stopping the seizures or reducing them.""We have used this technique in over 60 patients suffering from uncontrolled epilepsy,"" professor of neurosurgery at AIIMS, Delhi, Dr P Sarat Chandra, said. Recently, Chandra and his team performed the procedure on a 23-year-old woman, who had been suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy . Tanushree (name changed), who works with an MNC, had visited several doctors and undergone as many as 14 MRIs over nine years, but no abnormality could be detected even as the frequency of her seizures kept increasing.""Through pre-operative investigations including video EEG, MRI, SPECT and PET scans, and magnetoencephalography, we identified the areas of suspicious neural activity in the brain. This data was fed into the neuro-robot, which directed its robotic arm to the right area to place thin electrodes,"" Chandra said.The patient was moved to ICU and monitored for next few days. On day five, she developed five to six seizure episodes, which the implanted electrodes demonstrated were arising from a specific portion of the brain and spreading to the left temporal lobe. This is called periventricular heterotopia (PVH) - small 'lesions' in the brain found next to the ventricle (cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavities in the brain), where the wiring between the neurons had gone 'haywire', constantly short-circuiting & generating abnormal amounts of electricity that spreads to the rest of the brain, leading to epilepsy. In Tanushree's case, PVH was very small, and hence, missed by previous MRIs.To reconfirm, doctors passed a very low-intensity current - similar to what normally passes through neurons - through electrodes to stimulate the PVH.When the electrode in the PVH was stimulated at 10 milliamperes, the patient developed the typical 'staring episode' she used to have during seizures, said professor of neurology at AIIMS, Dr Manjari Tripathi. ""Reproducing seizures with stimulation is a moment of jubilation for us as we now know exactly where the abnormal networks are located within the brain,"" she said.The final part involved burning the PVH around the electrodes using a bipolar current. The patient is conscious and gets a 'popping' sensation as the brain substance around electrodes heats up and coagulates,"" Chandra said. Every electrode costs Rs 1.5 lakh. At AIIMS, they are being done at a fraction of cost with the same technology, and are often permanent cures for epilepsy, Chandra said.","Around 15 million people in India suffer from epilepsy - a common brain disorder that causes seizures.

'

Constitution gave people strength to recognise they have right to justice and are capable of raising voice against government.

Our Independence struggle was a unique one in the world as it was based on truth, non-violence

A few people from the bereaved families of Sambhal had come to meet us. There were two children among them - Adnan and Uzair. One of them was my son's age and the other was younger, 17 years of age. Their father was a tailor. The tailor had just one dream - that he would get his children educated, one son would become a doctor and the other too would be successful. The Police shot their father dead. The 17-year-old Adnan told me that he would grow up to be a doctor and realise his father's dream. This dream and hope was instilled in his heart by the Constitution of India

Government trying to weaken reservation through lateral entry, privatisation

Today, people of the country are demanding that there be a caste census. Colleague of the ruling side mentioned this, the mention is also being made only because of these results in the Lok Sabha elections. The caste census is essential so that we know the condition of everyone and policies can be made accordingly

It is people's demand that caste census is conducted

If not for Lok Sabha poll results, they (BJP) would have begun changing Constitution

BJP talks about past, they should talk what they are doing now; is Nehru responsible for everything

Nehru's name can be erased from books and speeches but not his role in Independence struggle, nation-building

Through lateral entry and privatisation, this government is trying to weaken reservation. Had these not been the results of Lok Sabha elections, they would have also started working on changing the Constitution. The truth is that they are repeatedly speaking about Constitution because in these elections they have come to know that the people of this country will keep the Constitution of this country safe. Winning while almost losing these elections, they have realised that the discussions about changing the Constitution won't work in this country

While our Constitution gave 'protective shield' of unity, seeds of discord and hatred being sown now

Seems PM Modi hasn't understood that it is 'Bharat ka Samvidhan' not 'Sangh ka Vidhan'

NEW DELHI: Newly elected MP from Kerala's Wayanad, Priyanka Gandhi, on Friday gave her first address in Parliament during the debate on the Constitution. Priyanka Gandhi 's maiden speech in the House largely revolved around Constitution , reservation and a push for a nationwide caste census.In the debate that marked the 75th anniversary of the Constitution's adoption, the first-time parliamentarian started off by invoking the father of Constitution Babasaheb Ambedkar to highlight his contribution.The Congress leader then sought to corner the BJP-led NDA government, saying the Constitution is a '(protective shield)but the ""ruling party has made all attempts to break it"". Gandhi pointed to the reduced numbers of the BJP in Lok Sabha elections as forcing them to talk about the Constitution more often. Further she said, had the Lok Sabha elections not gone the way it did, BJP would have started working on changing the Constitution.Gandhi also hit out at PM Modi, saying the PM doesn't understand ""Bharat ka Samvidhan"" but ""Sangh ka Vidhan"".Gandhi also framed the Lateral entry scheme pushed by the government, which is currently under a JPC deliberation, as an attempt by the government to weaken reservations in the country. Reiterating her party's stance, Priyanka Gandhi pressed on the need for a nationwide caste census to know the ""condition of everyone and policies be made accordingly.""""When the entire opposition called for a caste-based census, they talked about cattle and 'mangalsutra' getting stolen,"" she added.Priyanka Gandhi also raked up the Adani issue to hit out at the government, saying it was not ready to debate the US allegation against the industrialist in the House. Gandhi further accused the Modi government of favoring big business intrests over common people and said the ruling dispensation had sold everything to them. ""Country is watching 1.4 billion people being ignored to save one person with all wealth, ports, roads, mines being given to him,"" she charged.Further, Gandhi suggested holding a ballot to resolve ongoing political debates, saying, ""Conduct elections through a ballot, and the truth will be revealed.""Later after the speech, Rahul Gandhi heaped praise for her sister, saying it was a""wonderful speech.

BJP & allies back ONOE bills, say vital to cut costs, synchronise vibrant democracy

NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at streamlining India's electoral process, the Union Cabinet on Thursday approved the ""one nation, one election"" bills, with plans to introduce these during the current session of Parliament.The decision to clear two bills marks a significant step towards synchronising polls for Lok Sabha, state legislative assemblies and local bodies as part of a plan to unburden the executive from the weight of periodic elections and improve decision-making across all tiers of governance.The cabinet nod is to draft legislations to hold simultaneous polls to Lok Sabha and state assemblies. But whether it will turn into the stride to restore the simultaneous elections, which remained in vogue until the Lok Sabha elections and assembly polls were decoupled between 1967 and 1971, remains to be seen.The proposal has been under discussion for years as the idea was to revert to the pre-1967 state when one election was conducted. A panel led by former president Ram Nath Kovind had found that in Maharashtra, almost six months of a particular year were spent in poll-related matters due to multiple elections.While the first bill, which aims at holding simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and state assemblies, will need to be approved by Parliament, the one for local bodies will need the endorsement of at least half the states.BJP and its allies voiced strong support for proposed legislations on the ' one nation one election ' plan, drafted after extensive consultations with political parties and experts and a high-level panel studying electoral processes in seven countries.BJP described the legislations as essential for synchronising India's vibrant democracy with effective cost management and ensuring policy continuity. JD(U) has backed the bill, with party chief Nitish Kumar firmly in support of simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha and assemblies.""The proposed bill will strengthen the country's democracy and is set to be instrumental in making India a developed nation,"" BJP's chief spokesperson and Lok Sabha MP Anil Baluni said. He added the bill was drafted with inputs from independent constitutional and legal bodies and did not infringe upon the basic structure of the Constitution. JD(U) working president Sanjay Jha said, ""Our party welcomes this. We communicated our support to the committee, where I was part of the delegation. Nitish Kumar has consistently advocated simultaneous elections. The constant election cycle disrupts public and developmental work.""Union minister and LJP (RV) chief Chirag Paswan endorsed the move and highlighted its benefits, especially in fostering development.In Sept, the Cabinet had endorsed the proposal for simultaneous elections for Lok Sabha, assemblies, urban bodies and panchayats within a 100-day window, based on the recommendations of the Ram Nath Kovind committee.During the consultation, 32 political parties supported the concept, while 15 opposed it. Among national parties, Congress, AAP, BSP and CPM were against it, while BJP and NPP favoured it. Notable state parties opposing it included AIUDF, Trinamool Congress, AIMIM, CPI, DMK, SP. Supporting state parties included AIADMK, All Jharkhand Students Union, AGP, BJD, LJP (R), and Shiv SenaJD(U), SAD . Several parties did not respond, including BRS, NCP, RJD, TDP and YSRCP.The committee had reviewed election systems in countries like South Africa, Sweden, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines. On Wednesday, former President Kovind stressed the need for a consensus and said, ""This initiative transcends political interests for the welfare of the nation. Economists suggest that implementing one nation one election could increase the country's GDP by 1-1.5%.""","BJP & allies back ONOE bills, say vital to cut costs, synchronise vibrant democracy.

'I try to hide my face in international conferences on accidents': Nitin Gadkari on road safety,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-try-to-hide-my-face-in-international-conferences-on-accidents-nitin-gadkari-on-road-safety/articleshow/116247714.cms,"NEW DELHI: Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Thursday that the situation has worsened despite his initial commitment to cut accidents by 50% upon taking charge as the minister for road transport and highways.Speaking in the Lok Sabha during a discussion on road safety , Gadkari said, “Forget about reducing the number of accidents, I have no hesitation to admit that it has increased. When I go to attend international conferences where there is a discussion on road accidents, I try to hide my face.”Gadkari’s admission came during the Question Hour, where he also stressed the need for significant changes in human behavior, societal attitudes, and respect for the rule of law to improve road safety. Sharing a personal anecdote, the minister recounted a major accident involving him and his family several years ago, which required prolonged hospitalization.“By the grace of God, I and my family were saved. So I have my personal experience of accidents,” he said.Highlighting key factors contributing to road mishaps, Gadkari pointed to improper parking of trucks and lack of lane discipline as major issues. He noted that many accidents are caused by trucks parked haphazardly on roads. To address safety concerns, he announced directives for adopting international standards in bus body design, including equipping buses with hammers near windows for emergency escapes during accidents.The minister painted a grim picture of road safety in India, revealing that road accidents claim 1.78 lakh lives annually, with 60% of victims falling within the 18-34 age group.Among states, Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest number of fatalities, with over 23,000 deaths accounting for 13.7% of total road accident deaths, followed by Tamil Nadu (18,000 deaths, or 10.6%), Maharashtra (15,000 deaths, or 9%), and Madhya Pradesh (13,000 deaths, or 8%).In terms of cities, Delhi led the tally with over 1,400 deaths, followed by Bengaluru (915 deaths) and Jaipur (850 deaths).","Road accidents claim 1.78 lakh lives annually, with 60% of victims falling within the 18-34 age group.

VARANASI/BENGALURU: A Bengaluru police team reached UP's Jaunpur Thursday looking for the Singhania family accused of abetting the suicide of Subhash Atul , a senior AI executive at a leading automobile firm. But police met with little success as their houses were locked and phones switched off.Jaunpur Kotwali inspector Mithilesh Kumar Mishra said Atul's mother-in-law Nisha and her son Anurag had left their house on a motorbike Wednesday night. When some reporters camping there asked where they were going, Anurag replied his mother was unwell.According to neighbours, the Singhania family had moved in two months ago. Police have launched a manhunt and pasted a notice on the entrance of the house, asking residents to appear before the IO .""We are in constant touch with local police, and they are working with us to trace the suspects,"" DCP Shivakumar Gunare of Bengaluru police said.Atul, 34, took his life in his Bengaluru apartment early Monday amid a prolonged legal battle involving divorce, child custody, and a Rs 3.3 crore demand from his estranged wife Nikita Singhania. According to the FIR filed by Atul's brother Bikas, his estranged wife and her family allegedly demanded Rs 3 crore to drop police cases and Rs 30 lakh for visitation rights to see his four-year-old son. Bengaluru police registered a case against Nikita, her mother Nisha, brother Anurag, and uncle Sushil Singhania.His lawyer Dinesh Mishra said Thursday Atul was earning a monthly salary of Rs 84,000 and the family court in Jaunpur had ordered him in July to pay Rs 40,000 a month as maintenance for his son, which he might have found burdensome.Atul left behind a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video detailing alleged harassment by Nikita and his in-laws, and accused the family court judge of bias. However, his lawyer Mishra said the orders passed by the court were in accordance with the law.""The court did not mandate any compensation for his wife, as she was earning a sufficient income in Delhi. Atul might have found the Rs 40,000 payment steep. He had the option to challenge the order by appealing to higher courts, including HC,"" Mishra said.According to the lawyer, Atul never demonstrated violent behaviour or mood swings while appearing before family court. ""I suspect his wife and others might have demanded more money from him, forcing him to think they were blackmailing or extorting him."" Atul and Nikita met through a matrimonial site and got married on April 26, 2019, in Varanasi. In his suicide note, Atul wrote that she lived with her in-laws in Bihar's Samastipur for only two days before moving to Bengaluru.","Subhash Atul, 34, took his life in his Bengaluru apartment early Monday.

Madhya Pradesh Couple Suicide: Couple whose kids gifted Rahul Gandhi their piggy bank during Nyay Yatra found hanging at Madhya Pradesh home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-tragedy-business-couples-suicide-linked-to-ed-probe-sparks-outrage/articleshow/116281330.cms,"BHOPAL: A businessman and his wife were found dead at their residence in Sehore district, Madhya Pradesh, on Friday morning.Manoj Parmar and his wife, Neha, were found hanging in their home in Ashta.Family members allege that the couple was under extreme stress due to the actions taken by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against them.On December 5, the ED raided four of Parmar's properties in Indore and Sehore as part of an investigation into alleged money laundering linked to a 2017 CBI FIR.During the raids, authorities seized documents related to several movable and immovable assets and froze a bank balance of Rs 3.5 lakh.Parmar was also arrested in connection with an alleged Rs 6 crore fraud case involving a nationalised bank. A suicide note was reportedly found at the scene, although its contents have not yet been disclosed by the police.Parmar recently gained attention after his children gifted a piggy bank to Congress MP Rahul Gandhi during the Nyay Yatra. The Congress party claims Parmar was targeted by the BJP since then.According to Parmar’s family, the pressure from the ED played a major role in the couple's deaths. Parmar’s brother told local media that the businessman was under considerable mental stress due to the ED's actions and the ongoing legal proceedings.Kailash Parmar, the former Congress district president of Sehore, stated that Manoj’s son was actively involved in supporting Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra by organising a ""Gullak"" (piggy bank) team.Former chief minister Digvijay Singh also took to social media, accusing the ED of harassing Parmar without cause.Singh wrote: “Manoj Parmar from Ashta, Sehore district, MP, was being harassed by the ED without any valid reason. Manoj’s children gifted a piggy bank to Rahul Gandhi during the Bharat Jodo Yatra. His house was raided by ED Assistant Director Sanjeet Kumar Sahu.According to Manoj, he was targeted because of his support for the Indian National Congress. I arranged legal assistance for him, but with great sadness, I report that Manoj and his wife tragically took their own lives this morning. I demand a fair investigation by the Director of the ED into this matter.”BJP spokesperson Narendra Saluja, in a post on social media, highlighted Parmar’s vocal criticism of the BJP and his son’s ""Gullak Team,"" which presented piggy banks filled with donations to various Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi. Saluja raised questions about the financial dealings of the ""Gullak Team.""In September 2022, the Madhya Pradesh high court dismissed a petition filed by Manoj Parmar to quash the CBI FIR registered in December 2017.The FIR accused him of forgery and criminal conspiracy. Parmar’s petition argued that the local police had already filed a similar case in October 2017, but the high court ruled in favour of continuing the CBI investigation.The allegations against Parmar stemmed from claims that he facilitated loans worth crores of rupees under a government scheme by providing fake quotations, bills and TIN numbers, despite not being involved in the loan business. His company was also found to be non-existent.The local Ashta police registered FIR No. 858/2017 concerning a loan transaction involving Prashant Gupta, while the CBI's investigation into 18 loan transactions resulted in a charge sheet for fraudulent loan disbursements.The high court noted that while the CBI registered a single FIR for the 18 transactions, each was considered a distinct offence and the CBI was instructed to proceed further with the case.","Manoj Parmar and his wife, Neha, were found hanging in their home in Ashta.

Complaint filed by Bikas Kumar

'He was broken from inside'

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: A Bengaluru-based techie’s death has sent shockwaves across the country, with a 24-page suicide note and a chilling placard reading ""Justice is due"" found at the scene. Subash Atul , 34, was discovered hanging at his residence in Manjunath Layout on Monday. Employed by a private firm, Subash’s final words have reignited debates on the need for stronger legal protections for men.Atul’s brother, Bikas Kumar, has called for justice and stronger legal safeguards for men facing harassment.""I want justice for my brother. Laws should be made for men as well, as they also face harassment. The Government of India should recognise this. No arrests have been made yet, but we will proceed legally,"" said Kumar.He further called for legal reforms and action against judicial corruption, stating, ""I want my brother to get justice. I want this country to have a legal process through which even men can receive justice. I demand strict action against those in judicial positions engaging in corruption. If this continues, how can people expect justice?""Subhash’s father, Pawan Kumar, alleged that his son’s in-laws and the judicial system drove him to this point amid an ongoing legal battle over divorce and child custody.""He was forced to travel from Bengaluru to Jaunpur nearly 40 times. His wife kept filing one charge after another. He must have been under immense pressure, but he never let us sense it. Suddenly, we received news of his death. It’s 100% true that his wife and her family harassed him. We cannot describe the level of tension our son must have been in,"" said Pawan Kumar.Amid the public outcry following Atul’s death, his estranged wife, Nikita Singhania, and her family have denied any involvement in the incident.Her paternal uncle, Sushil Singhania, stated from Jaunpur, ""Neither I nor any family member was present at the scene. The claims made in the video will be addressed by Nikita shortly.""He further asserted that the family had no contact with Atul for the past three years and expressed faith in the judiciary. ""We are not guilty, and we trust the court to deliver a fair judgment,"" he said.According to a PTI report, Nikita had filed a complaint against Atul and his family at Jaunpur's Kotwali police station on April 24, 2022.The FIR accused Atul, his parents (Anju Devi and Pawan Modi), and his younger brother (Bikas) of harassment and assault over dowry demands. The charges were registered under IPC Sections 498A (cruelty by husband or relatives), 323 (assault), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), along with provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.Nikita claimed that after their marriage on April 26, 2019, in Varanasi, Atul’s family expressed dissatisfaction with the wedding gifts from her parents and demanded an additional Rs 10 lakh. On August 16, 2019, they allegedly repeated the demand, and her father’s sudden death occurred the following day.Nikita also accused Atul of physical and mental abuse, alleging that he ""started to beat me up like a beast"" and ""used to transfer my entire salary from my account to his account by threatening me."" She claimed to have endured the abuse on her parents’ advice to remain patient, but the situation reportedly did not improve.Following Subhash’s death, Bikas Kumar filed a formal complaint with Marathahalli police, leading to the registration of a case under IPC Section 108 (abetment to suicide) and Section 3(5) of the BNS, which relates to joint criminal liability.The FIR named Atul’s wife, Nikita Singhania, along with her mother (Nisha), brother (Anurag), and uncle (Sushil Singhania) as accused.According to the complaint, the accused allegedly filed a false case against Atul, demanding a settlement of Rs 3 crore.Bikas’s statement to the police outlined the intense pressure his brother faced during the ongoing legal proceedings.""Every time Atul attended the court hearing, he was mocked by his in-laws and told to die if he could not pay the money or pay for visitation rights. These drove him to take the extreme step,"" he said.Expressing grief and frustration, Kumar remarked, ""My brother gave everything to this relationship. If he had shared his troubles with me or our father, we would have supported him. I urge the government and the President of India to ensure a thorough investigation. If my brother was in the wrong, let us see the evidence, but justice must prevail if he was truthful. There should also be an inquiry into the role of the judge involved in my brother’s case.""The father of Bengaluru techie Atul Subhash who died by suicide, said his son had been ""broken from inside"" after multiple cases were filed against him and his family by his wife.My son used to say that there is a lot of corruption but he will fight as he is on the path of truth...He was broken from inside, though he didn't tell anyone anything,"" Subhash's father Pawan Kumar told ANI.","Bengaluru-based Subash Atul, 34, was found dead at his home on Monday.

Allegations of harassment and extortion

NEW DELHI: The investigation into the death of Bengaluru techie Subhash Atul , who allegedly died by suicide, has intensified as a Bengaluru police team again visited the home of his estranged wife in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, on Friday.The visit is part of a broader probe into allegations of harassment and extortion by his wife and in-laws, which Atul detailed in a 24-page suicide note and an 81-minute video.Police pasted an official notice on the front door of his wife's house.The notice states, ""There are reasonable grounds to interrogate you to ascertain the facts and circumstances. You are directed to appear before the investigating officer at Bengaluru within 3 days.""A special police team from Bengaluru reached Jaunpur on Thursday in search of the Singhania family, who stand accused of abetting the suicide of 34-year-old.However, the search yielded no success as the accused family members had already vacated their homes and switched off their mobile phones.According to Jaunpur Kotwali inspector Mithilesh Kumar Mishra, Atul’s mother-in-law, Nisha, and his brother-in-law, Anurag, were last seen leaving their house on a motorbike late Wednesday night.When questioned by reporters stationed outside their residence, Anurag reportedly said they were heading out as his mother was unwell. Since then, their whereabouts have been unknown.The case revolves around serious accusations leveled against Atul's estranged wife and her family.It is alleged that Atul was subjected to intense mental harassment as his wife and in-laws demanded Rs 3 crore to withdraw legal cases filed against him, in addition to seeking Rs 30 lakh for visitation rights to see his own son.In his final moments, Atul reached out to an NGO that supports men dealing with domestic violence and related legal battles. He sent an email post-Sunday night, informing the NGO that he could no longer endure the harassment and intended to end his life.Acting swiftly, NGO staff raised an alert with the police control room in Bengaluru.Police officers rushed to Atul's residence and, upon receiving no response, broke down the door to his apartment. Inside the bedroom, they found his body.","The investigation into the death of Bengaluru techie Subhash Atul has intensified.

PM Modi, in his Mann Ki Baat broadcast in late October, warned people against digital-arrest scams and outlined a three-step formula – ‘wait, think and take action' – to prevent likely ""digital arrests"".These scams involve fraudsters making video calls from lookalike police stations and posing as officers from central agencies such as CBI, ED, Income Tax, or the customs. They claim victims are under investigation for narcotics or smuggling offences, convincing them to reveal their banking details or make digital payments.To help those in distress, the govt has established helplines, urging citizens to dial 1930 to report such incidents. Additionally, over 700 social-media accounts and groups, including 268 Facebook and 465 Telegram groups, have been deactivated in efforts to curb the fraud.The minister stressed that public awareness remains the most effective tool in combating these crimes, especially as scammers continue to target educational institutions and exploit social media platforms.","India has reported 42,000 cyber-crime cases, and 11,000 of them were in Karnataka.

NEW DELHI: “The mediation court didn’t follow the law, not even Supreme Court rules,” said Pawan Kumar , grieving the death of his 34-year-old son, Subhash Atul, a deputy general manager at an automobile firm, who died by suicide in Bengaluru on Monday.Atul’s father, Pawan Kumar, accused his son’s in-laws and the judicial system of pushing him to the edge during an ongoing legal battle over divorce and child custody.Speaking to the media, Pawan Kumar said,""He was forced to travel to Jaunpur from Bengaluru nearly 40 times.

We cannot describe the level of tension our son must have been in.”Subhash's death has exposed allegations of his wife, Nikita Singhania, and her family demanding Rs 3 crore to withdraw legal cases and Rs 30 lakh for visitation rights to his son. His brother, Bikas Kumar, filed a police complaint, leading to cases of abetment to suicide being registered against Nikita, her mother Nisha, brother Anurag, and uncle Sushil Singhania.“My brother was mentally and physically exhausted ever since the court battle began. He was mocked by his in-laws and told to die if he couldn’t pay the money or gain visitation rights. This drove him to the extreme step,” said Bikas in his statement to the police.In his suicide note, Subhash detailed the unrelenting harassment he faced, including eight allegedly false police complaints, and accused a family court judge in Uttar Pradesh of bias. He also emailed an NGO advocating for men’s rights, announcing his intention to end his life.Subhash’s video message, recorded hours before his death, has since gone viral, drawing attention to men’s mental health and legal struggles. “The money I earn only strengthens my enemies. Courts and police harass me and my family using the taxes I pay. My in-laws suggested I commit suicide, so I am complying,” he stated.In his note, Subhash appealed for justice, asking that his wife and her family be kept away from his body. “My last rites shouldn’t be conducted until my harassers are punished. If they walk free, dump my ashes in a gutter near the court so I know how life is valued in this country,” he wrote.","Subhash Atul, a deputy general manager at an automobile firm, died by suicide in Bengaluru on Monday.

'Surgery was painful': UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione's social media posts indicate about his health struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/surgery-was-painful-unitedhealthcare-ceo-killer-luigi-mangiones-social-media-posts-indicate-about-his-health-struggles/articleshow/116270935.cms,"Social media posts of Luigi Mangione , who was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, give an insight into his physical and mental health issues.Last year, following his spinal surgery for chronic back pain , he became an advocate for the procedure that positively transformed his life. He actively encouraged individuals facing similar conditions, to challenge medical professionals who suggested pain was inevitable.His Reddit posts discuss spondylolisthesis, a spinal condition where vertebral fractures cause misalignment. This can lead to severe pain when nerves are compressed.According to his social media posts, this condition, which can develop during childhood or through injury, began significantly affecting Mangione's life in recent years.Following his studies at the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained bachelor's and master's degrees, he was employed at TrueCar, a Santa Monica-based car-buying website until 2023. He resided in Hawaii beginning January 2022. His back condition deteriorated, partly due to a surfing incident during his six-month residence at Surfbreak, a ""co-living"" accommodation in Honolulu.According to Josiah Ryan, who speaks for Surfbreak's owner and founder R.J. Martin, Mangione increasingly voiced concerns about his pain. The condition affected his ability to participate in recreational activities and exercise, and he worried about its impact on potential romantic relationships.""That was definitely a theme in his time there,"" Ryan said. ""He wasn't a big complainer. So it wasn't like he was bringing it up constantly. But the people who knew him knew this was a significant part of his life.""In July 2023, Mangione shared on Reddit his decision to undergo surgery.""I got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20's and damaging my nerves while I waffled on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it,"" he wrote.His posts indicated the procedure was successful. His X account displayed what seemed to be an X-ray showing a metal rod and multiple screws inserted in his lower spine.""Surgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds,"" Mangione posted on Reddit in August 2023. ""Obviously will be awhile until I get into rigorous activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had anticipated.""In a post from July 2018, he discussed his academic challenges and thoughts of leaving university. However, he noted that ""staying in college has at least let me maintain some semblance of normality.""His final Reddit contribution was on May 17, with surrounding posts indicating stability and no apparent health complications. He appeared supportive of the surgical procedure he had undergone previously.In early April, he shared details about equipment chosen for an extended Asian backpacking adventure involving motorcycle travel, describing it as having ""the perfect balance between minimalism and practicality.""Later that month, he offered advice to another Reddit user experiencing back issues, suggesting persistent consultation with different surgeons and emphasising work inability if needed.""We live in a capitalist society,"" he wrote. ""I've found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it's impacting your quality of life.""However, his Reddit posts, did not contain direct criticism of health insurance industry profits. These sentiments apparently emerged later, as evidenced by a handwritten note discovered after his arrest for allegedly killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.The note mentions ""parasites"" within the healthcare system and criticises health insurers' influence and earnings, According to law enforcement officials. Upon his arrest in Pennsylvania, Mangione was heard shouting about an ""insult to the intelligence of the American people"" while being escorted into court by sheriff's deputies.Meanwhile, a senior New York City police official confirmed on Thursday to NBC New York that there was no evidence of Mangione ever having UnitedHealthcare insurance.Although the incident has led to questions about potential negative healthcare experiences, Mangione's 2023 post-surgery Reddit activity showed satisfaction with his treatment and relief from chronic pain. He advised others not to fear surgical complications and mentioned travelling to Asia for backpacking this year.Interestingly, the 26-year-old Ivy League alumnus appears to have ceased social media activity approximately six months ago, coinciding with his loss of contact with family and friends.Whilst his arrest has shocked his close circle, limited information exists about his recent physical and psychological wellbeing.Meanwhile, healthcare professionals acknowledge the complexities of treating back pain.""In the gross majority of treatments, surgery is when everything else has failed to provide relief,"" said Dr Jason Pittman, co-director of the Spine Centre at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. He said that doctors typically explore conservative treatments like physical therapy, injections or medications before considering surgery.Despite having health insurance, patients may face substantial surgical costs depending on deductibles and other variables, although Mangione's financial situation remains unclear.Dr Padma Gulur, a pain specialist at Duke Health, highlights that chronic back pain can substantially affect mental wellbeing.“If you have underlying mental health issues — anxiety, depression — your pain can be worse because you have way more suffering. But, the second aspect is pain can push you into anxiety and depression,” said Gulur.Additionally, details about Mangione's recent mental health remain unclear, though evidence suggests he was becoming increasingly isolated.According to police reports, his family filed a missing person report in San Francisco during November.During his university years, Mangione had documented his struggles with cognitive difficulties and sleep disturbances on Reddit.",Luigi Mangione was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Toxicology reports indicated he had a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit and traces of ketamine and norketamine, substances often associated with recreational abuse.The lawsuit named 14 defendants, including the dump truck driver, the company responsible for the truck, the Florida Department of Transportation, a car rental service, and a nightclub Haskins visited prior to his death. By August 2023, Kalabrya had reached settlements with three major defendants, with additional agreements following soon after. The dismissal this week signifies the conclusion of all claims related to the case.Separately, Kalabrya is engaged in a legal battle with Haskins’ parents and sister, who accuse her of harassment over their use of Dwayne’s name and likeness for a nonprofit foundation.

India shouldn't build another LLM: Nandan Nilekani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-shouldnt-build-another-llm-nandan-nilekani/articleshow/116269605.cms,"Nandan Nilekani

BENGALURU: Nandan Nilekani said he stands by his view that India need not spend resources building another large language model (LLM). He was responding to a question from us on the view expressed recently by Google Research India director Manish Gupta that India will benefit from building a foundation model .""Foundation models are not the best use of your money. If India has $50 billion to spend, it should use that to build compute, infrastructure, and AI cloud. These are the raw materials and engines of this game,"" he said.Foundation models like the ones that OpenAI and Meta are building often cost billions of dollars because they are being trained on vast amounts of data using very expensive infrastructure.Nilekani has in the past stressed that India should focus on building use cases for AI on top of the LLMs that are available globally.Last month, Gupta had said at the Bengaluru Tech Summit that he ""respectfully disagreed"" with Nilekani's advice on prioritising use case building over building foundation models around AI. ""He is not preaching what he practised. He revolutionised India's technology landscape by starting with the basics. With Aadhaar, he did not start with use cases, he started with building foundations. We too must, using our constraints as ingredients for innovation,"" he said.",Nandan Nilekani said he stands by his view that India need not spend resources building another large language model (LLM) He was responding to a question from us on the view expressed recently by Google Research India director Manish Gupta that India will benefit from building a foundation model.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116269611,imgsize-998739,width-400,resizemode-4/116269611.jpg"
