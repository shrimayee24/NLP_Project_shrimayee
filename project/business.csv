"For SC-STs, funding IIT studies is tougher than cracking JEE",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-sc-sts-funding-iit-studies-is-tougher-than-cracking-jee/articleshow/112121042.cms,"HYDERABAD: On August 1, when gates of IIT-Tirupati open, Bonila Aryan Roshan will be in queue of students heading to the chemical engineering department. Yet, Roshan is far from being ecstatic.""I'm not sure if I'll be able to complete my four years of engineering,"" he says. Roshan, from SC community, belongs to Telangana's Siddipet district where his mother works as a daily wager for Rs 200 a day.The family has managed to raise Rs 50,000 to foot Roshan's IIT bills. ""It will see me through my first semester... not sure how I will pay for my education after that,"" said the 18-year-old who secured a 2406 rank (SC category) in JEE 2024. He lost his father at a young age.Roshan's story is the reality of several students from Telangana's marginalised communities. IITs waive tuition fee of Rs 1 lakh for SC/ST candidates. But they are expected to bear other costs such as accommodation, mess, and registration. That comes to anywhere between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh annually. The cash-strapped students end up selling whatever little assets they have, or they are left at the mercy of philanthropists.Over the past few weeks, TOI wrote about three such students - Badavath Madhulatha (IIT Patna), Vasam Sushmitha (IIT Gandhinagar) and Kuncham Shiva (IIT Mumbai).

Rahul Gandhi , in his second speech as leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, invoked the ""Chakravyuha"" of Mahabharata to accuse the Narendra Modi government of spreading fear and alleged that power was centred around only 6 people.The Congress leader then referred to Lord Shiva's wedding procession ""Shiva ki baraat"" to claim that opposition bloc INDIA was open to all.""Thousands of years ago, in Kurukshetra, six people trapped Abhimanyu in a 'Chakravyuh' and killed him. I did a little research and found out that 'Chakravyuha' is also known as 'Padmavuyh' - which means 'Lotus formation'. Chakravyuh ' is in the shape of a Lotus. In the 21st century, a new 'Chakravyuh' has been formed - that too in the form of a Lotus. The Prime Minister wears its symbol on his chest. What was done with Abhimanyu, is being down with India - the youth, farmers, women, small and medium businesses. Abhimanyu was killed by six people. Today, too there are six people in the centre of 'Chakravyuha',"" Rahul alleged.""The 'chakravyuha' that has captured India has three forces behind it: first is the idea of monopoly capital-- that two people should be allowed to own the entire Indian wealth ... The second element is the institutions, agencies, CBI, ED, Income Tax department of this nation; and the third is the political executive. These three together are at the heart of the 'chakravyuh', and they have devastated this country,"" he added.""'Chakravyuha' cannot defeat 'Shiva's baraat'.

You create 'chakravyuhas' and we break them,"" Rahul said attacking the BJP.Now, let's cut back to Rahul's first speech as leader of opposition earlier this month during the debate on Motion of Thanks to President's address. The speech then centred around Lord Shiva and also made mention of several other religions to drive home the point that all of them preach one thing ""Daro mat, Darao mat (Don't be scare and don't scare).The Congress leader himself made a mention of his last speech in today's address.""In the last speech, I spoke about some religious concepts. Shivji's concept and concept of Ahinsa is that the trishool is placed behind the back and is not held in the hand. I spoke about the snake on Shivji's neck and I also said how all religions in our country proposed the idea of non-violence, which can be capsulated in the phrase Daro mat Darao mat. I also said that there is an idea beyond the personal. The idea of the Abhay Mudra is that transmits this motion of Ahinsa and affection and fearlessness to everybody else,"" Rahul said.The Congress leader had then also held up a picture of Lord Shiva and said his message is about fearlessness and non-violence. He continued showing posters of Gods despite Speaker Om Birla's repeated requests not to do so.Rahul targeted the BJP and said those who call themselves Hindus are engaged in ""violence and hate"" round the clock. ""Aap Hindu ho hi nahi (You are not Hindus)"" he had said leading to a huge uproar in the House.His remarks evoked immediate reaction from Prime Minister Modi who said that calling the entire Hindu society violent is a serious matter.However, an aggressive Rahul did not budge and asserted that Prime Minister Modi, the BJP or the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) were not the entire Hindu society.","Rahul Gandhi invoked the ""Chakravyuha"" of Mahabharata to accuse the Narendra Modi government of spreading fear.

The Mughals' ability to maintain composure despite donning bulky traditional attire and carrying out household chores is something that is rarely discussed, except from their breathtakingly beautiful palaces, graceful dance as depicted in movies, or heartfelt hymns chanted in Allah's honour. But how did the Mughals survive without air conditioning? How did they build cooling architecture? That is the question.In the 21st century.It's as if we continually shatter our own records of hottest days alive. July 22 was the hottest day with the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth. A deadly heat wave across the world and malfunctioning air conditioners claimed many people's lives for a while.Air conditioning in buildings indicates considerable energy use and utility expenditures. Today, while we are developing sustainable heating and cooling technologies to comply with the green construction movement, it is important to note that ecological heating and cooling techniques have been employed for as long as humans have been building homes. Mughal architecture in India provides unique active and passive air conditioning technologies that can be easily incorporated into contemporary buildings.The Mughals employed two elements to regulate the weather around the structure: flora and water. These waterways and fountains were frequently extended into the interiors of structures. The Mughal architects made extensive use of water as a cooling element. Large reflecting pools and water channels, referred to as ""rills,"" were frequently included into the architecture of structures and landscapes.Through evaporation, these water elements not only enhanced the aesthetic appeal but also helped to cool the air. The pools' reflecting surfaces also assisted in deflecting sunlight from the structures, which lessened their ability to absorb heat.One common element of Mughal design was jharokhas, or overhanging enclosed balconies. These buildings promoted natural ventilation in addition to their aesthetic appeal. Jharokhas were positioned strategically to allow air to move throughout the building, limiting direct sunlight and offering shade while also facilitating a steady supply of fresh air.Huge courtyards and verdant gardens were frequently incorporated into the architectural designs of Mughal structures. The environment was significantly cooled by these open areas. Cooler air might flow within the buildings and hot air could exit through the courtyards. Gardens, which frequently have pools and other water elements, produced a microclimate that considerably lowered the temperature.The Mughals also employed inventive cooling methods like terraces and roof gardens. By acting as insulation, these raised gardens assisted in lowering the amount of heat that the roofs absorbed. Through transpiration, the flora on the roof gardens had a cooling effect that improved the comfort of the interior spaces below.Buildings with thick walls and lofty ceilings were among the Mughals' most simple yet effective strategies. As insulators, the thick walls limited the amount of heat that could enter from the outside, keeping the interiors cold. The living areas below were significantly cooler due to the hot air rising to the high ceilings. This type of architecture was especially common in palaces and huge public structures.Large domes and chhatris, or elevated dome-shaped pavilions, were useful features in Mughal design in addition to being decorative. These buildings promoted air movement and offered shade. Because of their high ceilings, the domes assisted in keeping the lower rooms cooler by retaining hot air and letting it to leave through ventilation at the top.Mughal architecture was distinguished by its finely carved jaali screens. Similar to contemporary blinds, these perforated stone screens allowed air to travel through while obstructing direct sunlight, producing a cooling effect. The jaali screens made sure the interiors stayed pleasant even on the warmest days by dispersing sunlight and lowering heat buildup.Mughal buildings were orientated with great care to maximise shade and reduce heat gain. Structures were frequently orientated to benefit from the dominant winds, which improved natural ventilation. Living areas were kept cool and shaded by the use of covered pathways and verandas.","Mughal architects made extensive use of water as a cooling element.

But I think it is for the two of us to talk it over and to find a way.""""Obviously other countries in the world would have an interest in the matter, because we are two big countries and the state of our relationship has an impact on the rest of the world.But we are not looking to other countries to sort out what is really an issue between us,"" he added while reponding to a question on Quad members's reaction on India-China issue.The minister also said that he met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi twice this month and had talked about the issue.

And on July 4 also, they met in the Kazakh capital city of Astana on the sidelines of the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).India and China's relation has been strained since 2020 when their militaries got locked in a standoff and a full resolution of the border row has not yet been achieved though the two sides have disengaged from a number of friction points.Talking about India relations with China, Jaishankar said, ""We have views on China based on our experience. Our relations with China are not doing very well, the main reason for that is in 2020, during the COVID, China brought very large forces to the border areas between India and China in violation of agreements that we had with China and that created tensions which led to a clash, people died on both sides."""" The consequences of that issue, which has not been fully resolved, continues. The relationship right now with China is not good, not normal.

Heat & height deadly mix for plane engines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heat-height-deadly-mix-for-plane-engines/articleshow/112118917.cms,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: An IIT prof, who was one of the passengers whose flight was cancelled at Leh airport on Sunday, said such high temperatures at a place like Ladakh was a sign of climate change .""It was unimaginable for me that at an altitude of 11,000 ft in Leh, where temperatures routinely drop to minus 20 degrees C, I would become a victim of global warming ,"" said the professor, Chetan Solanki.""The surprise was not the flight cancellation but the reason for which it was cancelled - high temperatures. No one will be spared the impact of climate change. Today, I have become a victim. Everyone should know their turn and their children's turn will come.''The IIT Bombay professor who is on unpaid leave from work left his Mumbai home in 2020 on an 11-year 'Energy Swaraj Yatra' to create awareness about climate change and encourage climate correctives. Last week, he was in Ladakh to attend the Sun and Earth festival which promotes eco-friendly practices. Solanki reached Leh airport for the 1pm IndiGo flight to Delhi only to hear the airline announce that the flight had been cancelled due to high temperatures.In a statement, IndiGo said its ""flight operations to and from Leh have been impacted due to the prevailing high outside air temperature in Leh, which is beyond the airline's control"".How does high temperature affect airline flights? Air density decreases with increase in altitude, which is why mountaineers rely on oxygen cylinders at heights above 14,000 feet. The Leh airport is at an elevation of about 10,700 feet, where the air is much thinner than, say at the Delhi airport, which is at about 770 feet. Another factor that decreases air density is temperature - higher the temperature, lower would be the density. A combination of these two factors spells trouble for aircraft.Low air density degrades engine performance. The A320s and B737 jet engines take longer to rev up and reach lift-off speed, thus consuming a longer length of runway during take-off. Thin air also affects aircraft performance post take-off during the climb phase and then again, when landing as the aircraft needs a comparatively higher approach speed to generate enough lift to stay afloat. Said an airline commander, requesting anonymity: ""High temperature forces weight restrictions on aircraft. Last week, we had the air traffic controller report a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, which is too high for Leh operations.""High temperatures at that altitude means aircraft engines cannot develop the thrust required to take off with commercially viable load. Heat and height are a deadly cocktail for engines. Delhi Airport, on the other hand, sees wide body aircraft take off for long hauls even at 45-47 degrees Celsius as IGIA is only 770 feet above mean sea level, pilots explained.Senior commander Capt Amit Singh said: ""Temperatures above 36 degrees C at the Leh airport is akin to taking off from a runway that's at an altitude of 16,000 feet, which makes the aircraft incapable of taking off safely.""When airlines realise that Leh temperature could cross 32-33 degrees Celsius at the scheduled time of departure, they cancel the flights - meaning do not send the aircraft to Leh or divert it to some other place if already enroute. The reason: after landing, the aircraft would get stuck there till the next morning and not be able to do all the other routes it had to. Or it would have to fly back with hardly any passengers and their baggage. Leh anyway sees flight operations till around 1pm as later tailwinds get too strong to permit aircraft movement.IndiGo in its statement added that it has offered the affected passengers alternatives, refunds and that passengers should check the flight status before leaving for the airport. Three other carriers TOI contacted did not respond.","Chetan Solanki is on an 11-year 'Energy Swaraj Yatra' to create awareness about climate change.

Supreme Court rejected on Monday Bihar govt's plea for revival of laws increasing quotas for SCs , STs and OBCs to 65% from 50% in state govt jobs and admissions to state-run educational institutions by declining to stay Patna high court 's June 20 judgment quashing the law as unconstitutional.The state govt sought that operation of Patna high court 's verdict be stayed by saying that hundreds of interviews were in the process of being conducted based on the two legislations of 2023 - Bihar Reservation of Vacancies in Posts and Services (for SC, ST and OBC) Amendment Act and Bihar Reservation (in Admissions to Educational Institutions) Amendment Act.After hearing senior advocate Shyam Divan for increase in quotas and senior advocate Aparajita Singh for those opposing reservation exceeding the 50% cap laid down by SC in the Indra Sawhney case in 1992, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said, ""We will not grant any stay on the high court order. Interim relief refused."" It posted Bihar govt's appeal for detailed hearing to Sept.Bihar govt attempted to differentiate its case from Maharashtra, whose law granting quota to Marathas that took the total quota beyond the 50% limit was quashed by a five-judge constitution bench of SC in May 2021 in Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil case.Divan argued the Maharashtra law was quashed as the state did not satisfy the pre-condition set in the Indra Sawhney judgment - collection of socio-economic data to prove backwardness among more classes of citizens making it essential to grant quota over and above 50%.He also contended that SC on May 1, 2023 in Yogesh Kumar Thakur case had stayed a judgment of Chhattisgarh high court, which had stopped recruitment following hike in quota from 50% to 65%, but had allowed the recruitments to go on as the advertisements were issued prior to the high court judgment. It had also clarified that all these recruitments would be subject to the outcome of judicial scrutiny of the validity of enhanced quota.Bihar said it had carried out a caste survey in 2022-23. ""Despite decades of affirmative actions and schemes, less than 18% of govt employees come from communities that constitute 85% of the population. The high court 's conclusion is flawed, being reductive and divorced from reality,"" it said.""The caste survey reveals that backward classes in Bihar are trailing in most socio-economic markers. Therefore, there was a dire need to provide additional support and representation to these communities,"" it added.","Supreme Court rejects Bihar govt's plea for revival of laws increasing quotas for SCs, STs and OBCs to 65% from 50% in state govt jobs and admissions to state-run educational institutions.

NEW DELHI: Registering a marginal increase in top scorers, 22,920 candidates scored full marks across 45 subjects in the Common University Entrance Test-Undergraduate ( CUET-UG 2024), the gateway to undergraduate courses across 283 universities in India.However, this year, as earlier announced by National Testing Agency, these top scorers scored perfect 200, while in 2022 and 2023 the agency accorded percentile scores as the papers were conducted in multiple sessions and normalisation method was employed.Bringing relief to lakhs of aspirants, NTA announced the results on Sunday evening. Of the 63 subjects, 200 is the maximum marks for 62 and the General Test paper is of 250 marks.The largest number of students scored full marks in Business Studies (8,024), followed by Political Science (5,141) and History (2,520).In 18 of the 33 language papers offered in the exam, 1,904 scored perfect 200. Of the 8.2 lakh candidates who took the English test, 1,683 scored 200.Sanskrit and Punjabi were the other two languages where over 50 candidates had perfect scores. A total of 22,836 aspirants scored 100 percentile in 2023 and 21,159 scored 100 percentile in 2022.Though the number of perfect scorers increased marginally from the number of 100 percentile scorers in 2023, the competition for select programmes like commerce is set to get tougher in popular universities like Delhi University (DU). The number of aspirants scoring 100 percentile in Busi- ness Studies was 2,357 in 2023, which has increased to 8,024 this year. However, for sought after honour programmes like economics/business econom- ics, there is likely to be a de- crease in minimum eligible marks as the number of high scorers have come down by 454% from last year. Among the 8,000-plus perfect scorers in Business Studies is Khusali Nahataa from Delhi, who aspires for admission in Shri Ram College of Commerce or Lady Shri Ram College of Delhi University.A student of Modern School, Barakhambha Road, she said, “I chose to study BS with a lot of mind maps and charts. I’m aiming for SRCC or LSR. I did not take any coaching and did 8-10 hours of self-study every day.” Anjali Jyoti, a student of DAV Noida, Sector 56, scored 200/200 in three (Geography, Political Science and Psychol- ogy) of the five subjects she appeared. she said, “I want to pursue BA (Political Science H) from one of the best colleg- es of DU. I relied entirely on self-study as maximum syl- labus was from Class 12 so there was no need for extra sources or coaching. Only the deleted portion needed to be covered separately.”On July 7, NTA had released provisional answer keys of CUET-UG 2024. A retest for over 1,000 candidates whose grievances were found genuine by the agency was conducted on July 19. The delay in CUET-UG results comes amid a row over alleged irregularities in competitive exams, including in NEET-UG and UGC-NET.Originally, CUET results were scheduled to be released on June 30 but NTA delayed it, grappling with paper leak allegations involving NEETUG, UGC-NET and CSIRUGC-NET. CUET-UG, conducted in hybrid mode for the first time across the country, was cancelled in Delhi a night before the scheduled exam over “logistical reasons”. The exam was conducted in the national capital later.NTA had earlier an- nounced that the third edition of CUET-UG would be com- pleted in seven days and there would be no normalisation of scores as all exams would be conducted in a single shift.For 15 subjects, the tests were in pen-paper mode and for the other 48, the exam was held in CBT mode. Over 13.4 lakh candidates registered for the test for admission to undergraduate courses in 261 central, state, deemed and private universities this year.In the first edition of the exam in 2022, the test was plagued by technical glitches. Also, as a result of tests for a subject being conducted over multiple shifts, the scores had to be normalised during announcement of results.","The largest number of students scored full marks in Business Studies (8,024), followed by Political Science (5,141) and History (2,520) In 18 of the 33 language papers offered in the exam, 1,904 scored perfect 200.

World's richest woman whose wealth surpasses modern tycoons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/worlds-richest-woman-whose-wealth-surpasses-modern-tycoons/articleshow/112078972.cms,"How Wu Zetian became empress Wu?



Natasa Stankovic Gets Trolled For Sharing Videos of Her Happy Moments with Son in Serbia

When you picture the world's richest people in the world, the names of Mukesh Ambani, Elon Musk, Jess Bezos, Bernard Arnault & family, and Mark Zuckerberg come to the mind. But long before, any of them existed a powerful Chinese Empress Wu Zetian of Tang dynasty , boasted of wealth of around 16 trillion USD , which could overshadow combined net worth of the wealthiest people across the globe.Emperess Wu Zetian was someone whose political prowess is comparable to notable women, like Joan of Arc, Queen Elizabeth I, and Catherine the Great. Popularly known as Empress Wu, the richest-ever female monarch accumulated the unfathomable fortune, with her astute vision, shrewd techniques, and brutal decisions, that also included killing of her own children, it is said. While she was hailed for some of her decisions like reducing the taxes on peasants that helps in increasing agricultural productivity and thus state revenue, she also took some controversial decisions. The controversy surrounding her life was definitely exaggerated by historians who were prejudiced towards woman with strong ambitions. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence of her cruelty towards the rich and affluent. She also was particularly ruthless towards her enemies real or imagined.As per one of the accounts, her power hunger and paranoia led her to kill one of her own children - her daughter - and depose her sons who were emperors before her. She, however, helped expand the Chinese empire significantly in the 15 years of her reign from 690 C.E. to 705 C.E.Wu Zetian was born in a wealthy family to a timber merchant in 624 AD in Shanxi province. Her father was close to Li Yuan, who eventually ascended to become Emperor Gaozong of Tang and this gave her an opportunity to forge close connections with the royal household.Empress Wu was deeply passionate about literature from a very early age and at the age of 14, she was appointed as a secretary in the Tang Palace, getting an opportunity to work under Emperor Taizong.Subsequently, the emperor's death led her to a Buddhist monastery which was a common practice for all the women associated with the emperor during that time. However her affair with Emperor Gaozong, the deceased emperor’s son and successor, once against brought an unexpected twist in her journey as she once again made her way back to the palace as a concubine.With her cunning ways, she soon ousted Empress Wang and ascended to the throne as an empress in the year 655. A major turning point for her was when Emperor Gaozong entrusted the empress with the governance of his empire after his health took a turn for the worse and he started having debilitating migraine-like headaches and vision loss.Thus, started a historic reign that made her the first and only woman to rule China. Well-educated, visionary, and an excellent public speaker, Empress Wu is credited with a number of welfare measures that also boosted trade like reducing taxation to re-opening of silk road to trade.(Image courtesy: Pinterest)","Empress Wu Zetian of Tang dynasty boasted of wealth of around 16 trillion USD.

THANE: The bad condition of service roads along the Eastern Express highway and Ghodbunder road is forcing vehicles to spill out on the highways leading to congestion and delays for outbound traffic to Mumbai, Nashik, Gujarat among others, commuters complain.A trip down the city highways reveal that major parts of the service roads including the one that passes along the chief minister’s residence in Louiswadi area remain empty even during peak hours as intra-city vehicles including bikers prefer to avoid them due to its battered state.This often results in jams on the highways affecting pace of both intra-city and outbound vehicles.“The condition of the service roads is pathetic and most of the times we end up diverting our car on the main carriageway as dodging the pockmarked roads ends up wasting our time in addition to adding to vehicle maintenance cost. Even the road which crosses the CM’s residence in Thane has suffered damage exposing the poor maintenance by the corporation,” pointed out a commuter from Ghodbunder road.“It has been observed that usually service roads are meant for movement of intra-city traffic so as not to hamper the pace of outbound vehicles on the main carriageway. However, in Thane we see an overlapping of vehicles on the highways while the service lanes end up remaining under-utilised,” complained Naresh Manera, former corporator and UBT- Thane functionary who has also objected to the ongoing integration of service lanes into the carriageway.When contacted, Prashant Sonagra, city engineer at the Thane corporation said they have started repair works of several stretches along the city. “At certain spots, the roads are damaged due to the ongoing metro rail works… There may be some potholes due to diversion of heavy traffic on service roads due to metro blocks at night.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
How a flaming car led to one of biggest fires in California's history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-a-flaming-car-led-to-one-of-biggest-fires-in-californias-history/articleshow/112122589.cms,"California had all the ingredients for a terrible fire year. All it needed was a spark, or — authorities say — a single burning car.The Park Fire raging out of control in the Sierra Nevada foothills may have started with an act of arson, after a man now in jail allegedly pushed a flaming car into a ravine. But it was able to outrun fire crews and explode in size — becoming California’s sixth-biggest fire on record — due to conditions that had been building for years.And those conditions could bode ill for the coming months.Two wet winters in a row covered the state in newly-grown grass and brush. Then summer arrived with dry air and back-to-back heat waves, turning vegetation to fuel. “That made prime conditions for fire,” said Brent Pascua, a battalion chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. “The fuel is still there, and the weather is too.”Firefighters caught a brief break Monday, with high temperatures near the Park Fire expected in the low 90s. But triple digits are forecast to return by Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. More ominously, much of the US West, including a large part of California's Sierra Nevada mountains, is forecast to be excessively hot from August 6 to August 8, according to the US Climate Prediction Center.The combination of high heat and dry vegetation is not confined to California. Oregon has seen its share of flames, and last week a fast-moving blaze ripped through Jasper, Alberta, in one of Canada’s most pristine national parks, destroying a large part of the town. Smoke from all the fires has risen high into the atmosphere and spread across the continent. Outside Florida and the Gulf of Mexico coast, few spots in the US are smoke-free right now, said Andrew Orrison, a forecaster at the US Weather Prediction Center.As it often does this time of year, high pressure has built up across the West, he said, raising temperatures and drying out the landscape. Although the annual Southwest monsoon has spun up thunderstorms, some have produced little rain, even as lightning strikes the ground — sparking more fires.So far, flames have scorched more than 726,000 acres across California this year, according to Cal Fire, well above the five-year average of 123,388 acres by this point of the summer. In a sense, the state is feeling the backlash from a relatively quiet fire season last year. Record mountain snows blanketed the higher elevations well into the summer of 2023, and relatively mild temperatures slowed the drying of grasses. Much of what grew last year is still there, waiting to burn.“There is all that biomass – fine, dry fuel – just ready to catch fire,” said Denise Knapp, conservation and research director at the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden.The Park Fire began July 24 and has now burned more than 370,000 acres, according to Cal Fire. Authorities arrested Ronnie Dean Stout II, 42, of Chico, California, after witnesses saw a man push a burning car down a 60-foot embankment, with flames spreading into the grass. The area that is now burning, including parts of Lassen National Forest, is full of steep slopes and canyons, allowing the fire to spread quickly. The blaze was only 12% contained Monday.The fire followed weeks of heat that sucked moisture from grasses and shrubs, with little relief even at night. “This 1-2 punch — i.e. the extra fuel for the fire from two years of robust growing conditions immediately followed by one of the hottest (if not the hottest) summer period on record — led to vegetation that approached or even exceeded record dryness levels, especially at lower elevations where the fire started,’’ said Daniel Swain, a climatologist at the University of California Los Angeles, in an email.Decades ago, California’s fire season was thought to be tied to the arrival of Santa Ana and Sundowner winds in late summer or early fall. But in recent years, fires have broken out in months once thought safe, particularly during droughts. Many counties across northern and eastern California have become abnormally dry in recent weeks, a stage just below drought status, according to the US Drought Monitor. As of July 23, a little more than 21% of the state was abnormally dry or in drought. Wildfires will remain a threat until the rains return.“In California it is a fire year,” Pascua said. “We have to come to terms with that.”","Two wet winters in a row covered the state in newly-grown grass and brush.

Pakistan seeks reprofiling of over $27 billion debt with friendly nations: Finance minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-seeks-reprofiling-of-over-27-billion-debt-with-friendly-nations-finance-minister/articleshow/112099105.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Cash-strapped Pakistan has sought the re-profiling of more than $27 billion in debt and liabilities with China and two other friendly nations to secure a bailout package from the IMF, according to a media report on Monday. The Washington-based International Monetary Fund last month announced that it signed a staff-level agreement with Pakistan to provide a $7 billion loan which would be disbursed for 37 months.However, it attached stringent conditions with it, requiring Pakistan prior action before the fund's board accords final approval for the loan.Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb after returning from Beijing told the media on Sunday that talks have been going on with China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE for a re-profiling of $27 billion.Aurangzeb said Pakistan had already asked the friendly bilateral trio of lenders to roll over its more than $12 billion annual debt portfolio by three to five years to secure the IMF board's approval, which is expected next month.This is on top of Islamabad's request to Beijing to convert imported coal-based projects to local coal and re-profile more than $15 billion in energy sector liabilities to create fiscal space amid difficulties in timely repayments.Pakistan has a peculiar financial arrangement with these three countries in the shape of commercial loans and SAFE deposits that are rolled over every year and form a major part of the IMF programme in terms of external financing needs.Pakistan has now requested the maturity period of these loans - $5 billion from China, $4 billion from Saudi Arabia, and $3 billion from the UAE - to be extended to at least three years, offering greater predictability under the IMF programme.Aurangzeb said the Chinese side acknowledged Pakistan's foreign exchange difficulties and wanted to help in new business ventures and the re-profiling of energy sector payments besides playing its role in supporting Pakistan's case at the IMF board as one of the major stakeholders.He said the process of debt and equity rescheduling had been started and would now go to the working groups with relevant financial institutions and sponsors of Chinese projects for which Pakistan hired local Chinese consultants.""Between now and the IMF board meeting (on the 37-month bailout package), we have to ensure confirmation of external financing"" from friendly bilateral partners, the minister said.However, he explained that the Chinese energy sector debt reprofiling had nothing to do with the IMF programme as other prior actions had been completed and structural benchmarks were under implementation.Aurangzeb said he was in contact with the Chinese, Saudi and UAE finance ministers for an extension in debt rollover for three years and they had assured their support that would place Pakistan in a very comfortable position in terms of external financing gap.""I can assure you we are at a very good place on external financing for the next three years, including year one, year two and year three,"" he said.He said the IMF had worked out a financing needs assessment for three years that also included its own $7 billion Extended Fund Facility. After rollovers from friendly countries, the remaining external financing gap would become very manageable, he said.Responding to a question, the minister said Pakistan was not seeking any incremental financing from friendly countries. ""The only incremental thing is an extension in the maturity period for three years instead of yearly rollovers,"" he said.Aurangzeb said that the issue of energy sector repayments was initially taken up by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Beijing and followed it up with formal letters to Prime Minister Li Keqiang.As part of the process, Aurangzeb, along with Power Minister Awais Leghari, held meetings with Chinese finance and energy ministers and the governor of the Chinese central bank to understand the context of Pakistan's ability to pay, economic stability and relief in energy tariffs.He said the two sides discussed conversions of Chinese power projects to local coal and how to take their technical, logistical and financial parameters forward.Secondly, financial re-profiling would also need to be discussed with banks and project sponsors one by one. ""They have recognised this and the process would now move forward on that basis,"" Aurangzeb said.He said the re-profiling of CPEC debt was also discussed with the governor of the Chinese central bank and ""we would need to go project by project given the CPEC structure"".""Very positive discussions have taken place from my perspective,"" he said, adding the debt of Chinese independent power producers (IPPs) was manageable as their legal payments were being made, but the issue pertained to return on equity to project sponsors mainly because of foreign exchange which required to be rescheduled to create fiscal space.The minister, however, clarified that Pakistan was seeking the re-profiling of payments and not ""haircuts"" - debt waiver or interest rate cuts.",Cash-strapped Pakistan has sought the re-profiling of more than $27 billion in debt and liabilities with China and two other friendly nations to secure a bailout package from the IMF.
