"Iran-Israel war: Iran airspace shut, international flights from India to take longer",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iran-israel-war-iran-airspace-shut-international-flights-from-india-to-take-longer/articleshow/121839437.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Flights between the West and India, mainly Delhi and Mumbai, will get even longer following the Iranian airspace closure on Friday after Israel attacked the country's nuclear sites. Sixteen Air India (AI) flights were impacted Friday, with the majority diverting and the others returning to origin.AI had resumed overflying Iran shortly after Pakistan had closed its airspace to Indian carriers on April 24 to partially mitigate the longer route its flights had to take since then. While AI will have to take longer routes to and from the West, IndiGo between Delhi and Tbilisi and Delhi and Baku will become one-stop flights now. With both Pakistan and Iran no-go areas, Indian carriers will have to take really longer routes to reach Central Asia. ""We are studying the situation and some AI flights may become one-stop after closure of Iran airspace,"" said sources.Also, if and when Iran retaliates, the airspace of countries near Israel, like Jordan and Lebanon, also be impacted. This has in the past forced airlines to take longer detours in that area whenever conflict escalates.""Due to the emerging situation in Iran, subsequent closure of its airspace, and in view of safety of our passengers, (some) Air India flights are either being diverted or returning to their origin. We regret the inconvenience caused to our passengers due to this unforeseen disruption and are making every effort to minimise it, including providing accommodation for passengers,"" Air India said Friday. ""Refund on cancellation or complimentary rescheduling is also being offered to guests who opt for it. Alternative arrangements are being made to fly passengers to their destinations. We advise passengers to check their flight status,"" AI added.Air India flights impacted Friday were AI-130 (London Heathrow-Mumbai), diverted to Vienna; AI-102 (New York-Delhi), diverted to Sharjah; AI-116 (New York-Mumbai), diverted to Jeddah; AI-2018 (London Heathrow-Delhi), diverted to Mumbai; AI-129 (Mumbai-London Heathrow), returned to Mumbai; AI-119 (Mumbai-New York), returned to Mumbai; AI-103 (Delhi-Washington), returned to Delhi; AI-106 (Newark-Delhi), diverted to Vienna; AI-188 (Vancouver-Delhi), diverted to Jeddah; AI-101 (Delhi-New York), diverted to Frankfurt/Milan; and AI-126 (Chicago-Delhi), diverted to Jeddah.Also impacted were AI-132 (London Heathrow-Bengaluru), diverted to Sharjah; AI-2016 (London Heathrow-Delhi), diverted to Vienna; AI-104 (Washington-Delhi), diverted to Vienna; AI-190 (Toronto-Delhi), diverted to Frankfurt; and AI-189 (Delhi-Toronto), returned to Delhi.","Sixteen Air India flights were impacted Friday, with the majority diverting and the others returning to origin.

Whether it is for goods or services… or the West Midlands as a whole, there is so much good stuff here to celebrate,” the minister added.The UK government estimates the deal could boost bilateral trade by GBP 25.5 billion annually in the long term. The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) projects a GDP increase of GBP 4.8 billion and wage growth of GBP 2.2 billion per year over the next decade.The debate in Parliament comes just ahead of UK-India Week, which begins next week as part of the India Global Forum (IGF) summit in London. Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal is among the high-level speakers expected at the event.UK-India Week will also mark the launch of the 2025 edition of the 'India Meets Britain Tracker', an annual analysis by Grant Thornton and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) that maps investment flows from India to the UK.“Indian companies continue to play a pivotal role in the UK’s growth story — from job creation to innovation. This year’s tracker showcases their growing diversification, scale and resilience, and reflects the growing maturity and confidence of Indian enterprise on the global stage,” said Anuj Chande, Partner and Head of South Asia Business Group at Grant Thornton.“Indian businesses are no longer just investing abroad – they are transforming global economies,” said India Global Forum founder Manoj Ladwa.According to last year’s report, a record 971 Indian-owned companies were operating in the UK — a number that has continued to rise. With India and the UK now ranked as the fourth and sixth largest economies respectively, the FTA is being seen as a critical pillar in one of the world’s most strategic investment corridors.","The UK government estimates the deal could boost bilateral trade by GBP 25.5 billion annually in the long term.

The Steinway powerboat is more than just a toy—it’s a Gretzky family heirloom in the making





As Dustin Johnson pursues another shot at U.S. Open glory, attention has shifted to his wife, Paulina Gretzky—not just for her support, but because of what she stands to inherit from her legendary father, the Great One, Wayne Gretzky. While Johnson has secured massive paydays from both the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, Paulina’s future is lined with generational wealth thanks to her father's illustrious career and lavish lifestyle.Wayne Gretzky, often referred to as “The Great One,” is more than just a hockey legend—he’s a financial powerhouse. With an estimated net worth of $250 million, Gretzky holds 61 NHL records and has turned his post-retirement years into a business empire. For Paulina, this means inheriting not only an enormous fortune but also a portfolio of jaw-dropping properties and luxury items.Among his holdings, Gretzky owns a lakefront estate in Idaho, multiple Florida homes, and a childhood residence in Brantford, Ontario. He even repurchased his famed ‘Gretzky Mansion’ in Thousand Oaks, California, only to flip it for a profit in 2021.But one of the most unique pieces in Wayne Gretzky's collection isn’t a home—it’s a custom, handcrafted 34-foot Steinway 340 HT powerboat.Commissioned in 2021, this bespoke mahogany boat—built by Couer Custom—is worth $900,000 and blends elegance with engineering. It can hit speeds of 50 mph but is designed for leisure. “I was relatively fast when I skated, but these days I drive my car slow,” Wayne Gretzky told Robb Report. “I'll take comfort over speed any day.”The boat features plush loungers, a main cockpit with cozy sofas, a stern sunpad, and even an electric bimini for added shade. Paulina’s mother, Janet Jones, played a pivotal role in designing its stylish aesthetic. “She’s the creative one in the family; the only thing I asked for was to have a Canadian flag at the back,” Gretzky added.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky sparks controversy by accusing Florida Panthers of buying success with tax loopholes Between her father’s sprawling real estate, massive fortune, and luxurious custom yacht, Paulina Gretzky’s future looks every bit as glamorous as her past—and Dustin Johnson may not be the biggest star in the household for much longer.","Paulina Gretzky stands to inherit millions from her father, hockey legend Wayne Gretzki.

Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, experienced a record-breaking $26 billion surge in his net worth on June 12, 2025, after Oracle’s stock skyrocketed following strong earnings. The monumental gain propelled the 80-year-old billionaire to the second spot on Forbes’ real-time billionaires list, surpassing Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, with a total fortune now standing at $243 billion just behind Elon Musk’s $407 billion. Fueled by investor optimism and Oracle’s impressive financial performance, Ellison's wealth has now outgrown the GDP of several nations. His rise reflects not only Oracle's momentum in AI but also Ellison’s enduring influence in global tech.Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison witnessed a staggering $on Thursday, June 12, driven by a sharp rally in Oracle's stock price. The massive single-day gain catapulted the 80-year-old tech mogul to the second position on Forbes’ real-time billionaires list,. According to the reports,, placing him just behind Elon Musk, who leads the list with a net worth of $407 billion.The leap in Ellison’s wealth was fueled by Oracle’s impressive earnings report, which exceeded Wall Street expectations and sparked a wave of investor confidence. With the stock hitting record highs, Ellison reaffirmed his dominance in the tech industry, not just as a business leader but as one of the wealthiest individuals in modern history, surpassing even the GDP of several small countries.The jump in Ellison's wealth followed Oracle's after-earnings rally that pushed its stock to an all-time closing price of $200. During the Wednesday afternoon announcement, Oracle logged better-than-expected quarter-ending financial results. The company had $1.70 of adjusted earnings per share and $15.9 billion of revenue, beating Wall Street estimates. Although it dipped 13% briefly after the report's release, investor confidence returned strongly, powering the upward path.According to the ET reports, Ellison's net worth today is not only staggering in comparison to single billionaires but it surpasses the total GDP of a number of nations, the IMF suggests in its 2025 estimates. These are the countries whose economies fall short of Ellison's wealth:Such a comparison puts Ellison in a fiscal league more similar to that of sovereign states than corporate bosses.Ellison, Oracle's co-founder in 1977, has been a household name in the tech industry for decades. From 2018 to 2022, he was a member of the board of directors at Tesla, aligning himself with the largest Silicon Valley names.His own business enterprises are equally impressive.

He also was instrumental in bringing a star quarterback to the University of Michigan football team his wife, Kere Zhu, being an alumnus of the university.Ellison's influence also goes beyond tech investment and high-end real estate. In January, he stood at the side of the US President Donald Trump when he unveiled Stargate, a strategic AI effort supported by Oracle, SoftBank, and OpenAI. The venture aims to grow the US's competitive advantage in artificial intelligence by developing scalable next-generation infrastructure.","Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison witnessed a staggering $ on Thursday, June 12, driven by a sharp rally in Oracle's stock price.

NEW DELHI: Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, a senior Air India pilot with nearly three decades of flying experience, was among those who died in Thursday’s plane crash shortly after take-off from Ahmedabad.Sabharwal, had called his family from the airport, assuring them he would ring again after landing in London. That call never came. His final transmission was to air traffic control, moments before Air India Flight 171 went down.Captain Sabharwal had logged more than 8,200 hours in the cockpit, according to India’s aviation regulator DGCA. Colleagues believe his actual experience was far greater, noting that the DGCA’s current digital system may not fully reflect his career history.“He was a very quiet, diligent man,” said a fellow pilot. “He flew Airbus A310s, Boeing 777s and the Dreamliner. He always kept his head down and did his work.”A resident of Jal Vayu Vihar in Powai, Mumbai, Captain Sabharwal had recently told his 82-year-old father — a former DGCA official — that he would take time off soon to be with him. That visit will now never take place.Captain Sabharwal was one of nine Mumbai-based crew members on the London-bound flight.Families who were expecting calls from Heathrow were instead confronted with news of the devastating crash.Authorised representatives from a medical laboratory on Friday, came to collect DNA samples from the family of deceased pilot Sumeet Sabharwal at his residence in Powai’s Jal Vayu Vihar on Friday. Sabharwal’s father, who is 82, and his sister, who has arrived from Delhi, are holding up stoically.","Captain Sumeet Sabharwal had logged more than 8,200 hours in the cockpit.

GFCCA then demanded it be given a plot in the city's west, in areas like Satellite, Bodakdev, and Makarba. After AMC's estate department showed GFCCA several options, a 5,601 sq. m plot in Makarba's TP Scheme No. 84 (B) was finalised.AMC then valued both plots, its valuation committee putting the Asarwa plot's total value at Rs 43.72 crore at Rs 42,700 per sq m. The Makarba plot was valued at Rs 42.65 crore, at Rs 76,150 per sq m.It was decided to give GFCCA the Makarba plot in exchange for the Asarwa plot, with the fisheries association paying the difference of Rs 1.07 crore to AMC.This plot exchange proposal was presented before the standing committee in Oct 6, 2022, but has not been approved since. As a result, AMC provided temporary shops for the fish market in Asarwa, which still exists.An official stated, ""GFCCA was to set up the fish market in Asarwa with an estimated grant of Rs 2.90 crore from central and state govts, but the plan had been facing opposition from local leaders since 2019. The market was to be set up on a plot in Makarba, but the proposal for the plot swap was not approved. There has been no decision on the matter and currently the market runs from shops allocated by AMC in Asarwa.""The bane of pigeon racingLed by the then additional chief secretary of the state govt, a meeting of the environment committee was held on Oct 6, 2022, to prevent bird strikes at the airport. The most discussed issue was pigeon racing competitions near the city airport. Airport authorities had requested AMC to ban such competitions in the area, but the civic body purportedly washed its hands off the matter, saying it was not in its scope. Finally, it was decided that AMC and airport operators would conduct joint visits to gather information on pigeon competitions in areas around the airport. Such contests are held in areas around the airport including Asarwa, Sardarnagar, Kubernagar, and Meghaninagar.","Bird strike is suspected to be one of the probable reasons behind Thursday's plane crash.

Air India crash linked to Boeing whistleblower warning

“shoddy work practices and poor oversight”

Air India death toll rises to 279

India’s New AC Rule: Cooling Between 20°C–28°C Explained

In a social media exchange in May 2024, a Twitter user responded to a post by Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticizing Boeing ’s management style. The user Gunther Eagleman @GuntherEagleman replied pointedly to the post saying:Musk responded to the user in a joking tone:the user further replied.But, the online conversation took a dark turn when another user followed up with:While Elon Musk did not publicly respond to this last comment, the thread has resurfaced after an Air India Dreamliner 787-8 aircraft crashed minutes after taking off from Ahmedabad airport on June 12. The deadly crash killed 241 of 242 people onboard the London-bound flight.In the original tweet, Elon Musk highlighted Boeing’s $4.2 billion investment in the Starliner spacecraft, contrasting it with SpaceX ’s (owned by Elon Musk) $2.6 billion for the Dragon 2, which completed four years earlier despite a near-complete redesign.He said: “Although Boeing got $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX only got $2.6 billion, SpaceX finished 4 years sooner. Note, the crew capsule design of Dragon 2 has almost nothing in common with Dragon 1. Too many non‑technical managers at Boeing.”The resurfaced conversation has gained further urgency after a recent report claimed that the Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was one of the same 787 Dreamliners that late Boeing whistleblower John Barnett had warned regulators about. Barnett, a former quality manager worked at Boeing for over 30 years. He had alleged serious flaws in the manufacturing of the 787 jets, citingat the company’s South Carolina plant. He claimed that Boeing prioritized speed over safety and even said he refused to fly on the Dreamliner. Barnett was found dead in March 2024 from an apparent suicide, shortly after testifying in a legal case against Boeing — a death that sparked widespread conspiracy theories. He is one of several whistleblowers whose warnings have resurfaced in light of recent safety incidents.The June 12 plane crash is being termed as one of the deadliest air disasters in decades. The total toll rose to 279 people killed, including 241 onboard the flight and 38 others on the ground. The lone survivor, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh said even he could not explain how he survived. ""Initially, I too thought that I was about to die, but then I opened my eyes and realised that I was still alive,"" Ramesh told national broadcaster DD News from his hospital bed.Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has directed all Boeing Dreamliner 787/9 fleet of Air India equipped with Genx engines to undergo additional maintenance and safety checks with immediate effect in coordination with the concerned regional DGCA offices.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to a Twitter user criticizing Boeing ’s management style.

India’s New AC Rule: Cooling Between 20°C–28°C Explained

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised concerns that it could take away jobs, especially entry-level roles. But Reid Hoffman , co-founder of LinkedIn believes that young people should not fear AI. Instead, they should use it to their advantage while job hunting. In a video he published on his YouTube channel this week, Hoffman said “""You are generation AI. You are AI native. So bringing the fact that you have AI in your tool set is one of the things that makes you enormously attractive”.Reid Hoffman was responding to questions from college students, many of whom were worried about their job prospects in the AI age. He admitted those fears are valid, but encouraged students to flip the script.“Yes, it’s changing the workplace and creating confusion for employers,” he said. “But it also gives you a chance to show your unique abilities. In teams with older professionals, you might even be the one helping them understand new tools,” Hoffman stated.Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, recently warned that AI could eliminate up to half of all entry-level office jobs in the next five years. He said this could cause unemployment to rise by 10% to 20%, and added, “Most people don’t realize this is about to happen.”But top tech figures like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and investor Mark Cuban strongly disagreed with Amodei’s view. Speaking at VivaTech 2025, Huang said: “I pretty much disagree with almost everything he says. AI will definitely change jobs — it changed mine — but it will also create new ones.”Cuban echoed the same sentiment in a recent social media post, pointing out that even in the past, roles like secretaries and in-office dictation staff were replaced by technology, but new industries and jobs emerged.“AI will lead to new companies and increase total employment,” he wrote.","LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman believes young people should not fear AI.

Poll Do you believe that the manufacturing practices at Boeing could endanger passenger safety? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Last year, a former quality manager at Boeing reportedly warned that the factory that made the 787 Dreamliner was plagued by ""shoddy work practices and poor oversight"". According to a report in Gizmodo, John Barnett, who had worked for Boeing for 30 years before becoming one of its most outspoken critics, said that Boeing was building the planes with ‘sub-standard’ parts and that its mandate of speed and efficiency was endangering lives. Barnett, who refused to fly on the Dreamliner, was also involved in a legal dispute with the company at the time that he died of an apparent suicide. He is said to be one of a long list of critics who expressed concern about the company’s manufacturing practices.The report claims that the Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad killing 241 passengers was the same that Barnett had warned regulators about. Barnett had worked for the US plane giant for three decades, until his retirement in 2017 on health grounds. His death in March 2024 sparked conspiracy theories due to his involvement in the legal case against Boeing.Barnett retired Boeing in 2017. In March 2024, he was found dead at his motel in Charleston, South Carolina, just weeks after testifying against the aviation giant. The local coroner’s office reportedly said that Barnett appears to have died as the result of a self-inflicted gunshot. According to a BBC report, Barnett accused Boeing of ""denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out - charges rejected by Boeing."" At the time of his death, Barnett reportedly had been in Charleston for legal interviews linked to that case.The 787 was launched in 2011, with one of the advertised benefits reportedly being that Boeing could manufacture the aircraft more cheaply than its previous models. The Gizmodo report adds that from the get-go, the plane was ridiculed for having an overly complicated assembly process. The report quoting an aviation commentator said that it was as if Boeing had said “F*ck it. Let’s throw out everything we’ve ever known or used in airplane production and use this new, unproven method.”Critics noted that the company had outsourced too many parts to too many different contractors and that there was a risk that all of those components might not properly fit together when the craft was finally assembled.","John Barnett, a former quality manager at Boeing, was found dead in 2024.

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke warned startup founders at VivaTech in Paris that while AI coding assistants can help launch companies, scaling them requires human developers and technical expertise . Speaking at Station F startup campus , Dohmke said bootstrapped startups built predominantly with AI coding tools ""doesn't have much value"" to investors and would struggle to justify funding rounds without complex systems built by skilled developers.The Microsoft-owned platform's CEO explained that non-technical founders increasingly use "" vibe coding ,"" natural language prompts that generate code, to build products with small teams and minimal funding. However, this approach creates a crowded market where investors question why they should choose one AI-built startup over another. ""The investors would ask, 'Why would I invest in you instead of the 10 other people?'"" Dohmke said, emphasizing that startups need deeper understanding of their systems to attract serious investment.Dohmke observed a dramatic shift in AI adoption over the past two years, from companies needing convincing to widespread ""FOMO"" in the market. While AI tools have democratized startup creation, he stressed that successful scaling requires developers who can build sophisticated systems. ""A non-technical founder will find it difficult to build a startup at scale without developers because they can't build a complex system to justify the next round,"" he explained.The GitHub CEO, whose platform serves over 150 million users worldwide, acknowledged the excitement around AI-driven engineering but maintained that coding skills remain essential. He previously stated that ""every kid, every child, should learn coding"" because knowing when to rely on personal coding abilities versus AI assistance is crucial. Dohmke emphasized that software engineers need ""willingness to learn"" about AI prompts while understanding when not to use them, noting that using prompts for tasks you can already do yourself ""is a waste of time.""","GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke warned startup founders at VivaTech in Paris that while AI coding assistants can help launch companies, scaling them requires human developers and technical expertise.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

'Decided this right out of high school': 18-year-old Brandon Moss launches bid for Mayor of Alabama's Fairfield,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/decided-this-right-out-of-high-school-18-year-old-brandon-moss-launches-bid-for-mayor-of-alabamas-fairfield-who-is-he/articleshow/121858160.cms,"Brandon Moss (Picture from Facebook)





Just weeks after receiving his diploma from Ramsay High School, 18-year-old Brandon Moss is charting a bold new course—running for mayor of his hometown of Fairfield.Moss, the youngest candidate in a crowded race, is vying to succeed current mayor Eddie Penny, who is not seeking re-election. The city’s municipal elections are scheduled for August 26.“I decided to do this right out of high school because I felt like I could be the change that I want to see in my city,” Moss told AL.com, speaking from outside a long-abandoned shopping center—a symbol, he said, of Fairfield’s chronic neglect.Dressed in a suit and tie as he canvasses neighbourhoods, Moss stands out among his peers enjoying a typical summer break. But for the teenager, the work has already begun.“Fairfield for far too long has not had an innovative thinker,” Moss said. “We need somebody who is able to connect our next generations and our past generations.”The city of Fairfield, located just west of Birmingham, has faced major challenges in recent decades, including widespread disinvestment, vacant properties, high crime, and a declining population. Once home to thriving retail hubs, Fairfield now struggles with a shrinking tax base and relies on the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office to bolster its under-resourced police force.According to 2024 Census estimates, the city’s population stands at around 9,500 and continues to fall.Despite the obstacles, Moss remains optimistic about Fairfield’s future. His campaign will officially launch Saturday at a rally outside the same shuttered shopping center he toured earlier—located at 6550 Aaron Aronov Drive.“I’ve seen the buildings fall apart,” Moss said. “If we look through Fairfield, we see nothing but abandoned buildings where there could be something else.”Moss envisions revitalizing the city by holding property owners accountable, engaging residents in surveys to understand their needs, and actively recruiting long-term businesses. He cited the recent opening of Carver Jones Market, the city’s first fresh food market in nearly a decade, as an example of what’s possible.“This is not a job about glorification,” he said. “It’s about how I can help the people.”Moss plans to attend the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) in the fall, majoring in political science and public administration—fields he believes will complement his leadership goals.Though his age has raised eyebrows, Moss is undeterred.“Age doesn’t guarantee wisdom or innovation,” he said.His campaign manager, Marilyn Yelder, admitted she was initially skeptical but ultimately joined his team after witnessing his commitment firsthand.Other candidates in the race include Councilmen Herman Carnes and Cedric Norman, former Midfield councilman James Reasor, and financial consultant Michael Williams.If elected, Moss said his early priorities would focus on improving city infrastructure, tackling urban blight, and addressing Fairfield’s financial challenges. He emphasized the importance of community engagement throughout.“I want to talk to my citizens. I want to know what they need in their city,” he said. “It’s not about me. It’s about the citizens.”","Brandon Moss, 18, is running for mayor of his hometown of Fairfield, Alabama. He is the youngest candidate in a crowded race.

Strong Compliance Reflects UAE’s Humanitarian Values

Poll Do you support the Midday Work Ban in the UAE? Yes, it's essential for worker safety. No, it disrupts work schedules.

Active Inspections and Supportive Measures for Worker Safety

Exceptions, Monitoring, and Penalties





Starting Sunday, June 15, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratization (MoHRE) will enforce the Midday Work Ban, a regulation prohibiting outdoor work under direct sunlight between 12:30 PM and 3:00 PM. This ban, which continues through September 15, aims to prevent heat-related illnesses and injuries during the hottest months of the year.The Ministry’s website highlights that this marks the 21st consecutive year of the ban’s implementation, underscoring the UAE’s commitment to global occupational health and safety standards. The initiative is a crucial part of creating safer work environments across the country during summer’s peak heat.According to Mohsen Al Nassi, Assistant Undersecretary for the Inspection and Compliance Sector at MoHRE:“The Midday Work Ban has achieved an outstanding compliance rate of over 99% for consecutive years, which highlights the deep-rooted social and humanitarian values within the UAE’s business community and private sector. It also reflects an advanced level of awareness regarding the importance of safeguarding human capital, which is a company’s most valuable asset.Moreover, it underscores the humane and progressive nature of UAE labour laws, particularly in relation to occupational safety and health. ”Similarly, Dalal Al Shehhi, Acting Assistant Undersecretary for the Labor Protection Sector, pointed out that:“The Midday Work Ban has become a leading example of partnership between the Ministry, the private sector, and members of the community. This is reflected in the way partners have developed initiatives for workers during the ban period, thereby promoting the concept of social responsibility and highlighting the success of awareness strategies and the entrenchment of humanitarian values in the UAE’s work environment. ”The UAE, home to more than 200 nationalities, continues to align this regulation with the broader “We the UAE 2031” vision, fostering a thriving and inclusive society.MoHRE conducts regular field inspections at worksites and workers’ accommodations to raise awareness and enforce compliance with the ban. These visits help prevent heat exhaustion and sunstroke by reinforcing the importance of adhering to safety standards.Many private companies support this initiative by providing fully equipped rest areas during the banned hours. These spaces include shaded areas, fans, sufficient drinking water, hydrating salts approved by local authorities, and first aid kits. Such measures ensure workers can rest and recover safely before resuming their duties.The ban allows exceptions for critical work that cannot be paused, such as asphalt laying, concrete pouring, and emergency repairs affecting utilities or traffic. However, these activities require authorization from relevant government authorities and must be completed promptly.To ensure strict compliance, MoHRE encourages public reporting of violations through its call centre (600590000), official website, and mobile app. Companies violating the ban face fines of AED 5,000 per offending worker, with a maximum fine of AED 50,000 for multiple violations.MoHRE continues to strengthen awareness campaigns and inspections in collaboration with both public and private sectors to maintain a safe and healthy work environment during the summer months.","UAE enforces Midday Work Ban from June 15 to September 15, banning outdoor work from 12:30 PM to 3:00 PM, with 99% compliance and fines up to AED 50,000.

Exit Permits Required for Private Sector Expats Starting July 1

This exit permit system, which is common elsewhere in the Gulf under the kafala sponsorship system , will be fully in force from July 1, 2025.





, will be fully in force from July 1, 2025. Practical implications: Private company employees cannot leave Kuwait, even temporarily, without their employer’s (the “kafeel”) approval submitted through the official government portals.





This applies to both permanent departures and routine vacations.





The process is digitized via the “Sahel” app or the Ashal Manpower Portal, but ultimate approval rests with the employer.





How the Exit Permit Process Works

Step 1: Worker submits application



Using their Civil ID and personal information, workers apply online via the Sahel app or the Ashal portal. They select start and end dates for the permit. The permit itself does not require a specific return date.

Upon employer approval, the permit is issued immediately, with no further formalities.

Upon employer approval, the permit is issued immediately, with no further formalities. Handling denials or non-response:



If the employer fails to respond or denies a request without cause, the employee can submit a complaint to the Public Authority of Manpower (PAM) to intervene.

Who is affected:

All private sector expatriates under Article 18 residency and their dependents. Government employees have long required departmental permission for travel.





Why is this rule introduced now?

Prevent illegal departures.

Ensure workers fulfill their financial and contractual obligations.

Crack down on abuses like absconding and labor market irregularities.



The Kafala Sponsorship System and the Exit Permit

While many Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have reformed or abolished parts of kafala, Kuwait’s reintroduction of the exit permit strengthens employer oversight.





The Public Authority of Manpower (PAM) outlined several objectives for this rule:



Strengthen oversight: Provide better government tracking of expatriate movement.



Balance rights: “Ensure a balance between the workers’ and employers’ rights,” preventing workers from leaving without fulfilling obligations.



Minimise violations: Reduce unauthorized departures such as workers absconding without clearing debts or proper documentation.



Curb visa trading: Help combat illicit visa trading and labor market irregularities.





Stricter Family Visa Regulations and the KD800 Salary Threshold





Minimum salary requirement:



To sponsor spouses and children under Article 22 residency, expatriates must earn at least KD800 (approximately $2,610) per month.





To sponsor spouses and children under Article 22 residency, expatriates must earn at least KD800 (approximately $2,610) per month. Background:



This salary threshold was introduced in January 2024 under Ministerial Resolution No. 56. Initially, applicants also had to hold a university degree and be employed in a profession matching their qualifications.



However, a July 2024 amendment removed the degree requirement but maintained the income threshold as the primary eligibility factor.

Enforcement campaign:



Kuwait’s Residence Affairs Investigations Department is actively identifying expatriates who initially met the KD800 salary but later fell below it due to job changes or salary reductions.

Those affected must regularize their status within one month, or they risk having their dependents sent back to their home countries.



Other Important Provisions and Exceptions





Profession consistency:



According to Article 29 of the revised regulations, only expatriates employed in jobs consistent with their declared professions can sponsor family members.





According to Article 29 of the revised regulations, only expatriates employed in jobs consistent with their declared professions can sponsor family members. Discretionary exceptions:



Children under five years old or born inside Kuwait may be granted exceptions, but these require review and approval by the Director General of Residency Affairs.





Children under five years old or born inside Kuwait may be granted exceptions, but these require review and approval by the Director General of Residency Affairs. Open application process:



The Ministry of Interior emphasizes that the family visa process is open to all expatriates regardless of nationality or educational background, as long as they meet the salary requirement.





Kuwait has long been a destination for expatriates, attracting workers worldwide with promises of stable jobs and tax-free salaries. However, the Gulf nation is now tightening controls on who enters, stays, and leaves, introducing new rules that impact everything from labor rights to family sponsorship.If you work or live in Kuwait or are planning to move there, here is a detailed breakdown of the latest visa and residency regulations, including exit permits for private sector employees, updated family sponsorship rules, and how these changes affect expats.Earlier this week, Kuwait announced a significant change affecting the country’s large expatriate workforce: all foreign private sector employees, who hold Article 18 residency, must now obtain explicit employer approval before leaving Kuwait.The system is designed to be accessible, digital, and 24/7.Kuwaiti authorities say the measure aims to:The new exit permit is tightly connected to the kafala system, prevalent across the Gulf. Under kafala, migrant workers’ visas are linked to their employers, giving sponsors significant control over employees’ legal status and movement.Kuwait has also updated rules for family sponsorship, emphasizing sponsors’ ability to financially support their dependents.","New Kuwait rules require employer-approved exit and KD800 income to sponsor dependents.

LONDON: A British Indian relative of an elderly Indian couple killed on board the Air India flight has spoken of his anger with the airline, saying the fleet that Air India uses is terrible.Tushar Jogi and his family were shell-shocked on Thursday when the news came through that the flight their relatives were on had crashed.Jogi’s cousin’s in-laws — Vallabh Nagji Agheda, a former general manager of the electricity board in Gujarat, and his wife, Vinaben Vallabh Agheda, a housewife, both from Vadodara — were in seats 21E and 21F on the Boeing aircraft. Both in their 70s, they were to come to the UK to spend a few months with their eldest daughter, her husband, and their grandchildren who live in Reading. The daughter and her whole family were en route to Heathrow on Thursday evening to fly to India.Jogi’s cousin, and his wife, an IT engineer, had been due to go to Gatwick on Thursday night to pick them up. The elderly couple have three daughters and the other two live in Gujarat. The two sisters had rushed to Ahmedabad on Thursday with their husbands to get DNA tests done so their parents’ remains could be handed over.“We are all absolutely shattered.We are all not able to digest this reality that we have lost them sadly — my cousin’s wife has lost both parents in just a single instant,” said Jogi, getting emotional. “They are the closest relatives we have in the UK. We don’t have any other family here. We are all a close-knit family,” he said, as he prepared to travel to Reading.Maharashtra-born Jogi, a British Indian social media influencer living in London, said though the couple were in their 70s they were enjoying the perfect retirement in Vadodara and spending time with all their grandchildren. “They were very fit and healthy and their life expectancy was beyond 90. They had huge love and affection from the whole family.”He said there was a lot of British concern with Air India among the Indian diaspora in Britain at “the way they treat passengers like luggage”. “The queue management is pathetic and people in the Indian community say the Air India fleet is the most horrible one. The ex-Etihad Airways Boeing 777-300ER aircraft are pathetic – the ones running from Heathrow. Seats falling apart is the default – whether 787 or 777-300ER, these Boeing fleets are horrible.

Summer drought risk







LONDON: The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years, the country's official weather service said on Monday.Temperatures for the season have been frequently elevated this century, according to the data from the Met Office, which said: ""Eight of the 10 warmest UK springs have occurred since the year 2000. ""The data ""clearly shows that recent decades have been warmer, sunnier, and often drier than the 20th century average,"" said Met Office scientist Emily Carlisle.The Met Office said provisional temperatures registered between March and May this year averaged 9.51 degrees Celsius (49.1 degrees Fahrenheit).That beat the last record, set in last year's spring, when the average was 9.37 degrees.The next warmest springs were in 2011, 2014 and 2007, according to the Met Office which has been recording temperature data since 1884.This year, the 128.2 millimetres (five inches) of rainfall recorded across the UK during the season was ""approximately 40 percent below the long-term average and still the driest spring in more than 50 years"", it said.""England was particularly dry, experiencing its driest spring in more than 100 years, beaten only by 1893,"" it added.The Met Office's Carlisle said: ""The UK's climate continues to change. What's particularly notable about spring 2025 is the combination of record warmth and sunshine, alongside very low rainfall.""""This spring shows some of the changes we're seeing in our weather patterns, with more extreme conditions, including prolonged dry, sunny weather, becoming more frequent,"" she said.The recent weather's dominant feature had been the persistent high-pressure systems, often coming from the Azores or mainland Europe.These had lingered over the UK since late February and blocked the usual flow of Atlantic weather fronts, allowing high pressure to dominate, the Met Office said.Last month, the Environment Agency (EA) called a meeting of its national drought group after it said levels in reservoirs were ""exceptionally low"".In the meeting, the EA's deputy water director, Richard Thompson warned that ""changing climate means we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades"".The agency added that, while there was no official drought yet, there was a ""medium risk"" of a summer drought without sustained rainfall.The UK government has said it would step in to fast-track the building of two new reservoirs.According to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, no new water reservoirs have been built since 1992.Scientists warn that extreme and fluctuating weather events are becoming increasingly common as planet-heating fossil fuel emissions keep rising.","The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years.

The number of migrants reaching the UK in small boats in a single day hits a 2025 high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/the-number-of-migrants-reaching-the-uk-in-small-boats-in-a-single-day-hits-a-2025-high/articleshow/121549944.cms,"Representative image (AI)





LONDON: UK government figures Sunday showed that more than 1,100 migrants arrived in the country on Saturday in small boats from France across the English Channel, the highest number recorded on a single day so far this year.The latest Home Office figures show that 1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions, bringing the provisional annual total so far to 14,811.That's 42% higher than the same point last year, an increase that has piled pressure on the Labour government, which returned to power nearly a year ago, partly on disillusionment with the previous conservative administration's efforts to get a grip on the numbers making the crossing.Having ditched the Conservative government's plan to send migrants who arrived in the UK by unauthorized means to Rwanda, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would get control by smashing the gangs and the business models that sustain their smuggling operations.Since gaining power, Starmer's government has sought better intelligence-sharing internationally, enhanced enforcement operations in northern France, and has adopted tougher rules in its immigration legislation.French police officers were seen watching Saturday as migrants boarded at a beach in Gravelines, between Calais and Dunkirk, and authorities were then pictured escorting the boats. French authorities said they rescued 184 people.""Pretty shocking, those scenes yesterday,"" defense secretary John Healey told Sky News.He added that it is a ""huge problem"" that French police are unable to intervene to intercept boats in shallow waters, adding that the UK is pressing for the French to put new rules into operation so they can intervene.""They're not doing it, but, but for the first time for years ... we've got the level of cooperation needed,"" he told Sky News. ""We've got the agreement that they will change the way they work, and our concentration now is to push them to get that into operation so they can intercept these smugglers and stop these people in the boats, not just on the shore.""Despite French and UK efforts, the cross-Channel route, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Many migrants favor the UK for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work.The home office says 36,816 people arrived in the UK on small boats in 2024, 25% more than in 2023 (29,437). The highest number of arrivals was in 2022, with 45,774.","1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions.

Expert Hints Prince William May Be King ‘Sooner Than Expected’

William’s ‘Impatient’ Duchy Rule EXPOSED | Unfiltered Management Bombshell Mirrors King Charles?





Prince William is quietly changing what it means to be heir to the throne and those who work with him say he’s not afraid to do things differently.Following King Charles’ accession in 2022, the Prince of Wales inherited the Duchy of Cornwall, a vast estate spanning over 130,000 acres across more than 20 counties in England and Wales. Now worth more than £800 million, the duchy provides income for the heir to the throne but under Prince William’s leadership, it is becoming far more than just a source of funds.The 42-year-old royal is reportedly a demanding leader who visits parts of the duchy every four to six weeks.Will Bax, the duchy’s secretary, called William ""pretty demanding,"" but in a good way.Speaking to The Telegraph, he said that the Prince is ""a man on a mission.""“He’s easy to follow because he’s got great conviction and personality, and he really wears his heart on his sleeve in terms of social interest and his desire to have a positive impact in the world.”Estate director Ben Murphy also called William’s leadership “energising”, and compared it to his father’s, ""healthy impatience, as his father did,"" which ""puts the wind in our sails,"" PeoplePrince William sees the Duchy as more than just a royal portfolio.“I see the Duchy as an extension of the work we do with the Royal Foundation,” he told the newspaper. “I see it as a branch of my philanthropy.""He further added that there’s so much good that can be done in the rural world, ""I see it as another arm to the work that I want to do, which is being a positive force for good.”Key priorities under his stewardship included tackling homelessness, supporting mental health among farmers, and boosting sustainability across rural communities. The duchy has partnered with local groups on housing initiatives and mental health outreach, particularly for those working in agriculture who often face isolation.“I’m trying to make sure I’m prioritizing stuff that’s going to make people’s lives, living in those areas, better. This is what we’re going to do to make people’s lives in Cornwall better,” William said.“That, I feel as Duke of Cornwall, is something I should be doing. It’s about responsibility, it’s about leadership and doing what’s right on the social issues of our time.”Even family getaways are laced with purpose. During visits to the Isles of Scilly with Kate and their children — Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis — the Prince often chats with locals about their needs. These conversations have already led to drastic results, including improved healthcare facilities, new housing for key workers, and steps towards more sustainable tourism.Bax said, “He’s asking us to change and evolve in a way to deliver positive impact at scale and at pace.”The duchy’s most recent Integrated Annual Report, released in July, reported a surplus of £23.9 million for the 2023–24 financial year, Prince William’s first full year as Duke of Cornwall.","Duchy of Cornwall is a vast estate spanning over 130,000 acres across more than 20 counties in England and Wales.

Meghan Markle In 'Image Push' Overhaul? Royal Expert Reveals 'Anxiousness'





Since stepping away from royal life in 2020, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have settled California their home — but their neighbours say the couple have shown little interest in becoming part of the local community.Richard Mineards, a local journalist, told the Daily Mail that while the Duke of Sussex is known to be warm and approachable, his wife has kept a much lower profile.Mineards recalled an incident where Markle reportedly turned away an elderly local historian who wished to present her with a copy of his documentary about the area. “The old man never got past the gate,” he said, adding that Markle “doesn’t play the community game.”The journalist contrasted Markle’s distant approach with that of fellow Montecito resident Oprah Winfrey, who is well-known for her visible presence at charity events.Meghan has remained practically invisible to her neighbours ever since the couple purchased their $14 million home, which has now doubled in value, Mineards said.“She’s there, of course, but she shows herself very little. Her relationship with Montecito is … distant, shall we say,” he said, adding that the former actress has managed to “cultivate a very controlled image” of herself.“She pays attention to every appearance, every word, every gesture,” the New York Post quoted.Meanwhile, Mineards described Prince Harry, 40, as “always charming, approachable, with that very recognizable Windsor accent.”The prince “has kept his good natured side,” he said.“He smiles, shakes hands, and willingly exchanges a few words.”The reporter also noted that many locals have seen Harry out and about, whether at the beach, visiting an organic coffee shop, or cycling in the nearby hills with his security following in a Range Rover.","Meghan Markle has remained practically invisible to her neighbours ever since the couple purchased their $14 million home, a local journalist said.

They inhaled a gas and scaled Everest in days. Is it the future of mountaineering?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/they-inhaled-a-gas-and-scaled-everest-in-days-is-it-the-future-of-mountaineering/articleshow/121451558.cms,"Photo/Agencies

With xenon, 'you feel better.'

The use of the gas is 'against climbing ethics.'





Climbing Mount Everest typically takes weeks, with most of that time spent at the foot of the mountain adjusting to the thin air. But four British men last week shrank that timeline dramatically, traveling from London to the summit and back in less than a week, according to the organizer of their expedition.They skipped the adjustment period, in part, by inhaling a secret weapon: xenon gas.Their feat has roiled the world of mountaineering and prompted an investigation by the Nepalese government, as use of the gas is fiercely debated. Some research has shown that xenon can quickly acclimatize people to high altitudes, even as some experts say the benefits, if any, are negligible and the side effects of its use remain unclear.Organizers said the gas was key to the speed of the climb, but their approach has prompted a broader debate that strikes at the core of mountaineering: Should scaling Mount Everest , one of sporting's greatest accomplishments, be made easier -- available to more people during a quick vacation -- with the help of a performance enhancer?""It is a provocation, especially for traditional mountaineers, who feel bad about this idea that you can climb Everest in less than a week,"" Lukas Furtenbach, who organized the exhibition, said in a phone interview from the base of the mountain.""This showed that it can work.""Furtenbach said that beginning in 2026 he planned to offer two-week round-trip excursions to Mount Everest using xenon gas, cutting the typical time needed to scale the mountain by several weeks.""This can be the future of commercially guided mountaineering on Mount Everest,"" he said.For those who live at lower elevations and have traveled to the mountains, the discomfort of altitude sickness is all too clear. Symptoms include nausea, headaches and disrupted sleep, and in some cases it can lead to brain swelling or even death.As you go higher, less oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream with each breath. That is why so many people who climb Everest use supplemental oxygen.Xenon, an odorless gas, has been known for years to activate a molecule called the hypoxia-inducible factor, which is also turned on when people acclimate to low oxygen, said Hugh Montgomery, a professor of intensive care medicine at University College London and a mountaineer who led an expedition to Mount Everest to study how humans respond to low oxygen.""So what these people claim to have done,"" he said, ""is basically found a way to switch on the adaptation to low oxygen levels.""The group took what was known from medical science, he said, ""and have now applied it, recreationally, to sport mountaineering.""Montgomery said scientists were still unsure how xenon triggers this response.While some doctors have used the gas in the past to ""precondition"" patients to low oxygen levels -- for example, before major heart surgery -- the practice hasn't really caught on because ""it hasn't been as protective as one would hope,"" he said.Mike Shattock, a professor of cellular cardiology at King's College London, said ""xenon probably does very little, and there is virtually no reputable scientific evidence that it makes any difference.""Experts cautioned that self-medicating with xenon, which has the effects of anesthesia, could lead to overdose or death, and more study was needed to understand how the gas works and its use in mountaineering.On Mount Everest, the weeks of training and acclimation on the lower levels of the mountain are typically required to survive the ""death zone,"" the area above 26,000 feet where the air is particularly thin.The British group, which included four former special forces members, took a different approach.About 10 weeks before the expedition, the men began sleeping in hypoxic tents, which lower oxygen levels in the air and gradually acclimatized the hikers to conditions on Mount Everest, Furtenbach said.While hypoxic tents have been used by some climbers for years, the big innovation for the British expedition came two weeks before the excursion, when the men flew to Limburg, Germany, outside Frankfurt, where a doctor, Michael Fries, had been experimenting with inhaled gases in his clinic.The men wore masks hooked up to ventilators as an anesthesiologist slowly introduced higher levels of xenon into their systems.Furtenbach, who has tried xenon gas on his own mountaineering trips since 2020, said that after the treatment, users experienced enhanced breathing and the sensation of more lung volume, and ""when you do your workout or training, you feel better.""After arriving at the base of Everest, the British group climbed to the summit in less than three days, which Furtenbach said was one of the fastest times for a group that hadn't acclimatized on the mountain. (According to the Nepalese government, the record for the fastest climb overall is held by Lakpa Gelu, a Sherpa, who reached the top of the mountain in just under 11 hours.)The rapid climb by the British expedition and the use of the gas caught the eye of the Nepalese government, and the fallout has been swift.Himal Gautam, director of Nepal's tourism department, which is responsible for regulating expeditions on the nation's mountains, said in an interview that using the gas was ""against climbing ethics,"" and that it would hurt the country's tourism industry and the Sherpas who help climbers by reducing their time on the mountain.Gautam said his department was looking into the use of the gas by the British climbers, one of whom, Alistair Carns, is also a member of Parliament.In an interview, Carns said that his expedition had been in touch with the ministry and clarified with the department that it had not taken the gas on the mountain.He added that many people who want to climb Mount Everest don't have the time to spend multiple weeks acclimating.""The reality is if I had six to eight weeks to climb Everest, I would, but I'm a government minister, and I don't have time,"" he said. ""What we've done is we've proven that you can reduce the timeline safely.""Others in the mountaineering community have warned against the use of the gas.In January, the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation, a global network that promotes and protects the sport, released a statement that said there was no evidence that xenon gas improved performance, adding that ""inappropriate use can be dangerous.""The federation noted that xenon has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances since 2014 and is not approved in all countries.""From a medical point of view, off-label use without a scientific basis and with unknown health risks must be rejected,"" the statement said.Furtenbach argued that his expeditions were still using Sherpas -- five accompanied the British climbers to the summit -- and that shorter times on the mountain were safer, as they reduce the chance that climbers will be exposed to other health threats, including avalanches, hypothermia or falls.He said the prohibition of the gas by the World Anti-Doping Agency didn't apply to mountaineering because it is not a regulated competitive sport.Use of the gas gets at a core question about why people climb mountains in the first place, Montgomery said.""Is it really a good idea that we can all have what we want, when we want, as quick as we want?"" he asked. ""Are we missing out on the sacrifice you sometimes have to make to get the achievement?""""I'm not a critic,"" he added. ""But maybe just bagging every hill at speed means you miss out on the joy you could have had.""","Xenon gas can quickly acclimatize people to high altitudes, some research shows. Some experts say the benefits, if any, are negligible and the side effects of its use remain unclear. Four British men last week traveled from London to the summit and back in less than a week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121451579,imgsize-856938,width-400,resizemode-4/121451579.jpg"

Passengers recount horror incident, call 'scary'







An aircraft travelling from Birmingham to Jersey passenger aircraft was forced to perform an emergency landing shortly after departure due to a ""technical issue"" affecting one of its engines.The Blue Islands aircraft, with capacity for approximately 70 passengers, departed at 15:00 BST on Sunday before returning to Birmingham Airport, successfully landing despite strong winds.The airline's representative confirmed their engineers were examining the aircraft, emphasising that passenger, crew and aircraft safety remained their top priority, BBC reported.The affected passengers received accommodation and meals for the night.The airline's official statement confirmed the crew followed standard protocols, with passengers disembarking normally.The crew received a cockpit alert indicating a ""technical issue"" and followed procedures by shutting down the engine preventively.They clarified that the engine remained under control throughout the incident.A company representative stated: ""These procedures have an abundance of caution built into them to ensure passenger safety.""Birmingham Airport confirmed one flight diversion, with no additional runway restrictions implemented.Leanne Rowe, travelling with family for holiday, attempted to calm her children whilst feeling uncertain herself.She stated: ""It was pretty scary - straight from the start it was quite rocky...""My daughter was quite upset about it... at some point in the air the captain said to us that we were going to turn around because there was a problem with the engine.""You don't really know how serious that is.""She noted fire engines were present upon landing. Lauren York described the landing as ""very worrying."" York mentioned her 20-month-old son remained asleep throughout. She said: ""When we touched ground and we were swerving all over the place, that was really frightening.""We were just holding on to him thinking are we going to make it? It was very worrying.""Sarah Brown praised the pilot's handling of the situation, despite the frightening experience.She said: ""We knew we'd get here safely in the end."" She noted that afterwards her children ""got to go in the cockpit, meet both the pilots, so they had an experience"".The AAIB decided not to investigate further after reviewing the incident.","The Blue Islands aircraft was travelling from Birmingham to Jersey.

UK renationalises first train operator under Labour reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-renationalises-first-train-operator-under-labour-reforms/articleshow/121392033.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)

Public good:





A private train operator servicing parts of southern England, including London, on Sunday became the first to be returned to public ownership under a government plan to renationalise Britain's much-maligned railways.All UK rail operators are due to be renationalised within the next two years in a key policy launched by Prime Minister Keir Starmer following his Labour party's return to government last July after 14 years in opposition.""South Western Railway is now under public ownership. And this is just the start,"" Starmer said on X, naming the service kickstarting his government's plan.He vowed the renationalisation ""will put passengers first"", with ""better services, with simpler ticketing, on more comfortable trains"".Train passengers in Britain suffer from frequent cancellations, in addition to high ticket prices and regular confusion over which services they can be used on.The privatisation of rail operations took place in the mid-1990s under the Conservative prime minister of the time, John Major, but the rail network remained public, run by Network Rail.Four of the 14 operators in England are already run by the state owing to poor performance in recent years, but this was originally meant to be a temporary fix before a return to the private sector.Labour triumphed over the Conservative party in elections last year, with its manifesto including promises to fix the country's ailing transport services.Legislation was approved in November to bring rail operators into public ownership when the private companies' contracts expire -- or sooner in the event of poor management -- and be managed by ""Great British Railways"".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said in a statement that will end ""30 years of fragmentation"", but warned that ""change isn't going to happen overnight"".""We've always been clear that public ownership isn't a silver bullet, but we are really firing this starting gun in that race for a truly 21st-century railway, and that does mean refocusing away from private profit and towards the public good,"" she added.In an example of how passengers might not immediately notice much difference, South Western's first service under public ownership on Sunday was set to include a rail replacement bus because of engineering work.Government figures show that the equivalent of 4 per cent of train services in Britain were cancelled in the year to April 26.The rate was 3 per cent for South Western.Rail unions -- which have staged a stream of strikes in recent years over pay and conditions due to a cost-of-living crisis -- welcomed the state takeover.""We're delighted that Britain's railways are being brought back where they belong -- into the public sector,"" said Mick Whelan, general secretary of union Aslef.""Everyone in the rail industry knows that privatisation... didn't, and doesn't, work,"" he added.Two operators serving towns and cities in southeastern and eastern England are next to be brought back into public ownership by late 2025.All the current contracts are set to expire by 2027.UK media reported that the renationalisation of South Western means a third of journeys are now on publicly owned services.The government has said renationalisation will save up to £150 million ($200 million) per year because it will no longer have to pay compensation fees to rail operators.The main rail operators in Scotland and Wales, where transport policy is handled by the devolved administrations in Edinburgh and Cardiff, are also state-owned.","South Western Railway is the first UK train operator to be returned to public ownership.

The United States is seeing a marked drop in popularity in many countries during the second term of President Donald Trump, according to a study by the nonpartisan Pew Research Centre released on Wednesday.The survey, carried out in 24 countries, showed overall ratings of the US falling in 15 countries since last spring, with Mexico, Sweden, Poland and Canada displaying the biggest increase in negative views.Respondents were asked about overall views on the US and the state of its democracy as well as about their opinion of Trump, both with regard to his personal traits and his ability to handle major global issues.Most of the interviews were conducted after the notorious meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on February 28 and before Trump announced tariffs on countries around the world on April 2.Mexico and Sweden were the two countries where the opinion of the US suffered most, with drops of 32 percentage points in positive ratings (from 61% to 29%) in the first and 28 percentage points (47% to 19%) in the second in comparison with 2024.US popularity among adults in Poland and Canada fell by more than 20 percentage points over the year in both countries.The fall in US popularity in Germany was also marked: from 49% to 33% (16 percentage points).Opinions about the US in the UK, Greece, Hungary, South Africa, Argentina and India showed little change.People in three countries — Israel, Nigeria and Turkey — became slightly more likely to give the US good marks.Israel was the country with the highest percentage (83%) of people with a positive assessment of the US.Sweden had the most people who view the US unfavourably (79%).Despite the increase in popularity in Turkey, the country still has one of the most unfavourable opinions of the US, with just 25% of adults having a positive view of the country.In Germany, 66% had a negative view of the US.Younger people (35 and below) in most countries surveyed had a more positive view of the US than those aged 50 and above.This was particularly noticeable in Brazil, with 73% of younger adults giving a positive assessment compared with 37% of older adults who have an unfavourable view.Political ideologies also played a large role in peoples' opinions.Among the 51% of people in Israel who say they are ideologically rightist, 97% had a favourable view of the US.Australia also displayed a wide gap between those on the right, of whom 60% viewed the US positively, and those on the left, where the number dwindled to 12%.In Germany, supporters of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party were far more likely to have positive opinions of the US (63%) than those who do not back the party (25%).The US president received mostly negative ratings in the survey, with more than half of adults in 19 of the countries saying they had little or no confidence in Trump's ability to lead world affairs.This is despite the fact that majorities in 18 countries viewed him as a ""strong leader.""The survey showed that a median of 34% of adults have a lot or some confidence in Trump's ability to give good leadership in world affairs, while 62%) have little or no confidence in him.His highest ratings came from Nigeria (79% confidence), Israel (69%), Kenya (64%), Hungary (53%) and India (52%).Adults in Mexico had the least confidence (8%), followed by Sweden (15%), Turkey (16%), Germany (18%) and Spain (19%).In 17 countries, men have more confidence in Trump than women, with this difference most marked in Sweden, Poland, and the UK. In Germany, the gender gap was 11 percentage points.Those on the right of the political spectrum also see him more positively.In all, 13 nations gave lower ratings for Trump than they did for his predecessor, Joe Biden, in 2024, but they are higher in six countries.Trump received his lowest marks on climate change policy, with a median of just 21% of people of the opinion that he can handle the challenges posed by global warming.Just 33% thought he could resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and 29% the ""conflicts between Israel and its neighbours.""","Survey shows overall ratings of the US falling in 15 countries since last spring. Mexico, Sweden, Poland and Canada showed the biggest increase in negative views. People in three countries — Israel, Nigeria and Turkey — became slightly more likely to give the US good marks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121826618,imgsize-1226223,width-400,resizemode-4/121826618.jpg"
