NEW DELHI: Maharashtra Samajwadi Party chief and MLA Abu Azmi has written to assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar requesting the revocation of his suspension.Azmi, who was suspended on Wednesday over his remarks on Mughal ruler Aurangzeb , argued that his statement was misinterpreted and taken out of context.In his letter, Azmi stated, ""Everything I said was based on quotes from various historians and writers. I did not make any controversial remarks about Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj. I deeply respect both Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj .""Azmi was suspended for the remainder of the ongoing budget session after he claimed in an interview that India flourished under Aurangzeb's rule and described the Mughal emperor as a great administrator.His remarks sparked controversy, leading to his suspension. Following the decision, Azmi took to social media, calling the action against him ""unfair"" and questioning whether ""two sets of laws"" existed in the state. He also compared his case to that of BJP leaders Prashant Kortkar and Rahul Sholapurkar.In his earlier statement, Azmi had said Aurangzeb should not be viewed solely as a tyrant but also as an administrator who contributed to India's expansion.He added that the conflict between Aurangzeb and Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj was political rather than religious. While Azmi later apologised for his remarks, he maintained that his words had been misrepresented and reiterated that his comments were based on historical accounts.",Abu Azmi has written to assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar requesting the revocation of his suspension.

Google marked International Women’s Day 2025 with a special Doodle honouring the achievements of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The artwork highlights key breakthroughs and discoveries made by female pioneers in these fields, celebrating their impact despite historical challenges.Women have long played a crucial role in STEM, yet their participation has remained disproportionately low since the 18th century’s Age of Enlightenment, when scientific and technological advancements became more structured disciplines. Scholars and policymakers have noted that these fields have traditionally been dominated by men, with women facing barriers to entry, recognition, and career advancement. The Doodle serves as a tribute to those who have pushed boundaries and made significant contributions, paving the way for future generations. Notable figures include Marie Curie, who won two Nobel Prizes for her groundbreaking work in radioactivity; Ada Lovelace, often regarded as the first computer programmer; and Katherine Johnson, whose calculations were critical to NASA’s early space missions.In recent years, efforts have increased to close the gender gap in STEM through education, policy changes, and advocacy. Initiatives promoting women’s involvement in science and technology continue to challenge stereotypes and create more opportunities for aspiring female professionals. Google’s latest tribute aligns with these efforts, aiming to inspire young women to pursue careers in these fields.International Women’s Day (IWD) is observed annually on 8 March to celebrate the achievements of women across various spheres, including social, economic, cultural, and political domains. The day also serves as a call to action for gender equality and women’s rights.The origins of IWD trace back to the early 20th century when women’s movements worldwide began advocating for better working conditions, voting rights, and equal opportunities. The United Nations officially recognised the day in 1977, and it has since grown into a global event marked by rallies, discussions, and campaigns aimed at addressing gender disparities.","Google marked International Women’s Day 2025 with a special Doodle honouring the achievements of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) The artwork highlights key breakthroughs and discoveries made by female pioneers in these fields.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Friday claimed that India has agreed to cut down tariffs adding that ""somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done.""

Can’t you find a safe house in Delhi, judge asks Agusta accused

NEW DELHI: Christian Michel James , one of the alleged middlemen in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper case who was granted bail by Delhi high court earlier this week, appeared before a city court on Friday and submitted that he could not accept it and wanted to go back to custody as Delhi was unsafe for him.Saying that because of ""security risks"", he would rather finish his sentence and leave India instead of being released on bail, he submitted before the court of special judge Sanjeev Aggarwal, ""I can't accept the bail. It's unsafe. Every time I step out of Tihar, something happens. The problem I am having is with police. I'd rather talk to you in private.""When the judge asked about his well-being, James said Delhi was just a larger prison for him. He mentioned something happened in AIIMS that he would rather talk to the court about in private.Christian Michel James was extradited from the UAE in 2018 in Rs 3600-crore money laundering case registered by ED. Later in the day, the court imposed the necessary bail conditions for releasing him. After James asked the court to talk in private, the judge sent the mediapersons and police outside the courtroom.Earlier this week, while granting him bail, HC said it was an exceptional situation where the accused was in custody for over 6.2 years but the trial had not yet commenced due to incomplete investigation. On Feb 18, Supreme Court had granted him bail in a related CBI case subject to terms and conditions decided by the trial court. In both cases, the court directed James to furnish a personal bond and surety of Rs 5 lakh each, at which James said, “How can a person who has been in jail for six years produce local sureties?”When James said that he did not want to be released on bail, the judge said, “Can’t you find a safehouse in Delhi?” James was extradited from Dubai in Dec 2018 and was subsequently arrested by CBI and ED. James is among the three alleged middlemen being probed and the other two are Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa. CBI, in its chargesheet, claimed an estimated loss of 398.21 million euros (about Rs 2,666 crore) to the exchequer due to the deal that was signed on Feb 8, 2010, for the supply of VVIP choppers worth 556.262 million euros.

JAMMU: Chief minister Omar Abdullah on Friday presented a Rs 1.12-lakh crore budget for 2025-26, the first by an elected government in J&K in seven years, as he heaped praise on PM Narendra Modi, promised all-round growth and ladled out a salad of sops for disadvantaged groups.Terming the document a roadmap for growth and a true reflection of people’s aspirations, Omar said J&K was at the cusp of a new era of peace and prosperity, with a semblance of normality returning after over 30 years of turmoil.Attired in a traditional suit and a skull cap, Omar started his 90-minute budget speech in the assembly in English, with a Persian couplet “Tan Hama Daag Daag Shud–Punmba Kuja Kuja Neham (my entire body is covered with bruises, where should I apply the balm)” amid thumping of benches by legislators of his National Conference (NC).The last budget was tabled in 2018 under the then PDP-BJP govt in the erstwhile state of J&K, which was accorded Union Territory status following the abrogation of Article 370 on Aug 5, 2019.Omar, who has retained the finance portfolio with himself, also praised Union home minister Amit Shah and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman for support in various areas. He said the improved environment was contributing to progress, with J&K’s economy expanding from Rs 1,64,103 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 2,45,022 crore in 2023-24. “GDP for 2025-26 is projected at Rs 2,884,22 crore, reflecting a growth of 9.5% over the previous year,” Omar added.Revealing other key fiscal indicators, the CM pegged the tax-GDP ratio at 7.5% for 2025-26 and fiscal deficit at 3% of J&K’s GDP. “This is substantially lower than 5.5% in 2024-25 (RE). Expected revenue receipts are Rs 97,982 crore and capital receipts Rs 14,328 crore. Similarly, revenue expenditure is estimated to be Rs 79,703 crore and capital expenditure Rs 32,607 crore,” the CM said, focusing on a zero-deficit revenue account budget.An additional Rs 41,000 crore is to flow as central assistance and Rs 13,522 crore as centrally sponsored schemes and Prime Minister’s Development Package (PMDP). “J&K continues to face significant infrastructure deficits. I met Prime Minister (Modi), home minister (Shah), and finance minister (Sitaraman) on multiple occasions. Our efforts have paid off -- the central govt has approved special assistance for J&K and will support fiscal reforms to enhance revenue and expenditure management,” Omar said.Marriage assistance for women under the AAY category will be raised from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Omar topped this up with free bus rides for women. “On International Women’s Day (March 8), I will announce free ridership for women on all govt-owned transport, including e-buses, starting April 1, 2025. This will enhance access to education and employment while ensuring safer, more affordable travel,” the CM said.Marriage assistance for women under the AAY category will be raised from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Omar topped this up with free bus rides for women from April to “enhance access to education and employment while ensuring safer, more affordable travel”.Pensions have been enhanced to Rs 1,250 per month for people above 60yrs, Rs 1,500 for those between 60 and 80, and Rs 2,000 per month for those aged 80 and above. The payouts were last fixed at Rs 1,000 in 2016.Buoyed by record-breaking 2.36 crore tourist footfalls in 2024, Omar unveiled a slew of initiatives for the sector. “Tourism’s contribution to GSDP will be increased from 7% to 15% in 4-5 years,” the CM said.Omar’s rivals were not persuaded. PDP said the budget exposed the “gap” between the promises Omar’s NC had made during assembly elections last year and the reality of its governance. BJP dismissed it as a “complete failure”.By limiting the food and free power benefits only to AAY ration card holders, the govt has excluded a vast majority of the state’s population, PDP argued. Peoples’ Conference chief Sajad Lone described the budget as a “disappointment”. “Same old style of parroting of centrally sponsored schemes with Hindi nomenclature,” Lone said.(With inputs from agencies)","Chief minister Omar Abdullah presented a Rs 1.12-lakh crore budget for 2025-26.

"Nitish Kumar loses cool, again: Why Bihar CM's frequent outbursts may upend state politics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nitish-kumar-loses-cool-again-why-bihar-cms-frequent-outbursts-may-upend-state-politics/articleshow/118790264.cms,"Get the latest lifestyle updates on Times of India, along with Women's Day wishes, messages and quotes !



NEW DELHI: Is Nitish Kumar losing his cool way too often these days? On Friday, the Bihar chief minister lost his temper inside the state legislative council and surprised many with his choice of words to refer to former chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi .""Jab iske husband doob gaye to apni wife ko bana diya (When her husband began to sink, he installed his wife (in the CM's post))"", Nitish said referring to Lalu Prasad's move to make Rabri Devi the chief minister after he was forced to resign from the post following an arrest warrant in a fodder scam case.It all started after RJD MLC Urmila Thakur, citing the example of her Begusarai district said ""in many villages, girls are deprived of education as reaching the nearest school requires them to walk four to five kilometers"".This irked Nitish Kumar, who lashed out at the opposition and said: ""Do you people even know what we have done for girls' education? Village girls hardly went to schools in Bihar until we came to power.""When Urmila Thakur objected, Nitish stepped up his attack.""The education system had collapsed during the RJD government. It was I who revived it,” the CM said. ""What did the RJD government do for women? Where did women study earlier? They barely had access to primary education,” he added.Then the Bihar chief minister went on to launch a frontal attack on Rabri Devi and mocked at the way she was made the chief minister by her husband Lalu Prasad.Also read: 'Mahila has no problems': Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's remark sparks spat with opposition women lawmakers - watch Leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav strongly objected to the language used by Nitish Kumar for his parents and once again raised questions over Bihar chief minister's health. ""I pity the condition of chief minister and I don't want to comment any more on this aspect. His falling health has proved that he is not fit to run Bihar anymore,"" Tejashwi said.""There should be some decency in language when you are holding the post of chief minister. Rabri Devi became the chief minister before him and that too of undivided Bihar and he is referring to her as ""re"" and ""tu"","" he added.""Nitish Kumar should know that Rabri Deviji was the first woman chief minister of the state. She is elder to Nitish both in age and also in relationship,"" the RJD leader said.And while targeting Nitish over his health suits Tejashwi's politics, senior political analyst N K Choudhary has a different take on the changed behaviour of Bihar chief minister.""Nitish Kumar is perhaps reacting to the challenges he faces to his undisputed leadership for the first time. Nitish enjoyed unbridled power for over 15 years but realises that political dynamics in the state has changed,"" says Choudhary, who is also a former professor of Patna University.Also read: 'I made your father': Bihar CM Nitish to Tejashwi Yadav amid big showdown in assembly ""No one could question Nitish Kumar and there was no challenge to his authority all these years. This perhaps led to some arrogance. Also, the social system that gave him power increased his ego over the years. So, now when questions are raised over his governance or his development claims are criticised, Nitish reacts very strongly,"" says N K Choudhary.""Even Lalu Prasad, during his prime enjoyed a lot of power and would often say ""I am the king,"" he adds.Whatever be the reason, those who have followed Nitish Kumar and seen his politics over the years, do feel that there is a perceptible change in his behaviour. In fact, one of the biggest factors that differentiated Nitish from his arch rival Lalu Prasad, who is also a mass leader, was the grace with which the JD(U) chief handled his critics and the opposition.With elections scheduled later this year in Bihar, Tejashwi has stepped up his attack on Nitish. However, the strong reactions from Bihar chief minister seem to suggest that he is not ready to take such political attacks lying low. May be Nitish feels offence is the best defence. More so, as his dominance in Bihar politics is perhaps on the decline. However, what Nitish needs to realise that his frequent outbursts will give the opposition an opportunity to raise more questions on his health - a narrative that not just suits RJD's Tejashwi, but also the BJP. The saffron party, which is now the senior partner in the Bihar alliance, would be keen to lead the alliance once the Nitish era comes to an end.(With inputs from agencies)","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar lost his temper inside the state legislative council.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission EC on Friday announced that it will resolve the longstanding issue of duplicate Electors Photo Identity Card (EPIC) numbers within the next three months. In an official statement, the commission acknowledged the presence of multiple voters with the same EPIC numbers due to past discrepancies in the allotment process. This comes as West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Congress raised the issue accusing the poll body of voters list manipulation to favor the BJP.In an official statement, the EC clarified that despite duplication, all electors linked to the electoral roll of a particular polling station can only vote at that designated location, ensuring no misuse of duplicate IDs. A sample verification of over 100 voters with identical EPIC numbers confirmed that they were genuine electors.""Irrespective of an EPIC number, an elector who is linked to the electoral roll of a particular polling station can cast his vote at that polling station only and nowhere else,"" the commission stated in its official release.The poll body said the issue arose due to incorrect series usage when the EPIC system was introduced in the year 2000. Since individual states and union territories managed electoral roll databases independently, errors in numbering went undetected at the national level.""It is a matter of electoral integrity. We have taken cognizance of the issue and are committed to ensuring a unique national EPIC number for all voters,"" said Anuj Chandak, director at the election commission.To rectify this, the commission said it will ensure a unique national EPIC number for all existing voters with duplicate numbers and for new electors in the future.Within minutes of the statement, Mamata's TMC reacted strongly alleging that the poll body's remark was in fact admission of the guilt.""Election Commission of India has finally admitted & accepted their guilt that duplicate EPIC numbers have been allotted to multiple people. This is a scam & answers must be given: TMC's Saket Gokhale said.""All of this has happened because CM Mamata Banerjee nailed the lies of the ECI and exposed this scam. After being in denial, ECI now says it will “fix the issue” in just 3 months. It has also given a very UNCONVINCING explanation that “this duplication of EPIC has happened since the year 2000 due to registration officers using incorrect alphanumeric series,” the TMC wrote on X.Congress rejects 'feeble' explanationMeanwhile, Congress also rejected EC's ""feeble and duplicitous explanation"" and demanded the agency to ""come clean"".""The Election Commission, in a letter issued on September 18th 2008 to Chief Electoral Officers of all States, had said that 'voter-IDs are unique'. However, the ECI today says, the issue of duplicate voter-IDs is a ""decades long issue"". Which statement of the ECI should the citizens of India believe? Why should an average Indian voter today trust the Election Commission?""

NEW DELHI: The ministry of external affairs on Friday addressed the tariff imposition threat from US President Donald Trump from April 2. The MEA said the country intended to ""reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers "" with the intention to ""deepen India-US two-way trade"".Amid stern response from Canada, China and Mexica, who have imposed reciprocal tariffs on the States and have also filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation, India, in its cautious response said, ""Our objective through the BTA is to strengthen and deepen India-US two-way trade across the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries.""Trump has repeatedly said that India is a high-tariff nation and has expressed his intentions to pull off a tit-for-tat. ""And the big one will be on April 2, when reciprocal tariffs, so if India or China, or any of the countries that really...India is a very high tariff nation,"" he said on Friday.The MEA response comes in amid reports of Trump administration pushing for India’s consent to eliminate tariffs on automobile imports as part of a proposed bilateral trade deal. However, India remains cautious about bringing the duties down to zero immediately, though it is open to considering potential reductions, sources told Reuters.India imposes import duties of up to 110% on vehicles, a tariff Tesla CEO Elon Musk has criticized as one of the highest globally. The steep duties previously prompted the electric vehicle giant to shelve its plans to enter India's automobile market, the third-largest in the world.According to the think tank GTRI, emerging trade barriers present India with an opportunity to explore alternative sourcing options, particularly from Canada, where key commodities may now be more competitively priced.Canada plays a vital role in supplying essential imports that align with India's high-demand sectors. Earlier in 2024, the US imported substantial volumes of crude petroleum oil ($103 billion), refined petroleum oil ($12.9 billion), and fertilizers ($3.1 billion) from Canada, highlighting its strong export capacity.India’s own import needs are significant across key commodities, including crude oil ($140.3 billion), gold ($42.5 billion), copper ($2.8 billion), ethylene polymers ($2.2 billion), plastics ($1.3 billion), and fertilizers ($1.3 billion). With Canada already exporting copper cathodes ($1.3 billion), gold ($4.3 billion), ethylene polymers ($2.2 billion), and plastics ($2.1 billion), it could emerge as a key supplier for India's growing demand.It noted that escalating trade tensions could work in India's favor by boosting exports and attracting greater American investments. Srivastava highlighted that during his first term, Trump scrapped NAFTA in favor of the USMCA in 2018-19, arguing that the older agreement was outdated and harmful to American workers.","The MEA said the country intended to ""reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers"" with the intention to ""deepen India-US two-way trade"" The MEA response comes in amid reports of Trump administration pushing for India’s consent to eliminate tariffs on automobile imports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118789904,imgsize-1074727,width-400,resizemode-4/118789904.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam on Friday claimed that the state unit of Congress is going through a severe monetary crunch leading to nonpayment of rent and electricity bill of the party office. Former state president of the grand-old-party, who joined Eknath Shinde months before the assembly elections said that the incompetence of the state and the national leadership of the party led to this situation.""The Mumbai Congress is just one step away from being shut down. The current ineffective and incompetent leaders of the Mumbai Congress are to blame for this situation. The office, which operates in the premises of the Maharashtra government's PWD department, has not paid rent for several years, resulting in an outstanding bill of 18 lakh rupees. The electricity bill has reached nearly 5 lakh rupees, and the electricity supply company eventually removed the meter and disconnected the power,"" Nirupam said.""This situation reflects the lack of leadership and capability among the leaders. For about 9 to 10 months, Mumbai Congress employees have not received their salaries. The party is in a silent mode with no events being organized, mainly because the leadership has completely failed,"" he added.Further, taking a jibe at Rahul Gandhi, Nirupam said that leaders seldom meet party workers in the state and make a video for YouTube and leave. He blamed the Congress' alliance with Thackeray’s party, Shiv Sena (UBT), for its decline.""Rahul Gandhi yesterday came to Mumbai not as a Congress leader but as a YouTuber to make a video in Dharavi. While the Mumbai Congress' condition is getting worse, their leaders are more busy making videos,"" Nirupam said""This is the result of effective leadership. In 2019, when the alliance between Shiv Sena and Congress was forming, I advised against it, warning that the Congress party would gradually weaken. Five to six years later, this prediction is coming true, with only three MLAs remaining, who rely heavily on Muslim votes. Currently, in Mumbai, Uddhav Thackeray's party is the first choice because they appear strong. The Mumbai Congress and the Congress party have become subordinate to Uddhav Thackeray's party, and the incompetence of Delhi's leaders is evident. They have accepted that they cannot stand on their own and rely on allies, leading to the party's downfall. In the coming days, the Congress party in Maharashtra will face a similar fate as it did in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar,"" he added.This comes days after Harshwardhan Sapkal became the new chief of the party's Maharashtra unit. Sapkal takes over from Nana Patole, who had resigned following the party's poor performance in the Maharashtra Assembly elections.In the 2024 assembly elections, the Mahayuti coalition of BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP won 235 of the 288 seats, with BJP securing 132 alone. Shinde's Sena secured 57 seats and Ajit Pawar's NCP got 41 seats.On the other hand, it was a disappointing show by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) which was hoping for a grand comeback.

PUNE: Maharashtra's Economic Survey 2024-25 released Friday by deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar revealed an alarming decline in the number of beneficiaries and financial allocations across women's welfare schemes .Shakti Sadan facilities , which provide rehabilitation services to trafficking victims and vulnerable women, recorded a dramatic 57% drop in inmates - from 3,902 in 2023-24 to 1,672 in the current fiscal. Similarly, govt women hostels, shelter homes and protective homes collectively served 4,527 women in 2024-25, 32% down from 6,654 the previous year. The funding for these facilities was slashed by 36%, from Rs 15.31 crore to Rs 9.82 crore.The report states that women counselling centres experienced one of the biggest funding cuts, with allocations reduced by 69% (from Rs 4.20 crore to just Rs 1.32 crore), while their beneficiary count fell by 29% - from 25,734 to 18,322.Protection services for domestic violence victims saw a 17% decrease in no. of beneficiaries (from 11,722 to 9,704) & a 20% reduction in funding (from Rs 30.95 cr to Rs 24.63 cr).Sakhi Nivas accommodations for working women dipped 20%, from 5,483 to 4,411.

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah on Friday presented his record 16th budget, allocating Rs 4,535 crore for minority welfare programmes - an increase of 33% over Rs 3,409 crore last year - igniting a political firestorm with BJP branding it 'halal budget' and accusing Congress govt of practising ""appeasement"" politics.However, a big takeaway from the budget, with a total outlay of over Rs 4 lakh crore, was a massive increase in capital expenditure by 25%, compared to just 2% last year. Within capital expenditure, the two biggest increases are in public works (187%) and urban development (173%). The CM made a specific mention of Bengaluru, saying the yearly grant of Rs 3,000 crore being provided to the city will be enhanced to Rs 7,000 crore.The state economic survey released Friday estimates that Karnataka will grow by 7.4% this fiscal, higher than India's growth of 6.4%. Agriculture has made a sharp turnaround because of good rains. Services grew by 8.9%, higher than the 7.9% in the previous fiscal. This was led by IT-related services that grew by 11.1%, up from 10.2% in 2023-24. Despite the significantly higher capital allocations, Siddaramaiah has managed to keep the fiscal deficit at 2.95% of state GDP, just below the limit mandated under Karnataka Fiscal Responsibility Act.Among the schemes for minorities in the budget is the revival of 'Shaadi Bhagya' in a new avatar - which entails a dole of Rs 50,000 to each eligible couple from economically weaker sections - and introduction of reservation for Muslims in govt contracts up to Rs 2 crore. Waqf minister BZ Zameer Khan justified minorities welfare schemes, saying the allocation was ""minimal"".BJP spokesperson Anil Antony slammed the quota provided to minorities, saying it is unconstitutional and a huge deviation from the principles of Dr B R Ambedkar, who strongly opposed reservations based on religious grounds. ""Congress is now disregarding its past credentials and is evolving into a modern version of Jinnah's Muslim League,"" he added. Antony cited provisions in the budget, including Rs 6,000 per month for imams, Rs 150 crore for development of waqf properties, reinstatement of the scrapped 4% Muslim quota and 4% reservation in every govt contract worth up to Rs 2 crore.

NEW DELHI: CBSE's proposal to conduct class X board exams twice a year has drawn mixed reactions. It is learnt that while some hail it as ""student-centric"", teachers, administrators and parents worry about execution, academic pressure and financial burden. CBSE has received extensive feedback, open till March 9.According to CBSE sources, the feedback also indicates that many assume the reform will be extended to class XII board exams subsequently. Schools, teachers, parents and students have submitted their views individually and jointly.Proponents argue the initiative offers flexibility and a chance to improve scores. ""If a student underperforms in one exam, they can attempt the second to improve marks. Those failing specific subjects can reattempt or replace them,"" said a student from Podar International School, Bengaluru.However, critics, according to an official, warn the system may increase stress. ""Two attempts mean students may feel compelled to appear twice, prolonging exam pressure,"" said a teacher.Another major concern is extended exam schedule from Feb to May. ""This disrupts the academic calendar and shortens summer vacations. Teachers will have to evaluate papers twice,"" said a school administrator. Feedback highlights that the reform may affect required 210 teaching days. ""The two-phased exam stretches over four months, impacting teaching schedules and increasing logistical challenges,"" said a director of a private school chain in north India.","CBSE's proposal to conduct class X board exams twice a year has drawn mixed reactions.

NEW DELHI: Election Commission, responding to concerns raised by some political parties regarding duplication in electors photo identity card (EPIC) numbers, announced on Friday that it would resolve the ""decades-old issue"" within the next three months.Sharing that a recent sample inquiry of over 100 electors had revealed those with duplicate EPIC numbers to be genuine electors, EC said it has, following detailed consultations with technical teams and the concerned chief electoral officers (CEOs), set a three-month timeframe to ensure the allotment of a unique national EPIC number to the existing electors having duplicate EPIC number and to all future electors.The three-month deadline - which will ensure that all duplicate entries are corrected before next assembly poll becomes due in Bihar - was fixed as the number of duplicate EPIC issued across the country was found to be small.EC reiterated that ""irrespective of an EPIC number, an elector linked to the electoral roll of a particular polling station can cast his vote at that polling station only ."" Given that EPIC is issued to a voter solely on the basis of his inclusion in the electoral roll and any changes can be made during the annual or pre-poll roll updation, followed by a two-stage appellate process, it revealed that just 90 appeals - including 89 filed with district election officer, the first appellate authority, and one with chief electoral officer (CEO), the second and final appellate authority - were filed across the country at the last annual summary roll revision taken up between Aug 7, 2024 and Jan 10, 2025.All the 90 appeals were filed in the sole state of Maharashtra. Though TMC has been at the forefront of flagging cases of duplicate EPIC numbers allotted to voters in West Bengal, the state did not see a single appeal being filed with the concerned DM/DEO or the state CEO.Explaining the reason behind the duplication , EC said that since the allotment of EPIC series in the year 2000 to the states/UTs, some electoral registration officers (EROs) did not use the correct series. ""The issue of allotment of duplicate numbers due to incorrect series across states/UTs could not have been detected as the states/UTs were independently managing the electoral roll databases,"" it clarified.","Election Commission responds to concerns raised by some political parties.

NEW DELHI: Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday slammed Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin over his recent remark urging couples to have more children immediately to secure greater representation of the state in Parliament amid concerns over the upcoming delimitation exercise.Puri dismissed the idea that states with higher birth rates would automatically benefit from the process, asserting that India's governance system was mature and democratic.""It doesn't work like that; those states who produce more kids will benefit more during delimitation. We are not only the world's largest democracy but also the world's most mature governance system,"" Puri said while interacting with women journalists on the eve of International Women’s Day , according to the news agency ANI.His remarks come in response to Stalin’s remark on Monday, where he urged Tamil Nadu’s residents to reconsider family planning norms, citing concerns that the proposed delimitation exercise could reduce the state’s political representation.Speaking at a wedding ceremony, Stalin said, ""Before, we used to say don't give birth to a child immediately, no need to rush. But now, it is not necessary, we shouldn't say that also… because it is being said that the number of MPs would be decided based on population. The situation created is more population, more MPs. But we have achieved success by focusing on family planning. Now I won't say don't rush to give birth to a child; give birth to a child immediately.""Stalin’s comments were based on the growing political debate over the Centre’s plans for delimitation, a constitutional process that redraws parliamentary and assembly constituencies to reflect population changes.The exercise, governed by Articles 82 and 170 of the Indian Constitution , is intended to ensure fair representation, but Stalin and other southern leaders argue it could disproportionately favour states with higher population growth, reducing seats for states like Tamil Nadu, which have successfully controlled their population through family planning policies.He has also written to several chief ministers and former chief ministers, warning that delimitation could “diminish the influence of states like Tamil Nadu, which have successfully controlled their population, in shaping the nation's future.”In his letter, Stalin called the Centre’s plan “a blatant assault on federalism” and accused it of punishing well-governed states. He also criticised the Union government for failing to provide clarity on the methodology behind the proposed changes, questioning whether the calculation of seats would truly be fair. ""When the very foundation of our democracy is at stake, can we accept such vague assurances? When our states' future hangs in the balance, do we not deserve transparent dialogue?"" he asked.The delimitation exercise, originally anticipated after the 2031 Census, could now take place earlier due to delays in the 2021 Census.If implemented as per the next Census data, southern states fear they will lose parliamentary seats, while states with higher birth rates could gain more representation in the Lok Sabha .Stalin has proposed a Joint Action Committee with representatives from affected states to develop a collective strategy and ensure that delimitation does not penalise states that have successfully implemented population control .","Hardeep Singh Puri slams Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin over his recent remark urging couples to have more children immediately.

NEW DELHI: Now station directors will control the sale of tickets as per station capacity and available trains, a high-level meeting chaired by railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw decided on Friday. Besides this, there will be permanent waiting areas outside 60 busy stations and wider foot-over bridges, moves that will help in better crowd management .Station directors, who are the overall in-charge of their stations, will be financially empowered to take on-the-spot decisions to improve facilities.The decisions come barely weeks after a stampede at the New Delhi station claimed 18 lives. Though a probe into the incident is underway, one of the probable reasons was the sale of a high number of tickets from its counters.In an official statement, the railway ministry said the high-level committee held detailed deliberations on crowd control at stations, particularly at 60 locations where footfall is exceptionally high during certain festive periods. It added that permanent outside waiting areas will be created at these stations which “periodically face heavy crowd”. Pilot projects have been started at New Delhi, Anand Vihar, Varanasi, Ayodhya and Patna stations.“With this arrangement in place, sudden crowding will be contained within the waiting area. Passengers will be allowed to go to platforms only when trains arrive there. This will decongest stations,” a ministry spokesperson said.As per the decisions, there will be complete access control at these 60 stations. While passengers with confirmed tickets will be given direct access to platforms, those without a ticket or with a waiting list ticket will have to be in the waiting area. All unauthorised entry points will also be sealed.Another major decision was to construct wider foot-over bridges (FOB). Two new designs — for 12-metre-wide (40 feet) and six-metre-wide (20 feet) standard FOBs — have been developed. These wide bridges with ramps were effective in crowd management during the Maha Kumbh.Moreover, war rooms will be developed at large stations, and officers of all departments will work in the room if there is a surge in people at the stations. The ministry has also decided to use communication equipment such as walkie-talkies, announcement systems, and calling systems at stations that face crowding. “A newly designed ID card for staffers and service persons, a new uniform that will make staffers easily identifiable in a crisis situation, and appointment of a senior officer as station director at major stations were the other measures that would be implemented,” the ministry said.","Station directors will be financially empowered to take on-the-spot decisions to improve facilities. The decisions come barely weeks after a stampede at the New Delhi station claimed 18 lives.

In the annals of political faux pas, Mitt Romney’s infamous ‘47%’ comment or Hillary Clinton branding Trump supporters as ‘deplorables’ stand out as classic cases of plain speaking gone horribly wrong—instances where opponents easily cast them as out-of-touch elitists. But perhaps no self-goal in Indian politics has been as monumental as Mani Shankar Aiyar ’s 2014 ‘chaiwala’ jibe at then-Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi. Modi may well have ascended to the Prime Ministership without that gaffe, but Aiyar ’s ill-timed comment ensured that the crumbling edifice of UPA-2 was buried six feet under. Narendra Modi, who had always sought to play on the theme of the entitled versus the commoner, lapped up the ‘chaiwala’ moniker like a fish to water.If that was not enough, Aiyar repeated history just a few years later, once again helping PM Modi secure his home turf. In 2017, as the BJP grappled with anti-incumbency, the Patel agitation, and Dalit uprisings in Gujarat, Aiyar’s ‘neech aadmi’ remark gifted Modi the perfect opportunity to reframe the election as a question of Gujarati(pride). The result? A last-minute consolidation of core voters, allowing the BJP to scrape through in a tough contest. A red-faced Congress suspended Aiyar, but the damage was already done.While that may have been the formal break between Aiyar and the Congress, the former Union minister has continued to embarrass the party. The latest episode? A backhanded compliment to Rajiv Gandhi, where Aiyar, in his characteristic bluntness, detailed how the former Prime Minister had flunked at Cambridge and later at Imperial College, London. It provided fresh ammunition to the BJP, all too keen to puncture the image of the technocratic PM, who has been widely hailed for bringing the first wave of the IT revolution to the country.Furious Congress leaders wasted no time in denouncing Aiyar—Maharashtra’s Nana Patole labelled him “mentally unstable,” Harish Khare called him “frustrated,” and former Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot dismissed him as(crazy).Whether Aiyar is crazy or simply unfiltered remains up for debate. What is clear, however, is his unwavering desire for validation from the Gandhis. Despite the controversy, he expressed hope that Rahul Gandhi would take notice of him. Ironically, it was Rahul himself who, during an AICC session in 2014, praised Aiyar’s role in solidifying the Panchayati Raj system. In 2004, Rahul had apparently told Aiyar's wife that he would always listen to the ex-bureaucrat because his father trusted Mani. Yet, Aiyar himself admits that in all these years, he has had only one meaningful conversation with Rahul and just two with Priyanka. He claims he has long been ready to mentor Rahul, but that the Congress leader seems averse to taking his advice, likely due to his age. He even goes on to say that Rahul Gandhi probably despises him, even though Aiyar maintains that his relationship with the Gandhis remains intact!Aiyar’s connection with the Gandhis, however, is indisputable. He was one of Rajiv Gandhi’s closest aides, serving as his joint secretary, and has extensively chronicled his legacy. Even last year, he published a book arguing that Rajiv Gandhi remains one of India’s most misunderstood Prime Ministers. Aiyar’s loyalty to Rajiv appears unquestionable, making it unlikely that he intended to damage his legacy. Instead, his real problem is that he is a relic of a bygone political era—one in which intellectual acerbity was tolerated, if not encouraged.In today’s-obsessed generation with decreasing attention spans, where media organisations are fishing for viral outrage, Aiyar's verbose, long-winded explanations of his ideals leave too many loose ends. Even though thehas shifted with the BJP being in power for over a decade, Aiyar has held onto his pacifist ideals and commitment to secularism. Thus, the man who embarked on aduring the Ayodhya movement and accused then-PM Narasimha Rao of parroting the BJP's line on Hinduism faced brutal public pushback when he said Modi must be removed to improve Indo-Pak relations. Similarly, his attempt to explain the reason behind theattack also led to controversy. Perhaps a simple condemnation without qualifiers would have been easier, but then, it wouldn’t have been Mani Aiyar.In today’s world, political correctness reigns supreme. Aiyar’s brand of public discourse—witty yet sharp, opinionated yet unfiltered—has long since expired. His comments, mocking Hansraj College with his elitepedigree, his dyed-in-the-wool liberal stance regarding what he believed were ‘alleged’ Chinese incursions, his opposition to nuclear weapons, and his resistance to liberalisation, are now seen as political liabilities rather than intellectual contributions.Even as sports minister, he went against the tide, opposing India’s hosting of the Commonwealth Games, describing them as a colossal waste of money.It is a testament to his political gumption that he managed to win three elections from Mayiladuthurai (1991, 1999, and 2004). It is no mean feat for a person born in Lahore, schooled at Doon and Welham’s, later attending St. Stephen’s and Cambridge, to also find acceptance with the electorate despite his anglicised persona. In 2010, he made it to the Rajya Sabha, but his relationship with the Congress leadership gradually soured, leaving him out in the cold.In another political system—perhaps in the US—Aiyar, a self-proclaimed 'secular fundamentalist,' might have found space as India’s equivalent of Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a left-liberal figure leading an ideological movement. But in India, where political pragmatism trumps ideological rigidity, he stuck out like a sore thumb. A more strategic Congress leadership could have harnessed Aiyar’s intellect and commitment to rural empowerment to craft an alternative policy vision, challenging the ruling government’s policies. As an IFS officer, he served in Pakistan and was the first consul general of India in Karachi. His insights could have been leveraged to shape opposition's foreign policy towards India's neighbourhood. Instead, he has been relegated to a running meme—a political grenade who periodically explodes, causing maximum collateral damage to his own party.In many ways, his trajectory mirrors that of Sam Pitroda , another Congress veteran known for his verbal misadventures. But unlike Pitroda, who still enjoys official roles in the Congress, Aiyar remains an outsider, waiting for his next moment of unfiltered candour.Perhaps the world is simply not ready for another Mani Shankar Aiyar. Or perhaps, just maybe, Aiyar has outlived his political relevance—a man out of sync with his time, clinging to an era that no longer exists. In some ways, the Congress, despite all its grandstanding about being a melting pot of ideas, failed to accommodate Aiyar. Another man who does not shy away from speaking his own mind—a diplomat-turned-politician who runs his own successful campaign—Shashi Tharoor, may end up sharing Aiyar’s fate if he does not play by the rules.","Mani Shankar Aiyar’s 2014 ‘chaiwala’ jibe at then-Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi helped the BJP secure his home turf.

Equipping the fleet of T-72 Tanks with 1,000 HP engines will enhance the battlefield mobility and offensive capability of the Army,” he added.Along with a fleet of 2,400 T-72 tanks, the Army has so far inducted 1,300 T-90S `Bhishma’ tanks of the 1,657 being produced by the Heavy Vehicles Factory under licence from Russia.The Army force is now also inducting 118 indigenous Arjun Mark-1A tanks , with 14 major and 57 minor “upgrades” to enhance firepower, mobility, endurance and protection, ordered for Rs 7,523 crore in Sept 2021. These 118 `improved’ tanks will add to the first 124 Arjun tanks inducted well over a decade ago.Then, there are the 354 indigenous light tanks for high-altitude warfare to be inducted under Project Zorawar for around Rs 17,500 crore. The need for such tanks, each weighing less than 25 tonnes with a high power-to-weight ratio as well as superior firepower and protection, has been driven home by the continuing almost four-year-long military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh.","India inked a $248 million contract with Russia’s state-owned Rosoboronexport (RoE) for procurement of 1,000 HP (horsepower) engines for its fleet of T-72 Tanks.

: New Delhi is close to having Tahawwur Rana , a former Pakistani Army doctor and 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attack accused, brought to justice after US Supreme Court Associate Justice Elena Kagan rejected his emergency application on Thursday to stay his extradition to India .Rana's attorneys immediately bumped up the application to Chief Justice John Roberts, likely the last court of appeal, with little possibility of reprieve after President Trump personally assured his extradition during Prime Minister Modi 's visit to Washington DC last month and the State Department signed off on handing him over to Indian authorities.On Thursday, Rana played the religion and health card, citing possible religious persecution and torture in India on account of his Muslim faith, besides serious medical condition, to forestall the extradition, which he argued through attorneys would be a ""de facto death sentence.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin is on a warpath with the BJP-led NDA government. The two major issues at the center of the now almost everyday war of words are delimitation and the Hindi ""imposition"" row concerning the National Education Policy (NEP).On Friday, Stalin wrote to his counterparts of seven states, including Bengal's Mamata Banerjee, Punjab's Bhagwant Mann, and also BJP-ruled Odisha's Mohan Chandra Majhi to fight the delimitation exercise. Stalin also wrote to the chief of political parties if these states proposing the inaugural joint action committee meeting in Chennai on March 22, urging the leaders to join forces to chart a ""collective course forward.""Stalin has claimed that the representation of the South in the Lok Sabha would be reduced due to delimitation exercise.Despite Amit Shah's assurance that the southern states will not lose a single Lok Sabha seat, the chief ministers of two Congress-ruled states — Karnataka's Siddaramaiah and Telangana's Revanth Reddy — have united with Stalin to attack the BJP-led Centre on delimitation.At a recent all-party meeting, Stalin also secured the support of the main opposition AIADMK, Congress, and Left parties, as well as actor-politician Vijay's TVK and Kamal Haasan's Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM). The meeting was boycotted by the BJP, Tamil nationalist Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK), and former union minister GK Vasan's Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar).During the meeting, Stalin also asserted that the 1971 population data should be the basis for delimitation of Lok Sabha seats for 30 years from 2026, and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make an assurance in Parliament.In what maybe seen as a win for Stalin, BJP’s ally, PMK, also voiced concerns on Thursday that Tamil Nadu's representation in Parliament could decline due to delimitation.With assembly elections due next year, Stalin has intensified his attacks on the NDA government on another front with three-language policy . The Tamil Nadu government has strongly opposed implementing the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020, raising concerns over the ""three-language formula"" and alleging that the Centre is attempting to ""impose"" Hindi.However, while Congress leaders in the South have supported Stalin's stance, the party's central leadership has so far maintained a neutral stance on the issue.With Bihar assembly elections just months away, followed by Uttar Pradesh, Congress seems to have adopted a carefully balanced approach. This is likely because Congress still holds influence in the South. Among the three Congress-ruled states, two — Telangana and Karnataka — are in the South. The party's 99-seat Lok Sabha win was largely powered by southern states, where it won a total of 42 seats:To keep the party's stance in balance, Manickam Tagore, Congress MP from Tamil Nadu’s Virudhunagar and party whip in Lok Sabha, recently stated: ""Our party respects all languages, and we are against all kinds of language imposition. Hindi can be learned by choice but not by imposition.""Other key INDIA bloc allies, including Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Jammu and Kashmir's National Conference leader Omar Abdullah, have remained silent on both issues.On NEP, all state governments except Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and West Bengal have adopted and implemented the policy. However, Bengal CM and INDIA bloc ally Mamata Banerjee has also refrained from making any public statements in support of Stalin.Instead, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief has shifted focus and is now trying to corner the NDA government and the Election Commission, alleging voter list manipulation.The Parliament session after Lok Sabha elections saw the INDIA bloc divided with their individual agendas (Congress on the Adani issue, Samajwadi Party on Sambhal violence) as they tried to corner the NDA government. With TMC already announcing that it will raise the issue of voter ID number duplication during the upcoming session starting from March 10, it will be interesting to see if the INDIA bloc finds a common ground to carry out coordinated attack this time.","Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin is on a warpath with the BJP-led NDA government.

Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?

Imagine this: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump , two of the most larger-than-life figures on the global stage, teaming up not to broker a trade deal or solve world peace, but to help Indian wrestlers smash their way into the WWE. Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena ’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin , opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and More Think about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","Narendra Modi and Donald Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena ’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years.

NFL Rumors: Tom Brady's New York Giants are said to be making progress in acquiring Aaron Rodgers at quarterback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-rumors-tom-bradys-new-york-giants-are-said-to-be-making-progress-in-acquiring-aaron-rodgers-at-quarterback/articleshow/118788915.cms,"Image via YouTube

Aaron Rodgers is closed to joining the Raiders

With NFL free agency looming, the New York Giants are said to be making progress in acquiring a top addition at quarterback. After their decision to move on from Daniel Jones last year, the team is looking for a consistent leader at quarterback for next season.Current news indicates Aaron Rodgers is deep in talks with the Giants, setting up a possibility of a monumental realignment in the quarterback depth chart across the league. In the event a trade occurs, it might do great things for the Giants' future while impacting the competitiveness within the NFC as well.NorthJersey.com's Art Stapleton recently reported on The Pat McAfee Show that talks between Aaron Rodgers and the New York Giants have reached a serious level. Stapleton explained that people close to the situation wouldn't be surprised if Rodgers officially signs with the team before the new league year opens.With word of a potential move building, the rumored move is making waves throughout the league, as Rodgers' arrival in New York would have a dramatic impact on the Giants' quarterback situation and overall roster plan going into the 2025 season.“From my understanding right now… they are pretty significantly down a road where they are negotiating to the point where, if Rodgers ends up a Giant before the start of the league year, it would not be a shock to people in this area and at the Meadowlands,” Stapleton reported.The Giants may consider a potential move for quarterback Ryan Rams, who is considered a valuable leader and playmaker despite being past his peak performance years. This move could address their quarterback questions.Rodgers' impressive performance in the previous season, including a passer rating of 90.5, 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions, despite his age, demonstrates his potential to significantly impact games.“My understanding is, yes, they have talked about what it would take to get Aaron [to the Giants],” Stapleton added, noting that “from a football fit, this is something that they’re seriously considering.” Aaron Rodgers has multiple suitors, including the Las Vegas Raiders and Tennessee Titans, who may see him as a veteran bridge quarterback while developing younger talent.Also Read: “Her wit is second to none”: Jimmy Johnson shares heartfelt message for Erin Andrews after announcing his retirement from Fox NFL Sunday For the New York Giants, signing Rodgers could be a strategic move, providing stability and leadership as they potentially target a long-term quarterback in the 2026 NFL Draft. His experience could elevate the team’s performance and mentor younger players, making him a valuable short-term addition. Additionally, Rodgers' presence could attract other key free agents, strengthening the Giants' roster. If the deal goes through, it would mark one of the biggest moves of the offseason.","The New York Giants are said to be making progress in acquiring a top addition at quarterback.
