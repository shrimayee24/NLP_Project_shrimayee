"Vande Bharats to run on bullet train corridor, till Japanese Shinkansens arrive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-bharats-to-run-on-bullet-train-corridor-till-japanese-shinkansens-arrive/articleshow/117441558.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid inordinate delay in finalising the deal for procurement of Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains for India’s first high-speed Mumbai-Ahmedabad corridor , the railway ministry has invited bids for a signalling system that will allow Vande Bharat trains , with a maximum design speed of 280 kpmh, to run on this section.Though the ministry had earlier claimed that Shinkansen trains would make their debut on the Surat-Bilimora section by Aug 2026, now it is clear that these high-speed specialised trains may not be a reality before 2030. The operation of Shinkansen trains on the entire corridor — the foundation stone for which was laid in Sept 2017 — would be possible only by 2033, sources said.This became evident after the National High Speed Rail Corporation (NHRSCL) last week published the tender for the signalling system for running Vande Bharat trains, which are being developed as India’s indigenous bullet trains. As per the tender document, the successful bidder will have to design, manufacture, supply, install and maintain the signalling and train control system. This will be the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level-2, different from the Japanese DS-ATC signalling for Shinkansen trains.The contract period for ETCS-2 is seven years from the date of award of work. Sources said the deployment of ETCS-2 on the corridor will ensure utilisation of the infrastructure. The plan is to start commercial operations of Vande Bharat trains on this track in 2027.“There is no point in keeping this high capital-intensive project unutilised for want of Japanese trains. Even when the Vande Bharat trains are operational, the installation of the Japanese signalling system for Shinkansen trains can be carried out. The timeline for introduction of the E-10 series trains (an advanced version of bullet trains) in 2030 or later can be finalised once the trains meeting Indian conditions are made available,” a source said.As per the plan, once the Shinkansen trains are fully operational, the advanced versions of Vande Bharat trains and the ETCS would be shifted to other projects.Neither the railway ministry nor the NHSRCL respond to queries about the signalling tender and the timeline of Shinkansen train operation on this corridor. However, officials said they are confident of getting the best Japanese bullet trains for the project by 2030, and that the Vande Bharat trains, to be introduced as a stopgap arrangement, and would meet the expectation of passengers.","The railway ministry has invited bids for a signalling system that will allow Vande Bharat trains to run on this section.

"Centre targets high procurement of pulses through PSS, PSF schemes to reassure farmers, boost output",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-targets-high-procurement-of-pulses-through-pss-psf-schemes-to-reassure-farmers-boost-output/articleshow/117440906.cms,"File photo

Govt extends free import of tur till March 2026

NEW DELHI: The Centre is aiming to aggressively procure tur, urad and lentil from farmers through price support scheme (PSS) and price stabilisation fund (PSF) to give an assurance to the growers that their produce will be bought by govt. Two govt cooperatives — Nafed and NCCF — have been directed to start purchase of pulses aggressively to encourage farmers to boost output.Sources said the directions were issued to the two cooperatives at a high level inter-ministerial meeting attended by officials from agriculture and consumer affairs departments and other stakeholders. Both the agencies have pre-registered around 21 lakh farmers for procuring their produce in key pulses producing states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh prior to sowing season.While the fund allocated under PSS is meant for use to support farmers when market prices crash below the MSP, the PSF is used for stabilising the prices of agricultural commodities and protecting consumers.The direction comes amid the govt’s commitment to buy 100% of urad, arhar and masur (lentil) varieties of pulses, which the country imports in substantial quantities, and prevent distress sale by farmers. “Now we are buying pulses not just at MSP but also at a price close to the rates at mandis. Unless we assure farmers that they will get remunerative price, they won’t grow pulses. This move will boost the country's pulses production to become self-sufficient,” said a source.Under the dynamic minimum assured procurement price (MAPP), the agriculture ministry has approved that agencies can buy tur and urad based on last three day average mandi prices .In the last two years the govt agencies could not purchase these three varieties of pulses as mandis prices were ruling above the MSP because of decline in production and rise in demand. The arrival of tur at mandis is likely to increase by this month end. The govt will have to purchase pulses at MSP using the PSS since the prospects of robust crop has started impacting the mandi prices of tur below MSP of Rs 7,550 per quintal.The govt on Monday extended the free import for tur dal till March 31 next year to keep prices under check. The Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) issued the notification. The govt had allowed the import of tur under the “free category' from May 15, 2021. Subsequently, the free regime has been extended from time to time. The existing free import policy was first introduced in May 2021 and has been extended several times amid faltering domestic production.",Two govt cooperatives — Nafed and NCCF — have been directed to start purchase of pulses aggressively. The directions were issued to the two cooperatives at a high level inter-ministerial meeting attended by officials from agriculture and consumer affairs departments and other stakeholders.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117440903,imgsize-19868,width-400,resizemode-4/117440903.jpg"
DRDO tests key tech for next-gen hypersonic missiles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/drdo-tests-key-tech-for-next-gen-hypersonic-missiles/articleshow/117439896.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a step towards developing next-generation hypersonic missiles , DRDO has conducted the successful test of an active cooled combustor of a scramjet engine on the ground for 120 seconds for the first time in the country.Hypersonic missiles, which fly at speeds greater than Mach 5 or five times the speed of sound, have become a major focus area for major military powers , given their capability to defeat existing missile and air defence systems due to super-fast speeds, high-manoeuvrability and low altitudes of flight.DRDO lab Defence Research & Development Laboratory (DRDL) recently demonstrated the active cooled scramjet combustor on the ground for 120 seconds. “The achievement marks a crucial milestone in the development of next-generation hypersonic missiles,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said.A DRDO official said, “Several nations including the US, Russia, China and India are actively pursuing hypersonic technology . The key is scramjets, which are air-breathing engines capable of sustaining combustion at supersonic speeds without using any moving parts.” “The ground test showcased several notable achievements, demonstrating its potential for operational use in hypersonic vehicles, like successful ignition and stable combustion. Ignition in a scramjet engine is like ‘keeping a candle lit in a hurricane’,” he added.The indigenous development of endothermic scramjet fuel , jointly by DRDL and the industry, is central to this breakthrough. The fuel offers dual benefits of significant cooling improvement and ease of ignition.","DRDO has conducted the successful test of an active cooled combustor of a scramjet engine on the ground for 120 seconds for the first time in the country. “The achievement marks a crucial milestone in the development of next-generation hypersonic missiles,” defence minister Rajnath Singh said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117439886,imgsize-763103,width-400,resizemode-4/117439886.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday welcomed the ruling by the World Bank-appointed neutral expert that said differences between India and Pakistan over the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric power projects in J&K fall within his competence under the Indus Waters Treaty.Govt sees this as a vindication of its stand and interpretation of the treaty as it does not recognise or participate in the parallel and “illegally constituted” court of arbitration proceedings being carried out at Pakistan’s request.In an official statement on the neutral expert’s decision, govt also said it remains in touch with Pakistan for the modification and review of the IWT. India had last year cited cross-border terrorism as one of the reasons for seeking a review of the treaty.“India welcomes the decision given by the neutral expert under Paragraph 7 of Annexure F to the Indus Waters Treaty, 1960. The decision upholds and vindicates India’s stand that all seven questions that were referred to the neutral expert, in relation to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects, are differences falling within his competence under the treaty,” govt said.India was upset that despite the World Bank asking both countries to find a mutually agreeable way to look into Pakistan’s objections to the projects, Islamabad had unilaterally sought a parallel process to address the issue. Govt said it has been India’s “consistent and principled” position that the neutral expert alone has the competence under the treaty to decide these differences.“Having upheld his own competence, which comports with India’s view, the neutral expert will now proceed to the next (merits) phase of his proceeding. This phase will culminate in a final decision on the merits of each of the seven differences,” it said.“Being committed to preserving the sanctity and integrity of the treaty, India will continue to participate in the neutral expert process so that the differences are resolved in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Treaty, which does not provide for parallel proceedings on the same set of issues. For this reason, India does not recognize or participate in the illegally constituted Court of Arbitration proceeding.”",World Bank-appointed neutral expert said differences between India and Pakistan over the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric power projects in J&K fall within his competence under the Indus Waters Treaty.

"Ailing mom & poverty led Saif Ali Khan's attacker to India, crime: Cops",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ailing-mom-poverty-led-saif-ali-khans-attacker-to-india-crime-cops/articleshow/117437980.cms,"Attacker after arrest (left) and Saif Ali Khan

MUMBAI: Bangladeshi national Shariful Fakir, arrested for breaking into actor Saif Ali Khan’s home and stabbing him last Thursday, was driven to crime because of extreme poverty, police said. “He chose Saif’s residence randomly. All he wanted was to steal from someone rich and escape to Bangladesh with the loot to help his ailing mother,” said an officer. “The immediate provocation for the crime was that Shariful lost a housekeeping job at a Thane restaurant on Dec 15 when its contract with the manpower agency owned by Jitendra Pandey ended. He found himself nearly penniless. He said as much.”Before joining the Thane restaurant in Sept last year, Shariful worked at a Worli restaurant, earning Rs 13,000 a month. He told police during interrogation that from this sum, he would send Rs 12,000 to Bangladesh for his mother’s medical treatment, keeping only Rs 1,000 for himself. One day in Aug, the restaurant management caught him stealing and terminated his employment. Having studied only till Class 2, he found another menial job at the Thane restaurant.Shariful entered India by crossing Dawki river on India-Bangladesh border at Meghalaya, paying Rs 10,000 to an agent to have him taken to Assam. “The agent helped him board a bus to Kolkata, where he stayed for three days before taking a train to Mumbai in May. The agent also helped him get a SIM card. Once in Mumbai, he wandered aimlessly for three days, living on the roadside. He got in touch with Pandey through another person and got the Worli restaurant job in June,” police said. They are on the trail of the agent.After losing his second job in the city, Shariful decided on committing a burglary, and surveyed locations across the ritzy parts of Bandra and Khar on Dec 31 and Jan 1. Police said before attack on Saif, Shariful walked 90mins to Bandra in the intervening night of Jan 15-16. “He carried housebreaking tools like a screwdriver, hammer, and hacksaw blade, which he had bought a few days prior. The knife he later used to attack the actor, he had stolen from the Thane restaurant where he used to work,” said an officer.“After the crime, he was in Bandra-Khar for hours before taking a train to Dadar. He was unaware till then that he had stabbed a famous actor. He told us during questioning that his attack on Saif was unplanned.”Police tracked Shariful after Pandey provided his Worli location and phone number. “We found that he used an e-wallet to pay Rs 6 for a cup of tea in Worli. His last location was traced to a labour camp in Thane. We found he had also paid Rs 60 for a plate of bhurji pav on Jan 18,” said an officer.Police learnt during Shariful’s questioning that he was a fan of Shah Rukh Khan and had tried to scale the walls of the actor’s Bandra bungalow Mannat “to get a dekko at the superstar” before the Saif incident. “He said his friends and family often told him that he looked like Shah Rukh Khan. That would puff him up,” the officer said.Police have seized Shariful’s mobile phone, cap, scarf and the shirt he changed after the crime. The items have been sent to forensics lab. But police are yet to recover the missing portion of the knife used to attack Saif.","Bangladeshi national Shariful Fakir, arrested for breaking into actor Saif Ali Khan's home and stabbing him last Thursday, was driven to crime because of extreme poverty, police said. “He chose Saif’s residence randomly.

Supreme Court explores ad hoc judges for criminal appeal backlog,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-explores-ad-hoc-judges-for-criminal-appeal-backlog/articleshow/117438800.cms,"Supreme Court

SC says 2021 ad hoc judges order needs tweaking, seeks AG's view

NEW DELHI: As pending cases continue to mount in high courts because of multiple reasons, including judge vacancies not being filled, Supreme Court Tuesday said it was time to appoint ad hoc judges in HCs — invoking Article 224A of the Constitution — who would be part of division benches headed by a permanent judge of the HC and would adjudicate criminal appeals.A bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant said the number of criminal appeals pending in HCs was substantial and per-judge pendency of cases too was acute, and that the apex court’s 2021 verdict needed to be modified to pave the way for appointment of ad hoc judges in HCs.As many convicts in criminal cases languish in jails waiting for their appeals to be heard, SC had earlier expressed concern over pendency of such cases.While examining the rate of disposal compared to filing of fresh criminal appeals in the Allahabad high court between 2000 and 2021, it came to light that a fresh appeal would take on average 35 years to be decided, as during the 21-year period, 1.7 lakh appeals were filed against disposal of only 31,000 cases.Pointing to pendency of criminal appeal cases, the bench said that around 63,000 cases were pending in Allahabad high court, 20,000 in Patna HC, 20,000 in Karnataka HC and 21,000 in Punjab and Haryana HC. The court said ad hoc judges could be appointed to deal with this problem but clarified that it would be allowed only to adjudicate cases of criminal appeals and no other case.“Per-judge pendency is also very high in some high courts. We have a feeling that criminal appeals before the division bench can be taken up by one sitting judge as the senior judge, and one ad hoc judge,” the bench said.The bench said the Supreme Court’s 2021 judgment, by which guidelines were framed for appointment of ad hoc judges, needed to be modified, and sought the opinion of attorney general R Venkataramani.The court had mentioned various trigger points for appointment of ad hoc judges in HCs, including if vacancies were more than 20% of the sanctioned strength.It had also clarified that the recourse to Article 224A was not an alternative to regular appointments.“We have given deep thought to the slightly different perspectives placed before us by way of affidavits by the different high courts and the Union of India. While emphasising that recourse to Article 224A is the necessity of the day, and without inhibiting the expanse of the powers conferred on the chief justice of the high court as per the Constitution, it would be in the fitness of things to lay down some guidelines for assistance of chief justices of high courts and to make the provision a ‘live letter’,” the court had said.","SC says 2021 ad hoc judges order needs tweaking, seeks AG's view.

Wealth extraction from India



Impact on India's economy and society



Multinational and colonial exploitation



Continuing Inequities



Colonialism's lasting impact



Global South struggles



A new report by Oxfam International , titled 'Takers, Not Makers,' reveals staggering figures on wealth extracted from India by Britain during the colonial era, claiming that $64.82 trillion was taken between 1765 and 1900. Of this, $33.8 trillion, which is more than half of the total wealth, adjusted for today’s value, is said to have enriched the UK’s richest 10%.Released at the World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting in Davos, the report pointed out colonialism’s lasting impact on inequality and economic systems. ""Legacies of inequality and pathologies of plunder, pioneered during the time of historical colonialism , continue to shape modern lives,"" Oxfam said.The report also specified that colonial practices perpetuated systemic wealth extraction from the Global South to the Global North, benefiting a select elite. “This has created a deeply unequal world, a world torn apart by division based on racism, a world that continues to systematically extract wealth from the Global South to primarily benefit the richest people in the Global North,” the report said.Oxfam calculated that the wealth extracted from India alone by Britain could carpet London’s surface area in £50 currency notes nearly four times. ""This would be enough to carpet the surface area of London in British pound 50 notes almost four times over,"" the report mentioned.The wealth extraction, Oxfam claimed, not only enriched the wealthiest 10% but also majorly benefited Britain’s emerging middle class, which received 32% of this income.The report details how India’s share of global industrial output dropped precipitously from 25% in 1750 to just 2% by 1900, primarily due to Britain’s protectionist policies targeting Asian textiles. ""This dramatic reduction can be attributed to Britain's implementation of stringent protectionist policies against Asian textiles, which systematically undermined India's industrial growth potential,"" the report added.During World War I , disruptions in colonial trade patterns inadvertently stimulated industrial growth in colonies, disclosing how external shocks temporarily alleviated colonial suppression.Oxfam also linked modern multinational corporations to colonial practices, tracing their origins to entities like the British East India Company . ""The concept of private multinational corporations, bankrolled by rich shareholders, was a product of the colonial era,” Oxfam stated, adding that these corporations employed private armies to suppress resistance.The East India Company alone had an army of 260,000 soldiers, double the size of Britain’s peacetime army, who engaged in land dispossession and violent repression.The report highlighted modern parallels, stating that wages in the Global South are 87–95% lower than for equivalent work in the Global North. It also mentioned the exploitation of natural resources and poor working conditions in supply chains dominated by multinational corporations.Oxfam also targeted global institutions like the WTO and World Bank for perpetuating inequities. “The inequality that these countries experience today is significantly of colonial making,” the report said.Oxfam also addressed the societal divisions entrenched during colonial rule, such as caste, religion, and language. For instance, it pointed out that only 0.14% of India’s mother tongues are used as mediums of instruction.The report further pointed out the devastating Bengal famine of 1943, which resulted in an estimated three million deaths. “Grain import restrictions during World War Two, underpinned by racist thinking, appear to have significantly contributed to or caused the Bengal famine,” Oxfam stated.Oxfam detailed how colonialism’s legacy continues to affect public services, education, and health in the Global South. It cited biopiracy, as seen in the case of neem, and the systemic exploitation of resources.Calling colonialism’s impact a “fruit from the poisoned tree,” Oxfam summed up its report stating that global inequality remains deeply rooted in the historical practices of extraction and exploitation.","Oxfam says $64.82 trillion was taken from India by Britain between 1765 and 1900.

'No room for manipulation': What EC said on claims of voter list meddling



'Foolproof': What EC said on EVM tampering allegations



'Why does he want it?' EC over blocking public access of CCTV footage of poll booths



NEW DELHI: Election Commission of India on Tuesday addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll and said that the allegations regarding the rigging Electronic Voting Machines were ""baseless.""Setting a poetic tone, the chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar began with a shayari: ""All questions hold importance; answers must follow; out of habit, we kept giving written replies, but today, face-to-face feels necessary; who knows if tomorrow will come or not, today, an answer is due).""The CEC, before announcing the dates of Delhi assembly elections, took the opportunity to offer clarifications on allegations, including EVM tampering , erratic changes in voter list and recent changes in rules by the poll body to prevent public inspection of certain electronic documents.Kumar refuted claims of manipulation in the electoral roll, categorically mentioning that no deletion is made without proper documentation, field verification, and providing the individual an opportunity to be heard.On addition of names to the electoral roll, Kumar said, ""Regular meetings are held with the representatives of political parties, who have the right to appoint booth-level agents (BLAs). Weekly lists of claims and objections are shared, and both draft and final rolls are published on the Election Commission's website. Polling station rationalisation is also carried out with the consultation of all the stakeholders.""Regarding deletion of names from the list, he said, ""Mandatory field verification is conducted by the BLOs, and in cases where deletions exceed 2 per cent of a polling station's voter list, cross-verification is done. Deletions due to death require a certified death certificate, and a seven-day window is provided for objections after notices are published online. Also, the affected voters are given the opportunity for a personal hearing before their names are removed.""""Where every vote matters, raising doubts about deletion of thousands of names without evidence is misleading. The processes we follow leave no room for manipulation,"" he said.He added that political parties were involved at each and every stage of voter list preparation with full disclosure and opportunity to object.CEC said that it was not possible to change the voter turnout and said that it was ""misleading to compare final VTR with 5pm data.""""...It is impossible to change voter turnout...Some polling parties report at midnight or the next day. Form 17C is matched before counting. There is nothing which VTR does not explain. It explains fully,"" he said.Addressing the EVM issue, CEC said, ""There is no evidence of unreliability or any drawback in the EVM... There is no question of introducing a virus or bug in the EVM. There is no question of invalid votes in the EVM. No rigging is possible. High courts and the Supreme Court are continuously saying this in different judgments... What else can be said? EVMs are foolproof devices for counting. Allegations of tampering are baseless. We are speaking now because we don't speak when elections are on.""Kumar also cited court rulings at multiple occasions and said that ""courts have ruled on 42 occasions that EVMs are not hackable, allegations of tampering totally baseless.""""This is aimed at derailing the electoral process,"" he added.Further, he said that no discrepancies had been found between votes counted through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) slips,"" he said.""Let me tell the nation today. After the Supreme Court mandated in 2019 that five VVPATs must be counted from each assembly constituency, over 67,000 VVPATs have been checked. ""This translates to more than 4.5 crore (VVPAT) slips being verified. And let me assure you that not even the difference of one vote has been found with the new machines since 2019,"" he added.Kumar defended the recent amendment to election rules restricting public access to CCTV footage from polling booths, citing the need to safeguard voter privacy and prevent misuse of data to create false narratives.""Why does he want it? Let us ask this question from the person who wants it,"" Kumar asked as he addressed the reason why the poll body had decided to block public access to CCTV footages of poll booths.The CEC explained that the poll authority has evidence showing how such data could be exploited for machine learning and AI to craft deceptive narratives. He cautioned that even fact-checkers might struggle to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated videos of polling stations.The government, acting on the Election Commission's recommendation, amended the rules last month to limit public inspection of certain electronic documents, including polling station CCTV footage, to prevent potential abuse.This comes amidst the opposition raising concerns regarding irregularities in electoral processes, with AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal recently accusing BJP of tampering with voters' lists in Delhi. The former CM had alleged that there was an ""unusual increase"" in voter list modifications, including both removals and additions, specifically in New Delhi constituency.Congress had also raised similar concerns during Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, with Mallikarjun Kharge demanding ballot papers instead of EVMs.Assembly elections in Delhi are set to take place in a single phase on February 5. Votes would be counted on February 8.","The Election Commission of India addressed concerns regarding wrongful additions and deletions of voters in the electoral roll.

Birthright Citizenship: Why Indian-American Usha Vance cannot lose her US citizenship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-indian-american-usha-vance-cannot-lose-her-us-citizenship/articleshow/117430904.cms,"Vice President-elect JD Vance's wife, Usha Vance, listens as her husband speaks during a dinner event at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, Saturday, Jan. 18, 2025. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)

“Among the categories of individuals born in the United States and not subject to the jurisdiction thereof, the privilege of United States citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the United States: (1) when that person’s mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth, or (2) when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the United States under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth.”

How new Trump order affects the Indian diaspora

Usha Vance defends husband’s resurfaced ‘childless cat lady’ comment as ‘quip’

On Tuesday, a Twitter handle claimed that JD Vance’s wife Usha Vance would lose her citizenship since her parents weren’t US citizens at the time of her birth. The theory comes after Donald Trump’s recent order in which he would overturn years of jus soli (birthright by soil) citizenship for children born to illegal immigrants or when the person’s mother was “lawful but temporary”.Usha Vance's parents, Krish and Lakshmi Chilukuri, immigrated to the United States from Andhra Pradesh, India, in the 1980s. However, publicly available information does not specify the exact date when they became US citizens. Both have established successful careers in the U.S.; Krish Chilukuri is an aerospace engineer and lecturer at San Diego State University, and Lakshmi Chilukuri is a biologist and provost at the University of California, San Diego.The actual order read:Would this make Usha Vance, the first Indian-American Second Lady’s citizenship void? Well, not quite, since the order is only valid for those born within the US after 30 days from the date of the order. Ergo, there’s no way Usha Vance will lose her citizenship under the current Trump executive order.However, things aren't that rosy for many members of the diaspora.The order, which ends automatic birthright citizenship for children of certain legal non-immigrant visa holders, has left many families shocked. This significant shift in US immigration policy targets children born to individuals on temporary visas, such as H-1B work visas, H-4 dependent visas, or F-1 student visas, if at least one parent is not a green card holder or US citizen.Read: How the new Trump order could affect one million Indians in Green Card Queue? This decision directly impacts over one million Indians awaiting employment-based green cards, many of whom face decades-long backlogs. Previously, these families relied on the assurance that children born in the US would automatically gain citizenship, providing a pathway to later sponsor their parents. With this change, those children must either self-deport upon turning 21 or seek another visa status. Immigration attorneys argue this interpretation contradicts the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to nearly all individuals born on US soil, barring exceptions like children of diplomats.The move has already prompted lawsuits from organisations like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and immigration attorneys, challenging the EO's constitutionality. Legal experts, including Cyrus Mehta and Greg Siskind, predict the case will reach the Supreme Court, where a conservative majority may uphold Trump's interpretation. The EO asserts that the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" excludes individuals born to temporary visa holders, a claim heavily disputed by immigration advocates. They argue this interpretation deviates from established precedents, such as the Supreme Court ruling that granted citizenship to a child born to Chinese immigrants who were not US citizens.The order also underscores potential gender biases, explicitly mentioning ""mother"" and ""father"" roles, which critics view as an outdated perspective. Moreover, the ripple effects are significant: Indian families, already grappling with lengthy green card queues, now face additional uncertainty regarding their children’s futures.The policy shift has fuelled polarising opinions. While some applaud the decision as a step towards stricter immigration control, others criticise it as a punitive measure targeting law-abiding immigrants. Amidst this controversy, the fate of affected families and the legal battle over the EO’s validity hang in the balance, with far-reaching implications for US immigration policy and the interpretation of the 14th Amendment.","Usha Vance's parents, Krish and Lakshmi Chilukuri, immigrated to the United States from Andhra Pradesh, India, in the 1980s.

Trump signs executive order ending birthright citizenship, other immigration actions

President Donald Trump’s executive order (EO) - ‘Protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship ,’ has left the Indian diaspora stunned. Many believed that Trump’s speeches during his campaign trail of ending ‘ citizenship by birth ’ would apply only to children of illegal immigrants. The overarching belief of many Indian families was that documented (legal) immigrants like the H-1B holders, or those on other work visas like the L (intra-company) visa, or even a F (student) visa, would not be impacted. They are in for a rude shock.Over a million Indians who are in a decades-long queue for an employment-linked green card will be impacted going forward, as a child born in a family (thirty days from the date of the EO) where the mother is here lawfully but temporarily (eg: as a visitor or on a non-immigrant visa – be it a dependent visa like H-4 or even a work visa) and the ‘father’ is not a green card holder or US citizen will not get automatic American citizenship.The Times of India, in its edition dated Nov 7, 2024, was one of the few newspapers to correctly predict this plan of action. We had said, that if the EO is signed, it would spell a huge set-back for the Indian diaspora, as at least one parent would be required to be a US citizen or green card holder.According to an analysis of the US Census (2022) done by Pew Research, the US was home to about 4.8 Indian Americans, of whom 34% or 1.6 million were born in the US (and became American citizens by virtue of birth).The proposed plan of action is now a reality. Currently, those children who are not born in the US, and whose families are caught in the decades long green card backlog have to self deport on turning 21 or have to opt for another visa – say an international student visa. Citizenship by birth at least gave Indian couples waiting endless in queue for a green card a breather, If their child was born on American soil.Trump’s executive order points out that the 14th Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the US. It has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the US but not ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’In the context of legal immigrants, it adds: “The privilege of US citizenship does not automatically extend to persons born in the US: When the mother’s presence in the US at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary (such as, but not limited to, visiting the US under the auspices of the Visa Waiver Program or visiting on a student, work, or tourist visa) and the father was not a US citizen or lawful permanent resident (which means a green card holder) at the time of said person’s birth.”According to immigration attorneys ‘citizenship by birth’ is enshrined in the 14th amendment to the US constitution. The first lawsuit challenging this executive order has been filed by immigration right activists such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and others.Cyrus D. Mehta, New York based immigration attorney told TOI: “If both parents are in the US in a non-immigrant status, such as in H-1B and H-4 (dependant visa) status, under Trump’s EO the State Department will not issue a US passport to the child as they are no longer regarded as ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’. This EO will obviously be challenged in court, but I can see the Trump administration taking this all the way to the Supreme Court in the hope that the majority of conservative justices could agree with Trump’s new interpretation of the 14th Amendment.”“If the courts agree with Trump’s interpretation, going forward children of H-1B and H-4 non-immigrants who are born in the US, will not be recognized as US citizens. There is a ripple impact. Many Indians are caught in 100 year employment-linked green card backlogs, and so their only hope was for their child born in the US to sponsor them, when he/she attained 21 years. Now this will not be possible”Also read: Hiring freeze could lead to immigration processing delays, say experts Greg Siskind, co-founder of Siskin Susser, an immigration law firm, said: “The unconstitutionality of this is stunning. The term ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’ was never intended to apply to those targeted by the EO. It was meant to apply to diplomats who are not subject to the jurisdiction of the US. This is going to be litigated and I predict it will be enjoined before it is effective in 30 days. But obviously there's no guarantees here,”Fiona McEntee also pointed out the gender-play here, “And yes, the EO uses the terms father and mother because obviously every child is born into a family with a mother and father!!!!”Ashwin Sharma, immigration attorney told TOI, “The phrase ‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’ has been consistently interpreted to include nearly all individuals born on US soil, irrespective of their parents’ immigration status, other than children of enemy occupiers or diplomats. A landmark Supreme Court case reaffirmed this interpretation, granting citizenship to a child born in the US to Chinese immigrant parents who were not US citizens. This decision established a precedent which leaves little room for reinterpretation.”The fate of children who have non-citizen, non-green card holder parents now vests with the US courts.","Many believed that Trump’s speeches during his campaign trail of ending ‘ citizenship by birth ’ would apply only to children of illegal immigrants.

Barron Trump’s role in the campaign

Barron Trump has turned 'LADIES' MAN'?!

“He knows his generation”

Where does Barron Trump study?

Will Barron live in the White House?

Barron Trump, the president-elect’s only child with his wife Melania, has been acknowledged for having a notable influence on his father during the election campaign. At the inauguration, all eyes were on Barron again who stood out ofr his remarkable height. The youngest child of president-elect Donald Trump is 6 feet 8 inches tall, making him as tall as LeBron James. At just 18 years old, Barron stands approximately 6 feet 8 inches tall. Remarkably, this may make him the tallest child of a US president in history.According to his mother, Melania Trump, Barron, the youngest son of Donald Trump, played a “very vocal” role in the 2024 presidential election campaign. The 18-year-old helped his father connect with younger voters, contributing to his November election victory.“I’m very proud of him for his knowledge, even about politics and giving advice to his father,” Melania said during an appearance on the Fox News show Fox & Friends last month. “He brought in so many young people. He knows his generation because, nowadays, the young generation, they don’t sit in front of the TV anymore. They’re all on tablets, phones, podcasts, and streamers.“He was very vocal, and he gave advice to his father. It was incredible how he contributed to the campaign’s success because he knew exactly who his father needed to connect with.”Born in New York City on 20 March 2006, Barron is Melania’s only son and Donald Trump’s fifth child. In September 2024, he began his first year at the Stern School of Business at New York University.Unlike many students, Barron is not living in the NYU dorms. Instead, he resides at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan.Speaking on Fox & Friends last week, Melania confirmed that Barron will continue living in New York but will have a room at the White House. This arrangement will allow him to visit with friends whenever he wishes.“Yes [he can bring his friends with him], whatever he would like to do,” Melania said. “I feel that we have our children until they’re about 18 or 19 years old. We teach them, guide them, and then give them the wings to fly. I always respect Barron’s ‘yes’ and ‘no’—what he likes to do and where he wants to be.”","Barron Trump, the president-elect’s only child with his wife Melania, has been acknowledged for having a notable influence on his father during the election campaign.

MUMBAI: Among the many Executive Orders (EO) signed by President Trump on Day 1, is one that seeks to promptly remove all aliens (which means foreign nationals) who enter or remain in violation of US Federal Law. In other words, this spells bad news for undocumented immigrants including those from India.This EO together with the Laken Riley Bill, which may soon be passed by the Senate and be enacted, has sparked fears that there would be sweeping visa bans if countries do not cooperate in taking back their citizens who are illegal immigrants in the US.In October last year, the US deported a planeload of illegal immigrants to India – this was achieved with the co-operation of the Indian government. According to Pew Research, there are 7. 25 lakh illegal immigrants from India , though government figures may vary.Migration Policy Institute, in a paper issued last March, explained that removals require the consent of the immigrant’s country of origin, which must confirm the individual’s nationality, issue a travel document, and accept their physical return.The removal process can be complicated or made impossible if relations are frosty between the US and the country of origin or if that country lacks a functioning government or has severely limited resources. The US government formally refers to countries that refuse or delay removals as ‘recalcitrant,’ a designation applied to 13 countries as of 2020, including China, Cuba, India, and Russia, it adds.Sameer Khedekar, founder of Vanguard Visa Law, an immigration law firm told TOI, “The bill, which is nearly law (it has already been passed by the House on Jan 7), also allows states to sue to cancel ‘all’ visas from countries that don’t take back their undocumented immigrants.”Khedekar says the fear is that once enacted, Steve Bannon, former chief strategist in the earlier Trump administration could seek out states like Texas (with right-wing attorney generals) to use this provision to ask a judge to cancel visas issued from India (say H-1B visas ), should India not take back its undocumented immigrants. Bannon has affirmed that he would be willing to take such measures, in statements to US media houses, including the New Republic.Traditionally owing to the strong ties between India and the US, India has not faced a blanket visa ban as a deterrent measure. If the bill is passed, the decision to impose a blanket ban will rest with the court rather than in diplomatic dialogue.","Fears that there would be sweeping visa bans if countries do not cooperate in taking back their citizens who are illegal immigrants in the US.

Timeline of Barron Trump's Rapid Height Growth Leading to His Current Stature

LeBron James's Physical Attributes Include a Height of 6 Feet 9 Inches and Weight of 250 Pounds

LeBron Shows LOVE to a Young Fan After the Game ❤️

Melania Trump Reveals If Son Barron Will Live at White House

Barron Trump , the 18-year-old son of Donald and Melania, is an impressive 6 feet 9 inches tall, which has led to comparisons with NBA great LeBron James . His profile has been on the rise, especially with Donald Trump ’s recent political success in winning the 2024 presidential election , marking his return for a non-consecutive second term as the 47th President of the United States.Barron Trump, born on March 20, 2006, in New York City, has always been in the spotlight for his impressive height. By 2017, he was already matching his mom, Melania Trump , who is 5 feet 11 inches tall. Fast forward to his high school graduation in May 2024 from Oxbridge Academy in West Palm Beach, Florida, and he had shot up to 6 feet 7 inches.By November 2024, he was reported to be an astonishing 6 feet 9 inches tall, the same height as NBA superstar LeBron James.LeBron James, born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, is often seen as one of the greatest basketball players in history. Standing tall at 6 feet 9 inches and weighing in at 250 pounds, his impressive combination of size, strength, and athleticism has been crucial to his legendary career.He entered the NBA straight from high school in 2003 and has since earned a bunch of accolades, including four NBA titles and four MVP awards.Barron Trump's height has become a hot topic online, especially on Google and Twitter. Users are making comparisons to LeBron James, who is also the same height, and it’s created quite a stir. This surprising similarity has led to a wave of memes and discussions, showcasing the public's curiosity about the youngest Trump.In a June 2024 chat with social media sensation Logan Paul, former President Donald Trump jokingly commented on his son's height, saying, ""He's a big boy. Six foot 9. I couldn't get him to play basketball. I play soccer, he's a good athlete."" Moreover, in his book ""Siege: Trump Under Fire,"" journalist Michael Wolff claimed that Donald Trump feels envious of his son Barron's height, which has led to some friction between them.Barron started his freshman year at New York University's Stern School of Business in September 2024, opting for a different route than his family, who typically go to the University of Pennsylvania or Georgetown. He’s staying at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan, pretty close to the NYU campus.Both Barron Trump and LeBron James are 6 feet 9 inches tall, but their journeys are worlds apart. LeBron has channeled his height into a stellar basketball career, while Barron, now 18, is just kicking off his academic path in business at NYU.It's pretty interesting how they both have the same height, showing that people with similar looks can take different routes and still find success in all sorts of areas.Also Read : “I’ve actually seriously considered it”: LeBron James was inches away from debuting in the NFL in a major career changing decision","Barron Trump was born on March 20, 2006, in New York City.

The TOI Correspondent from Washington:

'Go To BRICS...': Trump Taunts & Threatens NATO Nation, Says 'Will Punish With 100%...'

The familiar adage goes that a picture is worth a thousand words, but this one added up to nearly $ 1 trillion.A photo of three of the world's wealthiest individuals, Elon Musk (current worth $ 434 billion), Jeff Bezos ($240 billion) and Mark Zuckerberg ($ 212 billion), seated in the front row at Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday offered what critics called ""the perfect symbol of US plutocracy.""Stuck between Musk and Bezos in the billionaire's row was Alphabet/Google's Indian-American CEO Sundar Pichai , whose paltry $ 1.2 billion wealth is chump change in comparison. Google's co-founder Sergei Brin (net worth $ 140 billion) was seated elsewhere, as was luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault of LVMH (net worth $ 200 billion).In all, there was more than $ 1.3 trillion in combined wealth concentrated behind Trump with four of the five wealthiest individuals attending the inauguration, CNBC anchor Susan Li noted, adding that the stock value of their companies was more than $ 12 trillion.Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner breezed across the billionaires row shaking hands with them before the oath-taking ceremony.""When I started talking about Oligarchy, many people didn't understand what I meant. Well, that's changed. When the 3 wealthiest men in America sit behind Trump at his inauguration, everyone understands that the billionaire class now controls our government. We must fight back,"" the self-declared socialist Senator Bernie Sanders said in a post.But as if to illustrate that power from a country with 1.4 billion people also matters, India's external affairs minister S.Jaishankar was also seated in the front row facing (itals) the oath-taking ceremony, while the mega money was behind (itals) Trump.Meanwhile, Trump's MAGA minions were out in the cold in -10c weather after the ceremony was shifted indoors, with late-night comics later mocking them as mugs waiting for a miracle while the uber-rich were lining up to drink from the trough.Many commentators wondered how a President who so openly reveres wealth could also be a populist who wins elections with votes from a largely poor MAGA base.In fact, Trump himself has catapulted into the mega-billionaires club with the launch of new crypto token that soared to more than $10 billion in market value on Monday.Following $TRUMP memecoin, returning First Lady Melania Trump also launched her own cryptocurrency $MELANIA in a social media post Sunday, alarming ethics experts.Meme coins are a type of highly volatile cryptocurrency inspired by popular internet or cultural trends.The website for the Melania Coin characterizes the cryptocurrency bearing her name as “not financial instruments or investments” and says that they are for “collecting and entertainment purposes only.” But although they carry no intrinsic value, holders can cash in on them.Trump's meme coin shows the image of the president holding up his fist with the words, ""FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT"" – his battle cry after surviving an assassination attempt in July 2024.Trump's enthusiasm about generating economic activity and wealth, which critics see as obsession with money, is fairly transparent. In a free-wheeling media interaction in the Oval Office as he was signing executive orders on Monday, questions veered around to North Korea and Gaza. On both, Trump mused about their potential from the perspective of real estate.""It's a phenomenal location...on the sea...the best weather!"" he raved about Gaza.","Three of the world's wealthiest individuals, Elon Musk (current worth $ 434 billion), Jeff Bezos ($240 billion) and Mark Zuckerberg ($ 212 billion), were seated in the front row at Donald Trump's inauguration.

Budget 2025 income tax: Raise 30% income tax slab; provide flat 30% deductions on gross income,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2025-income-tax-raise-30-income-tax-slab-provide-flat-30-deductions-on-gross-income-heres-why/articleshow/117423315.cms,"Budget 2025: Shetty advocates for a 30% flat deduction on gross income with a ₹15 lakh ceiling on deductions.

Raise 30% Income Tax Slab to Rs 18 lakh

Enhance income tax brackets and not just the basic exemption limit

Give 30% flat deductions to encourage savings

Budget 2025 income tax expectations : Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should look to increase the income tax threshold for the 30% tax bracket in her Union Budget 2025, says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.According to BankBazaar, three important income tax changes that need to be brought in Budget 2025 are; raising the 30% income tax threshold to Rs 18 lakh, restructuring tax brackets, and implementing a standardised 30% deduction on gross income.""The 30% tax slab has remained at ₹15 lakh since 2020, despite a 21% rise in the Cost Inflation Index,"" Shetty notes. ""We propose increasing this threshold to ₹18 lakh to reflect inflation and offer relief to urban salaried individuals burdened by rising costs."" This modification would help distribute the tax responsibility more equitably amongst higher-income earners.Also Read | Budget 2025 income tax expectations: Make NPS more attractive - here's how Shetty expresses concerns about solely increasing the tax-free income limit. ""Calls to raise tax-free income to ₹10 lakh are well-intentioned but shift the tax burden to higher earners.

A balanced approach is necessary.""Regarding diminishing long-term savings and insurance adoption, Shetty observes, ""The absence of deductions in the new tax regime has led to reduced interest in essential financial protections.

The incentive to save and to insure—tax deductions—must continue.""Shetty advocates for a 30% flat deduction on gross income with a ₹15 lakh ceiling on deductions.

Bears versus Raiders for Ben Johnson

A Raiders fan noticed how the Raiders insider had hyped up Ben Johnson all week

OC Ben Johnson brought the Detroit Lions to the divisional round. But alas! In the divisional round, the Lions could not stand a chance against the Washington Commanders . The Commanders have been unstoppable since day 1! All thanks to the enthusiasm brought by LSU’s star quarterback Jayden Daniels , who played for the first time for the Commanders.Following this 31-45 defeat, the Detroit Lions’ offensive coordinator decided to leave his job and take on a new job as the head coach for the Chicago Bears . The only thing common between the Lions and the Bears is NFC North. There’s no Tom Brady ’s franchise anywhere here.First things first, Tom Brady owns a little portion of the Las Vegas Raiders , so that’s his suffrage. Secondly, an Insider of the Raiders took to his X and cleared the air around Ben Johnson and the Lions’ job.A rumor by an X account called ‘BlknSlvr’ was circulating. The rumor read:“Raiders used leverage by Johnson, to pump up the Bears offer, same story different year.” it received heavy views, around 80.2K!A Las Vegas Raiders insider by the name of Vincent Bonsignore clarified on behalf of the Raiders and stated,“That's not what happened.He picked the better QB situationWorst possible timing for the @Raiders was @Lions getting beat by Jayden Daniels on Saturday.

But hard luck for Tom Brady. OC Ben Johnson’s eyes were on the Chicago Bears. The Raiders insider even wrote a post on his X, explaining why Ben chose the Bears over the Raiders. It said:“Per source: Ben Johnson choosing the better overall situation, including young quarterback in place with the @Bears, over the money the @Raiders were prepared to offer, the chance to help pick the next GM and opportunity to work with Tom Brady.”A Raiders fan by the name ‘pear’ tagged the Raiders insider, Vincent Bonsignore, and wrote:“then why would you hype up him (Ben Johnson) coming to the raiders all week?????”To which, Vincent replied,“I'm not a hype man 😂😂I report what I'm hearing based on multiple sources.

Lakers legend Magic Johnson is reportedly exploring a role in NBA expansion as part of an ownership group. According to reports, Johnson could join efforts to bring a new team to Las Vegas or Kansas City. His involvement would be a significant step for the Hall of Famer who has been a successful businessman following his retirement from the league. While the legendary NBA star already has his stakes in sports ventures, the new ownership of an NBA team would bring him back to the league in a new role. Magic Johnson is widely regarded as one of the most successful athletes in business after his playing days. Along with his various business ventures, he has stakes in teams like the Los Angeles Dodgers, Washington Commanders, and LAFC.However, owning an NBA team has never been on Johnson’s radar, at least not until now. Despite his love for the Lakers, Johnson previously teased that the New York Knicks would be his top choice if given the chance.Now, that might be changing. Reports suggest Johnson could join an ownership group for an NBA expansion team in either Las Vegas or Kansas City. According to the latest report by DailyMail.Com, the 1.6 billion rich (according to Forbes’ Real Time Net Worth) NBA legend is considering joining the group of owners for the NBA’s franchise expansion.“Several investment groups in Las Vegas are interested in partnering with him. His extensive experience in sports ownership and his business acumen positions him as a formidable candidate,” Jack Bezants of The Daily Mail reported about Johnson’s potential move.The NBA Hall of Famer’s return to the league with the new league has sparked conversation among fans. Additionally, Lakers legend LeBron James previously shared his interest in bringing a new team to Las Vegas.“It just makes sense. Obviously you have the Raiders here. You have the Knights here. You have the Aces here. You got F1 coming very soon. All-Star Weekend has been here a few times, you got the NBA Summer League that’s very popular,” James said (via: Spectrum SportsNet).He went on to add, “Sports is here and I think adding an NBA franchise here would just add to the momentum that’s going on in this town. It’s an attraction. You don’t have to worry about getting fan support, nothing like that. They show every single time, every year, every summer, like you said even if its USA Basketball or the NBA coming here for Summer League whatever the case may be. I think it’s only a matter of time, and I hope I’m part of that time.”Also Read: LA Clippers fan who called out LeBron James ends up embarrassed in front of a full crowd If the Los Vegas NBA team gets a green light, the addition of two Lakers legends would make the team’s inception year interesting.

Barron Trump steals the show at Trump’s inauguration

Barron Trump, the youngest child of US President Donald Trump, is launching a luxury real estate company . Partnering with two of his high school classmates, Cameron Roxburgh and Carter Fulcher, Barron co-founded Trump, Fulcher & Roxburgh Capital Inc. last July.Following Donald Trump’s victory, the company temporarily paused operations just four months after its launch. According to co-founder Cameron Roxburgh, the decision was made to avoid unwanted media attention during the political season, according to The Post.The company, incorporated in Wyoming, plans to focus on high-end properties and golf course projects in states like Utah, Arizona, and Idaho. Its principal address was listed as Mar-a-Lago, the Trump family estate in Florida, according to The Post.Barron, 18, currently a student at New York University’s business school, played a significant role in his father’s 2024 re-election campaign. According to Daily Mail, he advised his father to appear on popular platforms like ""The Joe Rogan experience.""Also watch:Unlike his older brothers, Donald Jr. and Eric, who manage the Trump Organisation, Barron’s venture is independent of his father’s businesses, writes Daily Mail. However, Roxburgh mentioned to Newsweek that Barron has received private advice from his father about starting and running a company.According to Daily Mail, as Barron navigates college life and business, he chooses to remain in New York City rather than the White House, marking a different chapter for the youngest Trump.

NEW DELHI: Defending champion Aman Sehrawat is apprehensive about his prospects of competing in the upcoming Zagreb Open in Croatia, a ranking series event in the United World Wrestling 's (UWW) calendar which the Indian has dominated in the past two editions.It's not the men's 57kg defending champion alone. Other Indian men and women wrestlers who have submitted their entries for the Feb 5-9 meet too, are awaiting confirmation regarding their participation.The wrestlers are facing the ramifications of the government not acknowledging the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), headed by Sanjay Singh . The entries for the tournament must be routed through WFI since the UWW has informed the Indian authorities that it will only consider names sent by the Singh-led federation and not any other wrestling body.An Indian Olympic Association (IOA)-run ad-hoc body had been formed after the sports ministry had de-recognized the body, but it was subsequently dissolved after the UWW's stern directive.In the latest development, the wrestlers are awaiting clearance from the Sports Authority of India (SAI) to participate in Zagreb. They are scheduled to depart India on Feb 3 and 4 for the season's first ranking series meet, one which carries ranking points for seedings at the senior World wrestling championships, to be held later this year. There are four ranking series events in the wrestling calendar.Earlier, the wrestlers had missed out participating in two invitational meets in Belarus and Egypt in Nov-Dec last year after the SAI refused to clear the teams owing to the WFI's continued derecognition. With the event dates fast approaching, it appears unlikely that the wrestlers will be able to compete in the event.WFI officials said they had submitted the proposal to SAI some time back, expressing interest in sending the team for the series. But there has been no response from the authorities despite reminders from the federation.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
