Rahul's Adani-centric poll campaign fails to move voters in Maharashtra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rahuls-adani-centric-poll-campaign-fails-to-move-voters-in-maharashtra/articleshow/115617230.cms,"Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: In the run-up to Maharashtra elections , Gautam Adani 's link to the BJP-led coalition at the Centre and in the state was a key theme, whether it was the award of Dharavi redevelopment project or Rahul Gandhi 's jibe at BJP's 'ek hain to safe hain' slogan by dragging the businessman into the picture.Be it Uddhav Thackeray's reference to 'Adani ki sultani' or the Gandhi scion and his sister Priyanka's claims that BJP toppled the Maha Vikas Aghadi govt to favour the ports-to-power conglomerate, Adani was in focus for the alliance. Sharad Pawar was the only one who had sought to soften the attack on Adani.The MVA's allegations, however, do not seem to have clicked with voters. While the US department of justice's indictment of Adani and his nephew Sagar in a bribery case is expected to give BJP's rivals ammunition in the winter session of Parliament, the poll outcome has taken the sting out of the opposition's campaign.Although Dharavi redevelopment was originally conceived by the BJP-Shiv Sena govt, it was the Devendra Fadnavis-led coalition that got the project moving in 2016. CM Eknath Shinde has said the project was awarded to Adani by the MVA govt. While Congress's Jyoti Gaikwad trounced her Sena opponent in Dharavi, the haze over the project is expected to lift as Thackeray had vowed to cancel the contract.Rahul's attack is a critical component of his now familiar toolkit, where he seeks to link businesses such as those run by the Adanis and Ambanis with BJP, despite the pitch failing to get traction with a majority of voters for over a decade. In 2019, his attempts to portray Anil Ambani as the biggest beneficiary of the Rafale deal had similarly failed to impress voters. Yet, he and his allies have refused to give up on it.Unlike Anil Ambani, who is now left with a fraction of what he had inherited, Adani has seen his empire expand. It is unlikely that even INDIA govts across states, which have actively courted Adani to attract investment, are going to change their strategy, although Rahul may pull out the pamphlets again.","Gautam Adani's link to the BJP-led coalition at the Centre and in the state was a key theme, whether it was the award of Dharavi redevelopment project or Rahul Gandhi's jibe at BJP's 'ek hain to safe hain' slogan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115617258,imgsize-657172,width-400,resizemode-4/115617258.jpg"

MUMBAI: Six months is a long time in politics. The ruling Mahayuti had suffered a major setback in the state in the Lok Sabha elections. But it has made a crushing comeback in the assembly elections, winning 230 of the state's 288 assembly seats - at 80%, that's more than a three-fourths majority. MVA, which led in 153 assembly segments in the LS polls, has been reduced to an abysmal 46 seats in the state.The Ladki Bahin Yojana, its cash transfer scheme for women, is being widely credited as a gamechanger. Consolidation of the OBC vote and pro-Hindutva vote have acted as a force multiplier.For the Mahayuti alliance of BJP , CM Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and the Ajit Pawar-led NCP , this is a remarkable turnaround. BJP, apart from scoring a hat-trick of assembly poll victories - crossing 100 seats each time - has won its biggest mandate ever in the state with its 132 eclipsing its 2014 tally of 122. The victory, under deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis , heralds his return as a strong contender for the top post.It is also Congress's worst-ever showing in its one-time bastion of Maharashtra (which sends the largest number of MPs to Lok Sabha after UP). The party had been reduced to 42 assembly seats during the 2014 Modi wave. Now it has managed to win less than half that tally, with just 16 seats.Equally significant is that the verdict has legitimised Eknath Shinde 's Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar 's NCP. They can now claim to be the real inheritors of the party leadership. Shiv Sena has won 57 seats compared to Shiv Sena (UBT)'s 20. And Ajit Pawar's NCP has won 41 seats compared to the NCP (Sharad Pawar's) 10 seats. Uddhav Thackeray , who was anointed party chief by his father Bal Thackeray, could well be staring at political oblivion, having lost control of the party's vote base to a non-Thackeray. For 84-year-old Sharad Pawar whose pragmatic political alignments have helped him play a long innings, this presents a existential crisis and perhaps the end of the road for the party as he had envisaged it.The Ladki Bahin scheme, among other sops, a good monsoon and counter-consolidation of OBCs in response to Maratha quota aggression during the LS polls were factors that held across regions to deliver a saffron sweep.Hindutva consolidation through slogans like Yogi Adityanath's 'Batenge Toh Katenge' tapped into concerns within the Hindu community that the Muslim vote had consolidated behind MVA.Within Mahayuti, BJP has achieved a strike rate of 88.5%, with wins in 132 of the 149 seats contested. This is all the more impressive given that it contested the largest number of seats among the six main parties. Shiv Sena's strike rate was 70.4% while NCP's was 69.4%. Within MVA, Shiv Sena has the highest strike rate of 21%, winning 20 of the 95 seats contested. Congress's strike rate is 15.8% while that of NCP (SP) is 11.6%.Observers also said Mahayuti setback in LS polls was largely a vote against incumbency, not the state leadership. ""There was an anti-Modi vote in LS polls and a united campaign by INDIA bloc. Concerns about the Constitution being changed if BJP had absolute majority was a huge issue,"" said an NCP member.In Vidarbha and Marathwada, where farmer anger over low prices for cotton and soyabean crop was expected to go against govt, Mahayuti emerged victorious. Opposition was unable to exploit the issue and Mahayuti countered it by offering up to 20% support to MSP to cover price variations if elected. It had also announced a free power scheme for farmers with agricultural pumps up to 7.5 HP in the run-up to polls.In Marathwada, Maratha quota agitation had scarred BJP in LS polls, leading to defeat of stalwarts like Raosaheb Danve and Pankaja Munde. But the impact of Maratha quota activist Manoj Jarange waned in this election after he withdrew his initial plan to field candidates. Counter-consolidation of OBCs in response to Maratha agitation helped BJP.In north Maharashtra, Mahayuti had faced a major setback in LS polls owing to export restrictions on onion crop. Ahead of assembly polls, Centre slashed export duty on onions and removed the minimum export price.In western Maharashtra, where NCP factions were expected to clash, Ajit Pawar's party dominated. This is primarily because most of NCP's satraps who command a following in their constituencies regardless of party affiliations had joined Ajit Pawar. Their control over the rural network of cooperative sugar factories, banks and dairies helped them sail through.In Konkan and Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which is largely urban, Mahayuti's dominance in LS polls continued into the assembly elections. In Mumbai, once Shiv Sena's bastion, BJP dominated by winning 15 seats. Sena UBT managed a respectable 10 seats, a higher tally than Eknath Shinde's 6 seats. Sena UBT won the Mahim seat where Shiv Sena Bhavan is located.However, finally it was Mahayuti's recognition of the growing number of women voters that won it the greatest dividend. Gender ratio in women voters has risen from 929 in 2011 to 933 in 2024. Ladki Bahin Yojana, patterned on MP govt's Ladli Behna scheme, has been key to Mahayuti's win. It provides a monthly stipend of Rs 1,500 to underprivileged women between 21 and 65 with an annual family income below Rs 2.5 lakh. Mahayuti promised to raise it to Rs 2,100 if elected and claimed MVA would halt the scheme if it came to office.Over 2.4 crore women received the stipend in their bank accounts by voting day. Many had received stipends worth Rs 7,500 in three instalments. The instalments began rolling out in Aug, with the Nov stipend being delivered in Oct to beat the code of conduct.Besides, the state also announced 3 free gas cylinders for 52 lakh households and free higher education for girls from families with annual income of below Rs 8 lakh. It's evident the women-oriented schemes enthused women voters since there was a six percentage point surge in female voter turnout in the state - from 59.2% in the 2019 assembly polls to 65.2%.","Ruling Mahayuti had suffered a major setback in the state in the Lok Sabha elections. But it has made a crushing comeback in the assembly elections. The Ladki Bahin Yojana, its cash transfer scheme for women, is being credited as a gamechanger. Consolidation of the OBC vote and pro-Hindutva vote have acted as a force multiplier.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115613784,imgsize-1188635,width-400,resizemode-4/115613784.jpg"

NEW DELHI: There is unalloyed joy in BJP over the Maharashtra victory. However, its ally, Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde , may now have mixed feelings over the result because of the sheer numbers raked in by BJP.After BJP's best-ever performance in the western state, with the party missing the majority mark of 145 by just 13 seats, the leadership question appears to have been re-opened amid indications that it may like to put its tallest leader Devendra Fadnavis back at the helm.While senior figures like Union minister Piyush Goyal stuck to the formulaic ""the three parties will soon sit together to decide the issue"", sources in BJP acknowledged that the magnitude of its win has prompted a re-think over the leadership question.PM Narendra Modi's description of Devendra Fadnavis as ""Param Mitra"" (best friend) in the post-victory celebration was also seen as a strong pointer to that.""We have more than double Eknath Shinde's numbers. Our workers were disappointed when we made Fadnavis to agree to be deputy to somebody who had served as a minister under him. He agreed because of party discipline. Getting him to make the sacrifice yet again would be cruel,"" a senior BJP source said.A likely claim by BJP for the top position will be supported by Ajit Pawar who may be more comfortable with a non-Maratha like Fadnavis being CM rather than serving as deputy to a fellow Maratha for another term.The Shinde camp appeared to have sensed the signs of BJP's resurgent ambition and was resentful of it.""Shinde ran a govt which delivered on development, helped MLAs improve their chances of re-election and launched the highly popular Ladki Bahin Yojana to shift the vibes,"" a source close to the CMO in Mumbai said. He also brought up Shinde's role in bringing down MVA govt. ""We were promised that there would be no change of leadership,"" the source said.However, the outgoing chief minister does not have too many options because of BJP huge numbers and the strong likelihood of Ajit Pawar teaming up with the latter on the leadership issue. Also, the small flocks of Congress, NCP (SP) and Sena UBT are likely to be prone to splits.","BJP's best-ever performance in the western state, with the party missing the majority mark of 145 by just 13 seats.

PUNE: The passage of time seemed momentarily suspended at Bhigwan Chowk, Baramati 's political epicentre as the constituency stepped into a new chapter on Saturday, with Tennyson's words echoing powerfully: ""The old order changeth, yielding place to new...""By noon, 65-year-old Ajit Pawar , often referred to as 'Dada', cemented his position as Baramati's political heir, defeating nephew Yugendra Pawar of the Sharad Pawar-led NCP (SP) by a decisive margin of 1,00,899 votes.The square was awash in pink - the colour of Ajit Pawar's NCP faction - as supporters marked it with deafening drums, a shower of flower petals, and bike rallies through the streets. The celebrations departed dramatically from the traditionally subdued tones associated with the Pawar family .Baramati has been synonymous with the family since Sharad Pawar's first electoral victory in 1967. His nephew Ajit carried forward that legacy from 1991, winning consistently. But the 2023 split in NCP divided loyalties between the factions led by 83-year-old Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar, setting the stage for this election.Ajit Pawar's wife and Rajya Sabha MP Sunetra Pawar attributed his victory to the loyalty of Baramati voters. ""Baramatikars have shown they are Dada's true family,"" she said.Yet, amid the political shift, many residents yearn for unity within the Pawar family. Anganwadi teacher Meera Jadhav captured this sentiment: ""When people ask where we're from, we proudly say Baramati. They recognise it as Sharad Pawar's hometown. Look at our roads, schools, parks, and hospitals - all of this happened because Saheb and Dada worked together. We want the old days back so we don't have to choose.""Outside Ajit Pawar's office, jubilant supporters filled the streets. Just meters away, silence blanketed the NCP (SP) office, where defeat hung heavily in the air.As Baramati stood at a crossroads, its future shaped by the Pawar family's evolving legacy, many old-timers sought the hands that shaped the 'clock' to work together.","Ajit Pawar, 65, won the Baramati seat by a decisive margin of 1,00,899 votes. The square was awash in pink - the colour of Ajit Pawar's NCP faction. Supporters marked it with deafening drums, a shower of flower petals, and bike rallies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115613637,imgsize-1786554,width-400,resizemode-4/115613637.jpg"

MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde on Saturday established himself, and rather convincingly, as the leader of the real Shiv Sena With his party winning 57 seats - one more than the undivided Shiv Sena's 56 in the 2019 assembly elections and a staggering 35 more than Shiv Sena-UBT's Saturday tally - he now has the first claim to not only Sena founder Bal Thackeray's political legacy, but also the grassroots support that was so far believed to be with Uddhav Thackeray Shinde Sena's strike rate - number of seats contested divided by the number of wins - made its victory even more remarkable. His party contested only 81 seats and won 57 at a strike rate of 70.4%. In 2019, the undivided Sena had contested 124 seats and won 56, a strike rate of 45.2%. And in 1995, when the undivided Shiv Sena had won 73 seats, its highest ever, the strike rate was 43.2%.Shinde Sena now stands as the state's number one regional party, second only to the national behemoth, BJP, and miles ahead of Sharad Pawar's NCP. Political observers said having made deep inroads into Mumbai, Shiv Sena-UBT's traditional stronghold, it is just a matter of time before he challenges Uddhav Thackeray for the control of the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). There is a possibility of Shinde poaching Sena-UBT's MLAs, MPs and influential 'shakha pramukhs' in Mumbai.Shinde's Sena contested 15 seats in Mumbai and won 5. Uddhav's Sena contested 22 and won 10. Almost all of Sena's 40 sitting MLAs won and so did its cabinet ministers, illustrating the meticulous planning that went into selection of candidates. Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde characterised Shinde Sena's victory as the end of Shiv Sena being run as a private limited company. ""People have delivered their verdict on who is taking Balasaheb's legacy forward,"" he said.","Eknath Shinde's party won 57 seats - one more than the undivided Shiv Sena's 56 in the 2019 assembly elections. He now has the first claim to not only Sena founder Bal Thackeray's political legacy, but also grassroots support.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115612111,imgsize-855615,width-400,resizemode-4/115612111.jpg"
Election results: BJP's core agenda gets a boost with heavy-Mahayuti win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-maharashtra-election-results-bjps-core-agenda-gets-a-boost-with-heavy-mahayuti-win/articleshow/115615225.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress couldn't have imagined a drubbing like the one it got in Maharashtra, where MVA managed only 46 seats - 10 fewer than INDIA bloc's tally in Jharkhand, where the assembly is less than one-third the size of the western state. Congress's weakness in straight fights with BJP has also been highlighted again.Coming just six months after BJP's LS reverses in Maharashtra, the party will interpret its best-ever tally in the state as a revalidation of PM Modi's brand of politics. His authority, following a win in Haryana and sweep in Maharashtra, is now all but restored after the knock it took following LS results. In his post-victory speech, Modi made it plain he would focus as much on 'development' as on Hindutva themes and the 'virasat' (heritage) platform.A charged-up BJP will push its plans on UCC and one nation, one election more aggressively. Passing the ONOE bill will be easier after two state wins.Economic policy initiatives like hiking the ceiling on FDI in insurance to 100% will be politically safer following BJP's crushing win in Maharashtra.Key govt officials are upbeat that the bill can be placed before Parliament in the coming winter session. As for caste census, which only a few months back looked like a major opposition strategy, BJP, which executed electorally profitable social engineering in Haryana and Maharashtra, now has the luxury of not being pushed into it out of fear of a backlash.Maharashtra's win is so overwhelming that BJP has won the optics game despite its loss in smaller, and politically less crucial, Jharkhand. But even in that loss, BJP's vote share is close to that of the JMM-led INDIA alliance. Chatter on the party's and Modi's waning popular appeal will now quieten.The other big political message was that Rahul Gandhi's charges of crony capitalism against BJP is not a theme voters care about much. The Adani factor was hyped up by MVA in Maharashtra. But ordinary citizens have proved again that a measure of economic security, even via govt sops, is much more important to them than allegations of which rich industrialist is cozying up with which party.Congress, after back-to-back losses in Haryana and Maharashtra, has all but lost the leading status it gained among opposition parties after its improved LS performance. Alliance partners will again be more aggressive in negotiations and less willing to follow agendas set unilaterally by Congress.This will be especially true when it comes to Congress's opposition to BJP's future Hindutva agenda, whether its uniform civil code or pushing through the Waqf reform bill. Modi was pointed in his post-victory speech when he said the Constitution didn't back a waqf law.",Congress couldn't have imagined a drubbing like the one it got in Maharashtra.

NEW DELHI: The vote counting for the Maharashtra assembly elections is underway, with early trends hinting at a fierce battle between the Mahayuti alliance and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The Mahayuti, comprising the BJP, Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar’s NCP, is pitted against the MVA coalition of Congress, Shiv Sena (UBT), and Sharad Pawar-led NCP.Maharashtra’s 288 constituencies witnessed a voter turnout of 66.05%, reflecting increased public participation compared to 2019. Both alliances remain optimistic, interpreting the higher turnout as a sign of support for their respective coalitions.Key contests are drawing significant attention, including Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis’s fight in Nagpur South West and a high-stakes battle in Wadala, where Shiv Sena (UBT)’s Shraddha Jadhav expressed confidence in her victory.As counting progresses, leads are emerging, with the Mahayuti gaining a landslide margin of over 220 seats in several constituencies.","Here are the winners from Maharashtra assembly elections: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Maharashtra Alliance (Maha) and Jharkhand Alliance (Jharkand) BJP: 145 BJP+ 229 MVA 47 OTH 12 Maharashtra Alliance: 81 NDA 24 OTH 1 Source: PValue.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115585397,imgsize-938489,width-400,resizemode-4/115585397.jpg"
Jharkhand election results: BJP big guns fail to convert mega rallies into victories,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-election-results-bjp-big-guns-fail-to-convert-mega-rallies-into-victories/articleshow/115616249.cms,"RANCHI: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma almost matched the Sorens rally for rally. And hoping to make deep inroads, BJP rolled out its heavy artillery - led by PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah with UP CM Yogi Adityanath making frequent visits - in its high-decibel campaign to take Jharkhand.The results, with the exception of some urban seats, were quite the opposite. While PM Modi held five rallies and a roadshow in areas that included the tribal pockets of Gumla and Chaibasa (Kolhan), Shah held 14 rallies during the campaign while Yogi was parachuted in to consolidate Hindu and SC-dominated pockets in urban areas.Despite Modi holding rallies in Bokaro, Sarath, Godda and Chaibasa, BJP won no seats here. Bokaro, Sarath and Godda were, in fact, seats that were with BJP but were wrested by the JMM-led INDIA bloc. Similarly, despite Shah's rallies in Tamar and Chhatarpur, the INDIA bloc won both. Chhatarpur previously was with BJP.Yogi, with his 'batenge to katenge' line, held rallies in Deoghar, Bokaro, Bermo, Bhawnathpur and Hussainabad, but BJP-led NDA ended up with losses in these seats. Deoghar, Bhawnathpur and Hussainabad were in the NDA fold.Congress spokesperson Lal Kishorenath Shahdeo said the results showed an outright rejection of BJP's ""divisive politics"" by voters in the state. ""Right from the PM to lower-rung functionaries, all tried highly divisive politics but the outcome indicates tribals, Dalits and voters at large have given the mandate to INDIA bloc. This is a direct referendum on Modi, Shah and BJP,"" Shahdeo said.BJP functionaries said they did not agree with the assessment that their campaign had not worked ""We accept the verdict. Yes, it's not what we had expected, but we have managed to open our accounts in new seats only due to BJP's issue-based campaigning,"" said BJP spokesperson Ashok Baraik.",PM Modi held five rallies and a roadshow in areas that included the tribal pockets of Gumla and Chaibasa (Kolhan) Shah held 14 rallies during the campaign while Yogi was parachuted in to consolidate Hindu and SC-dominated pockets in urban areas.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115616954,imgsize-1158510,width-400,resizemode-4/115616954.jpg"

As for caste census , which only a few months back looked like a major opposition strategy, BJP, which executed electorally profitable social engineering in Haryana and Maharashtra, now has the luxury of not being pushed into it out of fear of a backlash.Maharashtra's win is so overwhelming that BJP has won the optics game despite its loss in smaller, and politically less crucial, Jharkhand. But even in that loss, BJP's vote share is close to that of the JMM-led INDIA alliance. Chatter on the party's and Modi's waning popular appeal will now quieten.The other big political message was that Rahul Gandhi's charges of crony capitalism against BJP is not a theme voters care about much. The Adani factor was hyped up by MVA in Maharashtra. But ordinary citizens have proved again that a measure of economic security, even via govt sops, is much more important to them than allegations of which rich industrialist is cozying up with which party.Congress, after back-to-back losses in Haryana and Maharashtra, has all but lost the leading status it gained among opposition parties after its improved LS performance. Alliance partners will again be more aggressive in negotiations and less willing to follow agendas set unilaterally by Congress.This will be especially true when it comes to Congress's opposition to BJP's future Hindutva agenda, whether its uniform civil code or pushing through the Waqf reform bill. Modi was pointed in his post-victory speech when he said the Constitution didn't back a waqf law.","Economic policy initiatives like hiking the ceiling on FDI in insurance to 100% will be politically safer following BJP's crushing win in Maharashtra.

Rahul Gandhi's exit paved way for Priyanka



Three-way contest in Wayanad



Congress's stronghold at stake



Priyanka's campaign rallies draw large crowds



NEW DELHI: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra won the Wayanad Lok Sabha polls with a massive margin as she received 6,22,338 votes in the election which also marks her electoral debut. She defeated CPI's Sathyan Mokeri by 4,10,931 votes.BJP's Navya Haridas garnered 1,09,939 votes and ended in the third spot.After her resounding victory, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra thanked the people of Wayanad, saying she felt ""overwhelmed with gratitude for the trust"" people of the constituency posed in her.""My dearest sisters and brothers of Wayanad, I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the trust you have placed in me. I will make sure that over time, you truly feel this victory has been your victory and the person you chose to represent you understands your hopes and dreams and fights for you as one of your own. I look forward to being your voice in Parliament! Thank you for giving me this honour and even more for the immense love you have given me,"" Priyanka Gandhi wrote on X.Priyanka further wrote: ""My colleagues in the UDF, leaders from across Kerala, workers, volunteers and my office colleagues who worked incredibly hard in this campaign, thank you for your support, for tolerating my 12 hour a day (no food, no rest) car journeys, and for fighting like true soldiers for the ideals we all believe in"".'To my mother, Robert and my two jewels- Raihan and Miraya, no gratitude is ever enough for the love and courage you give me. And to my brother, Rahul, you are the bravest of them all… thank you for showing me the way and having my back, always!"" she further wrote.Priyanka, in her debut electoral run, surpassed her brother Rahul's winning margin of Lok Sabha elections 2024. The Wayanad seat, previously held by Rahul who received 3,64,422 votes, has captured national attention.The Wayanad seat, previously held by her brother Rahul Gandhi, has captured national attention, with many wondering if Vadra can replicate his success. The district Congress leadership estimates that Vadra will secure nearly six lakh votes out of the 9.52 lakh polled. Meanwhile, the LDF’s Sathyan Mokeri is projected to get around two lakh votes, and BJP’s Haridas around one lakh votes.Also read: Election results Despite a low voter turnout, AICC general secretary KC Venugopal expressed confidence, stating, “We are not at all worried about the victory or majority Priyanka Gandhi will secure. The low turnout will not affect her lead.” The AICC is currently looking into the reasons behind the unexpected dip in voter participation.Also read: Bypoll Election Results 2024 Rahul Gandhi, who had held the Wayanad seat since 2019, announced his decision to vacate the constituency following his election in the 2024 general elections.Rahul, having secured victories in both Wayanad and Rae Bareli, chose to retain his seat in Uttar Pradesh, leading to the need for a by-poll in Wayanad. The Congress then nominated Priyanka Gandhi Vadra from the seat.Priyanka Gandhi’s entry into the electoral fray has triggered a high-profile contest in Wayanad, where she faces 15 other candidates, including Sathyan Mokeri of the LDF and Navya Haridas of the NDA. With political dynamics at play, this by-poll has become more than just a local contest.EC has taken extensive steps to ensure a smooth voting process, setting up 1,354 polling booths across the constituency, all equipped with webcasting facilities to monitor the election in real-time.Historically, Wayanad has been a Congress stronghold, with the party winning the seat in every election since its creation in 2008. Rahul Gandhi's victories in 2019 and 2024 were resounding, securing margins of 4.3 lakh and 3.6 lakh votes, respectively.However, the UDF (United Democratic Front) is now banking on Priyanka Gandhi’s popularity to carry the seat once again. The Congress hopes that her appeal, coupled with the party's traditional support base among minorities, settler farmers, and tribal communities, will help secure a significant win.Priyanka Gandhi’s campaign rallies have been marked by large female audiences, a trend that the UDF interprets as a positive sign for her electoral prospects.The rally crowds, coupled with the groundwork being laid by the party in the form of door-to-door outreach and community engagements, indicated that Priyanka positioned herself as a fresh and dynamic face for the constituency.","Priyanka Gandhi Vadra won the Wayanad Lok Sabha polls with a massive margin.

NEW DELHI: With Maharashtra handing over a landslide victory to the ruling Mahayuti, the focus now shifts to ""Kaun Banega 'Maha' Mukhya Mantri""? Interestingly, the people of Maharashtra, with their decisive mandate, seems to have solved what appeared to be one of the most contentious issues among the allies in the run up to the assembly elections.The BJP's superlative performance in the state makes Devendra Fadnavis the strongest contender for the top job. While the BJP had agreed to make Eknath Shinde the chief minister in 2022 when he split the Shiv Sena to engineer the fall of the MVA government, it may not be willing to play second fiddle any more.Fadnavis' mother Sarita Fadnavis, when asked about the chances of her son becoming the chief minister, said: ""Of course, he will become the chief minister. There is absolutely no doubt on this. 100% he will become the chief minsiter. As a mother, it is a moment of happiness and a big day for me as my son has become a big leader of the state. He worked hard 24X7 for this victory.""Fadnavis himself, however, later said it will be decided by the three parties. ""As the home minister Amit Shah had said, the three parties will sit down to decide on the CM. There will be no dispute,"" Fadnavis told reporters.What also works in favour of Fadnavis is the backing of the RSS for his candidature. Just hours after voting for assembly polls had concluded, Fadnavis had met Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat. Though he dismissed any political connotations to his visit, his approximately 15-minute meeting with RSS chief triggered curiosity among political analysts with many perceiving it as an attempt to get Sangh's endorsement for the top post.The saffron party, which has registered its best-ever performance in the state, is in a commanding position to dictate terms. With 125 seats in its kitty, the BJP needs the support of just 20 more MLAs to reach the majority mark. Which means that both Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar's NCP have lost any bargaining power that they may have hoped to have before the assembly elections.However, incumbent chief minister Eknath Shinde, who remains a strong contender for the top job after leading his party Shiv Sena to an impressive performance, feels that the deabte for the top post is far from settled. Shinde says there was no pre-poll agreement to suggest that the party with maximum number of seats will get the chief minister's post.When asked about the claims of some BJP leaders citing the party's numbers, Shinde said "" We have had no such agreement. Let the final results come in after which three senior leaders of the three parties will sit together and take a decision together, in the same way as we fought elections.""""At this time, no definitive formula has been established. Senior leaders from the three parties, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and BJP's national president J P Nadda, will discuss and decide the matter,"" he said.The NCP, which is the third partner of the ruling Mahayuti, had also pitched for Ajit Pawar as the next chief minister in the run up to the elections. In fact, on the eve of counting day a poster had been put up in Pune pitching Ajit as the next chief minister of the state. The NCP leaders had hoped to play the kingmaker after the results were out. However, despite decimating his uncle Sharad Pawar and winning 39 seats, Ajit Pawar is in no position to dictate terms on Kaun Banega Maha Mukhya Mantri ?",The BJP's superlative performance in the state makes Devendra Fadnavis the strongest contender for the top job. The BJP had agreed to make Eknath Shinde the chief minister in 2022 when he split the Shiv Sena to engineer the fall of the MVA government.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115595858,imgsize-30116,width-400,resizemode-4/115595858.jpg"

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: 'More gratitude...': Rishabh Pant talks about how things have changed after his life-threatening accident,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/more-gratitude-rishabh-pant-talks-about-how-things-have-changed-after-his-life-threatening-accident/articleshow/115590634.cms,"Rishabh Pant at Optus Stadium in Perth.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant is literally back from the jaws of death. It was on December 30, 2022, that the star Indian wicketkeeper-batter was involved in a life-threatening car accident near Roorkee in Uttarakhand .Pant was driving his Mercedes SUV from Delhi to Roorkee to surprise his family for the New Year when the car collided with a divider on the Delhi-Dehradun highway. The car subsequently caught fire.The accident occurred early in the morning and Pant had reportedly lost control of the car after falling asleep at the wheel.Now in Perth for the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy between India and Australia, Pant while talking to a Fox Cricket commentator, Pant described how things have changed after the life-threatening accident.On being asked that what he has learnt from the experience, Pant says, ""I think one of the few most important things is like more gratitude in life, yes I would say cricket is part of it, but you are looking at things with a different perspective, because whatever that's happening in life is good, we are thinking life is not happening this way or that way, whatever happens in life is for good, that's the only thing, that's how I look at it. So more gratitude, more humble, more hungry, that's what I'll say.""On his different approach to wicket-keeping in Perth, Pant says, ""I think I have to stand a long way back but it's much better than wicket-keeping on the rank turners (in India). I wouldn't say easier, but when you've just finished your wicket-keeping on rank turners, this would be a better one for sure.""Pant had suffered multiple ligament tears in his knee and ankle, there were lacerations on his forehead, burns on his back and other minor injuries across his body.Despite the severity of the accident, there were no fractures or injuries to his brain or spine.Pant was pulled out of the burning car by local truck drivers, who were praised for their quick actions. Initially admitted to a local hospital in Roorkee, he was later shifted to Max Hospital in Dehradun .Following preliminary treatment, he was flown to Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital in Mumbai for surgery and further recovery.Pant's injuries required multiple surgeries, especially for ligament repair, and he was ruled out of cricket for most of 2023.Pant displayed remarkable resilience during his recovery and started walking with the help of crutches by early 2023.Pant's accident was a stark reminder of the fragility of life, and his journey back has been a testament to his mental and physical strength.","Rishabh Pant was involved in a life-threatening car accident on December 30, 2022.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Trump's mass deportation plan could end up hurting economic growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-mass-deportation-plan-could-end-up-hurting-economic-growth/articleshow/115615479.cms,"Economic impact

WASHINGTON: President-elect Donald Trump's hardline immigration proposals -- including a controversial mass deportation plan -- could prove economically damaging, analysts say, with US sectors that rely heavily on foreign workers like agriculture and construction especially hard hit.US authorities estimate that there are around 11 million unauthorized people living in the United States, the vast majority of whom come from Mexico.Around 8.3 million unauthorized people were in the labor force in 2022, according to a recent estimate from the Pew Research Center. That was equivalent to just under five percent of the overall workforce.""Today our cities are flooded with illegal aliens,"" Trump said on the campaign trail earlier this year, adding: ""Americans are being squeezed out of the labor force and their jobs are taken.""The reality, however, is more complex; many of the sectors that could be the hardest-hit have long struggled to attract US workers.""The construction and agriculture industries would lose at least one in eight workers, while in hospitality, about one in 14 workers would be deported due to their undocumented status,"" the non-profit American Immigration Council (AIC) said in a recent report on Trump's deportation plans.The deportations would also impact ""more than 30 percent"" of plasterers, roofers, and painters, along with a quarter of housekeeping cleaners, according to the report.A recent joint study by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Brookings Institution, and the Niskanen Center estimated that Trump's immigration plans could curb US GDP growth in 2025 by as much as 0.4 percentage points.The impact on growth would primarily come from the direct effect of having fewer foreign workers producing goods and services, with an additional, smaller decline in output coming from less consumer spending by those groups.In such a scenario, the authors said, ""legal immigration is slightly below where it was during the pre-pandemic Trump administration, while enforcement and deportation efforts reach levels not seen in recent decades.""A total of 3.2 million people would be deported during Trump's term under this projection, with net migration -- arrivals minus departures -- falling from 3.3 million in 2024 to negative 740,000 in 2025, boosted by a sharp rise in voluntary emigration.In a more extreme scenario, which analysts say is highly unlikely, the impact on growth could be much more significant.A recent Peterson Institute for International Economics report modelled the impact of expelling all 8.3 million unauthorized immigrant workers.It predicted that economic growth by 2028 could be 7.4 percent beneath baseline estimates, ""meaning no US net economic growth occurs over the second Trump term because of this policy alone.""At the same time, US inflation would be 3.5 percentage points higher by 2026 than it would otherwise be, as employers raised wages to attract American workers.But even in a less significant scenario, mass deportations could push up prices, analysts say.Trump's immigration plans ""could lead to big price increases in certain sectors of the economy, but could also lead to inflation,"" Michael Strain, AEI's director of economic policy studies, told AFP.But mass deportations' aggregate effect on inflation would likely be small, economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in an investor note, ""with upward pressure in sectors like agriculture and construction partly offset by weaker demand in general and slower inflation in some other areas, such as housing.""Most analysts expect legal, logistical and financial challenges will blunt the most extreme proposals -- as they did during the first Trump administration -- with the end result being that net migration eases modestly next year compared to pre-pandemic levels.""We expect tighter policy to lower net immigration to 750k per year, moderately below the pre-pandemic average of 1 (million) per year,"" economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in an investor note.""We're sceptical that the kind of deportations proposed on the campaign could occur,"" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote in a note to clients.","US authorities estimate that there are around 11 million unauthorized people living in the United States.

Who is Santino Pietrosanti?

Pietrosanti's commitment to diversity

Backlash: Is Jaguar's rebranding too ""woke""?

British vehicle company Jaguar 's latest advertisement, ""Copy Nothing ,"" has ignited a firestorm on social media for featuring models and not a single car. Critics have labeled the ad everything from ""pretentious"" to ""a fashion show for people who forgot what they're selling."" Santino Pietrosanti , the self-styled marketing guru who orchestrated Jaguar's controversial rebranding, is at the center of the fierce debate surrounding the car company's shift toward inclusivity and diversity.In Jaguar's 30-second ad, the models walk through abstract scenes while delivering phrases like ""Create Exuberant"" and ""Live Vivid,"" which have been widely mocked. Notably, not a single Jaguar car appears in the entire ad. This absence has baffled many, especially considering the brand's reputation for sleek luxury vehicles.Pietrosanti, a US native, is the head of brand at Jaguar. He now resides in Milton Keynes, England, where he lives with his Scottish husband, Paul, and their cockapoo, Mia, in a £975,000 home, according to The Daily Mail report.At the Attitude Awards last month, dressed in a spangled dinner jacket over a see-through t-shirt, Pietrosanti shared his vision for the rebrand, describing it as a return to Jaguar's roots of ""something truly special.""""We're not just talking about new cars,"" Pietrosanti told the audience, as quoted by The Daily Mail. ""We are talking about all new ways of thinking and embracing the full spectrum of human potential and creativity. Jaguar has always stood for fearless originality, striving to be a copy of nothing. And we believe that every person has the potential to be something unique, something original, and that's what makes us strong.""A key part of Jaguar's transformation, according to Pietrosanti, is its commitment to diversity and inclusion . ""At Jaguar, we proudly stand with the LGBTQ+ community,"" he said. ""Originality and creativity thrive in spaces where people are free to be themselves.""Under his leadership, Jaguar has established over 15 DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) groups, including initiatives focused on Pride, women in engineering, and neurodiversity. Major policy changes, such as creating support for transitioning employees, have been implemented to drive equity and ensure that Jaguar's workforce reflects the diverse society in which it operates.While Pietrosanti's vision has been hailed by some for championing inclusivity and employee empowerment, others have criticized the rebrand as pandering to a ""woke"" agenda. Regardless of the backlash, Pietrosanti remains steadfast in his belief that Jaguar’s commitment to diversity will not only redefine the brand but will also empower its employees and customers alike.""We're on a transformative journey of our own,"" Pietrosanti declared, ""driven by a belief in diversity, inclusion, creativity, policy, and most importantly, action.""","Santino Pietrosanti, head of brand at Jaguar, is at the center of the fierce debate surrounding the car company's shift toward inclusivity and diversity.

Not only was the image a distance record for such cosmic intimacy, but the star, bulging like an overripe fruit, looks as if it is getting ready to explode.""For the first time, we have succeeded in taking a zoomed-in image of a dying star in a galaxy outside our own Milky Way,"" Keiichi Ohnaka, an astrophysicist from Andres Bello National University in Chile, said in a news release from the European Southern Observatory, an international collaboration that runs a phalanx of powerful telescopes in Chile.Ohnaka and colleagues described their observations in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. The star goes by the name of WOH G64. It is in the Large Magellanic Cloud , a small galaxy that orbits the Milky Way and is visible as a large cloud of light in the Southern Hemisphere. The LMC was the site of the last great supernova explosion witnessed by astronomers in 1987, an event known as SN1987a.Observations with spacecraft Infrared Astronomical Satellite in the 1980s revealed that WOH G64, once thought to be cool and dim, is actually the most luminous red supergiant star in that galaxy, and 2,000 times bigger than the Sun.Ohnaka and his team achieved their close-up of this process by using the Very Large Telescope, which consists of four 8-metre diameter telescopes on Cerro Paranal, Chile, and an interferometer called GRAVITY that combines the light from the telescopes to achieve the resolution of a much larger telescope. The new photo shows the mango-shaped star surrounded by wreaths and arcs of gas and dust previously ejected by the dying star.Robert Kirshner, director of the TMT International Observatory in Hawaii and a supernova expert who is not part of Ohnaka's team, said the image was ""definitely an eye opener!"" He added, ""That star is a mess as it gets ready to explode."" nyt","Astronomers have taken the first close-up picture of a star in another galaxy.

'We are entrepreneurs, not politicians'



Top 5 things DOGE will do



DOGE is assembling a lean team of small-government crusaders working for three kinds of reform: regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions and cost savings. They will take action based on existing legislation rather than passing new laws. They will make a list of regulations to Trump they believe are unnecessary and Trump would use his executive power to pause those. They would make work from office mandatory for government workers five days a week which would get rid of a lot of employees. They will shift some departments outside Washington.

As co-chiefs of the Department of Government Efficiency , Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk would make work from the office five days a week mandatory for federal workers and that would result in a wave of voluntary terminations, they wrote in a joint piece for Wall Street Journal. “Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome,” the two wrote. “If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home.”Vivek and Elon wrote that they are entrepreneurs and not politicians and hence will not work as government officials and won't cut ribbons. ""We are entrepreneurs, not politicians. We will serve as outside volunteers, not federal officials or employees. Unlike government commissions or advisory committees, we won’t just write reports or cut ribbons. We’ll cut costs,"" they wrote.“If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home,” they wrote.Elon Musk has promised to eliminate $2 trillion from the annual United States budget and has said that the government needs only 99 agencies, not more than 400.“Employees whose positions are eliminated deserve to be treated with respect,” Musk and Ramaswamy wrote, adding that the efficiency department would “help support their transition into the private sector.”“The president can use existing laws to give them incentives for early retirement and to make voluntary severance payments to facilitate a graceful exit,” they wrote.Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene will chair a newly created US House subcommittee dedicated to improving government efficiency. ""I won't rest until we've rooted out every penny of waste and abuse,"" Marjorie Greene posted.The DOGE has a mandate to wrap up their work by July 4, 2026.","Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk wrote that they are entrepreneurs and not politicians and hence will not work as government officials and won't cut ribbons.

Pakistan sparks global health concern with 50th polio case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-sparks-global-health-concern-with-50th-polio-case/articleshow/115458987.cms,"Pakistan’s National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) sparked global health concerns with the revelation of another polio case on Tuesday, which brings the total number of cases in 2024 to 50, as per ARY News.According to the operations center, the latest case was identified by National Reference Lab in a 2 month old girl, from Tank district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, who was confirmed to have Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1).This is the second case reported from Tank this year, with a genetic connection linked to a case from July in the same district.Balochistan province continues to be the most affected, with 24 cases reported this year, followed by Sindh with 13, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 11, and both Punjab and Islamabad each reporting one case. As a result, authorities continue to stress the importance of polio vaccination campaigns to prevent the spread of the virus, especially in high-risk areas. International organizations have also urged Pakistan to implement emergency measures to prevent the spread of the virus.Health authorities announced on November 14 that the case detected in Jaffarabad, Balochistan, marked the district's first confirmed polio infection, highlighting the continued spread of the virus across the country.Genetic sequencing of the virus sample, carried out by the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad, has traced the virus to a WPV1 strain that was previously identified in Pishin, Balochistan, in April. This connection highlights active transmission within the province, which remains the hardest-hit area, with 24 cases reported till now.Besides Afghanistan, Pakistan remains the only country where wild poliovirus transmission has yet to be eradicated. The continued spread of the virus is largely attributed to challenges such as insecurity, misinformation, and community resistance, all of which hinder vaccination efforts.Polio affects the nervous system, often resulting in paralysis or even death. Although there is no cure for the disease, health officials stress that vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent infection.","The latest case was identified by National Reference Lab in a 2 month old girl, from Tank district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

BAKU: Negotiations at the UN climate summit went into overtime as the presidency texts landed on Friday, scheduled as the concluding day of COP29 , carried huge gaps on climate finance issues that need to be bridged for a final outcome.The biggest point of disagreement is the meager core goal of $250 billion per year, which the developed countries are expected to mobilise for developing countries from a ""wide variety of sources,"" including public, private, bilateral, and multilateral, by 2035, rather than only from public finance.Though the annual $250 billion is part of the overall figure of ""at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035"" from ""all public and private sources,"" developing countries outrightly rejected it as they have long been pitching for a bigger share of public finance (grants and grant-equivalent resources) from the developed countries in the overall package. The post-2025 annual $250 billion by 2035 in the text is meant to replace the existing goal of $100 billion per year.Besides the quantum and nature of finance, the other point of discord is the provision where even the developing countries are expected to make additional contributions, including through South–South cooperation, to supplement the finance goal. It is now to be seen how long the negotiators from both developed and developing countries take to thrash out their differences and find a landing zone to reach a final outcome at the annual summit.“The $1.3 trillion number is at best a sham. Even the apparent increase in the provision from the developed world to the developing world of $250 billion annually by 2035 is the same as the $100 billion by 2020 if 6% annual average inflation is accounted for. There is no grant or low-cost finance component. This is a bad deal for the developing world, irrespective of how it is going to be portrayed by the presidency,"" said Vaibhav Chaturvedi, Senior Fellow, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).Avinash Persaud, Special Advisor on Climate Change to the President of the Inter-American Development Bank, however, said, ""There is no deal to come out of Baku that will not leave a bad taste in everyone's mouth, but we are within sight of a landing zone for the first time all year. The recognition of needs on the text is vital to give integrity to the system, but the $250bn commitment to be led by developed countries is short given adaptation needs alone, and reliance on the hope and prayer of cross-border private sector flows that have so far been negligible will be a point of contention.""Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends, noted that the latest text even changed goalposts as it calls on all countries, developed and developing, to contribute towards climate finance. ""It offers no core amount, which is necessary, not just to fight climate change, but to deliver on the legal obligations of the developed world. Setting a trend of acting in bad faith and cornering developing nations is dangerous. Watering down ambition on all fronts is a setback to the process itself but also to what multilateralism can yield,"" she said.“The sum proposed in the most recent NCQG text is just 0.22% of world GDP. The amount is expected to come through loans, mostly from MDBs, not grants, therefore effectively paid by borrowers. Developed countries allocate significantly more resources annually—up to 10 to 20 times as much—on other global priorities like defence. This shows how incredibly short-sighted and narrow we can be—especially towards the planet and risks for coming generations when the scale and frequency of impacts are already evident,"" said Dipak Dasgupta, Distinguished Fellow, TERI.",Negotiations at the UN climate summit went into overtime as the presidency texts landed on Friday.

India at COP29: We cannot accept any attempts to deflect the focus from finance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/india-at-cop29-we-cannot-accept-any-attempts-to-deflect-the-focus-from-finance/articleshow/115535132.cms,".

BAKU: Baku: Making intervention during discussion on the latest draft texts at COP29, India on Thursday made it clear that the goal for mobilisation of climate finance “needs to be $1.3 trillion with $600 billion of this coming through grants and grants equivalent resources”. It said the country cannot accept any attempts to deflect the focus from finance.Articulating India’s stand, the country’s environment secretary Leena Nandan said, “The New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) is the financial support from developed to developing countries on grant and concessional terms for meeting our ambitious nationally determined contributions (NDCs)…Action will get severely impacted in the absence of adequate means of implementation.The document therefore needs to be specific on the structure, quantum, quality, timeframe, access, transparency, and review.”Referring to the text on the post-2025 finance goal, she emphasised that the expansion of the contributor base, reflection of conditional elements such as macroeconomic and fiscal measures, suggestion for carbon pricing, focus on private sector actors for scaling up resource flows as investments are contrary to the mandate for the goal.“NCQG is not an investment goal…We must accept that climate actions by developing countries will have to be country driven, in line with their circumstances and in the manner best suited to country priorities,” said NandanShe also underlined that the COP29 started with focus on enablement through NCQG, but its focus is now shifting to mitigation.“We cannot accept any attempts to deflect the focus again from finance to repeated emphasis on mitigation. All countries have submitted their NDCs and will be submitting the next round of NDCs being informed by the various decisions we have taken together in the past as well as on the basis of our national circumstances and in the context of sustainable development goals and poverty eradication,” said Nandan.“What we decide here on climate finance will certainly influence what we submit next year. The attempt by some parties (countries) to further talk about mitigation is primarily a shift in focus from their own responsibilities of providing finance,” she said.The remark was in clear reference to the rich nations’ attempt to deflect attention from finance goal to mitigation by bringing in the issue of inadequacy of the developing countries’ NDCs in sync with the Paris Agreement temperature targets.“We feel disappointed by the fact that we continue to shift focus when the time has come to ensure that the mitigation actions are fully supported through provisions of adequate finances as per ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’ (CBDR-RC) and equity considerations,” said the secretary.“This is the time for balance. Balance in the climate discourse. If not so ensured, we may have continuous talk of mitigation that has no meaning, unless supported by enablement that is needed to make climate actions happen on the ground,” she said in her intervention during the single setting session on all the texts, released on Thursday.",India made it clear that the goal for mobilisation of climate finance ‘needs to be $1.3 trillion’ It said the country cannot accept any attempts to deflect the focus from finance.

"COP29: Climate talks face tough negotiations over finance goal, new text offers no progress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/cop29-climate-talks-face-tough-negotiations-over-finance-goal-new-text-offers-no-progress/articleshow/115529331.cms,"BAKU: The next 24 hours of negotiation here at the UN climate talks ( COP29 ) appear to be quite arduous as the latest draft text on the post-2025 climate finance goal, released on Thursday, remains incomplete without the concrete numbers (quantum of annual finance till 2035) in it, despite the unwavering demand of developing countries .Different options, including the one ($1.3 trillion per year) being demanded by developing countries, are bracketed in the text, but it will take a lot of hard negotiation to arrive at a landing zone before the conclusion of the talks on Friday. The amount to be finalised here will replace the existing finance goal of $100 billion per year (2020-25).Though the text is reduced to 10 pages from the 25-page previous version, it lacks clarity on several issues concerning the climate finance to be provided to the developing countries for the implementation of their climate action. However, on the positive side, it mentions prioritising grants, 50% of non-debt funding, 'loss and damage', the importance of a just energy transition, and the fulfilment of human rights.Besides finance (called the New Collective Quantified Goal), multiple texts on other issues—carbon market, mitigation, and adaptation fund—were also released on Thursday. Differences are expected to be thrashed out before bringing the final decision text on Friday. As the issues are being discussed in the plenary, even rich nations aired their concerns on several points, saying the text offers no progress.""The revised draft text, while more streamlined, presents a spectrum of options—some good, some bad, and some outright ugly. It recognises the need to prioritise grants but remains silent on the critical scale of the new finance goal, instead shifting pressure onto developing countries to mobilise more domestic resources,"" said Harjeet Singh, Global Engagement Director for the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative.Referring to an impending task before the developing countries' negotiators, Singh said, ""We must focus not only on the vast sums required—trillions, as acknowledged—but on ensuring these funds are provided as grants, not loans, to shield nations most impacted by climate change from further financial burdens.""Many experts believe that the latest draft NCQG text remains ""glaringly incomplete"" without the concrete numbers for the finance goal, which is the cornerstone of any agreement at COP29. As far as the contributor base is concerned, the text offers an option saying the developing countries willing to contribute may voluntarily do so without being accounted as NCQG.“We are disappointed to see no clear NCQG numbers in the draft text that has been streamlined and includes some strong options and good elements. However, our biggest concern is that this text explicitly tries to erode all references to historical polluters' obligation to pay under the Paris Agreement and is an attempt to prepare the ground for a private sector-led global finance goal with minimal accountability on developed countries,"" said Sanjay Vashist, Director, Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA).Sensing the urgency amid divergent views over the text, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, meanwhile, directly appealed to ministers and negotiators to soften their hard lines and navigate a path through their differences for a ""bigger picture"". ""We need a major push to get discussions over the finishing line to deliver an ambitious and balanced package on all pending issues, with a new finance goal at its heart. Failure is not an option,"" said the UN chief.Meanwhile, during the ongoing plenary on the texts, a European Union (EU) representative told the negotiators that the text is “imbalanced and unworkable, and unacceptable,” whereas the Umbrella Group (the US, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Iceland, Israel, Norway, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Canada) sought clarity on the overall finance package. Australia wants the new finance mobilisation goal to apply to even developing countries.A speaker on behalf of the 'G77 plus China', representing 134 developing countries including India, told the plenary that the group members cannot leave Baku without a clear quantum of finance as they need a mobilisation goal (public finance from developed to developing countries) of at least $500 billion per year out of the total package of an annual $1.3 trillion.","The latest draft text on the post-2025 climate finance goal, released on Thursday, remains incomplete without the concrete numbers (quantum of annual finance till 2035) in it.

A fishing village in southwest Iceland was evacuated late on Wednesday night (local time) following the eruption of the Sundhnukagigar volcanic fissure near Grindavik town, the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) reported.According to the IMO, the Sundhnukagigar volcanic fissure began erupting at 2314 GMT near Grindavik on the Reykjanes Peninsula .The volcano, near Iceland's capital, erupted for the tenth time in three years, spewing fountains of red lava and smoke.IMO expert Benedikt Ofeigsson informed public radio RAS2 that whilst infrastructure remained safe, authorities evacuated Grindavik, a coastal town renowned for the adjacent Blue Lagoon thermal spa , news agency AFP reported.The region's volcanoes remained dormant for 800 years until March 2021, when increased seismic activity commenced.Live footage from broadcasters displayed bright red-orange lava flowing from an extended fissure, surrounded by dense smoke.The IMO confirmed this eruption's intensity was less significant compared to the previous occurrence in August.The majority of Grindavik's 4,000 inhabitants were relocated approximately one year ago, preceding the initial volcanic activity in the area. Subsequently, residents have departed after selling nearly all properties to government authorities.A previous eruption in January resulted in the destruction of three village houses by lava.The region had entered a new phase of volcanic activity. Iceland hosts 33 active volcanic systems, surpassing all other European nations, Volcanology experts were quoted as saying by AFP.The country's position on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a geological boundary separating the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates, contributes to its frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity.","Iceland's Sundhnukagigar volcanic fissure began erupting at 2314 GMT near Grindavik on the Reykjanes Peninsula.
