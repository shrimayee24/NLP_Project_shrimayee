Party that works for national interest will win this family’s votes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/party-that-works-for-national-interest-will-win-this-familys-votes/articleshow/110242183.cms,"In 1972, Kishore Sharma came to Jhansi to set up a rolling mill plant. Soon after, his brothers Dilip and Rajiv followed from Prayagraj. The close knit family now has a thriving business, an active social life and they have been witness to the growth of Jhansi into its present day avatar.The family strongly believes that the issues of ‘roti, kapda aur makaan’ are foremost issues for any govt to fulfil.Therefore, says 75-year-old Dilip, “the party that works for national interest will win our votes.” There was a time when the family voted for candidates, based on their personal equations and the work done by them. Their vote continues to be for one person, though that person is not a candidate here. The vote is for Narendra Modi .His sister-in-law Vidrum highlights the need for a strong govt that can address law and order issues. Jhansi, she says, was a place where women could not step out alone after a point of time. Lawlessness was out of control some years back, and even today, people shudder at the mention of ‘gundagardi’. Vidrum’s husband Rajiv recalled a recent incident from his own factory, where a disgruntled employee ended up calling the police helpline after he was ticked off at work and the police reached within minutes. “At that point we were annoyed with the worker but also impressed with the police for reacting so quickly. Jhansi has changed drastically,” he said.The family is united in its opposition to freebies by govt, but believes that if a welfare programme reaches genuine beneficiaries, it will be welcome. Similarly, there is a strong opposition to reservations . Vidrum’s and Rajiv’s 28-year-old daughter Vatsala, who is preparing for judicial exams, says that the young generation would vote for any party which ends reservations.“There is no good Opposition at present, unless the alliance changes its image. Unlike older generations who have seen several govts, we have nothing to compare the present govt with. This is all we have seen through our youth. The youth will support a govt which ends reservations and ensures jobs,” she said.While extremely happy with the current govt for having provided welfare schemes , increasing India’s prestige and implementing development, the three brothers are unhappy with corruption persisting at the lower levels of govt. Dilip and Rajiv relate how while the govt could be clean at the higher levels, officials at the lower levels are continuing to demand bribes. “Many processes have been moved online, but corruption at the lower levels continues to remain an issue,” says Rajiv.The eldest brother Kishore, who holds immense respect for former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, says that he was the equivalent of Lord Ram, the Maryada Purshottam who could do no wrong. He said: “On the other hand, Modi is like Krishna. He will do whatever is needed to ensure the best for the people. It is because of this end goal of his that he commands such massive support.”During a discussion on the Ram temple and its use in the current election narrative, Vatsala says that this should not be an election agenda. Hindus are happy with its construction, she says, but the election should focus on development, economy and national defence. “Such matters are best ignored,” she said. Affiliation to a political party too, she believes, is linked to where one is coming from. In discussions among classmates and friends, one’s political leanings or appreciation for a political party throw light on the state one belongs to. A person from Delhi, she says, is likely to be impacted by the Aam Aadmi Party while BJP is the preferred choice among most people who belong to UP and Bihar.Vidrum’s father, 87-year-old Dr Manohar Abhay, now lives with his daughter in Jhansi, along with his wife Premlata. Abhay retired as chairperson of the Family Planning Association of India in Mumbai and was deeply associated with the Jana Sangh. Speaking on the changing political situations in India since the 1940s, he said: “A person should have the freedom to speak, unlike how it was during the Emergency. There is a need to end all divisions. A person should not be tied down to an ideology or he or she will have no future. We finally have a new leadership which is working not for a person but for the entire country. Govt should work for development,” he said.","In 1972, Kishore Sharma came to Jhansi to set up a rolling mill plant. Soon after, his brothers Dilip and Rajiv followed from Prayagraj.

India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast formation of a low-pressure area over southwest Bay of Bengal around May 22, while some independent forecasters sounded alarm about potential for an intense cyclone in the making that could impact Odisha, Maharashtra, and Gujarat.Mrutyunjay Mohapatra , director general of meteorology, IMD, told TOI: ""Low-pressure area will help monsoon advance over Andaman sea and adjoining Bay of Bengal, but it may not have an impact on onset of monsoon in Kerala.However, we have not so far ruled out the possibility of the system turning into a cyclone later because May is known for cyclone formation . It is too early to confirm whether or not it will transform into a cyclone. If at all a cyclone forms, its impact on monsoon progress cannot be gauged as of now because it will depend on its path and intensity.""GP Sharma, president of Skymet Weather Services, however, said the system did have a significant potential to become a cyclone, but is unlikely to hinder monsoon's progress.""There are ample chances that the Bay of Bengal system could gradually turn into a cyclone. It is unlikely to disrupt the monsoon progress when it forms, rather only help in its progress,"" Sharma said.Roxy Mathew Koll , senior climate scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, told TOI: ""A low pressure system will definitely develop over the south Bay of Bengal next week. Sea surface temperatures there are quite warm, so the ocean conditions are favourable.

Hospitals' failure to declare brain deaths hitting organ donations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hospitals-failure-to-declare-brain-deaths-hitting-organ-donations/articleshow/110238776.cms,"MUMBAI: Failure to identify and certify brain deaths by hospitals is reducing the country's organ donation rates drastically despite a significant number of potential donors available, Union health ministry recently stated in a directive, asking states to insist on hospitals documenting brain stem deaths meticulously. The ministry said India's cadaver organ donation rate continues to be abysmally low - less than 1 donor per million population a year.In a recent letter, it reminded states that as per provisions of the Transplantation of Human Organs Tissues Act , hospitals must identify each potential brain stem death case admitted in the ICU.It said it is mandatory for hospitals to ask if such potential donors had pledged for organ donation, and if not, to make family members aware of the opportunity to donate organs before the heart stops. The doctor-on-duty, with the transplant coordinator's help, is required to inquire after certification of brain stem death.It is estimated that India sees nearly 1.5 lakh potential brain stem deaths a year due to accidents. Other causes, like strokes, could add to the numbers. However, the total number of deceased donors in India was just 1,028 in 2023, which facilitated over 3,000 transplants. This falls drastically short of the annual need for about 5 lakh organs. With barely 2-3% of the demand met, countless lives are lost to organ failure. In Mumbai alone, over 4,000 people are awaiting cadaver organs.""We need all transplant centres and non-transplant organ retrieval centres to start declaring brain deaths. This is the crucial first step to facilitate organ donation, yet it's not happening in most hospitals,"" said Dr Anil Kumar, director of National Organ & Tissue Transplant Organisation (Notto). He said even registered transplant centres are failing to declare brain deaths.An official from the Maharashtra public health department said most institutions lack a panel to certify brain stem death which hampers identifying such cases. In Mumbai and most other urban districts, majority of brain death certifications are happening in the private sector.Issuing protocols, health ministry has, through Notto, urged hospitals to install 'Required Request Display Boards' at strategic locations conveying the message to the public that in the unfortunate event of brain death or cardiac arrest, donation of organs and tissues - like kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, eyes, skin and bones etc. - could save lives.Notto also issued a proforma to collect information from hospitals on a monthly basis. It said the head of the institutions and respective State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation could analyse and take corrective action.","India's cadaver organ donation rate continues to be abysmally low - less than 1 donor per million population a year.

Villagers of Loutolim, incensed over the proposed acquisition of the paddy fields by govt for the new bridge at Borim, expressed their determination not to part with their land and not to allow the project.Addressing reporters, the affected farmers and landowners said that they were dependent on their paddy fields for their livelihoods. “Agriculture is our livelihood, and a means for our survival.It’s also the future of our children.

66% of leaders say they wouldn’t hire someone without AI skills.

71% prefer hiring a less experienced candidate with AI skills over a more experienced one without them.

Junior candidates may gain a new advantage: 77% of leaders believe early-in-career talent will be entrusted with greater responsibilities due to AI.

45% of US executives are not investing in AI tools or products for employees.

Globally, only 39% of workers using AI have received AI training from their company.

State govt has started preparing an island coastal regulation zone plan (ICRZP) to protect 13 islands in Goa.“State has issued a work order to the National Centre for Earth Science Studies (NCESS), Thiruvananthapuram, to prepare the ICRZP, 2019, for the 13 islands. Of these 13, one island, Conco, located in Canacona taluka, is less than 10 hectares in size,” state govt said.The chief secretary said that steps have been taken to ensure that no developmental activities will be carried out on the islands that would be detrimental to their existence.“The state of Goa is in active consultation with Deltares, a Netherlands-based company, along with the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), for beach nourishment in the state,” the chief secretary said.He also said that Goa has taken elaborate steps to protect the coastal ecology.By the end of this month, state govt is likely to receive the coastal zone management plan (CZMP) 2011 maps in a 1:4000 scale, after which it will start preparing the CZMP 2019 for Goa.The chief secretary, in an affidavit filed before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), stated that it has already started doing preliminary works for field mapping, verification of morphology/ecosystem, and land use, for the CZMP 2019.The state said that concurrently, the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai, has been given a work order to prepare shoreline change maps. The chief secretary said that the NCSCM has informed the state that by May 30, the updated CZMP in the scale of 1:25,000 and 1:4,000 would be provided.After initial reluctance, the NCSCM agreed to generate the CZMP 2011 maps in a 1:4,000 scale and pave the way for finalisation of CZMP 2019 for the state. State govt had removed the discrepancies in the 2011 CZMP maps and submitted them to the NCSCM, to carry out corrections in the plan to finalise the CZMP for 2019.The NCSCM had said that they were required to revise the corresponding CZMP maps in a 1:25,000 scale, and submit the revised draft CZMP maps in a 1:25,000 scale (not 1:4,000) to the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority ( GCZMA ).After a meeting of the minister with NCSCM representatives, the Chennai-based centre agreed to generate the maps in a 1:4,000 scale.","State govt has started preparing an island coastal regulation zone plan (ICRZP) to protect 13 islands in Goa.

BENGALURU: Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is facing significant challenges in collecting property taxes from some of the city’s most prestigious institutions, hotels, developers, educational institutions, charitable trusts, and malls.As of May 18, nearly 3.63 lakh properties owe Rs 711.1 crore in taxes. Bommanahalli tops the list with 57,043 properties owing Rs 95 crore, followed by Rajarajeshwari Nagar with 55,073 properties owing Rs 54.31 crore.Additionally, 1,66,557 properties are supposed to pay a difference amount of Rs 231.77 crore.“We are sending daily SMS messages and making IVR-based calls to these defaulters and revision cases. But they are not paying their tax arrears. We will start special enforcement for recovery as per law soon,” said Munish Moudgil, special commissioner BBMP (revenue), told TOI.This is not the first time BBMP has made such a list public, yet many of these defaulters continue to evade tax payments. Property tax is a crucial revenue source for the BBMP, and some properties have had tax arrears for decades, posing a persistent challenge for the revenue department.The BBMP relies heavily on property tax collections to fund essential civic services, infrastructure projects, and urban development initiatives. However, the reluctance of high-profile defaulters to clear their dues is undermining these efforts.Many of the defaulters on the BBMP’s list have consistently ignored multiple notices over the years. Despite efforts by BBMP officials to enforce compliance, including issuing notices, sealing properties, confiscating inheritances and immovable property, and even seizing bank accounts, many property owners remain indifferent to their tax obligations.Zone wise details of property tax defaulters (source: BBMP)The bureaucratic process involved in these enforcement actions can be slow and cumbersome, further complicating the BBMP’s efforts to recover dues. “Whenever we send notices to the defaulters, they bring a stay from the courts, forcing us to tie our hands. What is the point of having a revenue cell that cannot function optimally due to the stays?” said Moudgil. “Thus, we have introduced the OTS, a time settlement scheme, hoping many might pay up,” he added.“The scheme offers a 5% discount on payments made within an extended period. However, compliance remains disappointingly low, with many property owners unwilling to settle their dues even with this incentive,” Moudgil noted.Repeated notices have been issued to delinquent property owners with unpaid taxes. For those who continue to ignore these notices, Form 13 has been issued, initiating the process of recording BBMP’s claim in the records of the Deputy Registrar’s office.This legal step is intended to create a lien on the property, making it difficult for owners to sell or transfer their properties without clearing the outstanding taxes.“We have publicly released the list of top defaulters to increase transparency and accountability. By naming and shaming the defaulters, the BBMP hopes to pressure them into paying their dues. However, this approach has had limited success in the past, and it remains to be seen whether it will be more effective this time around,” Moudgil added.","As of May 18, nearly 3.63 lakh properties owe Rs 711.1 crore in taxes. Bommanahalli tops the list with 57,043 properties owing Rs 95 crore, followed by Rajarajeshwari Nagar with 55,073 properties owing £54.31 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110237291,imgsize-769916,width-400,resizemode-4/110237291.jpg"

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

NEW DELHI: British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty , have climbed the ranks in the prestigious ' Sunday Times Rich List ' for 2024, propelled by Murty's lucrative shareholding in Infosys .Ranked 245th with an estimated wealth of GBP 651 million, the couple has seen a significant rise from their position last year, owing largely to Murty's considerable earnings from Infosys dividends.Murty's dividends over the past year are estimated at GBP 13 million, dwarfing Sunak's earnings of GBP 2.2 million in the same period.The bulk of the couple's wealth stems from Murty's shareholding in Infosys, the Bangalore-based IT giant co-founded by her father, Narayan Murthy. The value of these shares surged by GBP 108.8 million in the past year alone, reaching nearly GBP 590 million.The 'Sunday Times Rich List' also sees the Indian-origin Hinduja family maintain their top position, with their wealth hitting GBP 37.196 billion, largely attributed to the success of their diverse business ventures, including the recent opening of the OWO Hotel in London.Among the top 10 richest individuals in the UK are India-born brothers David and Simon Reuben, who rose to third place with an estimated fortune of GBP 24.977 billion.Other notable Indian-origin billionaires featured include steel magnate Lakshmi N Mittal and industrialist Anil Agarwal, among others.Despite the overall decrease in the number of billionaires in Britain, musician Sir Paul McCartney stands out as the first UK musician to achieve billionaire status, following a significant boost in his wealth over the past year.The 36th edition of the 'Sunday Times Rich List' reflects a changing landscape of wealth in Britain, with shifts in fortunes and a notable decrease in the number of billionaires, indicating a potential shift in the country's economic dynamics.","British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, have climbed the ranks in the prestigious'Sunday Times Rich List'for 2024.

Here's how Robert F Kennedy Jr could make the first debate stage under stringent Biden-Trump rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/heres-how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-could-make-the-first-debate-stage-under-stringent-biden-trump-rules/articleshow/110224101.cms,"PHOENIX: Robert F Kennedy Jr has long argued that the biggest hurdle of his presidential campaign is the perception that independent candidates can't win. He has looked to the debates as a singular opportunity to stand alongside Joe Biden and Donald Trump in front of a massive audience.But to make the first debate stage, he'll have to secure a place on the ballot in at least a dozen more states and improve his showing in national polls in one month.With a famous name and a loyal base, Kennedy has the potential to do better than any third-party presidential candidate since Ross Perot in the 1990s. Both the Biden and Trump campaigns, who fear he could play spoiler, bypassed the nonpartisan debate commission and agreed to a schedule that leaves Kennedy very little time to qualify for the first debate.Publicly, Kennedy is expressing confidence that he will make the stage.""I look forward to holding Presidents Biden and Trump accountable for their records in Atlanta on June 27 to give Americans the debate they deserve,"" he posted on the X platform.CNN has said candidates will be invited if they've secured a place on the ballot in states with at least 270 votes in the Electoral College , the minimum needed to win the presidency, and have to hit 15% in four reliable polls published since March 13. The criteria mirror those used by the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan group that has organized debates since 1988, except the commission's first debate would have been in September, giving Kennedy more time.Kennedy doesn't appear to have met the polling criteria yet, although he has reached 15% or higher in at least two polls meeting CNN's standards.The ballot access hurdle is even tougher.State officials have confirmed Kennedy's place on the ballot in Delaware, Oklahoma, and Utah, which have just 16 electoral votes. In California, Hawaii, and Michigan, minor parties have selected Kennedy as their nominee, in effect offering up existing ballot lines, though the states have not formally affirmed Kennedy's position. Adding them would bring Kennedy's total to 89 electoral votes, though it's unclear that his position in those states would meet CNN's criteria.Kennedy's campaign says he has collected enough signatures in Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas, states with 112 electoral votes in total. However, he has either failed to submit the signatures or they are yet to be verified by state election officials.Those states still only add up to 201 electoral votes.Independent candidates like Kennedy face a labyrinth of laws that vary wildly from state to state but generally require hundreds or thousands of signatures and compliance with strict deadlines.The patchwork of laws is littered with pitfalls. The Democratic National Committee has pledged to scrutinize Kennedy's submissions for mistakes that could keep him off the ballot or at least tie up his campaign's time and money.Kennedy, in turn, has resorted to secrecy and creative tactics in a sort of cat-and-mouse game to get on the ballot before his critics can thwart him. In California, Delaware, and Michigan, Kennedy allied with less-known existing parties and received their nominations. He formed his political party in Hawaii to nominate himself and pursued a similar strategy in Mississippi and North Carolina.Elsewhere, he's waiting to turn in signatures until the deadline to limit the time for critics to pore over them in search of errors. Getting on the debate stage next month would almost certainly require him to change his strategy and submit the petitions he's sitting on as soon as possible.Signatures are due in New York by May 28, which would get Kennedy 28 votes closer if they're affirmed in time. He could then try to make an all-out push in a bunch of states with relatively easy requirements many require 5,000 or fewer signatures, but they generally don't bring many electoral votes - or focus on bigger states, such as Illinois with 19 electoral votes or Florida with 30.Further complicating matters, some states aren't yet accepting filings from potential independent candidates and won't before the first debate.Kennedy's vice presidential nominee, Nicole Shanahan, who is divorced from Google co-founder Sergei Brin, committed $8 million from her personal fortune for ballot access, the campaign announced Thursday, declaring their $15 million effort ""fully funded.""","Kennedy's campaign says he has collected enough signatures in Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.

Korean War veteran finally awarded Purple Heart after 73 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/korean-war-veteran-finally-awarded-purple-heart-after-73-years/articleshow/110223638.cms,"ST. PETER: After 73 years and a long fight with the US Army , a Korean War veteran from Minnesota who was wounded in combat finally got his Purple Heart medal on Friday.The Army notified Earl Meyer, 96, of St. Peter, last month that it had granted him a Purple Heart, which honors service members wounded or killed in combat. Meyer, who still has shrapnel in his thigh that continues to cause him occasional pain, had the medal pinned to his chest at a ceremony at Gustavus Adolphus College in St.Peter.Afterward, Meyer recalled being at an earlier ceremony for veterans when Purple Heart honorees were asked to rise so they could be honored. Now, said Meyer, ""I can stand up with them guys.""Understated and quick to deflect praise, he added: ""It is nice. No doubt about that.""An Army review board had rejected Meyer's application several times due to a lack of paperwork, but it reversed course after a campaign by his three daughters and their attorney. US Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also intervened on his behalf along with the service's top noncommissioned officer, the sergeant major of the Army. A federal judge ordered the review board to take another look.Meyer's case showcases the challenges for wounded veterans to get medals they've earned when the fog of war, the absence of records and the passage of time make it challenging to produce proof.Klobuchar presented Meyer a certificate after the medal was pinned, while one of her former aides who worked on the case sang the national anthem.""Our safety is what Earl fought for. Minnesota, our country and our world are better because of you, Earl,"" Klobuchar told the crowd. ""Thank you. And congratulations. Finally.""Meyer's daughter, Sandy Baker, of New Buffalo, Michigan, described combat veterans like her father, who is known to friends as ""Sonny,"" as ""a different breed"" and said he was reluctant to push for the recognition. She said he ultimately became convinced his effort would help other soldiers win overdue recognition.""He's excited and he's very honored. Incredibly honored. But he said at coffee this morning, 'I don't know why we're making such a big deal out of this,'"" she said.Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael Weimer wasn't able to attend, but he sent a latter of gratitude for Meyer's ""selfless service and dedication."" And in a handwritten addition at the bottom of the letter Weimer said: ""Thank you for not giving up on us! Long overdue!""Weimer sent Command Sgt. Major Jason Ross, from the Army National Guard, in his place. He described the grueling fighting that Meyer endured.""He saw his close friends wounded, killed in action, and he engaged in continuous, sustained combat with the enemy and in wartime conditions for several days,"" Ross said. ""He believed and understood he could actually die in combat.""Few men in Meyer's unit who witnessed the mortar attack in 1951 survived. Only a few members of his platoon made it out unharmed. He didn't even realize at first that he had been wounded. He said he thinks the medic who treated him on the battlefield was killed before he could file the paperwork. And he wasn't thinking then about a medal anyway - he just wanted to survive.When the Army denied Meyer's first applications for the medal, it said his documentation was insufficient. It had been burned in a fire, said Baker, who is Meyer's daughter.Klobuchar's office helped the family obtain additional documents and an Army review board finally concluded last month that the new evidence ""establishes beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was wounded in action in early June 1951.""The board cited records from the Department of Veterans Affairs, where doctors concluded the shrapnel in his thigh had to be from a combat injury. The board also cited a recent memo from Weimer, who said he believed Meyer's account was accurate, and that his medal request deserved another review.Meyer's American Legion coffee buddy, Dave Johnson, who delivered the prayer, described Meyer as ""more than humble."" He said Meyer's tends to downplay it and say, ""Oh, this happened. I was part of this, and I guess I still have shrapnel in me.""But Johnson said it is important for the rest of the community to remember.""People have to recognize what it takes to have a country like this, and it takes people like Sonny and his efforts, what he's accomplished and what he did on those particular days. Very few people have that opportunity to say, 'I did this for our country.'""","Earl Meyer, 96, of St. Peter, Minnesota, was wounded in combat in 1951.

The combined value of these properties is around $11 billion.“Dubai Unlocked”, an investigative project by over 70 media outlets around the globe, has revealed ownership of hundreds of properties of prominent global figures, including corrupt politicians,money launderers and drug lords, in Dubai.The data covers records of residential properties from 2020 till 2022.Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaksowning 23,000 properties in Dubaiare President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly, former PM Nawaz Sharif’s son Hussain Nawaz, home (interior) minister Mohsin Naqvi’s wife, and several national and provincial lawmakers.While Zardari’s elder daughter, Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari, is a Dubai resident, his son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and daughter, Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, were listed as owners of four properties. Through her lawyers, Aseefa said that all assets owned by her in Dubai have been duly declared to the relevant authorities in Pakistan, including the electoral watchdog.The Pakistani list also features the late former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, former PM Shaukat Aziz, ex-army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa’s son, and more than a dozen retired army generals as well as a police chief, an ambassador and a scientist, all of whom owned properties either directly or through their spouses and children.The Altaf Khanani network, which was sanctioned by the US for involvement in money laundering, has also surfaced in the leaks. Moving illicit funds for organised crime groups, including drug cartels and violent terrorist organisations, the network raked in an estimated turnover of between $14 billion and $16 billion annually. Altaf Khanani, the international face of the organisation, was ultimately convicted and spent nearly six years in a US prison; he was blacklisted by the US on money-laundering charges along with his son, Obaid Khanani, and nephew, Hozaifa Khanani. In Dubai, a country where, reportedly, investing in real estate with bags of cash raises few questions, the Khananis are listed owners of a massive real estate portfolio. Obaid himself is linked to around 30 properties, while the family as a whole were listed owners of 85 properties in early 2020, including around a dozen villas.Notably, several Pakistani families involved in politics and business were absent from the data, despite it being well known that they have bases and family residences in Dubai. This underscores that although the data is solid, it is neither a historical record of property ownership nor a comprehensive representation of all properties purchased by Pakistanis in Dubai . Many owners, according to data, still remain undetected, especially those who purchased property via a third party, or lesser-known company.","Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaks are President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly.

Also, the spices banned in these countries are less than one per cent of India's total spice exports .Meanwhile, the Spice Board of India has taken steps to ensure the safety and quality of Indian spice exports to these regions.The board has implemented the recommendations of the Techno-Scientific Committee, which conducted the root cause analysis, inspected processing facilities, and collected samples for testing in accredited labs.The Spice Board of India also organized a stakeholder consultation involving over 130 exporters and associations, such as the All India Spices Exporters Forum and the Indian Spice and Foodstuff Exporters' Association.The board has also issued the guidelines for the EtO treatment to all exporters. The spice board has taken these steps to prevent EtO contamination in spices exported from India.In April, the Hong Kong food safety watchdog banned four spice products of Indian brands MDH and Everest after they found they contained cancer-causing chemicals, ethylene oxide.The Centre for Food Safety of the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region announced on April 5 that routine surveillance programmes had uncovered the presence of ethylene oxide in three spices from MDH Group, Sambhar Masala Powder, and Curry Powder.","Nepal has banned the import, consumption and sale of two Indian spice brands Everest and MDH as it starts test for levels of ethylene oxide.

"India's technical assistance critically important, says Commonwealth chief",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/indias-technical-assistance-critically-important-says-commonwealth-chief/articleshow/110194123.cms,"LONDON: India's technical assistance is critically important to the Commonwealth, the Secretary General of the 56-member organisation said, asserting that it gives a huge amount of hope to many of the developing states to leapfrog the developmental challenges which have already been undertaken and surpassed by India.Patricia Scotland's remarks came as she hosted the 22nd Conference of Commonwealth Education Ministers meeting in London on the theme of “Driving Resilience, Equity, and Skills for an Inclusive Future”.Scotland welcomed India's willingness to share technological developments with the Commonwealth in an open-source way and hoped for greater commitment towards the organisation's educational goals .At the two-day meeting at the Commonwealth Secretariat Marlborough House headquarters in London which opened on Thursday, she called on ministers to help eliminate the barriers that impede access to education, harness technology and encourage lifelong learning.“India has made it clear that she is willing to share her technological developments with her Commonwealth family and share it in an open-source way,” said Scotland.“For many of the developing states that gives a huge amount of hope because that technological development enables them to leapfrog the developmental challenges which have already been undertaken and surpassed by India… I would like to thank the Indian government for what they have shared with us so far and I would like to be able to be confident that we can rely on the contributions financially and otherwise made by India going forward,” she said.Describing the Commonwealth representing one-third of the world as a “petri dish” for sustainable development models, Scotland said she looked forward to India's “re-instatement of significant support for our programmes, hopefully not just in kind but in a financial manifestation”.The keynote address at the conference was delivered by social reformer and Nobel Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi, who highlighted India's huge leap in the field of education in the last 15-20 years and proposed “compassionate intelligence” as a guiding force to achieve equitable educational outcomes for children across the Commonwealth.“Compassionate intelligence is selfless, genuine problem-solving. The disconnect between the problem solvers and problem sufferers is a serious question mark. Education ministers and the education sector can play a leadership role in ensuring that our children can develop compassionate intelligence and mitigate growing divides and discriminatory practices,” he said.At the education conference which concludes on Friday, officials will exchange ideas about tackling uncertainties in education financing, explore partnerships, and discuss commitments and reforms. They will assess the current state of the education sector while creating a roadmap for accelerated progress towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 4 of equitable and quality education. The newly formed Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) led Commonwealth Higher Education Taskforce will advance the outcomes of its recent dialogues to feed into the meeting.ACU Secretary-General Professor Colin Riordan said: “Ensuring inclusive, quality higher education for all will require collaboration amongst partners, institutions and governments that transcends national borders.“Universities are at the forefront of driving solutions to some of the most pressing global challenges that define our time, through their pathbreaking research, teaching, and community engagement.""During the meeting, the Secretary-General will also update delegates on the various initiatives and work programmes the Commonwealth Secretariat implements to support member countries, including the Commonwealth AI Academy offering free and equitable access to transformative technology and artificial intelligence resources for all citizens of the 56 member countries.","Patricia Scotland welcomed India's willingness to share technological developments with the Commonwealth in an open-source way.

‘Like he’s bathing in blood’: King Charles portrait speaks diverse reactions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/like-hes-bathing-in-blood-king-charles-portrait-speaks-diverse-reactions/articleshow/110176539.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: A newly unveiled portrait of King Charles III has drawn vivid and varied reactions, with some viewers suggesting the depiction looks as though ""he’s bathing in blood."" The large-scale painting , measuring 2.6 by 2 meters, was commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Drapers and will be displayed in the Drapers’ Hall gallery in downtown London .The portrait, created by a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery who has previously painted prominent royal figures, including Queen Camilla and the late Prince Philip, reflects a more controversial image of the monarch. The artist, Jonathan Yeo, mentioned that King Charles participated actively in the portrait's conceptual phase, even suggesting the inclusion of a butterfly on his shoulder to symbolize his environmental advocacy and his transformative journey to the throne, a South China Morning Post report said.""Much like the butterfly I've painted hovering over his shoulder, this portrait has evolved as the subject's role in our public life has transformed,"" Yeo, 53, who has previously painted Charles' late father Prince Philip, said in a statement.""My aim was also to make reference to the traditions of Royal portraiture but in a way that reflects a 21st Century Monarchy and, above all else, to communicate the subject's deep humanity.""Despite King Charles's involvement, he was ""initially surprised by the strong color,"" Yeo revealed to the BBC. When the portrait was unveiled, the king appeared to react sharply to the vivid portrayal. The piece has also stirred online discussions, drawing references to the royal family’s controversial historical actions and personal scandals.Some social media users drew humorous comparisons to the ""Ghostbusters"" villain, Vigo the Carpathian. Critical comments on platforms like Instagram included descriptions of the portrait as making Charles appear ""like he's in hell"" or ""bathing in blood.""Queen Camilla, however, had a positive view of the portrayal, reportedly saying, “Yes, you’ve got him,” upon seeing the painting for the first time.The portrait was commissioned to celebrate Charles' 50 years as a member of the Drapers’ Company, which was set up more than 600 years ago as a trade association for wool merchants.Philanthropy came to be part of their mission and the company is now a grant-giving body.","A portrait of King Charles III has been unveiled in London.

Gujarati careworkers face destitution and deportation in Britain after being scammed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/gujarati-careworkers-face-destitution-and-deportation-in-britain-after-being-scammed/articleshow/110156647.cms,"LONDON: Thousands of Indians who came to the UK on care worker visas are in destitute condition, with some facing deportation , after finding the company they were meant to be working for does not exist.The National Council of Gujarati Organisations (UK), or NCGO , is representing five cases but says there are thousands more with many too scared to come forward.It says these migrants paid huge fees to agents in India to find the care company that sponsored their visa does not exist or has no work. It has requested a meeting with UK home secretary James Cleverly.Kanti Nagda, adviser to NCGO, said: “A number of them are Gujaratis. We are getting lots of complaints that they come here and there is no work. They go, sit in the office, wait for the employer to arrive. The employers are using serviced office desks so they hardly are there, and when they do turn up they say: ‘We will let you know’. And they never get a response. They are left with no jobs and no money and are crying in front of us. Someare getting deportation notices. Around a month ago people started coming to us and we realised this is a grave problem. These people have not committed any crime and are being deported.”The NCGO estimates around 2,500 Indians, of which 1,300 are Gujarati, are affected.Those who have received deportation notices have been told if they can find a job in a similar field with a new employer who holds a licence in 60 days, they can stay. But Nagda said hardly any managed this as “there aren’t that many jobs”.The five from Gujarat are men and women, aged 22 and 40, who came in the last six months to work in the care system and ended up with bogus employers who don’t have work — in London, Oxford and Bristol. They paid agents in Gujarat from Rs 12 lakh to Rs 18 lakh to get the work permit. Two of the five have received deportation notices as their sponsors have been stripped of their licences by the home office.“Their families have complained to the agents in India and they say, ‘We promised to send you to the UK, you are in the UK’,” Nagda said.They are borrowing money from friends and family to survive. If they take a job in another field, it would be illegal and they cannot claim state benefits, he said.Indians are the largest cohort coming to the UK on care visas. A report by the independent chief inspector of borders published in March exposed how 275 certificates of sponsorship were granted to a care home which did not exist and 1,234 certificates were granted to a company that only had four employees.",The National Council of Gujarati Organisations (UK) is representing five cases.
