Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection. Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group. This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-83513103,imgsize-129222,width-400,resizemode-4/83513103.jpg"

Mami Mizutori

tells

Pradeep Thakur

Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people. Excerpts from the interview:

The

estimates 150 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty in 2021 due to Covid-19. How can India minimise the impact?

The US and some other countries reserved enough shots for their citizens. Should India have done the same?

How much success has the UN’s Covax programme achieved?

The second wave of Covid-19 has caused more deaths in India. Where did it go wrong?

Your idea of a ‘global response for future pandemics’ and vaccine distribution?

With Covid disruptions, can countries like India meet the UN’s

target?

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the people and government of India on the tragic loss of life that is taking place across the country.All major disasters which affect low- and middle-income countries result in economic losses on a scale which has a damaging effect on their ability to eradicate poverty and meet other basic needs, including health services and access to education. In the case of Covid-19, we have seen how it has pushed millions into extreme poverty globally, and has contributed to rising levels of hunger in many parts of the world where the informal economy that poor people depend on has been decimated. For all member states, the eradication of poverty cannot be achieved without reducing disaster risk and improved prevention as nothing undermines development like disasters.Much of the world looks to India for vaccine supply but the pharmaceutical supply chain is very complex and specialised to a degree that serving a population the size of India’s was always going to be a gargantuan task. The numbers already vaccinated in India are enormous but manufacturing enough doses to reach over one billion people will take time.The Covax facility portfolio, administered by Gavi, currently consists of agreements related to eight vaccines, including those developed with the Serum Institute of India . Coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO, Covax is making steady progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high risk and vulnerable people, as well as frontline healthcare workers.Covid-19 demonstrates the systemic nature of disaster risk, how a biological hazard can ravage all areas of life starting from public health to all socio-economic aspects of our societies. Unfortunately, many countries, including India, are learning the hard way that prevention requires more patience than previously thought and, in the case of biological hazards, a longer game plan. WHO has warned that when there are mass gatherings, more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low, this can create a perfect storm for the virus to spread in any country. India has done an admirable job in harnessing technology and communication to ensure effective early warning leads to early action in the case of cyclones. The challenge for the government now is to communicate effectively on the continued need for face masks, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings while at the same time rolling out an effective vaccination programme.If the global level of preparedness for this pandemic had matched the warnings, much of the impact could have been reduced. An adequate level of pandemic preparedness would have cost billions instead of the trillions that it is now costing. The loss of life and the economic disruption could have been significantly reduced if we had been adequately prepared from the moment biological hazards were included in the Sendai Framework in 2015. Given the transboundary nature of biological hazards it is obvious that a global response plan is required for future pandemics. A patchwork response is not working for Covid-19, and it will not work against any newly emerging diseases and viruses in the future. It is not acceptable that developing countries should have to wait so long for Covid vaccines. This inequality and lack of solidarity to access affordable vaccines only fuels the spread of the virus, allows the emergence of new variants and prolongs the pandemic. None of us is safe until we are all safe.It is clear that the death toll and economic loss from Covid-19 means that Sendai Framework targets on reducing mortality, numbers of disaster affected people and economic losses has suffered a great setback. However, we are still making significant progress on other targets. Asia and the Pacific are not on track to achieve any of the SDGs.","Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people.

Goa may relax JEE criteria for engineering seats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goa-may-relax-jee-criteria-for-engineering-seats/articleshow/111306792.cms,"'Admission to IT engg in 1st round'

PANAJI: On Wednesday, the first round of admissions to engineering degree programme seats in the five engineering colleges in Goa ended. Of the over 1,500 seats in the five colleges, around 400 were left vacant at the end of the first round. Following this, the directorate of technical education ( DTE ) is set to allow students, who had not appeared for the JEE, to apply for the vacant seats .A file with the proposal will be moved for the state's approval soon, sources said. The second round of admissions are expected to take place in mid-July.""For the second round, students who have not appeared for JEE will be able to apply for admissions, once state govt approves the proposal. They can seek admissions provided they meet all other criteria for admissions set by the All India Council for Technical Education ( AICTE ), like minimum score of 45% in physics-chemistry-mathematics (PCM) at their Class XII board exams for general students and 40% for those in reserved categories,"" said a source.For the first time in 2024 after around two decades, the criteria for admissions to engineering programme degree programmes in Goa was altered.The Goa Common Entrance Test ( GCET ) was retired and JEE was made the criteria to apply for engineering seats in Goa.""The GCET or the JEE score is only to draw the merit list. Eligibility criteria set by the AICTE is different like PCM score. So, if students meet the eligibility criteria, there is no harm in allowing them to apply for the vacant seats. This was the first time students were appearing for JEE for state seats and some may have not appeared due to feeling intimidated over appearing for the national test. So, the second round will be an opportunity for them,"" said the source.Officials said that, at the first round of admissions, students showed a preference for engineering programmes in the streams of information technology and of computer engineering, in keeping with the trend in recent years. The stream of mechanical engineering did not seem to find favour with students.""IT and computer engineering streams in all colleges are taken in the first round. As usual, almost all seats in the state-run Goa Engineering College at Farmagudi were filled, while most seats were vacant in the Shiroda-based Shree Rayeshwar Institute of Engineering and Information Technology (SRIEIT),"" said the official.","Of the over 1,500 seats in the five colleges, around 400 were left vacant at the end of the first round.

No help for Indian helps when 'dream' foreign job turns into a nightmare,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-help-for-indian-helps-when-dream-foreign-job-turns-into-a-nightmare/articleshow/111372151.cms,"Anjali from Ulhasnagar in Thane has quite a few stamps on her passport. Having worked in Dubai, Hong Kong and Muscat (where she was employed by a 'sheikh') as a domestic worker, she reels off the dos and don'ts. ""Do not give your phone to your employer. Remember, they need you more than you need them. Ensure that you are allowed to speak to your family every day.Clients will say they have spent lakhs on your visa, so they have a right to take away your passport but don't fall for that. Don't go for a lower salary, and don't fall for scammy agents,"" says the 35-year-old, who has drawn a salary of up to Rs 45,000 a month abroad and wants to go to London for her next job.Not everyone is as savvy. While the money is more than what they would get in India for a similar job, it's still nothing compared to what a local would be paid. Before that comes the hurdle of getting there. Many of them take loans to pay greedy agents who don't give them the proper paperwork. Without that, they are held hostage by employers who take their passports and withhold salaries. As the recent Hinduja case in which four members of the family were convicted for exploiting domestic staff at their luxury villa in Geneva showed, even wealthy NRI tycoons can behave that way and not just a sheikh in the Gulf. Besides other charges like confiscation of passports, low salaries and long hours, the lead prosecutor pointed out that the family's annual spend on their pet dog surpassed the salary they offered their house-help.In the Hinduja case, the domestic workers took a rare step and fought back against exploitation, but the case highlights a larger problem - that of India's lack of protective mechanisms for domestic workers at home and abroad. India has not ratified the ILO Domestic Workers Convention No 189, which requires signatory governments to protect the rights of domestic workers. ""India should negotiate stronger bilateral labour agreements with destination countries to ensure that domestic workers are granted legal protections, fair wages, and safe working conditions,"" says Karan S Thukral, a Delhi-based immigration lawyer. ""Implementing accessible and effective reporting mechanisms for workers who don't speak the local language to report abuse and exploitation is critical. These mechanisms should ensure confidentiality and protection against retaliation,"" he adds.Sister Josephine Amala Valarmathi, Tamil Nadu state coordinator at the non-profit National Domestic Workers' Movement, says people use loopholes to not formalise this labour. ""More often than not, domestic workers are taken abroad as 'relatives' to escape any formal work agreement or contracts.""That several 'nanny institutes' have sprouted across north India shows that there is a demand to cater to busy NRI couples who seek help with child and elderly care. These institutes teach aspirants, who must have studied till either class 10 or 12, the basics of nutrition, first aid, etiquette, child behavioural psychology, etc through six-month certificate courses. Sometimes they are even required to take IELTS exams as part of the course, after which they travel on special caregiver visas.The day the Hindujas were convicted, the Kerala government became the first in the country to announce plans for a legislation for safeguarding house-helps, with the draft laying out minimum wage, fixed hours, workplace security, rest time, and outlining responsibilities of the employer and private placement agencies. Sonia George, vice-president of SEWA, a union of informal workers, and an executive committee member of International Domestic Workers' Federation, points out that while this is a welcome step, it isn't applicable overseas. ""The draft emigration Bill proposed by the external affairs ministry in 2019 and revised in 2021 would have addressed the concerns of overseas Indian domestic workers had it seen the light of day. Post-pandemic international migration of domestic workers acquired through illegal recruitment agencies has gone up in Kerala. These agencies tap into the most marginalised sections, including workers from tribal communities, Dalits and fisherfolk,"" says George, adding that the urgency to pay off debts accrued during the pandemic has only increased the need to go work abroad.","Anjali from Ulhasnagar in Thane has worked in Dubai, Hong Kong and Muscat.

NEET-UG paper leak case: Principal's arrest stuns Hazaribag,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/principals-arrest-stuns-hazaribag/articleshow/111370581.cms,"HAZARIBAG: Arrest of principal of Hazaribag 's Oasis School , Ehsanul Haque , by CBI in NEET-UG paper leak case has left those who have known him since his days of struggle in shock and disbelief. Many of them find it hard to accept that the soft-spoken teacher, who built the reputation of Oasis as the city's premier school from scratch, could be involved in the paper leak.Haque, 42, once ran a coaching institute called 'Seed' on Pugmil Road in the city.In 2013, he was roped in to head the Oasis School, located on Mandai Road in Hazaribag district, at its inception by its owner and chairman, Shabbir Ahmad.He faced significant challenges, right from taking the school to new heights to securing a CBSE affiliation, but succeeded in both, making Oasis one of Hazaribag's most sought-after schools, thanks to its top-notch infrastructure and faculty.The school, which started with 100-odd students in 2013, now has over 4,000 students and over 40 teachers, and runs from a modern building with state-of-the-art facilities for academics and sports. The school got CBSE affiliations for classes X and XII in 2020.Sources said a total of 118 students appeared in class X board exams in 2012-2022, and the school had a 100% pass percentage, with 38 students securing marks above 85%. In 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, too, all students who appeared for class X and XII board examinations passed.The academic success of the school also established Haque, who holds PhD and BEd degrees, among the noted academicians in Hazaribag. After being appointed as CBSE coordinator, he became a prominent figure of the city and was often invited to various programmes organised by different schools, said one of his acquaintances. Haque, his friends revealed, comes from a humble background. His father, a former employee of Central Coalfields Limited, passed away recently. A bachelor, he takes care of his two younger brothers and their families, and a married sister. ""He always remained busy from morning to evening, with most of his time spent at the school,"" one of his friends said.The staff at Oasis School and his neighbours in the Hasmia colony are still in shock over his arrest on Friday. None in the school or the locality wished to speak anything on record on Saturday.""It's beyond my expectation as to why he did what he did. It's a tough time for his family,"" said one of the locals, who did not wish to be identified. Another person said, ""When the almighty gave him everything, right from the chair of a big school to the CBSE coordinator, what was the use of indulging in wrong activities?""","Ehsanul Haque, 42, once ran a coaching institute called 'Seed' in the city.

Additionally, an access road will be constructed providing direct connectivity from the west end of Bandra station to Western Express Highway.The rehabilitation project had been stalled since 2002 and locals, along with Khan, had approached courts, seeking permission to renew their agreements under the new slum scheme that offered them more benefits.The developer has been paying monthly rents to the eligible families for transit accommodation after they vacated their shanties.Earlier, the slumdwellers had locked horns with the authorities over their rehabilitation after receiving multiple demolition notices from BMC to allow it to undertake road widening.The slumdwellers had signed the agreement with the builder in 2002, but over the last two decades, govt has changed the eligibility criteria . After the residents approached courts—the issue went till SC—the builder accepted the demand to execute a fresh agreement as per the new rules.","The vacant plot will be used to build several towers to rehabilitate 1,400 eligible slum families.

Even in a land of temples, and more deities than even the most pious can name, a temple for the arch villain of India's greatest epic is unusual. But what really makes the Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala 's Kollam district a standout is an aspect of modernity - per govt records, the eldest Kaurav prince pays taxes.Local lore has it that the prince was tired and thirsty during his travels.Drinking water was scarce, but a woman of a so-called low caste offered him a drink of toddy. Duryodhan, who also famously elevated the supposedly low-born Karna to kingship, accepted happily, blessed the woman and her village, and gave them land. The temple for him was the village saying thank you. Ritual offerings here include a good measure of intoxicants.At the Peruviruthy Malanada temple, the daily offering of toddy to Duryodhan, who's not represented by an idol in the temple but by a polished mace, the Kaurav prince's weapon of choice. In Mahabharat , he's the man who hoots with delight as he orders Draupadi disrobed, the prince who plotted to steal the kingdom that rightfully belonged to the good guys - Pandavs. But in this village, he's a benign, protective deity. Villagers call him 'appoopa' (grandpa).That sharp departure from Mahabharat's narrative treatment of Duryodhan, the fact that there's no idol and the votive offering of toddy are similar to other non-Vedic practices in many southern temples. Villagers have a more interesting take on the toddy offering - a tipple keeps the deity in a mild and cheerful mood, they say.As for those taxes Duryodhan pays diligently, it will be wise to first point out that the tax is not on the temple's income - all temples are tax free in India. The levy is on the 15 acres of temple land at the Poruvazhy village surrounding the temple.""When the pattayam was issued for the temple, the land was registered in the deity's name. The thandaper (land deed) number and survey details show the land is owned by Duryodhan. Ever since taxes were introduced in Kerala, this land tax has been paid in Duryodhan's name,"" a local administrator said. Of the 15 acres of temple land, eight acres are paddy fields, the rest is forested land, said temple committee secretary Rajaneesh R.When in Puruvazhy, don't diss Duryodhan.","Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala's Kollam district is a standout.

No justification to charge toll if roads are in disrepair: Nitin Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justification-to-charge-toll-if-roads-are-in-disrepair-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/111267453.cms,"NEW DELHI: Echoing the sentiment of many highway commuters, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said there is no justification of highway agencies charging toll, if roads are not in good condition and people continue to face problems. He was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling, which will be rolled out across 5,000 km during this financial year.Known for not mincing his words, Gadkari said, “If you don’t provide good services, you should not charge toll...We are in a hurry to start tolling to collect user fees and protect our interest.When the condition of any road is not good I get numerous complaints and there are social media posts all over...You should collect the user fee where you provide the best quality road. If you collect toll on roads with potholes, mud, then there will be a backlash from people. We (political leaders) face people’s ire.”The minister said the field officers of NH agencies must be more sensitive towards the pain that people face waiting for long at toll plazas and there must be a mechanism for lodging grievances and their quick redressal.Though govt made the use of FASTag for paying toll on highways mandatory in 2021 for seamless travel through toll lanes and currently around 98% transactions are through these smart tags fixed on vehicles, there have been numerous reports of queues at plazas from across the country. In its bid to put an end to this, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on the roll out and expansion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based toll collection. This aims to remove toll gates from the NH network in the next few years.The highway authority proposes to roll this out in a phased manner, starting with only commercial vehicles and dedicating one lane on each side of toll plazas for them to pass without stopping. It’s mandatory for commercial vehicles to install vehicle tracker system (VTS), an on board unit, which is necessary for GNSS-based tolling.Govt plans to bring private vehicles under this tolling system at a subsequent phase.The road transport ministry has finalised a series of amendments in Central Motor Vehicle Rules and NH Fee Rules, which don’t need legislation, for roll out of the system. While vehicle owners will be incentivised to get a discount in toll charge for complying with their vehicles having OBUs for paying toll without stopping, there will be disincentives for those who don't opt for this.Gadkari said the system (GNSS)-based toll collection will add Rs 10,000 crore to govt’s toll revenue. “We need to put in place a transparent, qualitative and a leak proof system of GNSS-based toll collection in India to ensure no inconvenience to toll users,” he added. The GNSS-based toll collection is expected to enhance efficiency, bring down logistics cost and major relief for the highway users as they will have to pay only for the distance travelled.","Gadkari was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling.

She spoke quite positively about Vince McMahon, despite the creative differences between them.""I had a great relationship with him. Me and Bayley took over the pandemic era, and it felt like the relationship really, really grew, that he knew he could count on us and trust us.

There was something in my soul that said, 'You need to grow.' I wanted to be the CEO of my own life. There was a light source that came into my heart that day. 'You have to do what's right for you. What's happening right now at this moment is not right. You have to take your life in your hands and go make it happen. Go make your heart happy. Go let them know that what they're doing right now is wrong and show them.' I did. I had to let them know that I am the right one that you messed with that day, and now here I am today, one of the highest paid women in women's wrestling history.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
China's June factory activity contracts for second month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-june-factory-activity-contracts-for-second-month/articleshow/111374511.cms,"BEIJING: China's manufacturing contracted for a second month in June, an official factory survey showed on Sunday, keeping alive calls for further stimulus after a string of recent indicators showed the economy struggling to get back on its feet.The official purchasing managers' index (PMI), at 49.5 in June, was unchanged in May, below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and in line with a median forecast of 49.5 in a Reuters poll.The PMI, a sentiment-based indicator, tends to paint a gloomier picture of the world's second-biggest economy than hard data. However, disappointing May industrial output numbers suggest factory owners have some reasons to be worried.While China's exports exceeded forecasts in May, experts say the jury is still out on whether export sales are sustainable given growing trade tensions between Beijing and Western economies. Meanwhile, a protracted property crisis continues to drag on domestic demand.As consumers remained wary and the May holiday boost faded, the non-manufacturing PMI, which includes services and construction, fell to 50.5 from 51.1 in May, the lowest since December.Analysts expect China to roll out more policy support measures in the short term, while a government pledge to boost fiscal stimulus is seen helping kick domestic consumption into a higher gear.But high local-government debt and deflationary pressures cast a long shadow over recovery prospects, despite a slew of measures officials have rolled out since last October, tempering investors' and factory owners' expectations.Private sector investment grew 0.1% in January to May, down from 0.3% in the first four months alone, while the property investment slump worsened.China's central bank last month announced a relending programme for affordable housing to accelerate sales of unsold housing stock so supply better matches demand.Officials are under pressure to fire up new growth engines to reduce the economy's reliance on property.Premier Li Qiang told a World Economic Forum meeting on Tuesday that growth of new industries was supporting healthy economic development.""Since the beginning of this year, China's economy has maintained an upward trend... and is expected to continue to improve steadily over the second quarter,"" Li said.","The official purchasing managers' index (PMI), at 49.5 in June, was unchanged in May.

This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years, a Newsweek report said.Melania Trump's former friend, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff , weighed in on the evolving dynamics within the Trump family. Wolkoff, who has previously published a tell-all book about her time with the former first lady, described some of the recent claims about Melania and Ivanka's relationship as ""ridiculous."" Wolkoff's comments suggest that the public may not have the full picture of the intricate relationships within the Trump family.This development comes as Donald Trump faces various legal challenges, which have undoubtedly impacted the family's interactions. The former president's conviction in New York has led to increased media attention on his personal life, including his relationships with Melania and Ivanka.Historically, there have been reports of tension between Melania and Ivanka. Ivanka, who served as a senior advisor during Donald Trump's presidency, often took on a prominent role, leading to speculation about her influence and relationship with her stepmother. However, the current situation appears to show a thawing of relations between the two women, perhaps brought on by the pressures of their shared circumstances.Melania Trump has largely remained out of the public eye since leaving the White House, making few public statements and maintaining a low profile. Ivanka, on the other hand, has also stepped back from the political spotlight but continues to be a figure of interest due to her high-profile role during her father's administration.As the Trump family navigates these legal and personal challenges, the evolving relationships within the family continue to be a topic of public fascination. The reported improvement in Melania and Ivanka's relationship adds a new layer to the complex narrative of the Trump family's public and private lives.","A source close to the family noted that ""Melania and Ivanka are rumored to be getting along better since Donald Trump was convicted in New York"" This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111292941,imgsize-10050,width-400,resizemode-4/111292941.jpg"

This figure is approximately 30 per cent lower than the 73 million people who tuned in to watch the candidates' initial debate in 2020, making it one of the three lowest-rated first presidential debates since 1976.The comparatively low viewership could suggest a lack of voter enthusiasm for both candidates, although it does not fully account for the growing popularity of online viewing as traditional TV audiences continue to decline.Media experts were interested in observing how CNN 's new format would unfold and whether it could serve as a model for future debates.Three media experts agreed that the format's restrictions, including the ability to mute the candidates' microphones, should be adopted by other networks as they helped maintain a level of discipline.CNN, which held exclusive rights to host the debate, provided candidates with two minutes for each answer and one minute for rebuttals, muting their microphones if they exceeded the allotted time.The studio had no audience, and moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper did not fact-check the candidates in real-time.Despite criticism from some media commentators about the lack of real-time fact-checking, which allowed both candidates to make false claims, CNN defended its approach. ""The role of the moderators is to present the candidates with questions that are important to American voters and to facilitate a debate, enabling candidates to make their case and challenge their opponent,"" a CNN spokesperson said.During the debate, Biden's performance was shaky and hesitant, while Trump made numerous exaggerated or false claims that largely went unchallenged by his opponent.Frank Sesno, a professor at the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University and a former CNN journalist, remarked, ""Without having an audience, you got a sense of who these guys are and what they are.""

After the incident the plane continued safely to Baltimore, Southwest said.Several other incidents involving Southwest flights in recent months have raised concerns.Last week, the FAA said it was investigating a Southwest flight that descended to a low altitude of around 500 feet (152.4 m) about 9 miles (14.5 km) from the Oklahoma City airport.After the automated Minimum Safe Altitude Warning sounded, an air traffic controller alerted the flight crew of Southwest Airlines Flight 4069, which had departed from Las Vegas.Earlier this month, the FAA and NTSB said they were investigating a May 25 Southwest flight of a Boeing 737 MAX. The NTSB said the plane experienced a ""Dutch roll"" at 34,000 feet while en route from Phoenix, to Oakland, California. Such lateral asymmetric movements are named after a Dutch ice-skating technique and can pose serious safety risks.The FAA said this month it was also investigating a Southwest 737 MAX 8 flight in April that came within about 400 feet of the ocean off the coast of Hawaii after bad weather conditions prompted pilots to bypass a landing attempt at Lihue airport.During the go-around, the first officer ""inadvertently pushed forward on the control column while following thrust lever movement commanded by the autothrottle,"" according to a June 7 airline memo, and the plane began to descend rapidly, hitting a maximum descent rate of about 4,400 feet per minute.The pilots in a post-debrief said seeing the severity of the flight ""through the animations was a significant, emotional event,"" Southwest said, adding the incident prompted the airline to review data and trends related to its procedures, training, standards, and performance.","Southwest Flight 4805 departed from a temporarily closed runway in Maine earlier this week.

The National Assembly of Pakistan approved the government's finance bill for the upcoming fiscal year on Friday, which includes significant tax increases, the bill was passed ahead of further negotiations with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) regarding a new bailout package, as the country seeks to prevent a debt default amidst the slowest economic growth in South Asia.Despite facing strong opposition from rival political parties, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented the tax-heavy budget in parliament, which was subsequently endorsed by the ruling alliance under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq announced the bill's passage during a live television broadcast.The government has set an ambitious tax revenue target of 13 trillion rupees ($46.66 billion) for the fiscal year beginning July 1, representing a nearly 40% increase from the current year. This target was outlined in the national budget presented on July 12, which aimed to bolster Pakistan's case for a new IMF rescue package, with the country currently in discussions for a loan ranging from $6 billion to $8 billion.The tax increases include a 48% rise in direct taxes and a 35% increase in indirect taxes compared to the revised estimates for the current year. Non-tax revenue, such as petroleum levies, is expected to surge by an astonishing 64%. Textile and leather products, as well as mobile phones, will face an 18% tax, and there will be an increase in the tax on capital gains from real estate transactions. Workers will also be subject to higher direct taxes on their income.Pakistan has forecasted a significant reduction in its fiscal deficit for the new financial year, aiming for 5.9% of gross domestic product (GDP), down from an upwardly revised estimate of 7.4% for the current year. However, the central bank has cautioned about the potential inflationary impact of the budget, noting that limited progress in structural reforms to expand the tax base means that increased revenue must come from tax hikes. The country has set a growth target of 3.6% for the upcoming year, with inflation projected at 12%.",The National Assembly of Pakistan approved the government's finance bill for the upcoming fiscal year on Friday.

Pak government's borrowings exceed two previous fiscal years combined,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-governments-borrowings-exceed-two-previous-fiscal-years-combined/articleshow/111251833.cms,"KARACHI: In a fiscal year marred by unprecedented borrowing and soaring debt servicing costs, the Pakistani government faces substantial financial challenges as it navigates through economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures, Dawn reported.""The government's borrowings in the first 11 months of the outgoing fiscal year have exceeded the combined figure of the two preceding fiscal years,"" revealed economic data, emphasising the magnitude of financial commitments.This hefty borrowing, amounting to PKR 7.39 trillion from July 2023 to June 7, 2024, surpasses the government's collective borrowings of PKR 7.16 trillion in the previous two fiscal years (FY23 and FY22).Bankers speculate that total borrowings for FY24 could reach PKR 8 trillion by June 30, driven by high spending necessitated by slashed development budgets in favour of meeting other expenses.The impact of this extensive borrowing is profound, constraining the government's ability to allocate funds towards critical development projects. Instead, a significant portion of tax revenues is earmarked for debt servicing, a trend expected to escalate in the upcoming fiscal year, as reported by Dawn.""The government would spend PKR 7.21 trillion on domestic debt servicing and an additional PKR 1.04 trillion on foreign debt servicing, taking the total to PKR 8.25 trillion,"" according to the budget document for FY2023-24. This figure is set to rise further in FY25, with allocations totalling PKR 9.77 trillion for debt servicing alone.Amid projections of increased revenue generation, economic experts remain skeptical about achieving ambitious tax collection targets. ""Economy experts believe that the government will not achieve the PKR 12.97 trillion tax collection target set for FY25,"" citing concerns over past targets being missed, including the PKR 9.41 trillion target for FY24.Critically, the high interest rates, recently reduced but still hovering around 20.5 per cent, have polarized opinions within the business community. ""The business community also finds this rate high and is demanding that it be brought down close to the inflation rate,"" as inflation levels stood at 11.8 per cent in May, prompting calls for interest rates to be lowered to 13-14 per cent.""This excessive borrowing practically makes it impossible for the government to spend money on development projects,"" lamented a banker, highlighting the imbalance between public sector investments and private sector participation, Dawn reported.","Pakistani government faces substantial financial challenges as it navigates through economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures.

Melting ice due to climate change unmasks Everest's hidden tragedies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/melting-ice-due-to-climate-change-unmasks-everests-hidden-tragedies/articleshow/111302957.cms,"The sacred slopes of Mount Everest are witnessing the effects of climate change as the snow and ice cover thins, exposing the bodies of hundreds of mountaineers who lost their lives pursuing their dream of reaching the world's highest peak. This year, a team of climbers and military personnel embarked on a mission not to summit the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) mountain, but to retrieve some of the corpses, risking their own lives in the process.As part of Nepal's mountain clean-up campaign on Everest, Lhotse, and Nuptse, the team successfully recovered five frozen bodies, including one that was reduced to skeletal remains.The task was arduous, dangerous, and emotionally challenging.Rescuers spent hours chipping away at the ice with axes and sometimes using boiling water to release the bodies from the frozen grip. Major Aditya Karki, who led the team, said, ""Because of the effects of global warming , (the bodies and trash) are becoming more visible as the snow cover thins.""Over 300 people have died on Everest since expeditions began in the 1920s, with eight fatalities in this season alone. Many bodies remain on the mountain, some hidden by snow or lost in deep crevasses, while others have become landmarks along the route to the summit, earning nicknames such as ""Green Boots"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"".The presence of these bodies can have a psychological impact on climbers, as they believe they are entering a sacred space.Retrieving bodies from the ""death zone,"" where thin air and low oxygen levels increase the risk of altitude sickness, is a controversial and challenging task. It requires significant financial resources, with each body requiring up to eight rescuers and weighing over 100 kilograms (220 pounds).However, Major Karki emphasised the necessity of the rescue effort, saying, ""We have to bring them back as much as possible. If we keep leaving them behind, our mountains will turn into a graveyard.""The retrieved bodies, once brought down from the mountain, are transported to Kathmandu. Two of the bodies have been preliminarily identified, and authorities are awaiting detailed tests for final confirmation. Those that remain unidentified will likely be cremated.Despite the recovery efforts, the mountain still holds its secrets. The body of British climber George Mallory, who went missing during a 1924 summit attempt, was only discovered in 1999. His climbing partner, Andrew Irvine, and their camera, which could provide evidence of a successful summit and rewrite mountaineering history, have never been found.In addition to the body retrieval mission, the clean-up campaign, with a budget of over $600,000, employed 171 Nepali guides and porters to remove 11 tonnes of rubbish from the mountain.The well-trodden route to the summit is littered with fluorescent tents, discarded climbing equipment, empty gas canisters, and even human excreta. While current expeditions are under pressure to remove their waste, historic rubbish remains a challenge.As Tshiring Jangbu Sherpa, who led the body retrieval expedition, said, ""The mountains have given us mountaineers so many opportunities. I feel that we have to give back to them, we have to remove the trash and bodies to clean the mountains.""","Mount Everest is witnessing the effects of climate change as the snow and ice cover thins.

As per the record from the home ministry, landslides have claimed 14 lives followed by 13 deaths due to the lightning in the same period of time.Nepal has a high mortality rate due to landslides and flooding during monsoons on an annual basis, because of the terrain and unplanned urbanization as well as settlement in the slopes prone to landslides.The monsoon season in the Himalayan nation usually starts on June 13 and ends on September 23. Last year, it began on June 14, which was one day later than the usual start date.Nepal is expecting the monsoon to formally arrive on June 13 and will remain active for approximately three months. Over time, the government has estimated that up to 1.8 million people could be affected by rain-related incidents during the season.According to a statement by the 28th Session of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum released on April 29, above-normal rainfall is expected during the monsoon season over most parts of South Asia. However, some areas over northern, eastern, and northeastern parts of the region may experience below-normal rainfall.Landslides triggered by heavy rains in Nepal cause extreme damage to life, property, infrastructure, and the environment.In Tarai, tens of thousands of people are affected by floods every year. In the hills, landslides are the main natural disaster occurring very frequently, mostly during monsoon.This year, South Asian meteorologists say, there is a strong agreement among the experts that La Nina conditions are likely to develop over the equatorial Pacific during the second half of the southwest monsoon season.It is also recognised that the La Nina conditions are generally associated with the normal to above-normal southwest monsoon rainfall over most parts of South Asia.(With inputs from agency)","Eight people have been killed by landslides, five due to lightning, and one due to floods.

The agreement marks a key step in the country's economic recovery after defaulting on debt repayment in 2022.Sri Lanka is under an International Monetary Fund bailout program, and the debt treatment deal is expected to reopen the doors to bilateral transactions and the resumption of foreign projects stalled when the island nation defaulted.""This morning in Paris, Sri Lanka reached a final agreement with our official bilateral creditors . Similarly, we signed another agreement with China's exim bank today in Beijing. ... Sri Lanka won,"" Wickremesinghe said.Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 and suspended repayments on some $83 billion in domestic and foreign loans amid a severe foreign exchange crisis that led to a severe shortage of essentials such as food, medicine, fuel and cooking gas, and hours-long power cuts.Sri Lanka's crisis was largely the result of staggering economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which along with 2019 terrorism attacks devastated its important tourism industry. The coronavirus crisis also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad.Additionally, the then-government slashed taxes in 2019, depleting the treasury just as the virus hit. Foreign exchange reserves plummeted, leaving Sri Lanka unable to pay for imports or defend its beleaguered currency, the rupee.Wickremesinghe said with these agreements, Sri Lanka will be able to defer all bilateral loan instalment payments until 2028. Furthermore, Sri Lanka will be able to repay all the loans on concessional terms, with an extended period until 2043.According to a previous president's office statement, the agreements would cover $10 billion, but further details on the mode of restructuring were not immediately announced.By 2022, Sri Lanka had to repay about $6 billion in foreign debt every year, amounting to about 9.2 per cent of gross domestic product. The agreement would enable Sri Lanka to maintain debt payments at less than 4.5 per cent of GDP between 2027 and 2032.As Wickremesinghe addressed the nation, his supporters the watched the speech on a giant screen in the capital Colombo and celebrated the announcement by lighting firecrackers and partaking traditional milk rice.The economic upheaval led to a political crisis that forced then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign in 2022. The Parliament then elected Wickremesinghe as president.Sri Lanka suspended repayment of its debt as it ran short of foreign currency needed to pay for imports of fuel and other essentials. Shortages led to street protests that changed the country's leadership. The IMF approved a four-year bailout program last March.The economic situation has improved under Wickremesinghe, and severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine have largely abated. But public dissatisfaction has grown over the government's effort to increase revenue by raising electricity bills and imposing heavy new income taxes on professionals and businesses, as part of the government's efforts to meet the IMF conditions.After Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy, all projects funded by foreign loans were also halted.On Wednesday, Wickremesinghe said the new agreements would pave the way to resume the foreign funded projects such as highways, light railway and airport development and also initiate new projects too.",Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 and suspended repayments on some $83 billion in domestic and foreign loans.
