Kerala makes venomous snakebites health priority,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kerala-makes-venomous-snakebites-a-health-priority/articleshow/124514625.cms,"Kerala records 3,000 critical snakebite incidents annually

Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala, second only to West Bengal in venomous snake diversity nationwide, has declared snakebite envenomation a disease of public health importance, requiring mandatory hospital reporting of cases, strengthening anti-venom supply chains and standardising treatment protocols.Kerala HC directed the state govt recently to make snakebite a notifiable disease within two months in accordance with a circular issued by Union health ministry in Nov 2024. The Sept 26 order came on two petitions filed in 2019 after a Class 5 student suffered a fatal snakebite at a govt school in Wayanad that year.Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are two other states that have declared snakebite envenomation a notifiable condition. In Kerala, its inclusion in the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme under Section 28(3) of the Kerala Public Health Act, 2023, makes it a structured health priority.The state records over 3,000 critical snakebite incidents annually. Between 8,000 and 12,000 people are admitted to govt hospitals each year for treatment of snakebites, according to reports from the National Health Mission.Official data from SARPA, the forest department's ""snake awareness, rescue and protection"" app, shows 334 snakebite deaths between 2017 and 2019, averaging 110 fatalities a year.The number of deaths dropped to 76 in 2020, 40 in 2021 and 42 in 2022.The classification empowers coordinated action between departments and improved medical response mechanisms. Clinical management and reporting will follow the National Centre for Disease Control's updated national guidelines for management of snakebite, published in 2022.Kerala's rural and agricultural regions face continued risk from venomous snakes. Apart from the Russell's viper, cobra, krait and saw-scaled viper, the venom of hump-nosed pit viper - unique to the Western Ghats - is linked to severe renal complications and underreported deaths, says a 2021 study in Journal of the Association of Physicians of India.WHO recognised snakebite envenomation as a Neglected Tropical Disease in 2017 and urged countries to halve related deaths and disabilities by 2030. Kerala's new classification aligns state health policy with WHO's global strategy.The state's SARPA platform connects citizens to certified rescuers, records verified incident data and provides guidance on safe first response. The initiative, which integrates trained snake handlers, emergency rescue teams and hospital alert systems, is believed to have driven the decline in fatalities in recent years.","Kerala HC directed the state govt recently to make snakebite a notifiable disease within two months.

"Just 3,000 left in wild, IUCN classifies Indian wolf as 'potential distinct species'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/just-3000-left-in-wild-iucn-classifies-indian-wolf-as-potential-distinct-species/articleshow/124514592.cms,"The Indian wolf, commonly known as gray wolf, is found across India and Pakistan

DEHRADUN: In a significant development in animal classification, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has for the first time evaluated the Indian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) separately, suggesting that it may be classified as a distinct species within the Canis genus - a move that could elevate its global conservation priority.According to IUCN's global panel of canid experts, the Indian wolf population is estimated to be around 3,093 (2,877-3,310) across India and Pakistan, putting it in the ""vulnerable"" category on the Red List. The canid experts noted that the trend of decline in its population is mainly due to habitat loss and persecution.The Indian wolf represents one of the most ancient wolf lineages globally - having evolved in the subcontinent long before humans arrived. Unlike the tiger, which is found in 11 countries, this wolf's range is almost entirely restricted to India, with Pakistan having just about 10 to 20 left.""While tiger numbers are stabilising, the Indian wolf's population continues to decline since it lives largely outside protected areas and is exposed to anthropogenic disturbances and threats. This species urgently needs focused conservation efforts,"" said Bilal Habib, senior scientist at the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII).Commonly known as Gray wolf (Canis lupus), the 'genus' currently has seven species recognised by the IUCN. Ex-dean at WII, YV Jhala, said, ""With the inclusion of the Indian wolf, this will be the eighth recognised species of Canis genus."" The other seven species of Canis genus are Canis lupus (wolf), Canis latrans (coyote), Canis aureus (Golden jackal), Canis simensis (Ethiopian wolf), Canis familiaris (domestic dog), Canis rufus (red wolf) and Canis lupaster (African wolf).The IUCN assessment of Indian wolf reads, ""Analysis indicates that only 12.4% of the Indian wolf's distribution is encompassed within protected areas across India and Pakistan. Most of its population is found outside of designated protected areas, where they are not subject to formal protection or management efforts by governmental bodies. As a result, the majority of the population is directly exposed to anthropogenic disturbances and threats. Given current trends, threats are anticipated to persist and intensify in the coming decade...""On the recent incidents of man-wolf conflicts in UP, Jhala said, ""Removing the problematic ones expediently and professionally wins community support, hence it becomes even more important to conserve the species.""","The Indian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) may be classified as a distinct species within the Canis genus.

"Ahead of Supreme Court order, Delhi split on green crackers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ahead-of-supreme-court-order-delhi-split-on-green-crackers/articleshow/124514552.cms,".

Return of firecrackers? Why green activists are not bursting with joy

NEW DELHI: A mix of anticipation and anxiety has gripped Delhi with the Supreme Court hinting that it may allow the sale of green crackers in the city just a week before Diwali. The apex court is likely to deliver its verdict on Monday. While many residents welcomed the prospect of fireworks returning to the skies, calling it an essential part of festive celebrations, others expressed concern that weak enforcement could once again pave the way for regular, more polluting and noisier crackers - turning the city into a ""gas chamber and boom box"".When TOI visited several key markets, shopkeepers said they didn't have firecrackers - green or not - in stock, but many claimed that ""others are selling it"".The permission, likely to be granted, would bring back the bursting of crackers within the legal ambit for Diwali, Gurpurab and Christmas after five years. Green firecrackers are designed to emit 20-30% less particulate matter than conventional ones, but experts argue that they still release harmful pollutants and are difficult to regulate effectively. They warn that enforcement of such selective permissions could prove challenging, given Delhi's already strained pollution control mechanisms.SC last week reserved its order on the sale of green crackers after earlier, in Sept, allowing certified manufacturers to produce them in Delhi-NCR. Manufacturers welcomed the development, recalling how a complete ban during last Diwali led to widespread use of conventional fireworks despite restrictions. They argue that bringing green crackers back into the market could help formalise the trade and reduce illegal manufacturing.According to Rajeev Kumar Jain, a member of Delhi Fireworks Traders Association, the move could curb black marketing and encourage safer options. ""There's a reason the Chief Justice said that if they don't permit crackers, a mafia will be created. Those engaged in illegal work must face the law, but allowing green crackers gives people cleaner and safer choices. Like food has FSSAI certification and jewellery has hallmarking, firecrackers too can have checks and balances. The goal should be to offer people better alternatives rather than push them toward illegal and more harmful options,"" he said.Jain added that innovations have significantly improved the new range of green crackers, with 80-90% of the same varieties and effects - sky shots, chakris, showers - but with a modified composition that converts emissions into water vapour. ""There's huge demand across India, not just during Diwali. From Janto Dec, there are at least 20 festivals where fireworks are used, cutting across regions and religions. But only Diwali faces such scrutiny, which feels unfair,"" he said.However, environmentalists and health experts remain deeply sceptical. Activist Bhavreen Kandhari argued that even so-called green crackers are far from safe.""Science, economics and common sense all point to the same truth - there is nothing truly 'green' about green crackers. The CSIR-NEERI's own data shows only about a 30% drop in emissions, and that too under controlled lab conditions. In Delhi's winter, when pollution gets trapped under a blanket of cold air, that reduction becomes meaningless. A single night of fireworks can poison the air for days. Allowing crackers, green or otherwise, means asking the youngest and oldest among us to pay the price for nostalgia. Clean air is not a privilege - it's a constitutional right under Article 21,"" she said.Parents of young children echoed similar concerns. Neha G Jain, a mother of two aged two and nine, urged the court to prioritise public health over festivity. ""Children are already suffering from toxic air, battling asthma and lung disease. The so-called 'balanced approach' tilts toward manufacturers, not the vulnerable population of NCR. My children depend on nebulisers daily. The polluted air doesn't care whether a cracker is labelled 'green' or not - it harms them all the same. Diwali can be just as beautiful without crackers,"" she said.Experts also fear this Diwali could be more polluted than the last, given that air quality has already started dipping following the withdrawal of the monsoon. Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst at think tank EnviroCatalysts, warned that allowing even green crackers could worsen the situation.""With the emission load from other sectors like transport, power, and construction likely to be higher this year, any relaxation on crackers - green or otherwise - will make matters worse. The city is already struggling with deteriorating air quality, and any added pollution will push it deeper into the severe category,"" he said.According to the CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, green crackers are made by reducing the size of the shell, eliminating ash and using additives that act as dust suppressants. These crackers can be identified by a green CSIR-NEERI logo and encrypted QR codes on the packaging to ensure authenticity. However, a Delhi Technological University study in 2022 found that even green crackers release high concentrations of ultrafine particles which can easily penetrate deep into the lungs.",Supreme Court hints that it may allow sale of green crackers in Delhi just a week before Diwali. Green firecrackers are designed to emit 20-30% less particulate matter than conventional ones.

GURGAON: A 21-year-old labourer died after being crushed under a pile of iron rods that fell from a trailer at a construction site near Ambience Mall on Saturday.According to police, the incident occurred around 4 pm in the DLF 3 area, where a private company is constructing a multi-storey building. Rohit, who was from Parwani Gauri village in UP's Bahraich, worked for the company. He was extricated from under the debris by fellow workers and rushed to a nearby hospital, but was declared dead.A senior officer said, ""No FIR has been registered as preliminary investigation suggests it was an accident. We talked to Rohit's relatives, who also work in the same company.""Rohit was sitting on the stack of iron rods loaded on the trailer, which was being transported to the basement of the site. A truck, filled with construction waste, was already stationed on the ramp leading to the basement. As the waste-laden vehicle moved forward, it collided with the trailer, causing the iron rods to slip and fall. Rohit lost balance and was crushed underneath.","A 21-year-old labourer died after being crushed under a pile of iron rods that fell from a trailer at a construction site.

After Germany, Canada Aims To Lure Indian Tech Talent Amid Trump’s H-1B Visa Fee Hike

NEW DELHI: Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand landed in New Delhi on Sunday evening for a three-day visit aimed at boosting diplomatic and economic ties with India, as part of her broader tour of the Indo-Pacific region that includes Singapore and China.During her stay in the national capital, Anand will meet external affairs minister S Jaishankar and commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal. The meetings, scheduled for Monday, are expected to focus on advancing a framework for strategic cooperation covering trade diversification, energy transformation, and security. She will later travel to Mumbai to meet Indian and Canadian business leaders working to deepen investment and job creation across both economies.Announcing the trip earlier, the Canadian government said the visit was part of efforts to “advance bilateral relations and cooperation” with key Indo-Pacific partners. “For Canada to be strong at home, we need strong, stable partnerships abroad. I am building bridges and increasing cooperation with India, Singapore and China,” Anand said in a statement. “In line with Canada’s Indo-Pacific Strategy, I will be working to advance efforts to position Canada as a trusted, reliable partner of choice for Indo-Pacific countries and their economies.The ministry of external affairs confirmed Anand’s official schedule, with meetings set at Hyderabad House and Vanijya Bhavan before her departure for Mumbai on Monday evening.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal welcomed Anand on her first official visit to India, describing it as an opportunity to “build on the positive momentum in India-Canada relations by revitalising our bilateral mechanisms, deepening economic cooperation, and further strengthening the enduring people-to-people ties that anchor our partnership.”The visit comes amid cautious efforts by both sides to normalise engagement following a period of strained relations last year. Canada and India share more than 75 years of diplomatic ties, underpinned by strong community and business links. Two-way trade between the countries stood at $33.9 billion in 2024, with Canada’s exports to India totalling $5.3 billion, Ottawa said.Anand will continue her tour with stops in Singapore, marking 60 years of diplomatic relations, and in China, where she will meet foreign minister Wang Yi to mark 55 years of Canada-China diplomatic ties.","Canadian foreign minister Anita Anand landed in New Delhi on Sunday evening for a three-day visit.

Centre has no plan to raise ‘creamy layer’ income cap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-has-no-plan-to-raise-creamy-layer-income-cap/articleshow/124511990.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The Centre has made it clear that it has no plan to raise the income ceiling for ‘creamy layer’ for OBC reservations, though the last revision took place eight years ago and is now twice overdue. There is at present an annual income bar of Rs 8 lakh for the purpose.An OBC family that earns more than the prescribed ceiling is ineligible for quotas in public education and employment. The view in government is that an upward hike would cater to a small segment of OBCs but end up making the competition difficult for poorer OBC segments. A lower ceiling of eligibility leads to greater exclusion of the better-off OBCs and works to the advantage of the financially weaker ones competing for a piece of the same quota pie.According to the norm, income ceiling should be revised every three years to factor in inflation, so that the economic criterion for quota eligibility, as defined by the ‘creamy layer’, does not become regressive and hurt the backward classes. The ceiling was last revised in late September 2017 from Rs 6 lakh to the existing Rs 8 lakh and was due for a revision in October 2020. It was to be revised again in 2023, but govt has refused to move ahead on the issue.The parliamentary Committee on Welfare of OBCs, headed by BJP MP Ganesh Singh, in its 7th report, had impressed on department of personnel & training and the social justice ministry the need for a revision of the income ceiling.While central govt in February 2020 did initiate a Cabinet proposal to hike income ceiling from Rs 8 lakh to Rs 12 lakh, the issue kicked up a controversy as the social justice ministry sought an overhaul of the norms to include “salary” in the computation of “income”. According to the 1993 OM that governs “creamy layer” and also defines “income”, “salary and agricultural income” are not included in the calculation, and only “income from other sources” forms part of the “total income”.The row forced govt to put the proposal in deep freeze. Since then, there have been demands that govt decouple the two proposals — on overhauling the definition of “income” and revising the income ceiling to Rs 12 lakh — and move on just the latter proposal. But the social justice ministry refused to do so, calling it a reform package.","An OBC family that earns more than the prescribed ceiling is ineligible for quotas in public education and employment.

NASHIK: A half-hour trek uphill, a line of women waiting in the midday heat for an OTP that rarely arrives. Their eyes fixed on a phone tied to a tree - praying for a single bar of signal. Digital welfare dream meets patchy network reality in the tribal heartland of Maharashtra's Nandurbar district as hundreds of beneficiaries are trying to complete the state-mandated e-KYC process to keep receiving their monthly Ladki Bahin Yojana payout.In Kharde Khurd village of Dhadgaon taluka, women walk nearly 30 minutes uphill to find a patch of signal. Over 500 beneficiaries from the Bhamane group gram panchayat and Kharde Khurd are forced to wait in the sun, hoping the phone - secured on a tree - will connect to a network, often from across the border in Gujarat or MP.

""But the verification fails most of the time.""State govt's decision to make e-KYC mandatory has left beneficiaries in remote areas scrambling. Websites load slowly, OTPs take ages, and the Aadhaar-linked verification process times out repeatedly.""Out of more than 100 women trying, only five or 10 get through,"" said a volunteer at the site. For women like Usha Pawara, each attempt is an ordeal. ""To reach the taluka office in Dhadgaon, we trek and then pay Rs 300 for transport. It's not possible for us,"" she said.Deputy CM Ajit Pawar reiterated Friday that the e-KYC is non-negotiable. ""Only verified beneficiaries will receive funds,"" he told reporters in Pune. ""I know there are difficulties, but there is no alternative. The deadline can be extended if needed, but completion is mandatory."" The current cut-off is Nov 15.The directive follows growing frustration across rural Maharashtra - OTP failures, patchy internet, and confusion over cases involving divorced or deceased family members. ""No clarity exists on what to do in such cases. These are genuine concerns,"" an NGO worker said.Dhadgaon tehsildar Dnyaneshwar Sapkale admitted the difficulties.

Maharashtra specifies minimum size for fish that can be sold,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-specifies-minimum-size-for-fish-that-can-be-sold/articleshow/124512313.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: In a move to arrest netting of juvenile fish that has been adversely affecting their reproduction and eventually depleting the state’s annual catch, Maharashtra government, with the help of Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, has officially decided on length as a criterion for fish to be caught or netted for selling in market yards.Catching a fish that is not fully grown and does not attain a minimum legal size (MLS) as decided by the state will now attract action from the fisheries department. For example, the state’s official fish, silver pomfret, and bangda (Indian mackerel) must be 14cm long.Similarly, a prawn should be 9cm long. The length of Bombay duck should be 18cm whereas for surmai, MLS is 37cm. Maharashtra is the second state after Kerala to introduce the fish length criteria.Sources said a stricter ban on juvenile fishing during the recent monsoon led to a sudden rise in the overall catch during the post-monsoon season, prompting the administration to take the decision. “This is because it gave fish enough time to grow and reproduce, eventually making them flourish. Even stocks have improved,” said a senior fisheries official. Sources said in the premonsoon period this year, the state received 995 tonnes of pomfret stock.However, after five months of total control on fishing, the post-monsoon stock has gone up by over four times, with average length much more than what has been decided. “So, the earlier Rs 11 crore business between March and May now stands at over Rs 350 crore and counting,” a source added. Recently, state minister of fisheries and ports Nitesh Rane chaired a review meeting on MLS of fish and the ongoing conservation measures to curb juvenile fishing of Indian silver pomfret (Pampus candidus).Rane emphasised on the need for a large-scale awareness and compliance campaign to ensure the effective implementation of MLS norms, which, he said, were also vital for the sustainability of the species and the livelihood of the fishing community. A poster on sizes of various fish types was released with an aim to create awareness among fishers, traders, and coastal communities about conserving juvenile fish and adhering to MLS guidelines for long-term fisheries sustainability, said an official.","Maharashtra government has officially decided on length as a criterion for fish to be caught or netted for selling in market yards.

Bihar Elections: NDA Announces Seat Sharing Deal; BJP, JDU Get 101 Seats Each; LJP(R) Bags 29 Seats

PATNA: Barely five days left for the close of nominations for the first phase of Bihar assembly polls, a seat-sharing deal continued to elude the opposition INDIA bloc on Sunday as RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his son Tejashwi Yadav reached New Delhi in connection with a case of alleged irregularities in the award of IRCTC contracts during the former’s tenure as railway minister.The duo, along with former CM Rabri Devi and others, are scheduled to appear before the court on Monday, when the order on framing of charges is likely to be pronounced. The court appearance comes amid efforts to finalise seat-sharing among the INDIA bloc allies, which include Congress , the Left and the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP). Tejashwi said the visit to the national capital was solely because of the court summons.Lalu, however, maintained that talks on seat-sharing were still underway. Sources said the issue is stuck as the Congress is unwilling to settle for fewer than 60 seats, while RJD is equally reluctant to concede. In the 2020 assembly elections, Congress contested 70 seats but won only 19, with a strike rate of 27.14%, a key reason why RJD is hesitant to spare many seats. Sources added that Congress became firm in its demand after witnessing large crowds during the fortnightlong Voter Adhikar Yatra last month, which was supported by all INDIA bloc constituents, including RJD and the Left.“The deal has almost been finalised and will be announced soon, as none of us wants to spoil the momentum created by the yatra. But the announcement can happen only after Monday,” a top RJD source said. Former Bihar Congress president Akhilesh Prasad Singh said, “The seat allocation is almost done, but at the last moment, some difficulties arise in all parties. These are there in the NDA as well and here too. Everything will be announced in 1-2 days. ”The VIP has emerged as another challenge for RJD as it has been demanding a significant number of seats and insisting that party chief Mukesh Sahani be named as the deputy CM face. Sources said while RJD is willing to allocate some 15-18 seats to the VIP, it is not prepared to make any commitment on the deputy CM post. Sahani posted on X on Saturday, promising to form a “govt” in Bihar where each community will receive “justice and dignity,” without mentioning the Mahagathbandhan or INDIA bloc.He later posted another message asserting that the “Grand Alliance is united” and stating, “We will write a new story of development and equality in Bihar along with the ideology of social justice of the respected Lalu Prasad.” Meanwhile, in a curious twist, Tejashwi held a meeting with All India Pan Mahasangh president I P Gupta on Saturday evening. The Pan community holds a significant vote share in Bihar and analysts say the move could be intended at countering the aggressive approach of Sahani.The delay in seat-sharing is causing frustration among the alliance partners, as only five days remain before the close of nominations for the first phase of elections to be held on November 6. The last date for filing nomination papers is October 17.","RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his son Tejashwi Yadav reached New Delhi in connection with a case of alleged irregularities in the award of IRCTC contracts.

BAREILLY: The district administration in Bareilly has reopened a decades-old loan default case and served a recovery notice to cleric Maulana Tauqeer Raza, head of Ittehad-e-Millat Council, who was arrested following violence that broke out near Islamia grounds in Bareilly on September 26.Officials said on Thursday that Raza had taken a fertiliser and seed loan of Rs 5,560 in 1990 from Rasoolpur Kutti Sadhan Cooperative Society, which he never repaid. The case had remained dormant since 1997, when a bank audit marked the dues as unpaid. Although the then government announced a loan waiver for farmers in 1996, Raza's account was reportedly not included in the relief.Hari Babu Bharti, general manager of Budaun District Cooperative Bank, said the amount remained unpaid for over three decades despite multiple reminders. ""The cleric never repaid the amount.

With interest accrued over the years, the total dues now stand at Rs 28,386, and an additional 1% interest is also being considered.If the payment is not made within the stipulated time, the administration may initiate proceedings to attach Raza's property to recover the amount.The recovery notice is part of a wider crackdown on alleged financial and administrative irregularities linked to Raza's network. After his recent arrest, officials began reviewing pending cases and violations tied to his name. Authorities also flagged unauthorised power usage and illegal constructions connected to his premises. Subsequent action included demolition drives and fresh notices across multiple departments.The September 26 violence occurred during a protest connected to the ‘I love Muhammad' campaign, which led to clashes in parts of the city. Police later named Raza as one of the key accused in the FIR and sent him to 14-day judicial custody. Since the violence, authorities have intensified action against Raza and his close aides. Police have registered multiple cases related to incitement, unlawful assembly, and damage to public property. The district administration has also carried out demolition drives against structures linked to his associates, sealed several premises over alleged illegal power connections, and launched inquiries into benami assets and funding sources tied to his organisations.Officials said the revival of the old loan case is in line with recent efforts to address pending liabilities and enforce compliance. Administrative sources added that similar dormant files linked to other individuals named in recent FIRs may also be reviewed.","Maulana Tauqeer Raza, head of Ittehad-e-Millat Council, was arrested following violence that broke out near Islamia grounds in Bareilly on September 26. Raza had taken a fertiliser and seed loan of Rs 5,560 in 1990 from Rasoolpur Kutti Sadhan Cooperative Society, which he never repaid. The case had remained dormant since 1997, when a bank audit marked the dues as unpaid.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124439088,imgsize-1452724,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/protest-over-i-love-mohammad-posters-in-bareilly.jpg"

Features and challenges





Zoho’s homegrown messaging app Arattai recently gained immense popularity. Rival to WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal the app surged to the top spot in India’s app stores. The app has now received attention from Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra . Recently, Mahindra took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to reveal that he has downloaded the Arattai app, prompting a response from Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu. Launched in 2021, Arattai—meaning “chat” in Tamil—was initially seen as a niche side project. But in the wake of AI anxieties, spyware scandals, and scrutiny of Big Tech, its pitch as a “spyware-free, made-in-India messenger” has struck a chord with users. The app’s rise was fueled by endorsements from government officials, including Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who urged Indians to adopt indigenous platforms under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.Mahindra Group chairman and industrialist Anand Mahindra recently gave a public shoutout to Zoho’s messaging app Arattai. Mahindra revealed that he has downloaded the app ‘with pride’. His post on X (formerly Twitter) read: “Downloaded @Arattai today… With pride.”The post shared by Mahindra quickly went viral as many praised him for endorsing an Indian-made tech solution.Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu warmly responded to Mahindra’s gesture and also expressed gratitude.Along with this, he also reaffirmed his firm’s commitment to improve the app. “I was in a meeting in our Tenkasi office with our Arattai engineers, working out refinements to the app and a team member showed this tweet. Thank you @anandmahindrathis gives us even more determination,” wrote Vembu.Arattai offers familiar features such as:* One-to-one and group chats with text, voice notes, and media sharing* Audio and video calls with end-to-end encryption* Multi-device support, including desktop and Android TV apps* Stories and channels for broadcasting updatesHowever, the app is still ironing out issues. Users have reported OTP delays, slower contact sync, and call glitches due to server overload. Zoho has acknowledged the problems and said fixes will take “a couple of days.”Another limitation is that end-to-end encryption for chats is not yet live, though the company says it is working on it.",Mahindra Group chairman and industrialist Anand Mahindra recently gave a public shoutout to Zoho’s messaging app Arattai.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success. Bezos said ‘Go work at McDonald’s.’ As reported by Fortune, in a recent interview, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. “I always advise young people: Go work at McDonald’s,” Bezos said. “You learn responsibility. You learn how to show up. You learn how to deal with people. You learn how to hustle.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure. These are the traits that many Gen Z entrepreneurs may overlook in their rush to build startups.The comments by Bezos come at a time when debate is growing over the value of traditional work experience versus the allure of instant digital success. With platforms like TikTok and YouTube offering rapid fame and monetization, Bezos’ advice serves as a reminder that grit and consistency still matter.Jeff Bezos also stressed that the working environments like McDonald’s exposes Gratification.

AI embedded across JPMorgan



Big AI bets under scrutiny







JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently gave a clear warning about the disruption power of artificial intelligence. Dimon believes that job losses are inevitable, but so is the opportunity to retain and deploy workers into new roles. As reported by Business Insider, In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Dimon said that the bank has invested about $2 billion as an annual investment in AI and is already making $2 billion in direct benefits. This includes the headcount reductions and operational savings. “We know about $2 billion of actual cost saves,” he said. “It’s the tip of the iceberg.”Dimon also talked about layoffs and he did not shy away from the workforce implications. “People shouldn’t put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs,” he said. “AI will enhance some aspects of work, but also eliminate some jobs.” However, Dimon also stressed on the fact that JPMorgan is focused on retaining and redeploying employees whose roles are impacted by automation. “We’ll have more jobs, but there’ll probably be less jobs in certain functions,” Dimon added. “You’re better off being way ahead of the curve,” Dimon added.Dimon also revealed that JPMorgan has been integrating AI since 2012. He said that AI now touches every part of the bank starting from rest and fraud detection to marketing and customer service. The bank also used AI for idea generation. he bank’s proprietary large language model, trained on internal data, is used by 150,000 employees weekly. “It’s quite productive,” Dimon noted. “Our managers and leaders have to do it. ”Dimon’s remakes come at a time when skepticism is growing about the massive corporate spending spree on AI. Meta is planning to spend around $600 billion on AI infrastructure by 2028. On the other hand, OpenAI and Oracle have announced a $500 billion data center project dubbed Stargate.A recent Goldman Sachs report warned that many firms investing billions in AI have yet to see measurable returns. “AI technology is exceptionally expensive,” said Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs. “Even basic summarization tasks often yield illegible and nonsensical results.”","JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon believes that job losses are inevitable, but so is the opportunity to retain and deploy workers into new roles.

Mira Murati’s growing influence in Silicon Valley’s AI ecosystem





Mira Murati, former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer is backing a new artificial intelligence (AI) venture launched by one of her former colleagues, Angela Jiang. According to a Business Insider report, Jiang – an early OpenAI product manager has started a startup called Worktrace AI. The publication claims to have reviewed documents which reveal that Worktrace AI was in talks this summer to raise $10 million in seed funding at a $50 million valuation.Jiang, who joined OpenAI as its third product manager, played a key role in developing the GPT models that powered ChatGPT’s viral success in late 2022. She later worked on OpenAI’s policy team before leaving in December 2024.Worktrace AI joins a growing list of startups founded by OpenAI alumni — including Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab, Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence, and William Fedus’s Periodic Labs — that have quickly attracted billion-dollar valuations before releasing a commercial product.Mira Murati’s involvement in Worktrace AI follows her own major project, Thinking Machines Lab, which raised $2 billion in seed funding earlier this year and reached a valuation of $12 billion. Her growing role as a backer of emerging AI companies signals her influence in shaping the next generation of artificial intelligence research and enterprise solutions.Like Murati’s venture, Worktrace AI is focused on bringing advanced automation to large enterprises.According to its website, the company helps businesses “find and automate repetitive tasks by observing employees.”Worktrace AI has attracted funding from several prominent OpenAI figures, including Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT; Jason Kwon, OpenAI’s chief strategy officer; and Joanne Jang, who helped define ChatGPT’s behavior, according to a job listing. The company is also backed by the OpenAI Startup Fund, along with venture capital firms 8VC and Conviction.Despite having an active website and LinkedIn profile, the company has not made any public announcements about its launch.","Mira Murati, former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer is backing a new artificial intelligence (AI) venture launched by one of her former colleagues.

By: Anushka Kogta





NEW DELHI: As the chill of early winter settles over Delhi, the city begins to shimmer with signs of celebration. Markets across the capital are coming alive with colour and light.At Scindia Pottery in Sarojini Nagar, the earthy scent of mitti fills the air as rows of freshly molded diyas dry in the sun. Shopkeepers arrange their displays, customers bargain for deals and artisans paint intricate designs—the familiar rhythm of Diwali preparations. Yet, beneath the glow, subtle shifts mark the changing times.Sushil Kumar, a decorator continuing a three-generation family trade, carefully paints a diya bright red. “Sales are steady, but the excitement isn’t what it used to be,” he says, hoping for the usual last-minute rush that brings the biggest crowds before Diwali.For 77-year-old Suresh Chandra, the festival market has been a constant for five decades. He has been buying diyas from Scindia Pottery and selling them at Bengali Market in Connaught Place for half a century.“Earlier, things were cheaper and people bought freely. GST has come down, but prices haven’t.Costs have gone up, and the crowds have thinned— it’s a risk we take,” he says.Meanwhile, at Lajpat Nagar Market, the festive bustle continues. “Sales are about the same as last year. Weekends are the busiest,” says Ashok, a vendor who’s worked there for five years.Shoppers, too, are embracing the spirit of the season. “The excitement for Diwali never really changes,” says Dipansha, 29, who works in Gurgaon. “My family shops for the basics in Haryana, and I do the rest here. I don’t burst crackers, but Diwali still feels just as special.”","As Delhi gears up for Diwali, markets are alive with festive preparations, though some vendors note a shift in excitement and crowds.

Exhibition of paintings by tribal artists depicts what tiger means to communities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/exhibition-of-paintings-by-tribal-artists-depicts-what-tiger-means-to-communities/articleshow/124516994.cms,"To encourage the artists and support the cause of conservation, these paintings are up for sale





NEW DELHI: From a canvas bringing to life the story of Maya -the famed tigress from Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve -to folklore surrounding the tigers of Kaziranga in Assam, Ranthambore in Rajasthan and Kamlang in Arunachal, where communities see the tiger as family, around 250 paintings made by 50 tribal artists living in and around the buffer zones of over 30 tiger reserves are up on display as part of an exhibition ""Silent Conversations: From Margins to the Centre’ at the India Habitat Centre in the Capital.From the buffer zones of the tiger reserves where communities thrive amid nature while co-existing with wildlife, these paintings bring into focus the crucial role of communities in conservation efforts and how the tiger is a part of their existence.Cited as a confluence of tribal art, culture and conservation, the exhibition is on till Sunday for Delhiites to experience. It has been organised by non-profit Sankala Foundation, with the support of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), a statutory body under the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC), and the International Big Cat Alliance (IBCA).Secretary General NHRC Bharat Lal, who is mentoring this exhibition, sees it as a medium to not just create awareness but also bring alive the oral history of the many tribes that thrive around tiger reserves. The stories have been presented in various art forms, including Gond, Warli, Bhil, Sohrai, Patachitra, Pithora and Lohakam. The exhibition, held like an annual event, is in its fourth year this time.According to the Sankala Foundation team, to encourage the artists -mostly tribals -and support the cause of conservation, these paintings are up for sale, for visitors and organisations to make the tiger and the folklore of communities a part of their homes, offices and life experience.As this correspondent walked past the artwork, 27year-old Maroti Tekam, who hails from Gond tribe in Chandrapur, smiled radiantly, sharing that three of his paintings were on display and showcased stories based on his lived experiences in the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra. The one captioned ‘The Love of a Mother in Nature’ is a striking pen picture of the famed tigress Maya, who ruled her territory with grace. “She led her cubs with discipline and knew how to protect her territory. Through my painting I have tried to show her as a symbol of a nurturer, keeping a watchful eye on her cubs while being vigilant to the dangers the jungle presents,” Tekam said.Focussing on co-existence, a 15-year-old artist has highlighted the importance of vultures. Aasawari Aoswale, a class 10 student who lives in Pench Tiger Reserve, shared that her painting depicts how nature creates balance, with vultures being crucial for removal of carcasses of animals that in earlier times were picked up and left on a designated land by villagers.Similar stories abound. Narayan Nayak, an artist from Kaziranga Tiger Reserve, puts out a strong message through his ""stripes of resilience"" -a painting that shows a crow peeling off the stripes of the tiger and the stripes being removed bearing signs of deforestation, encroachments and other factors leading to a reduction in tiger population. On the other hand, there is also a flower of hope that carries stripes of change: afforestation, conservation efforts, awareness drives and research to protect tiger reserves.The final word, however, came from Sareng Rangmang, a 23-year-old artist from Kamlang Tiger Reserve from Arunachal Pradesh. ""We believe the tiger and we humans are like a family and therefore there is no fear. The tiger is our very own and that is what my painting showcases,"" she said with a smile.","Around 250 paintings made by 50 tribal artists living in and around the buffer zones of over 30 tiger reserves are up on display as part of an exhibition in Delhi.

What the schemes cover

Growing reach

Easy access, minimal paperwork

From farishtey to rah-veer?





NEW DELHITwenty-one-year-old law intern Piyush Mudgal had just finished a day’s work at Tis Hazari when his bike skidded near LG House on Feb 19. He suffered a severe brain injury and multiple fractures. A mechanic and his co-rider rushed him to Sant Parmanand Hospital in Civil Lines, where he spent nearly a month on ventilator.For his father, Sunil Kumar (52), a contract worker with MCD, the fear of losing his son was compounded by the worry of medical bills. “We didn’t even know about the Delhi Arogya Kosh (DAK) scheme,” he said. “A lawyer told us about it. The hospital took care of all paperwork — even the police formalities. My son was in ICU for weeks, and we didn’t pay a rupee. I lost one son in 2020. This scheme saved my other child.”A few months later, in Aug, 41-yearold Xerox shop owner Mohd Naushad met with a similar fate when a car hit his bike near Azadpur flyover. He was first taken to Babu Jagjivan Ram Memorial Hospital and then shifted to Jaipur Golden Hospital, Rohini. “At first, we were terrified of the cost,” said his brother-in-law, Shahwaz Alam.“But the staff told us treatment would be cashless under DAK. Naushad was discharged on Aug 23 — without us spending a rupee.”These are not isolated cases. Data shared by the health department shows that over 14,800 accident victims have received cashless treatment under DAK’s Road Traffic Accident (RTA) scheme in the past three years, with Delhi govt spending more than 15 crore.The number of beneficiaries almost doubled between 2022–23 (3,698 cases) and 2023–24 (6,664 cases). In 2024–25, the figure stood at 4,469 cases, with officials attributing the dip partly to improved road safety.Officials said the growing use of DAK reflects both awareness of the scheme and confidence among hospitals and victims that emergency care won’t be delayed for want of money.The DAK RTA scheme allows cashless hospitalisation for accident victims for up to 30 days — without any financial cap. If treatment needs to continue, the case is reviewed by govt doctors for approval. The national MoRTH scheme, introduced under the Motor Vehicles Act, provides coverage of 1.5 lakh or seven days of treatment, whichever is earlier.In Delhi, the two are being integrated — patients are treated under MoRTH first, and once the limit is reached, they’re notionally discharged and re-admitted under DAK, ensuring uninterrupted care.“Our aim is to save lives and limbs during the golden hour,” said a senior health official. “With MoRTH and DAK working in tandem, no accident victim in Delhi should have to worry about arranging money before treatment.”Officials said the integration of the two schemes will also allow real-time online processing of claims, speeding up reimbursements and improving transparency.To access DAK benefits, patients need only prove that the accident occurred in Delhi and an MLC (medico legal case certificate) was filed. No income or residence proof is required. All hospitals registered under the Delhi Nursing Homes Registration Act, 1953, are directed to provide cashless care under DAK/MoRTH.Hospitals denying treatment can face showcause notices. Officials said payments to hospitals are generally released promptly. Private wards remain outside the scheme, and families choosing them must pay separately.The Farishtey Dilli Ke scheme, launched in 2017, rewarded bystanders who rushed accident victims to hospitals with 2,000 and a certificate, while protecting them from police questioning. Over 5,000 people benefited in 2021–22, but numbers dropped to 3,000 in 2022–23. The scheme has ended.The central govt had announced a similar scheme called Rah-Veer (Good Samaritan) , which offers up to 25,000 for taking road accident victims to a hospital within the “golden hour”. It’s not clear if it has been notified in Delhi yet. UP notified it recently.","Delhi's Delhi Arogya Kosh (DAK) scheme is providing crucial cashless treatment for road accident victims.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

The Pentagon is looking to buy as much as $1 billion of critical minerals to stockpile, Financial Times reported, citing public filings published in recent months by Pentagon's Defence Logistics Agency (DLA).The increased purchases come as new export controls of rare earths and other key materials for defence and technology manufacturing were unveiled by China's ministry of commerce last week. China accounts for almost 70% of the world's production of rare earths, according to the US Geological Survey.Planned purchases include $500 million of cobalt, up to $245 million of antimony and $100 million of tantalum, the paper said. The DLA stockpiles alloys, rare earths, ores and precious metals, and stores them in depots across the country.

Clear messaging to Pakistan



Strategic recalibration: Delhi steps in



Economics, connectivity and regional stakes



Security calculus: Terrorism and recognition



Presence restored, recognition withheld



Regional balancing act



Strategic hedging, not endorsement







NEW DELHI: In a diplomatic manoeuvre that could reshape regional equations, India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy. The decision was announced during Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s high-profile visit to New Delhi. On the same day, the Afghan foreign minister, from Indian soil, condemned Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, Afghanistan — the first of its kind that came against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Kabul and Islamabad.During the meetings, external affairs minister S Jaishankar underlined that India’s engagement “contributes to Afghanistan’s national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” while announcing a fresh round of development projects across Afghan provinces. The upgrade of India’s technical mission to a full-fledged embassy signals a significant deepening of diplomatic ties without extending formal recognition to the Taliban regime.Later the same day, Muttaqi held a press briefing in New Delhi, sharply condemning Pakistan for bombing civilian areas in Paktika, calling it a “provocative act” and a violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty. “Such issues cannot be resolved by strength.Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he said, stressing the widening rift between Kabul and Islamabad.India had shut its Kabul embassy in August 2021 after the Taliban’s return to power, maintaining only a skeletal presence through a technical team since June 2022 to oversee humanitarian aid. The embassy upgrade marks the deepest level of engagement between India and the Taliban since the fall of the Ashraf Ghani government. This move stops short of formal recognition but signals a decisive shift in India’s Afghanistan strategy.The timing of the announcement was significant. It came just hours after Afghanistan’s defence ministry accused Pakistan of bombing civilian areas in Paktika near the Durand Line. “Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the ministry said in a post on social media. Calling it “an unprecedented, violent, and provocative act”, Kabul warned that defending its territory is its right.From Indian soil, Muttaqi chose to respond sharply. “I think it’s a wrong step by the Pakistan government. Such issues cannot be resolved by strength. Countries with disputes should resolve them internally. Peace and prosperity are good for all,” he told reporters in Delhi. “Some attacks happened in border areas, and we condemn them. We have opened doors for dialogue and diplomacy.”The unusually strong language stressed the widening rift between the Taliban and Pakistan, their uneasy patron for decades. Relations have deteriorated over Islamabad’s military operations against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters allegedly sheltering in Afghanistan. In March 2024, Pakistani airstrikes in Khost and Paktika killed several civilians, triggering warnings from Kabul of “consequences”. This fracture, analysts say, has created a new strategic opening for India.India has historically had a fraught relationship with the Taliban. During the 1990s, New Delhi backed the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance while Islamabad openly supported the Taliban regime. After 2001, India became one of Afghanistan’s largest regional donors, pledging over USD 3 billion for development projects. But the Taliban’s return to power in 2021 disrupted India’s presence and leverage in the country. New Delhi maintained limited contact, focusing on humanitarian assistance and regional coordination with Iran and Central Asian partners.Now, with Pakistan–Taliban ties fraying, India is recalibrating. By reopening its embassy, hosting Muttaqi, and accepting Taliban-appointed diplomats (though not at the ambassadorial level), India is signalling a willingness to engage without granting formal recognition. Strategic analysts describe this as “hedging” — positioning itself to gain influence should Pakistan’s grip weaken further, while safeguarding its own security concerns.Professor Rajan Kumar of the School of International Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University says this evolving situation presents India with a rare diplomatic opening.“The ongoing conflict with Afghanistan and Pakistan certainly offers an opportunity for India can be a stabilising factor even in the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. India’s presence matters a lot to Afghanistan because it will provide some kind of legitimacy to the Taliban government, even though India is unlikely to recognise the regime as such,” he says.The engagement carried clear economic undertones as well. Muttaqi invited Indian companies to invest in Afghanistan’s mining sector and called for the opening of the Attari–Wagah border for direct India–Afghanistan trade. “Pakistan and India should open the Wagah border to facilitate trade between Afghanistan and India. It will benefit the people of all three countries,” he said.Currently, India trades with Afghanistan primarily via Iran’s Chabahar port due to Pakistan’s denial of overland access. But the route faces uncertainty after the United States revoked India’s sanctions waiver for Chabahar in September 2024, complicating transit. While Chabahar remains a strategic hedge, its operational limitations make direct India–Afghanistan connectivity via Pakistan attractive in theory — though politically fraught.India also announced a new slate of development projects: a Thalassemia Centre and 30-bed hospital in Bagrami district, oncology and trauma centres in Kabul, maternity clinics across Paktika, Khost and Paktia, and donations of ambulances, medical equipment and vaccines. These announcements draw on India’s legacy of over 500 development projects across all 34 Afghan provinces, including the Parliament building and the Salma Dam.Security remains at the core of India’s engagement. Without naming Pakistan, both sides “unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism emanating from regional countries” in their joint statement. Jaishankar said, “We have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity. However, these are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.” Muttaqi, meanwhile, pledged that Afghanistan “won’t allow any group to use the country against others”, identifying Daesh (ISIS) as the main regional threat.For India, the key is ensuring Afghan soil is not used for anti-India activities — a core concern since the IC-814 hijacking in 1999. Prof. Kumar explains this strategic bottom line:“What can happen, and what India is probably thinking, is that the land of Afghanistan may not be used for terrorist activities against India. That would be a huge achievement from the Indian perspective,” he says.India has so far avoided pressing the Taliban hard on human rights. Muttaqi remained vague when asked about women’s rights, saying, “All countries have their own customs and traditions and these should be respected.” While India has consistently raised rights issues at multilateral forums, officials have avoided making them a precondition for engagement.Perhaps the most consequential element of India’s strategy is its decision to reopen its embassy in Kabul without formally recognising the Taliban regime — a nuanced diplomatic line that gives New Delhi both flexibility and leverage. By restoring a physical diplomatic presence, India can deepen engagement on the ground and signal its relevance in Afghanistan’s evolving power dynamics, without extending official legitimacy to a government that remains internationally unrecognised and controversial for its human rights record.This approach reflects a clear distinction between establishing an embassy and granting diplomatic recognition. India has previously maintained similar diplomatic arrangements, such as with Palestine, where the presence of an embassy does not automatically translate into full diplomatic recognition of a government. In the Afghan context, this allows India to engage pragmatically while aligning its policy with the broader stance of the United Nations, the European Union and Western countries, most of which have opted for functional engagement without recognition.By doing so, New Delhi positions itself strategically. It can build channels of communication, potentially shape outcomes on critical security and connectivity issues, and apply pressure on regional actors like Pakistan and China, both of which are wary of India expanding its influence in Afghanistan. At the same time, India avoids prematurely endorsing a regime whose policies on women’s rights and governance remain at odds with international norms.India’s outreach is also informed by broader regional considerations. Russia and China have already established working relationships with the Taliban. Western governments are engaged in dialogue on counterterrorism and aid. New Delhi, analysts say, does not want to be the outlier.As Prof. Kumar notes, “Since Russia is talking, China is already there, and American and Western governments are also talking, India should not be left out. We may have ideological differences with the Taliban regime, but since other countries are talking to the Taliban in different forms, we should also try to moderate our policy and engage on several issues.”This balancing act is not without challenges. The Taliban regime remains ideologically rigid, especially on women’s rights and governance. Connectivity through Chabahar faces geopolitical headwinds. And there is no guarantee that the Taliban will limit anti-India groups indefinitely. Yet, by opening formal diplomatic channels, India aims to secure a seat at the table rather than watch from the sidelines as others shape Afghanistan’s future.Muttaqi’s visit to Delhi, marked by strong rhetoric against Pakistan, overtures for trade, and assurances on terrorism, reflects Kabul’s attempt to diversify its diplomatic bets. For India, the outreach is less about endorsing the Taliban regime and more about strategic positioning: insulating itself against security risks, reasserting influence in a region long dominated by Pakistan, and adapting to a shifting geopolitical landscape.New Delhi’s approach remains cautious but deliberate. It is engaging the Taliban to pursue its security and strategic objectives, without abandoning its normative concerns or rushing into recognition. In the complex triangle of India–Afghanistan–Pakistan, this marks the beginning of a new phase — one where India is no longer merely reacting to developments in Kabul, but actively shaping them.","India announced on Friday that it will upgrade its technical mission in Kabul to a full-fledged embassy.

Clarkson still believes the NHS needs reform but concedes he “couldn’t find anything to moan about” during his stay, a rare admission from one of its harshest critics. A national paradox laid bare: Britons may grumble about long waits and systemic flaws, yet trust in the NHS remains strong — a sentiment Clarkson now shares firsthand.

Bottom line:





For a man who’s made a career out of roaring engines and roaring opinions, Jeremy Clarkson has always reserved a special kind of scorn for the NHS. He’s called it bloated, broken and outdated — a “creaking monster” swallowing Britain’s money and happiness whole. But fate, with its impeccable comedic timing, decided to put his rhetoric to the test. Just nine hours after his latest tirade against the health service hit breakfast tables, Clarkson was racing to an NHS hospital himself, clutching more than just his pride. And there, lying in a gown that left his backside exposed to the world, Britain’s most bombastic motoring mouthpiece was forced to admit a humbling truth: for all its flaws, the NHS still works when you need it most.In his Sunday Times column, Clarkson once again attacked the NHS as an outdated, cash-devouring institution in need of a total rethink. But later that same day, a sudden medical emergency meant the broadcaster had no choice but to rely on the very system he had just ridiculed. With private treatment hours away, he checked into an NHS hospital in Oxford, bracing himself for hostile nurses and bitter tea. What he got instead was professional care, spotless facilities, and a recovery that left him quietly — if reluctantly — grateful.Clarkson’s abrupt change of circumstances mirrors the conflicted relationship many Britons have with the NHS: it’s easy to criticise when you’re healthy, but when illness strikes, there’s no substitute for it. His experience serves as a reminder of the health service’s enduring value — not as a perfect system, but as a vital public institution that delivers when it counts.A swift dose of irony: Hours after deriding the NHS as a “bottomless abyss”, Clarkson became a patient, forced to trust the system he had just dismissed.Jeremy Clarkson hasn’t turned into an NHS evangelist, but his hospital dash has quieted his trademark complaints. It’s hard to sneer at a “creaking monster” when it’s the very thing that put you back on your feet.","Clarkson still believes the NHS needs reform but concedes he “couldn’t find anything to moan about’ during his stay, a rare admission from one of its harshest critics.

Focus on trade and investment





NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi and his visiting counterpart Keir Starmer discussed initiatives to double down on likely gains from the India-UK landmark trade deal in a bilateral meeting, while also focusing on efforts to deepen their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and in areas like technology, defence co-production and security.Modi also raised the issue of anti-India activities by Khalistan separatists. While the PM himself did not bring up the issue in his media remarks after the meeting, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said later that the PM emphasised radicalism and violent extremism had no space in democratic societies and “in particular should not be allowed to use the freedoms or abuse the freedoms provided by democratic societies”. It is understood that the issue of extradition of Indian economic figities was also discussed.He also said that the PM underlined the need to move against them within the legal frameworks that are available to both sides.Modi, who announced an agreement for cooperation in military training under which IAF flying instructors will serve as trainers with the UK’s Royal Air Force, said India and the UK are natural partners as their relationship is built on the shared values of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law.“In today’s time of global uncertainty, our growing partnership stands as an important pillar of global stability and economic progress,” said Modi in a joint press statement with Starmer after their meeting.Defence, in fact, was a major focus area in the meeting with the leaders endorsing an Intent to finalize an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) on cooperation in developing maritime electric propulsion systems for Indian Naval platforms. Another agreement for supply of Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) systems to support India’s air defence capabilities was also announced. According to a joint statement, this agreement, in the spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat, will meet the current and future requirements of the Indian Ministry of Defence, and support a long-term collaboration on complex weapons between the two countries.Both leaders agreed to work closely in promoting reformed multilateralism, including reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), as Starmer reiterated UK’s long-standing support for India’s “legitimate aspirations for permanent membership in a reformed UNSC”.Modi and Starmer focused on ramping up cooperation in the Indo-Pacific too as they committed to, according to the joint statement, robust maritime security collaboration in the region, including establishment of the Regional Maritime Security Centre of Excellence (RMSCE) under the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI).Recalling the “historic” Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) that India concluded with the UK in July, Modi said this agreement will reduce import costs between the 2 countries, create new employment opportunities for youth, boost trade, and benefit both Indian and UK industries and consumers.He said there are immense possibilities in the technology partnership, including in critical and emerging technologies, between India and the UK. “We are working to connect the UK’s industrial expertise and R&D with India’s talent and scale. Last year, we launched the India–UK Technology Security Initiative. To connect the youth of both countries through an innovation bridge, we have taken several steps, including establishing the Connectivity and Innovation Centre and the Joint AI Research Centre,” he said.The leaders also announced the setting up of a UK – India Critical Minerals Processing and Downstream Collaboration Guild to build concrete partnerships which “strengthen and diversify critical mineral supply chains and deliver investment and growth in both nations”.“Our defense cooperation has also deepened. We are moving towards defense co-production and connecting the defense industries of both countries. Taking our defense collaboration a step further, we have signed an agreement for cooperation in military training, under which Flying Instructors from the Indian Air Force will serve as trainers with the UK’s Royal Air Force,” he said.Both leaders looked forward to an early ratification of the India–UK CETAThey welcomed the resetting of the Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO) which will support the governance and utilisation of the CETAFocus on construction, infrastructure and clean energy, advanced manufacturing, defence, education, sport, culture, financial and professional business services to realise the benefits of FTABoth Prime Ministers reiterated their commitment to improving connectivity and enhancing cooperation in the aviation sector.","PM Narendra Modi and his visiting counterpart Keir Starmer discussed initiatives to double down on likely gains from the India-UK landmark trade deal.

LONDON: IndiGo will launch daily flights between New Delhi and Manchester. The new direct service was announced at the start of the trade mission to India led by UK PM Keir Starmer.This comes just months after IndiGo picked Manchester airport for its first ever long-haul route into Europe, launching direct flights between Mumbai and Manchester in July.It means that from November there will be nine direct flights a week between Manchester and India. There will be five flights a week from Mumbai to Manchester, and four a week from Delhi to Manchester.Until now, there were three direct flights from Mumbai to Manchester. Manchester airport is now the only UK airport outside London to have direct services to both Mumbai and Delhi. They will all operate from Manchester’s state-of-the-art £1.3 billion Terminal 2.The two routes are expected to generate increased exports worth more than £33.5 million a year, £26 million in tourism income from Indian visitors, 500 new jobs, and more than £26 million of productivity savings for UK businesses.Chief secretary to the UK Treasury James Murray said: “Manchester airport has recently had a large amount of investment which has enabled Terminal 2 to be renovated and expanded, and on the basis of the extra capacity IndiGo chose Manchester airport.”British Airways on Wednesday confirmed it will introduce a third daily flight between Delhi and London Heathrow in 2026, subject to regulatory and capacity approval, and will look for further growth opportunities in India as trade between the UK and India increases.",IndiGo will launch daily flights between New Delhi and Manchester.

Gen Z pushes back against fast furniture,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/gen-z-pushes-back-against-fast-furniture/articleshow/124508006.cms,"DW photo

The rise of fast furniture

Forests under pressure

Gen Z's secondhand surge





Every item of furniture in Daniel Santos' Berlin apartment comes with a story. There's the desk that took him deep into the city's former Soviet suburbs, the bed frame he hauled with the help of five housemates, and the nearly century-old dresser he brought back to life with glue and nails.Santos says it's ""crazy"" to think the pale-yellow antique he bought from a grandson parting with his family's heirlooms ""has survived until now.""""Actually a few days ago, I sent him pictures of it in my room, and he was happy to see that it was living on,"" he said.Santos is part of a younger generation of decor scavengers, increasingly aware of furniture's massive carbon footprint and therefore happy to shop secondhand. They don't want to buy things that will be dumped a little further down the line.Globally, researchers estimate at least 51 million tons of furniture are consumed every year with more than 95% of it discarded. That high buy-to-landfill ratio is partially a consequence of ""fast furniture,"" a cousin of""fast fashion"" — cheap, mass-produced home decor designed for convenience rather than durability.On the rise in recent years, fast furniture's ever-changing styles encourage people to toss furnishings before the end of their natural lifecycle.One study found that British consumers redecorate their homes every one to five years. In a push to ""to stay in style, they turn to inexpensive and disposable furniture that can easily be replaced when their decor changes,"" the authors wrote.And items are often not made to be recyclable. A single sofa might contain textiles, plastic-based foams, plywood, cardboard and metal springs — all fused with laminates, resin and glues — which makes them very hard to separate and repurpose.In the United States alone, 12.1 million tons of furniture waste was generated in 2018 with less than 0.5% of it recycled. That's an almost sixfold increase over 1960 levels.Chicago furniture designer CoCo Ree Lemery says the explosion in fast furniture is partially driven by cheap new materials.IKEA's ubiquitous Billy bookcase is a case in point. When it first appeared in the IKEA catalog in 1979, it was made with a wood veneer finish. Since then, it has been redesigned with contact paper, making it cheaper than the original but harder to repair. Today, the company claims to sell a new Billy bookcase every five seconds.Lemery says the influence of fast-fashion brands on home decor design has been another key factor pushing the uptake of cheap furniture.Spanish fast-fashion giant Zara launched its home division in 2003, followed by Swedish rival H&M in 2009. They both helped normalize quick-turn seasonal trends such as rustic wood tables for fall or velvet chairs for winter in home goods stores.Buying trends shows a greater emphasis on cheap, trendy furniture, Lemery said. ""So, a lot of designers and manufacturers and large companies are in fact following that data, despite it not being good for the long run.""As demand for cheap furniture has increased, it's placed pressure on the supply chain and resources.IKEA is one of the world's largest consumers of wood, using about 0.5% of the total amount harvested for industrial purposes each year, the company said.Environmental group Greenpeace has accused the company of felling ancient forests in areas of Romania's Carpathian Mountains that it says should be protected for their high biodiversity value.The furniture giant told DW it had reviewed the Greenpeace report and could confirm that ""the wood used in IKEA products from these forests fully complies with applicable laws."" And with standards set by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) — a global nonprofit that certifies timber production.""Wood from protected old-growth forests is strictly prohibited in our supply chain,"" a spokesperson for the company said. ""Nevertheless, we have asked FSC Romania to consider the potential need for further protection following our review.""Flat-pack giants and fast-fashion retailers may be losing sway with first-time furniture buyers.According to research from e-commerce comparison website Capital One Shopping, over a billion people visit the Facebook Marketplace digital classified service every month. An estimated 491 million buy something there. Meanwhile, a trend report from social media platform Pinterest recently said searches for ""secondhand kitchens"" have skyrocketed by 1,012% and ""secondhand decor"" by 283%, with Gen Z users making up half of the site's base.Deana McDonagh, professor of industrial design at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says younger consumers are turning to secondhand shopping for a number of reasons: sustainability, frequent moves, tight budgets, limited transport, and also the emotional connection they form with an acquired piece.""With this old furniture, these old chairs, you have to invest in refreshing it,"" McDonagh said, which draws it into a person's story.Santos can relate to that, insisting he wouldn't dream of dumping the dresser he fixed up.Sustainability advocates say reuse is one of the clearest antidotes to fast furniture's environmental toll.""The more that you can source inside your bubble, the better off you're making the world,"" Lemery said","At least 51 million tons of furniture are consumed every year with more than 95% of it discarded. That high buy-to-landfill ratio is partially a consequence of ""fast furniture"" Fast furniture is cheap, mass-produced home decor designed for convenience rather than durability.

Integration and equality

A nod to religious freedom

Central Council of Muslims: No preferential treatment





A recent agreement in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein sparked public debate after tabloid headlines claimed Muslims were being granted ""extra holidays."" The contract, signed between the state's Ministry of Education and a regional Islamic association, formalizes the option for Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave on two major Islamic holidays: the first day of Ramadan and the first day of Eid al-Adha.Although the agreement was routine in nature, it quickly became the subject of heated public debate. Germany's largest tabloid,, known for stirring controversy, ran the headline: ""In Schleswig-Holstein: Muslims Get Additional Holidays,"" and claimed that Muslims in the state could now receive extra days off., another newspaper published by Axel Springer, echoed the claim of ""two additional Muslim holidays"" in Schleswig-Holstein. On, Islamic studies scholar Susanne Schröter described them as ""Two extra holidays just for Muslims."" She argued that Muslims already benefit from Christian holidays — suggesting that members of other religious communities who don't receive similar allowances for their own holidays could be ""unfairly disadvantaged without equivalent time off.""Legal and Islamic scholar Mathias Rohe, who advises policymakers and served on the inaugural German Islam Conference, dismissed the uproar, calling the regulation ""Completely unremarkable, in substance.""In his view, the agreement merely affirms a long-standing legal practice rooted in religious freedom — not a new entitlement.Muslims in Germany are not granted any 'extra holidays.' A spokesperson for the Ministry of Education in Kiel explained that the agreement with the Northern German State Association of Islamic Cultural Centers (VIKZ LZ Norddeutschland) merely formalizes an existing practice — it does not create new legal entitlements.This modest step in Kiel — and the public reaction it provoked — reflects a broader national conversation in Germany about integration and cultural identity, one that increasingly includes questions about public holidays. German law specifies which days most employees are entitled to time off. Such days are called 'statutory holidays.' Only one of them — October 3rd, the national holiday marking German reunification — is uniformly regulated across all states by federal law.Many other holidays, rooted in religious tradition, are regulated by individual states — creating a patchwork of rules across the country.All employees in Germany are entitled to time off on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, as well as Easter Monday and Pentecost Monday. Corpus Christi, a Catholic feast celebrated in late spring, is a public holiday only in states with large Catholic populations. Similarly, the Protestant Day of Repentance and Prayer, held in November, is recognized only in states with significant Protestant populations.These rules were established decades ago, but religious demographics and expectations have evolved. Consider Corpus Christi in Schleswig-Holstein — it is not recognized as a public holiday there. Still, Catholics who wish to attend church and observe the day may request special leave, which employers are encouraged to grant when possible. This leave is unpaid. Today, flexible schedules and time-tracking systems often allow such requests to be handled informally.Schleswig-Holstein is now extending the same principle to two Muslim holidays. On the first day of Ramadan and the first day of Eid al-Adha, civil servants, employees, and students may be ""excused,"" according to the state ministry. This provision aligns with the state's Sunday and Holiday Act, as well as its education laws — and the leave is granted without pay.That's why Mathias Rohe describes the Kiel agreement as ""Completely unremarkable, in terms of holiday regulation."" It reflects ""an already common legal practice,"" and appropriately acknowledges ""the constitutionally protected religious freedom of the Muslim population."" He adds that such clarification is useful for authorities and institutions, as ""the details of legal practice are not widely known.""What about schools? A query to the office of the Standing Conference of Education Ministers (KMK) in Berlin confirms that education policy is the responsibility of individual states within Germany's federal system. According to the KMK, students are generally allowed to take time off from school to observe religious holidays.In Bavaria, Jewish students may be excused for five religious holidays, typically spanning ten school days. Muslim students are granted leave for two holidays over a maximum of four school days. Orthodox Christian students may be excused for seven holidays over seven school days.Most states follow similar, though not identical, practices. Some, such as Hamburg and Rhineland-Palatinate, also recognize Alevi holidays. In eastern Thuringia, by contrast, only Christian holidays are listed. For broader guidance, the Intercultural Calendar published by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) highlights major religious holidays that may be meaningful to families with migrant backgrounds.Federal states with large Muslim populations, such as North Rhine-Westphalia and Berlin, have issued similar policy guidance to support religious observance.School regulations tend to be more rigid than labor market rules, since students don't have the same flexibility to schedule vacation days or work overtime like employees can. The Tikvah Institute, which promotes Jewish perspectives, is urging states to take major Jewish holidays into account when planning university exams.Abdassamad El-Yazidi, chairman of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD), welcomes the clarifications: ""This is not about giving Muslims preferential treatment,"" he told DW, but rather about allowing them to take leave, or request unpaid time off, on religiously significant days, ""Just as members of other non-Christian religious communities are entitled to do.""He voiced concern that certain actors and media outlets repeatedly use such moments to reinforce prejudices against Muslim citizens. Instead, he urged a commitment to respectful coexistence in a diverse society.In a follow-up, the Bild tabloid revisited the topic a few days later with the following headline: ""Uproar over Government Announcement: Extra Holidays for Muslims? Here's what's behind It."" A few lines into the article, the tabloid issued a clarification: ""Muslims do not gain any labor law advantages from this.""","A recent agreement in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein sparked public debate after tabloid headlines claimed Muslims were being granted ""extra holidays"" The contract formalizes the option for Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave on two major Islamic holidays.

GENEVA: US-based Nobel laureates Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee will soon join the University of Zurich, where they will establish a new centre for development economics, the institution said Friday.The University of Zurich (UZH) said the married couple, who currently work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), would join its economics faculty from July next year.The university statement made no mention why the pair — who won the 2019 Nobel Economics Prize alongside Michael Kremer for their “experimental approach to alleviating global poverty” — had decided to leave.But they will be moving to Switzerland at a time when experts are warning US President Donald Trump’s cuts to research funding and attacks on universities’ academic freedoms could lead to a brain drain, with some countries trying to attract US scientists.Duflo, a dual US-French national, herself co-signed an editorial in Le Monde newspaper back in March denouncing “unprecedented attacks” on US science.She and Indian-born Banerjee will each have an endowed professorship at UZH funded by the Lemann Foundation, the university said. They will also establish and co-lead the new Lemann Centre for Development, Education and Public Policy, with an aim to foster policyrelevant research and connect researchers and education policymakers around the world, it added.“We are delighted that two of the world’s most influential economists are joining UZH,” university president Michael Schaepman said.Duflo said the Lemann Centre would enable the couple, who will retain part-time positions at MIT, to “build on and expand our work, which bridges academic research, student mentorship and realworld policy impact”.This year’s Nobel Prize in Economics will be announced on Monday.","US-based Nobel laureates Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee will soon join the University of Zurich.

"How China powers its e-cars, high-speed trains",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/how-china-powers-its-e-cars-high-speed-trains/articleshow/124493101.cms,"



GUQUAN: In China, the longest ultrahigh-voltage power line stretches over 2,000 miles from the far northwest to the populous southeast — the equivalent of transmitting electricity from Idaho to New York City. The power line starts in a remote desert in northwest China, where vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines generate electricity on a monumental scale. It snakes southeast, following an ancient river between mountain ranges before reaching Anhui province near Shanghai, home to 61 million people and some of China’s most successful electric car and robot manufacturers.That’s a single power line. China has 41 others. Each is capable of carrying more electricity than any utility transmission line in the United States. That’s partly because China is using technology that makes its lines far more efficient than almost anywhere else in the world. The feat is owed to China’s ambitious national energy policies and the fact that few residents along the path of these lines dare object.Half the country’s new cars are battery-powered, and the 30,000 miles of high-speed rail lines run on electricity.Wind and solar energy provided over a quarter of China’s power in April.But much of that clean energy is produced in the country’s sunny, windy western and northern regions, far from most of its people and factories. More than 90% of China’s 1.4 billion people live in the east, where cloudy days, windless nights and sluggish rivers limit the potential for clean energy.Beijing, having underestimated the country’s swift adoption of renewables, are building the world’s first nationwide grid of ultrahighvoltage power transmission lines. China consumes twice as much electricity as the US. By 2050, China plans to triple its count of ultrahigh-voltage routes. The most recent data, from the end of 2024, showed 19 lines transmitting power at 800 kilovolts. Another 22 lines operated at 1,000 kilovolts.China’s more efficient power lines have broad consequences for the global race against climate change. China uses as much coal as the entire rest of the world, and emits more greenhouse gases than the United States and the European Union combined.","The longest ultrahigh-voltage power line stretches over 2,000 miles from the far northwest to the populous southeast.

China outlines more controls on exports of rare earths and technology,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-outlines-more-controls-on-exports-of-rare-earths-and-technology/articleshow/124439075.cms,"China puts more curbs on exports of rare earths, tech





HONG KONG: China outlined new curbs on exports of rare earths and related technologies on Thursday, extending controls over use of the elements critical for many high-tech and military products ahead of a meeting in about three weeks between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.The regulations announced by the Ministry of Commerce require foreign companies to get special approval to export items that contain even small traces of rare earths elements sourced from China. These critical minerals are needed in a broad range of products, from jet engines, radar systems and electric vehicles to consumer electronics including laptops and phones.Beijing also will impose permitting requirements on exports of technologies related to rare earths mining, smelting, recycling and magnet-making, it said.China accounts for nearly 70% of the world's rare earths mining. It also controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing. Access to such materials is a key point of contention in trade talks between Washington and Beijing.As Trump has raised tariffs on imports of many products from China, Beijing has doubled down on controls on the strategically vital minerals, raising concerns over potential shortages for manufacturers in the US and elsewhere.It was not immediately clear how China plans to enforce the new policies overseas.During a cabinet meeting Thursday, Trump said he had yet to be briefed on the new rules but suggested that the US could stop buying Chinese goods. ""We import from China massive amounts,"" Trump said. ""Maybe we'll have to stop doing that.""Neha Mukherjee, a rare earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, called the new export controls ""a strategic move by China that mirror some of Washington's new chip export rules.""Most rare earth magnet manufacturers in the U.S., Japan and elsewhere remain heavily dependent on rare earths from China, so these restrictions will force some difficult decisions - especially for any company involved in military uses of rare earths because most of those export licenses are expected to be denied, he said.""The message is clear: if the U.S. and its allies want supply chain security, they must build independent value chains from mine to magnet,"" Mukherjee said.The new restrictions are to ""better safeguard national security"" and to stop uses in ""sensitive fields such as the military"" that stem from rare earths processed or sourced from China or from its related technologies, the Commerce Ministry said.It said some unnamed ""overseas bodies and individuals"" had transferred rare earths elements and technologies from China abroad for military or other sensitive uses which caused ""significant damage"" to its national security.The new curbs were announced just weeks ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea, that begins at the end of this month.""Rare earths will continue to be a key part of negotiations for Washington and Beijing,"" George Chen, a partner at The Asia Group, said in an emailed comment. ""Both sides want more stability but there will be still a lot of noises before the two leaders, President Trump and Xi, can make a final deal next year when they meet. Those noises are all negotiation tactics.""These new restrictions will likely prompt additional government and private investments in developing a mine-to-magnet supply chain outside of China. Mukherjee said that $520 million of investments in the American rare earths industry were announced just in the second quarter with most of that coming from the government.And there is some progress already being made with American magnet maker Noveon announcing an agreement with Lynas Rare Earths this week to secure a supply of rare earths outside of China from Lynas' mine in Australia, and MP Materials preparing to begin producing magnets later this year at its new plant in Texas that uses rare earths from the only U.S. mine that it operates in California.In July, the U.S. Defense Department agreed to invest $400 million in shares of the Las Vegas company, establish a floor for the price of key elements, and ensure that all of the magnets made at a new plant in the first 10 years are purchased.An MP Materials spokesperson said China's action ""reinforces the need for forward-leaning U.S. industrial policy. Building resilient supply chains is a matter of economic and national security.""Wade Senti, president of the U.S. permanent magnet company AML, said it's time to innovate.""The game of chess that China is playing underscores the importance of developing innovation that changes the game and puts the United States in leading position,"" Senti said.Nazak Nikakhtar, a former Commerce Department undersecretary, said the new restrictions are ""a significant development and escalation"" by extending controls to related technology and equipment and to sectors like chipmakers. ""This should be a wake-up call to the U.S. government that we need to invest in and appropriate more to domestic capabilities. Both are critical to rebuild America's rare earths industrial base,"" she said.In April, Chinese authorities imposed export curbs on seven rare earth elements shortly after Trump unveiled his steep tariffs on many trading partners including China.While supplies remain uncertain, China approved some permits for rare earth exports in June and said it was speeding up its approval processes.","China announces new curbs on exports of rare earths and related technologies.

China doctors transplant gene-edited pig liver into a man — He lived 171 days; Scientist says 'this is a very key finding',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-doctors-transplant-gene-edited-pig-liver-into-a-man-he-lived-171-days-scientist-says-this-is-a-very-key-finding/articleshow/124408263.cms,"AI Image used for representative purpose





Doctors in China have transplanted a genetically modified pig liver into a 71-year-old man, who lived for 171 days after the procedure, including 38 days with the pig organ in place – a first to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, CNN reported.Scientists have previously achieved early success transplanting genetically modified pig kidneys and hearts into humans, and pig livers have been transplanted into brain-dead individuals. However, experts in xenotransplantation – the use of animal organs in people – have expressed concerns about the suitability of the liver for such procedures.“Everyone always says, ‘oh, liver is too complicated to transplant, compared to the heart or kidney,’ but after this, in the future, I think people will think differently. I think liver is good if we can get enough human genes in the pig,” said Dr Beicheng Sun, president of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and a co-author of the new study.Unlike hearts and kidneys, which have more narrow functions, the liver is more complex to replace with a pig organ because it is large and has a dual blood supply and multiple functions. The liver filters blood, removes toxins and waste, processes nutrients, detoxifies harmful substances such as alcohol and drugs, produces bile to aid digestion, manufactures proteins that help blood clot, and plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar.Last year, doctors at Penn Medicine conducted the world’s first successful external liver perfusion using a gene-edited pig organ.Blood from a brain-dead patient circulated through a pig liver outside the person’s body. In that case, the pig liver showed no signs of inflammation during the 72 hours it was tested, and the patient’s body remained stable. A transplanted pig liver given to a brain-dead patient in China in March-2024 was removed at the family’s request ten days after surgery. There had been no signs of immune rejection or accumulation of inflammation.Experts say the new study, published Thursday in the Journal of Hepatology, suggests that pig-to-human liver transplantation shows promise as a bridge to help a person with a serious liver condition survive long enough for their own liver to recover or for a donor human liver to become available.“In the future, maybe the left side can get a real chance to regenerate, and in that case, we would remove the graft, and that would be enough to support the life, or at least we know we can wait one or two months for a graft from a human that could save his life. I think this is a very key finding,” said Dr. Beicheng Sun, president of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and a co-author of the new study.With more than 1 lakh people on organ transplant waiting lists in the US alone and over 9,000 waiting for a liver transplant, the demand for human organs far outpaces the supply. Livers are the second largest need after kidneys, according to the US Health Resources & Services Administration.Scientists have been exploring alternatives for decades, including the use of pig organs due to their similarity to human organs. In the case described in the new paper, doctors at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University in China transplanted a liver from an 11-month-old pig into a 71-year-old man in May-2024. The pig, a clone, had ten gene edits to reduce the possibility of infection or rejection of the organ. Doctors also administered drugs to suppress the man’s immune system to prevent rejection of the foreign organ.The man had initially been hospitalised for hepatitis B-related cirrhosis, a condition in which scar tissue replaces healthy tissue, impairing liver function and sometimes leading to liver failure. He also had a large tumour in the right lobe of his liver, but efforts to shrink the tumour with high-concentration chemotherapy targeted at its blood supply were unsuccessful. In some cases, surgeons can remove part of the liver, but the researchers behind the new study said that what remained of the man’s liver would probably have been too small to meet his metabolic needs.After almost three weeks in the hospital, the man developed severe abdominal pain, and tests indicated that the tumour was at risk of rupturing. Doctors tested family members for potential liver tissue donation, but no suitable match was found, so a gene-edited pig liver was considered the only remaining option to save his life. He and his daughter discussed the experiment with the doctors and agreed to proceed.“We need to have great respect for this patient and their family,” Sun said. “The patient provides such a special contribution to the field of this science, and we need to be grateful for all of these patients who have made such a big contribution to this field.”Doctors removed the tumour and transplanted the genetically modified pig liver onto the remaining portion of the man’s liver. The transplant appeared successful initially. The pig liver turned red immediately, and bile – which helps remove waste products and aids in the absorption of fats – began to drain from the external bile duct, with secretion progressively increasing over time.Within the first day, there was a significant increase in other liver function indicators, and there were no initial signs of inflammation or rejection. There were no signs of acute rejection in the man’s body on day ten after the surgery, according to the researchers. Instead, what remained of his liver seemed to perform better than before the surgery. An ultrasound showed that the portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic vein blood flow in the transplanted pig liver were functioning normally.However, by day 25, the patient’s heart began to show progressive signs of stress. Tests on days 28 and 33 revealed inflammatory changes related to the transplant, and doctors adjusted the immune-suppressing drugs. Other signs indicated that the transplant was not performing as well as initially, suggesting the man had developed xenotransplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, a condition where microscopic blood clots damage small blood vessels and organs.On day 37, the man’s blood pressure plummeted, and his heart rate increased, causing him to lapse in and out of consciousness. At that point, his own liver was deemed capable of functioning sufficiently to sustain his body, so doctors removed the pig organ on day 38. The man’s liver continued to function well afterward.On day 135, the man developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding and died from this bleeding 171 days after the transplant procedure. The study authors stated that the research provided critical insights into the challenges and feasibility of such transplants.It demonstrated that pig-to-human liver transplantation “can provide effective hepatic support while preserving part of the native liver, confirming its clinical feasibility as a bridging strategy.” Dr Heiner Wedemeyer, a professor and chairman of the Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Infectious Diseases and Endocrinology at Hannover Medical School in Germany, co-authored an editorial published alongside the study on Thursday.He wrote that the experiment showed “a cause for cautious optimism” as well as a “reminder of how far the field must still travel.” “It’s really groundbreaking,” Wedemeyer told CNN. “For me as a transplant hepatologist, it really opens completely new views and ideas.” Wedemeyer said he saw a patient Wednesday morning who had acute liver failure and did not qualify for transplantation with a human organ because of some cancer issues.“If I would have had, at this stage, use of a pig liver to bridge her – because she may need three, four, five, six, seven weeks to recover with her own liver – I would have done this,” he said. “A pig liver gives us completely new opportunities, and that can really be promising for our patients.”","Doctors in China have transplanted a genetically modified pig liver into a 71-year-old man, who lived for 171 days after the procedure.

Outcomes and insights





Doctors in China have reported a major milestone in organ transplantation after a 71-year-old man lived 171 days following the world’s first published pig liver transplant. The surgery, performed in May 2024 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, involved transplanting a genetically modified liver from an 11-month-old pig. The patient initially survived 38 days with the pig organ in place before it was removed when his own liver functioned sufficiently. Despite later complications, the procedure provided critical insights into xenotransplantation and showed that pig livers could serve as temporary support for patients awaiting human organ transplants.The patient had hepatitis B-related cirrhosis and a large liver tumor, making conventional human transplantation unfeasible. With no suitable human donors available, doctors opted for a genetically modified pig liver with 10 gene edits to reduce immune rejection and infection risks. Immunosuppressive drugs were administered to help the body accept the foreign organ. Surgeons successfully removed the tumor and attached the pig liver to the remaining portion of the patient’s liver, achieving immediate bile flow and improved liver function indicators.Initially, the pig liver functioned well, with no signs of inflammation or acute rejection. Ultrasounds confirmed normal blood flow through the portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic vein. However, by day 25, the patient’s heart showed signs of stress, and subsequent tests revealed inflammatory changes and possible xenotransplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy. On day 38, the pig liver was removed after his own liver regained sufficient function to support life.Although the patient ultimately passed away on day 135 due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the study demonstrated that pig-to-human liver transplantation could provide temporary hepatic support, bridging the gap until human organs are available or native liver regeneration occurs. Experts highlighted the procedure as an important step in xenotransplantation, offering hope for thousands of patients on organ waiting lists worldwide.The experiment underscores the potential of genetically modified pig organs in saving lives and advancing transplant medicine. Researchers and clinicians now have valuable data on immune responses, organ function, and surgical techniques, paving the way for future trials and innovations in organ transplantation. This success suggests that hybrid transplantation could soon become a viable bridge therapy for critical patients. Scientists believe such advancements may one day eliminate organ shortages altogether, transforming the future of transplant medicine. The achievement also encourages international collaboration to standardize protocols and improve patient outcomes in xenotransplantation. It marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing quest to overcome global organ shortages.","The patient had hepatitis B-related cirrhosis and a large liver tumor, making conventional human transplantation unfeasible.

UAE joins global league of liquid propulsion nations





In a historic leap for its sovereign space ambitions, the UAE has successfully designed, built, and test-fired its first liquid-fuelled rocket engine. Developed entirely in Abu Dhabi by the Technology Innovation Institute (TII), this 250-newton-class engine marks a crucial step in building the country’s independent space propulsion capability and advancing its roadmap for orbital and deep-space missions.The Technology Innovation Institute (TII), the applied research arm of Abu Dhabi’s Advanced Technology Research Council, has announced the successful ignition of the UAE’s first liquid-fuelled rocket engine, a technical and strategic breakthrough in the nation’s expanding space programme.The engine, a 250-newton-class liquid rocket thruster, was completely designed and constructed in the UAE. It is capable of producing a thrust equivalent to lifting 25 kilograms on Earth. Thrusters in this category are primarily used for small satellite propulsion, orbital manoeuvres, and attitude control, all of which are critical for in-space mobility and stability.The engine was tested through over 50 hot-fire firings, reaching 94% combustion efficiency, a benchmark typically associated with well-established global space programmes. These performance metrics validated its design reliability, combustion precision, and consistency, key prerequisites for advanced space missions, including orbital operations, satellite station-keeping, and future lunar and Martian missions.Dr. Najwa Aaraj, CEO of TII, emphasised that the engine’s successful operation is not only a technological achievement but a platform for future capability. “This engine is the foundation for building the capability that will empower the UAE to design, test, and deploy propulsion systems supporting a wide range of future missions,” she said.The Liquid Rocket Engine Programme, spearheaded by TII in Abu Dhabi, was designed with a dual focus: to develop local propulsion technologies and to build a skilled Emirati-led space engineering workforce. Nearly half of the core engineering team behind the engine were Emirati nationals, responsible for critical tasks such as thermal and structural simulations, injector design, and test protocol development.“This is a moment of national pride,” said Dr. Elias Tsoutsanis, Chief Researcher at TII’s Propulsion and Space Research Centre. “It represents the starting point of a broader journey towards an ambitious space future led by the people of the UAE.”Despite the absence of permanent testing infrastructure in the country, the team overcame significant logistical and technical challenges. They custom-built cold-flow testing rigs in Abu Dhabi and collaborated with Airborne Engineering in the UK to conduct the live hot-fire tests.Dr. Tsoutsanis acknowledged the scale of the challenge: “The most significant hurdle was the absence of dedicated test infrastructure in the UAE. We solved this by developing deployable systems and performing the live firings abroad.”Work is now underway to establish the UAE’s first static-fire rocket engine testing facility, which is expected to be operational by 2026 in Abu Dhabi. This facility will be capable of supporting engines up to five times more powerful than the current 250-newton model.The first 1-kilonewton-class engine firing on Emirati soil is also slated for 2026, signalling the UAE’s commitment to bringing space research infrastructure home.TII’s propulsion roadmap includes:“These plans reflect Abu Dhabi’s determination to play a meaningful role in global space exploration,” said Dr. Tsoutsanis. “Our aim is not just to build engines, but to enable the UAE to access space independently, repeatedly, and sustainably.”With this successful milestone, the UAE enters an elite group of countries with verified liquid propulsion design capabilities — including the United States, China, Russia, India, Japan, and members of the European Space Agency.The UAE’s progress showcases not only its technical capability but also its strategic vision to cultivate local expertise, reduce dependence on foreign technologies, and inspire the next generation of Emirati space innovators.For the engineers involved, especially the Emirati team members who grew up watching space launches from afar, this achievement is deeply personal. “Seeing our own design ignite is something we’ll never forget,” said one engineer.“This engine is more than a technical success — it’s the start of a journey,” said Dr. Aaraj. “It reflects the UAE’s evolving capability in space, led by its own people and driven by a long-term vision.”","The 250-newton-class liquid rocket thruster was completely designed and constructed in the UAE.

As of today, October 12, the European Union’s long-awaited Entry/Exit System (EES) is officially in effect. The new system replaces the traditional manual passport stamping with a fully digital process, streamlining border control while enhancing security.In a recent advisory, the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reminded Emirati citizens and residents that, under the new rules, travelers will need to provide biometric data—such as fingerprints and facial images—along with their passport details when entering any EU country for the first time. This data will be stored for three years and only needs to be updated if there are changes or errors.The Ministry reassured travelers that all data will be handled in accordance with EU privacy regulations and emphasized that holders of diplomatic passports are exempt from the system. With the EES now in effect, MOFA also advised travelers to allocate extra time for the new registration process during their initial entry.Here’s a complete breakdown of what the EES is, who it affects, how it works, and what UAE residents need to prepare for before their next trip to Europe.The EES introduces automated border checks for non-EU nationals entering or exiting the Schengen Area for short stays. This includes UAE citizens and residents who are visa-exempt or travelling on a Schengen short-stay visa (up to 90 days in any 180-day period).From 12 October 2025, border control officers will digitally register the following data on arrival:This data is stored in a centralised EU database managed by eu-LISA, the European Agency for large-scale IT systems in the fields of freedom, security, and justice.On future trips, travellers won’t need to repeat the full biometric process. Instead, the system will verify identity using previously stored data and digitally log border crossings.Importantly, manual passport stamping will gradually be phased out, though some locations may continue to stamp passports during the system’s early rollout phase.The EES only applies to travellers from non-EU countries, meaning it directly affects UAE citizens and residents visiting the Schengen Area for short stays.Airlines operating in the UAE, including Emirates and Air Arabia, have already issued alerts to their passengers about the upcoming changes. Both carriers are advising travellers to allow extra time at border checks, especially during their first visit after the system goes live, as the new process could take longer than usual.The European Union is launching the EES to modernise its border management, increase security, and improve efficiency for both authorities and travellers. The current system — manually stamping passports — is time-consuming, often inaccurate, and unable to reliably detect overstayers.The EES aims to:The system also supports wider use of automated border control gates and self-service kiosks, making travel more seamless once initial biometric data is captured.This initiative is part of the EU’s broader Security Union agenda, supporting the goals of the European Agenda on Security and the European Agenda on Migration, particularly around countering terrorism and cross-border crime.The proposal for the EES was initially presented on 6 April 2016 under the Smart Borders Package. After negotiations, it was adopted on 20 November 2017, and came into force on 29 December 2017.The EES collects and stores several pieces of personal and biometric information:All data is stored securely and handled under strict EU data protection laws. Access is limited to:In certain circumstances, data may also be shared with international organisations or third countries under regulated conditions.Each travel record remains valid for three years from the last recorded crossing. If you cross the border again, the clock resets. Renewing your passport will not affect your stored data — the system will automatically match your new passport with your existing biometric records through facial recognition.There is no need to register in advance. Your biometric data will be collected on your first entry after the system goes live.Although the EES is intended to replace manual stamps, some countries or border points may still apply physical stamps temporarily during the transition period.There is no insurance requirement under the EES. However, some countries (e.g., France) may ask at kiosks whether travellers have medical coverage. Travel insurance is highly recommended but remains optional.Some EU countries may offer National Facilitation Programmes to speed up border checks for frequent visitors. Eligibility criteria and availability vary by member state.The EES applies across all external borders of the Schengen Area. Travellers from the UAE should expect the new system when visiting any of the following countries:Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland.While the Entry/Exit System (EES) is set to officially launch in October 2025, another significant change is scheduled to follow about a year later: the introduction of ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System), often referred to informally as the “Euro visa.”ETIAS will be a new, mandatory pre-travel authorisation for visa-exempt nationals, including travellers from the UAE and the UK, who plan to travel to any of the 30 designated European countries in the Schengen Area. It is not technically a visa, but it is a compulsory security clearance designed to thoroughly screen travellers before they arrive.The authorisation is:If a traveller gets a new passport, they must apply for a new ETIAS authorisation, even if their previous one was still valid.Once implemented, ETIAS will work in tandem with the EES, further tightening EU border security by vetting travellers in advance and tracking their movements upon arrival and departure.For now, the focus remains on the smooth rollout of the EES, a foundational shift in how Europe manages border entry, aiming to balance security, efficiency, and traveller experience.","The European Union’s long-awaited Entry/Exit System (EES) is officially in effect.
