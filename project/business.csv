Opposition expressed confidence that Birla would step in to reduce the frequency of meetings to allow members to prepare for the sittings. One of the MPs suggested that the meetings be held with a gap of a fortnight. After the meeting, MPs said the Speaker assured them of a decision at the earliest.Tuesday marked the 14th meeting of the JPC since Aug 22. Senior advocate Harish Salve appeared for Anjuman e Shiateali Dawoodi Bohra community. The community, according to sources, in a written submission noted that it is a ""small and tightly-knit"" denomination and its affairs do not need the kind of regulation that may be considered necessary or even desirable in relation to other denominations that do not believe in any such religious tenet.The power of waqf board undermines the community's founding faith, it claimed, citing various SC judgments to underscore the judiciary's recognition of their ""distinctive structure"", sources said.",Representatives of the Dawoodi Bohra community have contended that the proposed legislation does not recognise their special status.

However, a notification issued on Aug 17, 2005, claimed the fort area as waqf property.The areas claimed include Solah Kambh or 16-pillar monument, 14 of the 15 domes in Ashtur and multiple tombs, including that of Amir Barid in Barid Shahi Park.Though the CM issued back-to-back clarifications and an order to nullify any takeover notices in the past fortnight, farmers and citizens are still a frazzled lot.Anirudh Desai, assistant surveyor with the archaeology department, claimed he has no knowledge of the govt notification that classifies ""this protected site"" as wakf property since 2005. ""The relevant department records are in the head office in Hampi,"" he said, adding the Hampi office may shed more light on the issue.Deputy commissioner Shilpa Sharma, too, claimed she is unaware of Bidar Fort being designated as Waqf Board property and said she will obtain information from the department concerned.Similarly, Dharmapur and Chatnalli villages of Bidar taluk are claimed by Waqf Board.

Patient representatives and treatment activists urged govt, courts, and lawmakers to take urgent action to address the abuse of patent monopolies in rare diseases by incentivising generic production.""Roche's action against Natco isn't just about a single drug or one company's right to profits, it's about our right to life.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday said that minorities have no absolute right to administer educational institutions, while upholding the validity of Uttar Pradesh Board of Madrasa Education Act, 2004 - a decision that will clear the uncertainty hanging over 13,364 madrassas in the state with over 12 lakh students since March 22 when Allahabad high court had struck down the Act terming it ""non-secular"" and hence ""unconstitutional"".An SC bench of CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said that the high court erred in quashing the statute and ordering shifting of the students to regular schools under UP Education Board.The SC bench ruled that the right of minorities to administer educational institutions was not absolute and the board could exercise its regulatory power with approval of the state govt to ensure that religious minority institutions imparted secular education of a requisite standard without destroying their minority character.Writing the 70-page judgment, CJI Chandrachud said, ""The right of minorities to administer educational institutions is not absolute. The state has an interest in maintaining the standards of education in minority educational institutions and may impose regulation as a condition for grant of aid or recognition.""The CJI said the state has a constitutional obligation to strike a balance between two objectives - ensuring the standard of excellence of minority educational institutions and preserving the right of minorities to establish and administer its educational institutions.""State can regulate aspects of the standards of education such as the course of study, qualification and appointment of teachers, health and hygiene of students, and facilities for libraries. Regulations pertaining to standards of education or qualification of teachers do not directly interfere with the administration of the recognised madrassas. Such regulations are designed to prevent maladministration of an educational institution,"" the SC said.It said the 2004 Act did not interfere with the day-to-day administration of madrassas as its objective was regulatory in nature for improvement of academic excellence of students. ""The Madarsa Act is consistent with the positive obligation of the state to ensure that students studying in recognised madrassas attain a minimum level of competency which will allow them to effectively participate in society and earn a living,"" it said.However, the SC said the Madarsa Act, to the extent to which it sought to regulate higher education, including degrees of Fazil (postgraduate) and Kamil (undergraduate), was beyond the legislative competence of the state legislature as it conflicted with the UGC Act, which governs the standards for higher education. A state legislation cannot seek to regulate higher education in contravention of the UGC Act, it said.The SC severed conferment of Fazil and Kamil degrees from the functioning of the Madarsa Board and said it could continue to regulate madrassa education till Class 12. ""The mere fact that the education which is sought to be regulated includes some religious teachings or instruction does not automatically push the legislation (Madarsa Act) outside the legislative competence of the state,"" it said.Referring to Article 28(3) which prohibits students in state recognised and state-funded or aided educational institutions from being compelled to receive religious instructions, the CJI said, ""The corollary to this provision is that religious instruction may be imparted in an educational institution which is recognised by the state, or which receives state aid but no student can be compelled to participate in religious instruction in such an institution.""","Supreme Court upholds validity of Uttar Pradesh Board of Madrasa Education Act, 2004.

BATHINDA: Canada 's Khalistani-Hindu altercations, from Brampton to Malton and Surrey, have left many Indians and temporary visa holders, especially those from Punjab, fearing for their safety and their families back home worried.The conflict sparked by an attack on a Hindu Mahasabha temple in Brampton city of Canadian province Ontario's Greater Toronto Area underscores divisions around the demand for Khalistan and its impact on Canada's multicultural communities.Many in Brampton and Surrey feel these clashes could strain social cohesion among various Indian diaspora groups. Punjab's Rohit Kumar, who is on a work permit in Brampton, said: ""We are highly concerned. Incidents such as these only worsen the perception that we are creating unrest here, and that will cause more problems for us.""Kulwinder Singh, who has been involved in peaceful protests for extending work permits, emphasised the potential long-term consequences of the violence on community relations. Calling for unity among communities, Kulwinder said: ""While we focus on securing our future in Canada, incidents like these could affect our ability to integrate.""Back in Punjab, Amit Mittal, whose son lives in Surrey, requested the Canadian authorities to manage these recurring conflicts carefully. ""These events have ripple effects that impact the safety of our children staying abroad,"" Mittal said, also calling on the Indian govt to push for protection of Punjabis in Canada.The rising tensions highlight the delicate balance within Canada's diverse immigrant communities and the need for careful intervention to prevent further discord.These escalating tensions between pro-Khalistan supporters and opposition groups make migrants from Punjab anxious to save their reputation. For those struggling to extend their work permits, like Brampton store worker Jatinder Singh - whose permit expires next month - a dented image could be disastrous. ""These disruptive elements could fracture Canada's social harmony and create unrest back home, where longstanding regional disputes remain unresolved,"" Jatinder added.","Many in Brampton and Surrey feel these clashes could strain social cohesion among various Indian diaspora groups.

Man accused of terror by India is our employee but no evidence to prove allegations: Canada agency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/man-accused-of-terror-by-india-is-our-employee-but-no-evidence-to-prove-allegations-canada-agency/articleshow/114958546.cms,"NEW DELHI: Canada ’s accusation without “evidentiary proof” that India got designated pro-Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar killed on its soil contrasts with its refusal to acknowledge what New Delhi calls irrefutable evidence about Canadian Border Security Agency harbouring the wanted mastermind of Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu’s October 2020 assassination in Punjab’s Tarn Taran.In an emailed response, CBSA confirmed to TOI that Sandeep Singh Sidhu, aka Sunny Toronto, was an employee but denied he was involved in any crime in India.“All CBSA employees are subject to background checks and reviews prior to their employment, periodically all throughout their career and in response to allegations that call into question their reliability. CBSA can confirm we have no evidence to support allegations made against him,” the agency wrote.Intelligence sources said Sidhu, whose extradition India has officially demanded, operates in “close coordination” with Canadian Security Intelligence Service, while officially being part of CBSA.He is a member of banned International Sikh Youth Federation, which is one of the reasons why India has put him on its list of fugitives charged with promoting terrorist activities from Canada.How Sidhu masterminded killing of Sandhu, a teacher who was conferred Shaurya Chakra for his role in fighting militancy, is among the subplots in a larger antiIndia conspiracy involving Pakistan’s ISI, sources said.Multiple agencies, including NIA, found out during the probe into Sandhu’s assassination how Sidhu and his ISI handlers baited Gurjit Singh, a ‘hitman’ obsessed with an underage girl & blackmailed him into agreeing to murder.Gurjot Kaur, the USbased widow of former Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) chief Harmeet Singh, alias Happy PhD, was another piece on ISI’s chessboard.ISI promised Gurjit and his arrested accomplices — Sukhdeep Singh and Inderjeet Singh — money and shelter in Canada in return for murdering Sandhu. The plot took shape in the spring of 2020. Those tasked with coordinating the hit were Dubai-based gangster Sukh Bhikhariwal and Sidhu.The duo acted on the instructions of ISI henchman and pro-Khalistan terrorist Lakhbir Singh Rode, who died in Pakistan last December.Sidhu had established links with ISI through Gurjot, wanted in India for coordinating terrorist activity from her base in the US.The hired shooters received sophisticated weapons and training in Sept 2020, sources said. On October 16, Gurjit and his accomplices arrived at Sandhu’s residence-cum-school in Bhikhiwind dressed from head to toe in black. The target’s coordinates were given to them through the conduits of two gangsters – Ravinder Singh, alias Gyani, and Sukhraj Sukkha – in Ferozepur Jail.That morning, Sandhu opened the door presuming it was the milkman. The shooters barged in and fired, killing him instantly. They threw their bike in the Sutlej and fled to Ludhiana, where they stayed in a house in Salem Tibri that Sidhu and Bhikhariwal had arranged for them.Prior to Sandhu’s murder, the family had faced 16 attacks in a year. In one of these, Sandhu and his wife fought back a group of terrorists for five hours using weapons provided by the govt. By Dec 2020, Delhi Police’s special cell tracked down Gurjit and Sukhdeep. Bhikhariwal was extradited from Dubai and a manhunt started for Sidhu. The third shooter, Inderjeet, was arrested while trying to flee to Dubai. Inderjeet confessed that two Khalistani terrorists based abroad contacted him in March 2020 after noticing his Facebook posts.He said one of them identified himself as Sidhu aka Sunny, a resident of Canada, and tasked him with doing a recce of Sandhu’s residence. Sidhu later helped him get in touch with Bhikhariwal. Sidhu also sent him a flight ticket and e-visa to Dubai.","Canadian Border Security Agency harbouring wanted mastermind of Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu’s October 2020 assassination.

The food-grains’ basket includes all-time high production of paddy at around 120 MT which is higher by over 6% (7 MT) than the output in 2023-24 crop year, according to the agriculture ministry’s estimates released on Tuesday.The record estimate of paddy, the main Kharif crop, comes amid surplus rice stocks in government godowns that led to slow pace of procurement during the current marketing season. Harvesting of paddy is expected to be completed by mid-Nov across the country.The ministry, for the first time, used data from the Digital Crop Survey (DCS) which is being conducted under the Digital Agriculture Mission, replacing the manual ‘Girdawari (random estimation based on crop cutting experiments at the time of harvest) system.Use of digital survey is an important step towards arriving at robust crop area estimates. Such estimation has been done for Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Odisha wherein 100% districts are covered under DCS in Kharif 2024. “This has led to substantial rise in area under paddy particularly in UP,” said the ministry while sharing the first advance estimates of production of Kharif crops for the year 2024-25.In the Kharif food-grain basket, maize (24 MT) and jowar (2 MT) also showed record output whereas pulses output is expected to remain almost flat at nearly 7 MT.Among non-foodgrains, oilseeds production is likely to marginally increase to nearly 26 MT while sugarcane production is projected to decline to 440 MT from 453 MT last year.

"Kodu Crop to blame for elephant deaths in Bandhavgarh, says ICAR toxicology report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/kodu-crop-to-blame-for-elephant-deaths-in-bandhavgarh-says-icar-toxicology-report/articleshow/114983728.cms,"BHOPAL: As Congress Demands CBI Inquiry into Alleged Elephant Poisoning, Wildlife Institute Identifies Kodu Crop as the Cause A toxicological examination report from the Center for Wildlife Conservation, Management, and Disease Surveillance, ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly, has debunked claims of intentional poisoning of elephants in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, Umaria, Madhya Pradesh. The report, which was submitted to the Deputy Director of Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, attributes the deaths to contamination from Kodu crop, specifically its fungal toxins.The report followed an investigation based on visceral organ and gastrointestinal contents sent by the Reserve to the institute on November 2. The samples, including liver, kidney, spleen, heart, lung, stomach, and intestinal contents, were analyzed for the presence of various toxic substances. These included cyanide (HCN), nitrate-nitrite, heavy metals, commonly used insecticides, and the active principle of Kodu, cyclopiazonic acid.The analysis found no traces of cyanide, nitrate-nitrite, heavy metals, or any common insecticides such as Organophosphates, Organochlorines, Pyrethroids, or Carbamates. However, cyclopiazonic acid was detected in all pooled samples, with concentrations exceeding 100 ppb. Further screenings are underway to determine the exact levels.“The results suggest that the elephants might have ingested large quantities of Kodu plant or its grains,” the report concludes, indicating that the elephants were likely poisoned by the fungus growing on the Kodu crop.The IVRI has also issued several precautionary measures to combat the spread of fungal infections in the region. According to experts, the contamination of Kodu crops has not only been affecting the local wildlife, including elephants, but is also posing a significant risk to domestic livestock.The research institute has strongly recommended that farmers conduct a survey of affected fields and destroy any fungal-infected Kodu crop residue. It is also critical to prevent both domestic and wild animals from entering these fields, as ingestion of the contaminated crop could lead to serious health complications.Furthermore, the institute stressed the importance of raising awareness among farmers and livestock owners in and around the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (BTR) about the dangers posed by fungal-infected crops. It has urged local communities to take necessary precautions, such as keeping livestock away from fields with high fungal contamination.To better understand the environmental factors contributing to these fungal outbreaks, the institute has called for an in-depth study of the cropping patterns and environmental conditions around the BTR. The study is expected to shed light on the conditions that may be fueling the spread of the infection.In addition, the institute has suggested further research into the toxicity of cyclopiazonic acid, particularly its lethal dose (LD50) for both domestic and wild animals. Understanding this threshold is crucial to mitigating the risks associated with the consumption of contaminated crops.This report comes amid ongoing political pressure, as the Congress party has demanded a CBI inquiry into the elephant deaths, alleging that the poisoning was intentional. However, the scientific findings point to the unintentional consequences of consuming contaminated crops, highlighting the urgent need for agricultural and wildlife management interventions in the region.As the investigation continues, local authorities and wildlife experts are urging the immediate implementation of the recommended measures to prevent further harm to both wildlife and livestock in the BTR area.","Toxicological examination report has debunked claims of intentional poisoning of elephants in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, Umaria, Madhya Pradesh.

CJI Chandrachud criticises former Justice Krishna Iyer's 'rigid economic theory' on private property,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-chandrachud-criticises-former-justice-krishna-iyers-rigid-economic-theory-on-private-property/articleshow/114985345.cms,"The CJI said, ""To declare that Article 39(b) includes the distribution of all private resources amounts to endorsing a particular economic ideology and structure for our economy. Justice Krishna Iyer's judgement in Ranganatha Reddy, which was followed inter alia in Sanjeev Coke and Bhim Singhji, was influenced by a particular school of economic thought.""

""For instance, in Ranganatha Reddy, Justice Krishna Iyer observed that Article 39(b) constitutes 'a directive to the State with a deliberate design to dismantle feudal and capitalist citadels of property'. In Bhim Singhji, Justice Krishna Iyer cited Karl Marx in his judgement to observe that taking over large conglomerations of land is necessary to make Article 39 a 'constitutional reality',"" he added.

The Chief Justice of India noted that Justice Iyer, in the same ruling, shared his views on the economic landscape, describing it as being in a transitional phase undergoing gradual transformation.

""Significantly, both Justice Krishna Iyer (in Ranganatha Reddy and Bhimsinghji) and Justice Chinappa Reddy (in Sanjeev Coke) consistently referred to the vision of the framers (of the Constitution) as the basis to advance this economic ideology as the guiding principle of the provision. However, as noted earlier in his judgement, the vision of the framers while drafting the Constitution was not to lay down a particular form of social structure or economic policy for future governments,"" the majority judgement said.

The majority judgment, authored by CJI held that while the phrase ""material resources of the community"" could theoretically include privately owned resources, the broad interpretation offered by Justice Krishna Iyer in his minority judgment in Ranganath Reddy and later relied upon by Justice Chinnappa Reddy in Sanjeev Coke, cannot be accepted.

""The Constitution was framed in broad terms to allow succeeding governments to experiment with and adopt a structure for economic governance which would subserve the policies for which it owes accountability to the electorate,"" the CJI said.

""According to Dr Ambedkar, if the Constitution laid down a particular form of economic and social organisation, it would amount to taking away the liberty of people to decide the social organisation in which they wish to live,"" he added.



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday in its majority judgment regarding private property issues criticised former Justice V R Krishna Iyer for ""postulating a rigid economic theory"" that promoted increased state control over private resources as the sole foundation for constitutional governance.These comments on Justice Iyer's approach were made in the majority opinion authored by Chief Justice DY Chandrachud on behalf of himself and six other justices on the bench.The nine-judge bench, led by the CJI, ruled with a 7:2 majority that not all private properties can be classified as ""material resources of the community"", which would otherwise permit states to acquire them for distribution towards 'common good' under the Constitution.""The doctrinal error in the Krishna Iyer approach was, postulating a rigid economic theory, which advocates for greater state control over private resources, as the exclusive basis for constitutional governance,"" the CJI wrote in the 193-page judgement.In 1977, a seven-judge bench had previously ruled with a 4:3 majority in the state of Karnataka vs Shri Ranganatha Reddy case, that privately owned resources were not within the scope of 'material resources of the community'.Justice Iyer had presented a dissenting opinion, maintaining that the state possessed authority to acquire private resources for distribution to serve common good. He consistently upheld this position in subsequent judgements as well.In his judgement, Justice Chandrachud cited various statements made by Justice Iyer across different verdicts.The majority judgment was authored by CJI Chandrachud, for self and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Rajesh Bindal, SC Sharma and AG Masih, while Justice BV Nagarathna partially concurred and Justice Dhulia dissented.","Chief Justice of India criticises former Justice V R Krishna Iyer for ""postulating a rigid economic theory"" that promoted increased state control over private resources as the sole foundation for constitutional governance. The majority judgment, authored by CJI held that while the phrase ""material resources of the community"" could theoretically include privately owned resources, the broad interpretation offered by Justice Iyer in his minority judgment cannot be accepted.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114987837,imgsize-598917,width-400,resizemode-4/114987837.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the validity of Uttar Pradesh Board of Madrassa Education Act, which Allahabad high court had struck down as 'non-secular', ordering closure of madrassas. However, it said that state has a vital interest in regulating madrassas to improve standards of education.The SC clarified that while regulating standards of education in madrassas, state can't violate minority community's right to establish and administer educational institution. The apex court said the HC erred in terming Madrassa Act unconstitutional as it only allowed government to regulate education standard.The SC said madrassas granting certificates beyond Class XII - Kamil and Fazil - cannot be recognised by UP Madrassa Board as these are in conflict with the UGC Act. This means the 13,000-odd madrassas would continue to function in UP with the state regulating the education standards.""The UGC Act governs the standards for higher education and a state legislation cannot seek to regulate higher education, in contravention of the provisions of the UGC Act,"" the court said.A bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra reserved the verdict after hearing arguments from all the concerned parties in the case.Hearing the case, the apex court described India as a ""melting pot of cultures, civilisations and religions"" and stressed taking steps to preserve it.""Ultimately we have to see it through the broad sweep of the country. Religious instructions are there not just for the Muslims. It is there in Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, etc. The country ought to be a melting pot of cultures, civilisations, and religions. Let us preserve it that way. The answer to ghettoization is to allow people to come to the mainstream and to allow them to come together. Otherwise, what we essentially would be doing is to keep them in silos,"" observed the CJI.Justice Pardiwala observed that the teaching of religion has not been prohibited by the Constitution. The bench said that such religious instructions are not unique to the Muslim community and other religions have the same too.Muslim leaders and opposition parties welcomed the apex court's ruling on madrassa law in UP, urging the government to consult stakeholders for any reforms. Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind’s legal advisor, Maulana Kab Rashidi, warned against unconstitutional actions, promising legal challenges if necessary.BSP supremo Mayawati also praised the ruling, expressing hope it would end controversy over madrassa education and bring stability, especially in Uttar Pradesh.Commenting on the top court's decision, former CM and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav said, ""It's the UP govt which has been scolded the most by high court and Supreme Court. Time and again, the UP government has done unconstitutional work. It has forced the courts to interfere. I think all those decisions need to be turned down.""","Supreme Court upholds validity of Uttar Pradesh Board of Madrassa Education Act.

"Farmer claims park with Taj view, raises fences",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/farmer-claims-park-with-taj-view-raises-fences/articleshow/114957803.cms,"AGRA: Gyarah Sidi Park , an iconic spot across the Yamuna in Agra that provides a picturesque sunset view of Taj Mahal, is at the centre of a land dispute. Local farmer Munna Lal has claimed a chunk of the park as his own. A native of Nagla Devjit, Kachhpura, he insists he has won a “four-decade-long court battle for six bighas of ancestral land within the park”.Lal has ploughed the land with a tractor, raised fences and barricades, and declared it off-limits to public. Lal said his father and uncle were “registered cultivators” of the plot and it was lost to the urban ceiling action in 1976. District court documents from 1998 and 2020 confirm “transfer of ownership” to Lal.Agra divisional commissioner Ritu Maheshwari said the land falls within Agra Development Authority ’s jurisdiction. “Recent developments are being probed,” she said.M y family has fought a 40-year legal battle to secure this land. We’ve court orders and legal papers. In 2020, the office of the sub-divisional magistrate asserted our ownership over the land. This is also registered in revenue records,” Munna Lal told TOIon Monday.The park, managed by ADA and adjacent to the historic Mehtab Bagh, has been the focal point of various proposals, from hosting cultural events and beautification initiatives to plans for a museum. The ADA’s vision for the park was to transform it into a vibrant entertainment zone and cultural hub, providing a unique experience for locals and tourists alike.“Development of a theme park and entertainment zone along with a cultural activity zone at Garah Sidi near the Taj view point will create a lively recreational space that celebrates cultural heritage, offers diverse entertainment options, and enhances the visitor experience, making the area a vibrant and attractive destination for both locals and tourists (sic),” reads aportion in the ADA website.The park hosted the Taj Mahotsav cultural festival in 2023 and a concert by Greek composer Yanni in 1997. It is also home to an ancient observation structure, the Gyarah Sidi, believed to have been used by Mughal emperor Humayun as an observatory. Shakeel Chauhan, national general secretary of Tourist Guides’ Federation of India, said, “The park was a place to witness Taj in its full glory at sunset. This development puts a question mark over its future.”","M y family has fought a 40-year legal battle to secure this land. We’ve court orders and legal papers.

NEW DELHI: All the top 10 most polluted cities of India were from Delhi-National Capital Region in Oct, according to an analysis by Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Delhi was the most polluted city in the country in Oct with an average PM2.5 concentration of 111 micrograms per cubic metre, followed by Ghaziabad at 110 and Muzaffarnagar at 103. CREA monitored 263 cities in the country, whose pollution data on continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations was available for 80% of the year's days.According to the analysis, Ghaziabad, Muzaffarnagar, Hapur, Noida, Meerut, Charkhi Dadri, Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Bahadurgarh, all NCR cities, were identified as the second to tenth most polluted cities in India .

Uptick in man-wildlife conflicts in Ranthambore

JAIPUR: As many as 25 tigers, out of a population of around 75 in the tiger reserve in Ranthambore National Park (RNP) in Rajasthan, have ""disappeared"" within the last year, Rajasthan's chief wildlife warden Pavan Kumar Upadhyay told RNP authorities Monday.This is the first time such a large number of tigers has been reported missing, officially. In 2022, 13 tigers were reported to be missing from Ranthambore National Park. However, this happened over a three-year period, between Jan 2019 and Jan 2022.The high number of missing cats has triggered panic in Rajasthan, with the chief wildlife warden constituting a three-member committee on Monday to investigate the disappearance of the tigers. The committee will review the monitoring reports and recommend action against officials if any negligence by the park administration is found.The department's primary objective is to locate the 14 tigers which went missing in just four months, between May 17 and Sept 30, this year.An official order issued on Nov 4 said that reports of missing tigers have repeatedly emerged from monitoring the assessments within Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (RTR).""Despite several letters sent to RTR field director, no satisfactory changes have been observed. According to a report dated Oct 14, 2024, there has been no concrete evidence of 11 tigers for over a year, and substantial evidence of 14 others has not been obtained for less than a year. Given these circumstances, an inquiry committee has been constituted to investigate the matter of the missing tigers in Ranthambore,"" the order said.Talking to TOI, Upadhyay said, ""The committee will submit its report within two months. There are some monitoring lapses that we aim to address. Recently, I started gathering weekly monitoring reports, which revealed that these tigers were not recorded by the camera traps. Taking this situation seriously, the committee has been formed.""""The state forest department had shortlisted 24 villages in the buffer zone and periphery of RTR for relocation of villagers. The last such relocation took place in 2016, when families from two villages were moved. However, the process has been slow. To mitigate human-animal conflict, new programmes must be designed with the active involvement of local communities,"" said a retired official.Park managers, however, argue that the situation is more complex than it appears, as RTR faces several challenges, including overpopulation of tigers.The reserve, already overcrowded, has seen an increase in human-wildlife conflicts. Tigers, being inherently territorial and migratory, have started dispersing in search of larger, undisturbed areas where they can hunt, rest, and breed. In the congested park, many tigers perished in territorial disputes over access to prey and mates.According to sources, Ranthambore tigers are currently confined to a 900 sq km area. The situation is expected to worsen as both male and female tigers, particularly older ones, struggle to establish their own territories.""A Wildlife Institute of India study, conducted between 2006 and 2014, found that the carrying capacitiy of Ranthambore National Park and Sawai Man Singh Sanctuary is no more than 40 adult tigers. Currently, there are 75 tigers, including subadults and cubs. With more than 10 tigers per 100 sq km, territorial conflicts are forcing weaker animals to leave,"" an official stated.","Uptick in man-wildlife conflicts in Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan.

""That is an interesting law. It says you in your generation made wealth and you are leaving now, you must leave your wealth for the public, not all of it, half of it, which to me sounds fair,"" Pitroda had said while noting the absence of a similar law in India.This sparked a fight with BJP, with PM Narendra Modi slamming Congress's advocacy for wealth redistribution. In public meetings, he claimed that the proposal needed to be read along with former PM Manmohan Singh's thesis about minorities, especially Muslims, having the first right on national resources, which he said was a pursuit of vote bank politics in disguise. Congress refuted the charge.The govt's stand in the court was centred on drawing a distinction between a welfare state and the Marxian conception of community having the right to acquire the assets of individual citizens for its version of ""larger interest"".""In essence, the court has held that while Article 39(b) envisages distribution of material resources of the community for the common good, it would be hazardous to assume that such provisions allow commuting the entire national wealth by totalling the wealth of every citizen and distributing it equally among a particular section. The court has accepted the approach put forth by the Union govt and the Maharashtra govt,"" a govt source explained.A wider conception of what constitutes material resources of the community and whether it should extend to limit, even negate, right to private property was the source of many legal battles between the judiciary and an executive influenced by the socialistic pattern of community ownership of resources and the idea of interests of the community getting precedence over those of the individual citizen. The idea lost its sheen after the collapse of the Soviet Union and because of China's embrace of markets and because of economic liberalisation pursued by successive govts in India, beginning the 1990s.It was after a long gap that the issue figured in the political discourse, with Congress espousing it in the run-up to the campaign.",The Supreme Court held that the concept of'material resources' of the community could not be extend to cover assets of private citizens.

Every private property not a community resource: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-private-property-not-a-community-resource-sc/articleshow/114994231.cms,"1978 judgment reiterated by a five-judge bench ruling in 1982

NEW DELHI: A nine-judge Supreme Court bench Tuesday rescinded a 46-year-long socialist interpretation of Article 39(b) of Constitution to authoritatively rule that community resources cannot encompass every private property.By a seven-to-two majority judgment, authored by CJI D Y Chandrachud for himself and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, J B Pardiwala, Manoj Misra, Rajesh Bindal, S C Sharma and A G Masih, the apex court said it cannot subscribe to an expansion of the definition of community-owned material resources to bring in its ambit privately owned assets. Justice B V Nagarathna partially agreed with the CJI but Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia penned a dissent, adopting a socialist interpretation of Article 39(b).Article 39(b) says the State shall ""direct its policy towards securing that the ownership and control"" of material resources of the community ""are so distributed as best to subserve the common good"".The CJI said theoretically, material resources of the community may include privately owned resources. But he discarded the expansive socialist interpretation of Article 39(b) by Justice Krishna Iyer in the 1978 judgment to mean material resources of the community subsumed all privately owned resources.The 1978 judgment was reiterated by a five-judge bench ruling in 1982. In his 194-page opinion, the CJI said, ""Not every resource owned by an individual can be considered a 'material resource of the community' merely because it meets the qualifier of 'material needs'."" The majority verdict laid down a guideline to inquire whether a private property could be construed as 'material resources of the community' under Article 39(b).It said the inquiry must be context-specific and subject to a non-exhaustive list of factors - nature of the resource and its characteristics, impact of the resource on the well-being of the community, scarcity of the resource, and consequences of such a resource being concentrated in the hands of private players. ""The Public Trust Doctrine evolved by this court may also help identify resources which fall within the ambit of the phrase 'material resource of the community',"" SC said.Discussing the meaning of 'distribution' of material resources of the community so as to subserve common good, as mandated by Article 39(b) in the Directive Principles of State Policy chapter of the Constitution, the bench said though the state can adopt various means, including nationalisation of assets, constitutional courts will determine whether such distribution 'subserves the common good'.Though the concept of community ownership went out of vogue after the pursuit of liberalisation by successive govts, it continues to find adherents and muscled its way into the public discourse in April when Congress's Rahul Gandhi had mooted ""jitni aabadi, utna haq"" principle and explained, ""First, we will conduct a caste census... to know the exact population and status of backward castes, SCs, STs, minorities and other castes. After that, financial and institutional survey will begin. Subsequently, we will take up the historic assignment to distribute the wealth of India, jobs and other welfare schemes to these sections based on their population,"" he had said.During the arguments on the issue, Mehta had referred to Rahul's suggestion and told the SC, ""It would be a rustic and juvenile method to propose computing the nation's wealth by totalling the wealth of every citizen and distributing it equally among a particular section. Such ideas reflect a lack of understanding of economic development, governance, social welfare and the nation."" The bench discussed the transition of economic policy in India through the decades. It said the interpretation of Article 39(b) by Justices Iyer (1978) and O C Reddy (1982) were ""rooted in a particular economic ideology and the belief that an economic structure which prioritises acquisition of private property by the state is beneficial to the nation"".Justice Iyer, a known communist, had even cited Karl Marx in his 1980 judgment in Bhim Singhji case to observe that (state) taking over of large conglomerates of the land is necessary to make Article 39(b) a ""constitutional reality"". Referring to the vision of framers of the Constitution on the economic policies to be adopted by the country, the CJI said, ""The Constitution was framed in broad terms to allow succeeding governments to experiment with and adopt a structure for economic governance which would subserve the policies for which it owes accountability to the electorate.""Frowning at the SC adopting a particular economic structure for interpretation of the Constitution, the majority opinion said, ""The role of this court is not to lay down economic policy, but to facilitate this intent of the framers to lay down the foundation for an 'economic democracy'."" The SC said during the nascent years of the nation, there was a mixed economic policy, which in the 1960s and 70s shifted to a socialist pattern. ""Since the decade of the 1990s, or the liberalisation years, there has been a shift towards pursuing a policy of market-based reforms,"" it said.

""I must record here my strong disapproval of the remarks made on the Krishna Iyer Doctrine as it is called. This criticism is harsh and could have been avoided,"" he said.The majority opinion of seven judges, authored by CJI Chandrachud, criticised Justice Iyer's minority interpretation of Article 39(b) in 1978 in Ranganatha Reddy case and also faulted the adoption of the minority view in Sanjeev Coke (1982) case judgment by a five-judge bench, which included Justice Nagarathna's father Justice E S Venkataramiah who went on to become CJI in 1989.CJI Chandrachud said, ""The majority judgment in Ranganatha Reddy expressly distanced itself from the observations made by Justice Krishna Iyer (speaking on behalf of the minority of judges) on the interpretation of Article 39(b). Thus, a coequal bench of this court in Sanjeev Coke violated judicial discipline and erred by relying on the minority opinion.""This was not taken kindly by Justice Nagarathna, who said, ""Judgments in Ranganatha Reddy, Sanjeev Coke, Abu Kavur Bai and Basantibai correctly decided the issues that fell for consideration and do not call for any interference on the merits of the matters and as explained above. The observations of the judges in those decisions would not call for any critique in the present times. Neither is it justified nor warranted.""""Can principles of liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation adopted in India since 1991, reforms in the economy and structural changes that have been brought about in these last three decades hold a mirror against the socio-economic policies that were followed in the decades immediately after India attained independence?"" she asked. ""Can we castigate former judges... for reaching a particular interpretive outcome?"" she added.""It is a matter of concern as to how the judicial brethren of posterity view the judgments of the brethren of the past, possibly by losing sight of the times in which the latter discharged their duties and the socio-economic policies that were pursued by the state and formed part of the constitutional culture during those times,"" Justice Nagarathna, who will take over as India's first woman CJI in 2027, said.In his judgment, Justice Dhulia said, ""The Krishna Iyer Doctrine, or for that matter the O Chinnappa Reddy Doctrine (in Sanjeev Coke judgment), is familiar to all who have anything to do with law or life. It is based on strong humanist principles of fairness and equity. It is a doctrine which has illuminated our path in dark times.""The long body of their judgment is not just a reflection of their perspicacious intellect but more importantly of their empathy for the people, as human beings were at the centre of their judicial philosophy. In the words of Justice Krishna Iyer himself, 'the courts too have a constituency - the nation - and a manifesto - the Constitution'.""","Justice B V Nagarathna took issue with CJI D Y Chandrachud's comments on the Justice Krishna Iyer Doctrine.

Kesavananda Bharati judgment upheld this part of Art 31C.However, it had struck down the second part of Article 31C, which said no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy.Through the 42nd amendment, Parliament had amended Article 31C to expand its scope much beyond clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39 and in its place incorporated ""all or any principle laid down in Part IV - Directive Principles"". Minerva Mills judgment struck down this amendment restoring the shape of Article 31C to a position existing after the Kesavananda judgment.The question before the nine-judge bench was: ""Whether Article 31C (as upheld in Kesavananda Bharati) survives in the Constitution after the amendment to the provision by the 42nd amendment was struck down by this court in Minerva Mills?""Writing the majority opinion, the CJI said Parliament through 42nd amendment had intended to expand the immunity to laws incorporating provisions of directive principles and that it cannot be suggested that Parliament would have repealed the words ""the principles specified in clause (b) or clause (c) of Article 39"" as originally existed in Article 31C.""After Minerva Mills invalidated Section 4 of the 42nd amendment, the composite legal effect of Section 4 is nullified and the unamended text of Article 31C stands revived,"" the bench said.""The text of the unamended Article 31C was challenged, and the first part of the Article was upheld by 13-judge decision in Kesavananda Bharati while the latter half of the Article was invalidated. Therefore, the first half of unamended Article 31C, which is the subject matter of the present controversy, was undoubtedly constitutional...

NEW DELHI: Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK) has introduced a new admission pathway for its BTech and BS programmes, allowing top-performing students from international Olympiads to gain entry. This pathway, set to commence in the 2025-26 academic year, provides an alternative to the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Advanced for exceptionally talented students who excel in international Olympiads in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and informatics.Reserved seats will be available across five departments: biological sciences and bioengineering, computer science and engineering, chemistry, economic sciences, and mathematics and statistics.This initiative is designed for students with a strong foundation in Olympiad subjects and allows them to bypass the conventional JEE route to pursue studies in their areas of expertise at IITK.To be eligible, candidates must meet the age requirements for JEE (Advanced) candidates, and should have completed their class XII (or equivalent) with physics, chemistry, and mathematics as compulsory subjects. Additionally, they must have attended a relevant Olympiad training camp in the subject they are applying for. Students previously admitted to IITs through JoSAA or those who had an IIT admission cancelled are ineligible for this route.The selection process includes two stages. In the first, each department will shortlist applicants based on their Olympiad rankings.Shortlisted candidates will then undergo a mandatory written exam and, if necessary, an interview.A selection committee, led by the dean of academic affairs, will consolidate recommendations from each department, ensuring efficient and fair placement for all reserved seats without any overlap.Professor Shalabh, dean of academic affairs at IITK , highlighted the purpose of this new pathway, stating, ""Our Olympiad-based admissions initiative is crafted to welcome the brightest minds from international competitions. We aim to foster a diverse academic environment rich in innovation and critical thinking. This program seeks to enhance our academic community with students who bring unique perspectives and exceptional analytical abilities, supporting innovation in disciplines crucial for India's growth and global competitiveness.""Applications for this pathway will open in early March 2025 and close by the end of the month.Each department will conduct its assessments by May, allowing ample time for screening and final selections.","Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK) has introduced a new admission pathway for its BTech and BS programmes.

Donald Trump vs Kamala Harris: What’s in it for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-vs-kamala-harris-whats-in-it-for-india/articleshow/114984387.cms,"

Human rights



Murder-for-hire



The emphasis on bipartisan support for India-US ties has been the leitmotif of political discourse in both countries about the relationship that is seen by many as among the most consequential for this century. For over two decades, India-US relations have been marked by steady growth driven as much by strategic convergence as an organic development of people-to-people ties.In the circumstances, it goes without saying that the presidential election in the US next week is unlikely to have any impact on the broad contours of the relationship. However, India will be alert to how a Trump or Harris presidency might have a bearing on cooperation on some key issues and challenges:Keeping the landmark initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET), which was launched by Biden and Modi, going is among India’s foremost priorities as access to cutting edge technology in areas like defence, AI and quantum technologies is important for its growth and security. Dismantling regulatory barriers, the initiative allows India and the US to accelerate cooperation in joint development and production of advanced defence systems with focus on jet engines and munition-related technologies.Amid concern about the delay in implementation of the GE-HAL deal for manufacturing jet engines, US ambassador to India Eric Garcetti tells TOI the agreement is “100 percent on track” and the US remains excited about it. While no American president will wreck this partnership, given also the need for the US to have India on its side in the technology war with China, the Americans will work to ensure no sensitive, dual-use technology is passed on to Russia.India’s biggest concern with a potential Trump presidency comes from its likely restrictive trade and immigration policies. It was Trump who ended India’s preferential trade status under the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) in 2019 for its alleged failure to provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets. Trump has threatened to launch a tariff war against China and he’s unlikely to spare countries like India, which he described as a tariff abuser, and Brazil at a time even the Democrats stand accused of pandering to the protectionist sentiment. A mini trade deal under discussion during the Trump presidency also fell through as neither side was willing to compromise on tariffs.Harris is expected to have a more nuanced approach on trade even though she, like Biden, is unlikely to dismantle the Trump-imposed higher tariffs. That’s still a better alternative though than Trump’s proposed reciprocal trade/ tariff act that could disrupt supply chains across the world. On immigration, any return of some of the H1B regulations that Trump attempted during his presidency, like higher wage requirements for foreign workers, will be bad news for the Indian IT sector.The convergence on China, as reflected in the growing Indo-Pacific partnership and Quad, will continue to act as a guiding factor in the relationship irrespective of who the president is. Notwithstanding efforts to normalize ties with China, which are still at an inchoate stage, India will need to build geopolitical leverages against Beijing and there’s perhaps no better way of doing it than to hit the gas in terms of its cooperation with like-minded countries in the region. While Harris is expected to broadly follow in Biden’s footsteps, India and several other partners might have some worries about possible unpredictability or incoherence and little regard for multilateralism under a Trump presidency. India, however, will take heart from the fact that it was under Trump that Quad was elevated to the ministerial level, foundational agreements for force interoperability were signed and India-US 2+2 ministerial dialogue was launched. For India, the convergence with Trump on issues like counterterrorism was also important.Given her track record, this is an issue Harris is hardwired to addressing all over the world and there’s no reason to believe she won’t prioritize it in talks with India if she indeed becomes the first woman to occupy the White House. It’s also one of the reasons why the Indian right wing, despite Harris’ Indian ancestry, believes Trump, who is unlikely to get into a lather over domestic Indian developments, might prove to be a better president for India. However, while Harris can be expected to be more vocal on concerns about democratic backsliding and declining religious freedom in India, she will ultimately defer likely to following American interests in ties with India, as she has done on the Gaza war by not breaking ranks with the president despite her concerns over the humanitarian situation.While human rights may not be a deal-breaker, this latest and unfortunate entrant into the list of India-US outstanding issues can potentially stymie progress in ties. Harris can be expected to pursue the Biden administration’s focus on ensuring accountability, without doing a Justin Trudeau on India, and the Indian government may have to find a way of addressing American calls for action. As Garcetti recently told TOI in an interview, there’s too much at stake for both countries to not handle the case properly. Trump’s return could ease some of the political pressure on India but it’s unlikely US prosecutors will not pursue the case as diligently or aggressively as they are doing now. Significantly, the US has expressed satisfaction so far over the progress in the Indian probe into the case.",India-US relations have been marked by steady growth driven as much by strategic convergence as an organic development of people-to-people ties. India will be alert to how a Trump or Harris presidency might have a bearing on cooperation on some key issues and challenges.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114984358,imgsize-25186,width-400,resizemode-4/114984358.jpg"
Kamala Harris or Donald Trump? 10 charts to explain who Indian-Americans are likely to vote for in 2024 US elections,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-or-donald-trump-10-charts-to-explain-who-indian-americans-are-likely-to-vote-for-in-2024-us-elections/articleshow/114844660.cms,"Mixed bag of sentiments for Harris

Key poll issues



Healthcare and economy: Like many other voters, Indian-Americans prioritise domestic issues such as healthcare and economic stability over foreign policy concerns. These ""kitchen table"" issues dominate their electoral considerations.

Abortion and reproductive rights: Abortion rights have emerged as a significant concern for many voters within this community, particularly among women. The survey indicates that reproductive rights rank as a vital issue for Indian Americans, influencing their support for candidates like Harris.

Gender divide: A pronounced gender gap exists within voting preferences. While 67% of Indian-American women plan to vote for Harris, only 53% of men express similar intentions. This division highlights differing priorities between genders, with men increasingly leaning towards Republican candidates like Donald Trump .

Increasing Republican interest

Perception of economic policies: Some Indian-American voters are drawn to Republican economic policies that emphasize lower taxes and business-friendly regulations.

Cultural resonance: Trump's strong stance on immigration and his populist rhetoric may resonate with certain segments of the Indian-American community, particularly younger men who are increasingly aligning with conservative values.

How Indian-Americans are likely to vote

Democratic commitment declines: Indian Americans remain predominantly Democratic, with 47% identifying as Democrats, a decrease from 56% in 2020. The proportion of independents has increased, indicating a shift in political alignment within the community.

Support for Kamala Harris: 61% of registered Indian American voters plan to support Kamala Harris in the upcoming election, while 32% intend to vote for Donald Trump. This marks a modest increase in Republican support compared to previous elections.

Emerging gender gap: A significant gender gap exists in voting preferences, with 67% of Indian American women supporting Harris, compared to only 53% of men. Conversely, 22% of women and 39% of men plan to vote for Trump, highlighting differing priorities among genders.

Mixed views on Indian-American Republicans: Indian-Americans generally hold lukewarm views towards prominent Indian-American Republicans like Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy , indicating a lack of enthusiasm for Republican candidates despite some engagement from the party.

and , indicating a lack of enthusiasm for Republican candidates despite some engagement from the party. Abortion as a key issue: Abortion and reproductive rights are crucial issues for Indian-Americans this election cycle, ranking it as their second-most-important policy concern, especially among Democrats and women.

Policy discrepancies drive Republican disadvantage: The Republican Party's struggles with Indian-American voters stem from policy misalignments, particularly regarding issues like minority rights and abortion, which many community members find incompatible with Republican stances.

With just days to go before the 2024 US presidential election, Indian-Americans, who constitute a significant and growing demographic in the electorate, are poised to play a crucial role in determining the outcome. With approximately 5.2 million Indian-Americans in the US, around 2.6 million of whom are eligible voters, their political preferences are increasingly influential, particularly in key battleground states.Historically, Indian-Americans have leaned heavily towards the Democratic Party. However, recent surveys indicate a notable shift in this allegiance.According to the 2024 Indian American Attitudes Survey, only 47% of Indian-Americans now identify as Democrats, a decline from 56% in 2020. This drop suggests a growing discontent with the Democratic Party, particularly among younger voters and men within the community.The support for Kamala Harris , the Democratic candidate and current vice president of Indian descent, is also showing signs of decline.Approximately 61% of Indian-American respondents expressed their intention to vote for Harris , which reflects a decrease of nearly 7 percentage points compared to Joe Biden 's support in 2020.This trend may indicate that while Harris's candidacy initially galvanised enthusiasm among Indian-Americans, it has not sustained the same level of support as seen in previous elections.The response of the Indian-American community to Kamala Harris is characterised by a blend of excitement about representation and cautious skepticism based on broader political concerns.Many Indian-Americans are excited about Harris due to her Indian heritage, which resonates deeply within the community, but Indian-Americans do not vote as a monolithic bloc.A significant portion remains aligned with the Republican Party, and many are not swayed by Harris’s candidacy. For instance, some Republican supporters express skepticism regarding her commitment to issues important to them, such as immigration reform.Some community members also feel that Harris downplays her Indian identity in favor of her African American heritage.As the election approaches, her ability to bridge these sentiments will be crucial in securing their votes amidst a diverse array of perspectives within this influential demographic.Several factors are also influencing the voting behavior of Indian Americans this election cycle:Interestingly, there is a growing interest among Indian-Americans in Republican candidates.Support for Trump has risen to 31%, reflecting a modest increase compared to previous elections. Factors contributing to this shift include:The study suggests that the Indian-American community continues to show strong support for the Democratic Party, particularly for candidates like Kamala Harris, but that there are notable shifts that could influence electoral outcomes.The decline in Democratic identification and the rising interest in Republican candidates, especially among younger men, suggest a potential realignment that both parties must heed.As Indian-Americans solidify their role as a pivotal voting bloc, their decisions in the 2024 elections will not only impact local and national races but also reflect broader trends in American politics, making it essential for candidates to understand and address the unique perspectives of the influential community.","According to the 2024 Indian American Attitudes Survey, only 47% of Indian- Americans now identify as Democrats, a decline from 56% in 2020.

The 2024 US election is expected to be influenced by high voter turnout and a significant increase in mail-in ballots, which could result in vote counts continuing well past election night in various states. While some states are projected to report almost all results by the next day, others may experience delays due to a combination of mail-in ballots, provisional votes, and late-arriving ballots. Each state has different counting processes and deadlines, leading to variations in early vote reporting. This is likely to cause temporary shifts in vote tallies, particularly in swing states, where initial results from mail-in ballots may favour Democratic candidates, while same-day in-person voting could show early leads for Republicans.Moreover, the need for provisional voting in certain states for voters switching from mail-in to in-person voting adds further complexity to the situation. This summary provides anticipated timelines for counting votes across states, including polling hours, the types of ballots expected to be reported first, and policies regarding the acceptance of late-arriving mail ballots. Given the high stakes and numerous closely contested races, election observers will need to exercise patience as officials work diligently to ensure an accurate and comprehensive vote count.",Here are the expected polling opening and closing times for each state.

As the world’s largest economy and strongest military power, the United States, approaches its presidential election on November 5, the stakes are high for many countries, including world's largest democracy, India.The US presidential polls could have substantial consequences for global stability and growth, especially given the distinct policy differences between Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump . The global economy, including India’s own economic landscape, may experience major shifts based on the outcome of this pivotal vote.The United Nations has dubbed 2024 ""the biggest election year in human history."" With nearly half the world’s population eligible to vote, including people across 72 countries, the significance of certain elections overshadows others. Among them, the US election stands out as one of the most consequential. As the US heads to the polls, the world watches with bated breath, aware that American leadership has far-reaching implications across continents.If former president and Republican nominee Donald Trump wins his second term, India’s future relationship with the United States can possibly take a new direction. Trump, who has shown a keen interest in enhancing ties with India, has made public commitments to strengthening what he calls the “great partnership” between the two nations. In a recent post on X, timed just ahead of the US election, Trump reaffirmed his friendship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi , celebrating their close diplomatic relationship.In his strategic outreach to the Indian diaspora, Trump condemned the recent violence against Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh, where reports indicate significant attacks on the Hindu community.This statement comes amid complex South Asian geopolitics, with former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reportedly seeking refuge in India following her ouster. Trump’s message underscores his intent to uphold security and respect for minorities in South Asia, signaling potential shifts in US foreign policy under his administration.""Kamala and Joe have ignored Hindus across the world and in America. They have been a disaster from Israel to Ukraine to our own southern border, but we will make America strong again and bring back peace through strength!"" former US president said in a Diwali message on X.Hindu American groups also have applauded Trump for promising to protect the human rights of Hindus across the world, including the US and Bangladesh and protect them from the ""anti-religion agenda of the radical left.""The friendship between Trump and Modi is not new. Their camaraderie was vividly displayed at the 2019 “Howdy, Modi!” event in Texas, where Trump hosted Modi in front of a crowd of 50,000, one of the largest US gatherings for a foreign leader. In early 2020, Trump reciprocated with a visit to India for the ""Namaste Trump"" event in Ahmedabad, attended by over 100,000 people at the world’s largest cricket stadium. These high-profile events reflect a mutual admiration, with Trump praising PM Modi’s leadership and India’s economic progress.PM Modi’s “India first” vision aligns with Trump’s “America First” platform, with both leaders emphasising domestic growth, economic nationalism, and secure borders. Their similar ideologies have fostered an alignment of US-India interests, which could deepen further should Trump win the election. Trump’s emphasis on strategic partnerships may lead to closer economic and defense collaboration with India, impacting areas from trade to military cooperation.A Trump administration would likely pursue US-centric trade policies, pushing India to reduce trade barriers or face tariffs. This could impact key Indian sectors like IT, pharmaceuticals, and textiles, which have considerable US market exports. Trump has been vocal about his concerns over India’s tariffs, calling the country an “abuser” on the matter while recognizing Modi as a “fantastic man.” By pushing for balanced trade, Trump’s approach may challenge India to recalibrate its trade strategies, though it also opens doors for potential opportunities.Trump’s opposition to China, particularly regarding trade and security, may benefit India. His administration’s push to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing could encourage US companies to diversify their supply chains. With favorable policies, India could attract these companies, positioning itself as an alternative production hub and potentially accelerating economic growth.Trump’s previous administration reinforced the Quad—a security partnership between the US, India, Japan, and Australia—to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Under Trump’s leadership, a second term would likely see a continuation of joint military exercises, arms sales, and technology transfers. Such defence collaboration would bolster India’s military capabilities, especially given its tensions with neighboring countries like China and Pakistan.Trump’s restrictive immigration policies, particularly concerning the H-1B visa program, have affected many Indian professionals in the US. If re-elected, Trump may revive these policies, creating obstacles for skilled Indian workers and potentially impacting sectors dependent on Indian talent, especially technology. Stricter immigration policies could prompt Indian tech firms to explore alternative markets or invest more domestically, creating new dynamics in the global talent landscape.Trump’s South Asia policies may impact India’s regional interests. Though he has shown a willingness to cooperate with Pakistan, Trump has also demanded accountability in counter-terrorism. His “Peace through strength” approach could signal a tougher US stance on terrorism and extremism, aligning with India’s own security concerns. A Trump-led US may exert more pressure on Pakistan to curb militant activities, potentially benefiting India’s security objectives.","The US presidential polls could have substantial consequences for global stability and growth.

Tom Brady won't be fined by the NFL for criticizing the officials for ejecting Brian Branch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-brady-wont-be-fined-by-the-nfl-for-criticizing-the-officials-for-ejecting-brian-branch/articleshow/114966749.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

The NFL won't fine Tom Brady for criticizing the officials

Tom Brady doesn't know what he's allowed to do in his new role as Fox's lead NFL analyst, since the league has prohibited him from criticizing officials because of his Raiders stake. There may be some wiggle room, since Brady won't be disciplined for his comments during the Packers-Lions game on Sunday, during which Lions defensive back Brian Branch was flagged for unnecessary roughness. Branch was tossed following a review from New York.Critics of the referees usually attract five-figure fines, and fines vary with circumstances. The NFL has fined the Chiefs coach Andy Reid $100,000 during last season, and owners rarely cross the line; a case in point being Steelers owner Dan Rooney being fined $25,000 back in 2006.Also Read: Tom Brady appeared to break NFL rules as he criticized the decision to eject the Detroit Lions' Brian Branch against the Green Bay Packers Tom Brady and Kevin Burkhardt called the NFC North rivalry game between the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers for FOX. Brady, who does not have the freedom to speak about officials because he owns part of the Las Vegas Raiders, did ultimately criticize a major call that occurred after Brian Branch was ejected from the game for an illegal hit to the head.An NFL spokesperson clarified that Brady will not face discipline for his comments on Monday. ""The concern would be if Tom was egregiously critical of officiating or called into question the integrity of an official or the crew. That did not occur in this instance,"" NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy told Ben Fischer of Sports Business Journal.Brady's shots at the referees were not harsh enough to bring any form of punishment from the NFL. He was to make ""egregious"" or integrity-questioning critique of officials to face any form of punishment. Brady said he did not like the call, but it has to be serious intent in a game like this. As a minority stakeholder in the Raiders, he was also barred from visiting non-Raiders facilities and attending production meetings.The NFL typically fines a player a five-figure sum who attacks the referees, while fines vary with circumstances. Chiefs coach Andy Reid was fined $100,000 last year, while owners hardly ever cross the line or get punished. Steelers owner Dan Rooney was fined $25,000 for attacking officials in 2006. Raiders, Fox, and the NFL Referees Association haven't made any comments about this issue.Also Read: Tom Brady’s game-worn jersey from the 2000 Orange Bowl is estimated to be sold between $150,000 and $250,000","The NFL won't fine Tom Brady for criticizing the officials during the Packers- Lions game.

Potential Effects of Trump's Victory on India

Potential Effects of Harris's Victory on India

Historical US Market Performance Analysis:

US Elections : Financial markets appear to be positioning for a Donald Trump victory and Republican dominance in the upcoming November 5 US presidential election, despite the race remaining undecided, according to an ET report.Analysts suggest that a Kamala Harris victory would maintain current economic conditions with minimal market impact, while a Trump win could significantly affect emerging markets, equities, and currencies through reduced globalization policies.""If Trump is elected as President, it could imply higher rates, gold prices, and global USD regime than our base-case forecasts, while crude prices could be lower. A Harris victory could mean that the markets could trade closer to our base-case projections with rates likely to ease and global USD to trade flat,"" ICICI Bank's head of economic research Sameer Narang said.Financial experts indicate that among emerging economies, India could benefit from a Trump presidency due to its domestic consumption-focused growth, potential advantages from reduced commodity prices, supply chain alterations, and foreign relations.A Trump administration's restrictive trade policies could sustain strong US growth, potentially leading to Wall Street's superior performance compared to global markets.Also Read | ‘Mr Modi is fantastic…’: Prem Watsa, known as ‘Canada’s Warren Buffett’, says India can grow at 10% under PM Modi This scenario could trigger increased yields, particularly in long-term securities, as investors anticipate higher supply. ICICI Bank analysts predict stronger US dollar performance, decreased Brent crude prices, lower global base metal prices affecting Chinese growth, and elevated gold prices due to increased safe-haven demand.ICICI Bank projects that with Trump's victory, the US 10-year Treasury yield could reach 4.40%-4.50%, while the Dollar Index might rise to 105-106, potentially reaching 106.50 by December 2024.Nomura's analysis suggests India's predominantly domestic demand-driven economy would experience limited negative effects from slower US growth.According to Nomura's Sonal Varma, India could actually benefit from reduced commodity prices resulting from decreased Chinese growth and lower oil prices, influenced by increased fossil fuel production.A decrease in crude oil prices would benefit Indian oil marketing companies including BPCL, IOCL, and HPCL, while potentially negatively affecting ONGC, Oil India, and GAIL.Also Read | PM Modi highlights Mark Mobius’ ‘love for India’; says renowned global investor believes 50% should be invested in Indian stock market A Harris victory in the election would likely maintain current global and US economic structures, with expectations of a gradual economic alignment between the US and other nations influencing mid-term market dynamics.ICICI Bank indicates that various financial markets, including equities, energy, gold, base metals, and the US dollar, would likely remain stable without significant fluctuations.""In case of a Harris victory, we see the UST 10yr moving to the 4.00%-4.10% range and the DXY trading in the 101.50-103.50 range by December 2024. Global commodity prices could trade flat if Harris wins,"" it said.India's export performance to the US could benefit under Democratic leadership, considering the positive trade relationship during Biden's administration. According to Phillip Capital, Harris's anticipated support for skilled immigration policies would benefit India's IT sector.The Dow Jones, excluding recession-related declines, increased 28% under Bush, 78% during Obama's presidency, and 54% under Trump, while Biden's current term shows 41% growth.The Indian markets showed substantial growth during different US presidencies: Bush's term saw a 200% increase, Obama's presidency witnessed 55% growth, Trump's tenure recorded 63% gains, and Biden's administration has achieved 89% growth so far.","Financial markets appear to be positioning for a Donald Trump victory and Republican dominance in the upcoming November 5 US presidential election.

Raquel Rodriguez’s quiet love life and rising WWE career

WWE star Raquel Rodriguez is the newest member of The Judgement Day. Despite having been in WWE for almost a decade, Raquel is only 32-years-old. She is one of the more prominent female stars on the WWE roster, but much isn’t known about her relationship status, so it would be safe to assume that the 32-year-old is single. Raquel had previously been in a relationship with WWE superstar Braun Strowman.The two were very public with their relationship and would constantly post pictures of each other on social media. However, throughout the last year or so, fans have noticed that Braun and Raquel have unfollowed each other on social media. That’s not all, Raquel and Strowman have also deleted all of their pictures as well.Now, fans believe that the two have split up, which is likely the case, but the same has never been confirmed by Strowman or Raquel. Here’s what Strowman had to say when asked about teaming up with Raquel in an interview with Sportskeeda:Also Read: WWE Raw Results and Highlights 11/4 While Rodriguez’s dating life hasn’t been all that glorious, the same cannot be said about her time in the ring. Raquel has held the WWE Women’s Tag Team Championship thrice in her career, she is also a winner of the WWE NXT Women's Tag Team Champion twice and the NXT Women’s Championship once.If it wasn’t for her seven-month hiatus this year, she might have added more titles to her already impressive resume. Currently, Rodriguez is going strong as the newest member of the Judgment Day and thanks to her help, Liv Morgan was able to put Rhea Ripley on the sidelines once again.With the way that Rodriguez has been developing, it’s clear that her focus lies on her career inside the ring. Her love life may be silent, but Raquel's work in the ring does the talking for her.

Nifty, after hitting a low at 23,843 points, rallied to close at 24,213 points, up 218 points or 0.9%.According to Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services, the domestic market experienced a sharp recovery, reclaiming most of the previous day’s losses despite uncertainty surrounding the likely downgrade in Q2 GDP forecast and closely contested US presidential election . “However, the recent rebound in domestic manufacturing activity data, along with the expected revival of consumption in the H2, are likely to support market sentiment. Metals led the gains, driven by the anticipation of significant stimulus from China later this week,” he said.During the day, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net sellers at Rs 2,569 crore, while domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 3,031 crore, BSE data showed.Starting Oct, FPIs have been net sellers in the secondary market in each session. Over this period, they have net sold stocks worth more than Rs 1 lakh crore, translating to a little over $11 billion, NSDL data showed.Market volatility is expected to remain elevated in the next few days, mainly because of the uncertainty about the outcome of the US presidential election. “Nervousness around the US presidential election outcome continues as it can result in major global policy shifts,” said Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services. “The market’s recovery in the final hour (of Tuesday) was fuelled by short covering ahead of the US election results and after sharp fall (on Monday). We expect markets to remain volatile on the back of global factors with stock specific action as index heavy weights announce quarterly results during the next few days,” Khemka said in a note to investors.","The sensex on Tuesday rallied over 1,200 points from the day’s low to end nearly 700 points higher as banking and metal stocks led the surge. The relief rally came on the back of speculative buying in the mid-session, backed by short covering by traders. Foreign players, however, remained major sellers in the market while domestic funds were buyers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114991470,imgsize-1382788,width-400,resizemode-4/114991470.jpg"

HYDERABAD: House listing for the BC survey is scheduled to begin on Wednesday. This marks the first stage of the survey process, which will last for three days, leading up to the actual survey on Nov 9.An estimated 1.10 crore households will be assessed and precise figures will be gathered during the listing phase. A set of 56 questions was finalised recently, after which a few changes such as the age when individuals got married have been incorporated. The survey has a question on the marital status of citizens as well.Data from revenue records, municipal information and the 2011 Census will be utilised to compile the number of households in each district as part of the initial data collection. Once the listing is completed, stickers will be affixed to the doors, indicating the date when staff will return to gather feedback on the survey questions.Sources indicated that while some questions from the preliminary draft may be removed, the survey will still be comprehensive. Discussions regarding these changes continued late into Tuesday night, sources said.Each enumerator will be assigned 150 households for the listing process. However, data from the previous Samagra Kutumba Survey will not be utilised for mapping households. ""Enumeration blocks created by the Census department's methodology will be employed in this instance,"" a source said.Enumerators will visit each household twice, and if a household is locked, they will note them as locked. ""There is a possibility that a helpline may be set up for households that are missing from the listing,"" a source said.Importantly, presenting an actual caste certificate will not be necessary for the survey. However, there will be a question regarding whether members possess caste certificates or not.Starting Wednesday, a campaign to propagate the survey will be conducted in mandals, with data being collected and recorded daily once the survey commences, officials said.","An estimated 1.10 crore households will be assessed and precise figures will be gathered during the listing phase.

Left parties drifting apart after joining INDIA: CPM,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/left-parties-drifting-apart-after-joining-india-cpm/articleshow/114992671.cms,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The distance between Left parties has grown since they became part of the INDIA bloc , suggests CPM's draft political resolution for its 24th congress early next year. It accuses the CPI and CPI(ML) caucus of sacrificing the cause of ""Left unity"" for a broader, poll-based alliance.According to the draft, the only instance in the past three years of the Left troika speaking in one voice was on Israel's onslaught on Gaza. But even then, they were ""unable to initiate joint action and strengthen Left unity, as desired"". ""A major reason for the failure to initiate joint action and activities at the national level was the disinterest of CPI and CPI(ML) for a joint Left platform ever since the moves for a wider opposition unity began,"" the draft states.The resolution says CPI and CPI(ML) were so invested in INDIA bloc ahead of the Lok Sabha elections earlier this year that the Left parties couldn't meet once during that period for collective strategising and action.The draft alleges CPI's unwillingness to work together based on shared ideology is why a Left Front doesn't exist in several states. ""In Tamil Nadu, this foiled efforts to identify forces that could be part of a Left Democratic Front . It is, therefore, necessary first and foremost to arrive at a common understanding with CPI on the need for such a front,"" the draft states. It says CPM needs to expand its base to counter ""RSS/Hindutva forces"" and their activities.
