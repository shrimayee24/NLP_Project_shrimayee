Nevertheless, certain parts of the country may still face 'below normal' rainfall like what eight states experienced in July.""During the second half of the monsoon season, normal to above normal rainfall is most likely over most parts of the country, except many parts of northeast and adjoining areas of east India, Ladakh, Saurashtra & Kutch, and some isolated pockets of central and peninsular India where below normal rainfall is likely,"" said IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.Releasing the forecast for Aug, Mohapatra said ""normal to above normal rainfall"" is likely over many parts of the country this month, except many areas in southern parts of central and adjoining northern peninsular India, northeast and adjoining areas of east India, some parts of northwest and south peninsular India, where below normal rainfall is likely.Though the country recorded 11% deficit monsoon rainfall in June, the sowing operations in many parts of the country continued unabated with the help of irrigation using groundwater. Despite a skewed distribution of rainfall, July finally logged out with 9% more rains than normal.

Collision with Sri Lanka navy vessel kills fisherman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/collision-with-sri-lanka-navy-vessel-kills-fisherman/articleshow/112205731.cms,"NEW DELHI: India on Thursday summoned the Sri Lankan acting high commissioner and registered a strong protest over the collision earlier in the day between a Lankan navy vessel and an Indian fishing boat that left an Indian fisherman dead.Another Indian fisherman was reported missing after the collision.Indian government expressed shock and anguish at the loss of life and the Indian high commissioner in Colombo, Santosh Jha, also raised the matter with the Lankan govt later on Thursday.Recalling that India has always emphasised the need to deal with issues pertaining to fishermen in a humane and humanitarian manner, Indian authorities told the Lankan govt that existing understandings between the two govts in that regard must be strictly observed. ""Utmost efforts should be made to ensure that there is no recurrence or resort to the use of force,"" said the Indian govt in a statement.The collision was reported five nautical miles north of Katchatheevu Island. Out of the four Indian fishermen who were on board the vessel, one unfortunately lost his life and another is missing, according to the Indian govt.""Two of the fishermen have been rescued and brought ashore to Kankesanthurai.

Indian consulate officials in Jaffna have been instructed to immediately rush to Kankesanthurai and extend all possible assistance to the fishermen and their families,'' it said, adding that India attaches the highest priority to the safety and security of Indian fishermen. Issues relating to Indian fishermen have been raised regularly at the highest levels with the Sri Lankan leadership, it said.This is the second such incident reported between a Lankan naval vessel and an Indian fishing boat in recent times.In June, Sri Lanka had registered a protest with India for the death of a navy sailor who was killed while attempting to seize an Indian vessel allegedly poaching in Lankan waters. The sailor sustained critical injuries due to ""the aggressive manoeuvres of the Indian trawler, resisting its seizure"".Sri Lanka had detained 10 Indian fishermen for causing the death of the sailor. The MEA had later raised the issue with Lankan authorities and sought their release.

The Indian PM said new steps were being taken to increase defence and security cooperation , including the inauguration of an army software park in the coastal city of Nha Trang.A powerful pillar of India’s Act East policy, Vietnam has seen ties with its Communist neighbour improve lately, and President Xi Jinping visited Hanoi last year, but it remains, like some of its other Asean neighbours, at the receiving end of China’s expansive and contested nine-dash line claim over SCS waters.""We share unison in our views regarding the Indo-Pacific region. We will continue our cooperation for a free, open, rules-based and prosperous Indo-Pacific,’’ said Modi, adding they also emphasised cooperation on the issues of terrorism and cyber security.Apart from the credit lines that will be used by Vietnam for defence procurement, and the plan of action for the implementation of the comprehensive strategic partnership during the 2024-2028, the 2 sides signed 7 other agreements. Pham said in his media statement both sides agreed to share information and work together to ensure peace and stability in SCS. In a joint statement, the leaders reaffirmed the importance of freedom of navigation and overflight in the SCS, while pursuing the peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS ), without resorting to threat or use of force.Following the recent escalation in China-Philippines tensions over their dispute in SCS, both leaders underscored the importance of non-militarisation and self-restraint in the conduct of all activities by claimants and all other states, and ``avoidance of actions that could further complicate the situation or escalate disputes affecting peace and stability’’.""Both leaders emphasized the legal framework set out by the UNCLOS within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out, and that UNCLOS is the basis for determining maritime entitlements, sovereign rights, jurisdiction and legitimate interests over maritime zones,"" said the joint statement. India had earlier this week joined Quad nations in saying in a joint statement that the 2016 arbitral tribunal award, which refuted Beijing’s claims in its dispute with the Philippines, should form the basis for the resolution of such disputes in the region.Defence and security remains the most important of the 5 pillars that the strategic partnership is based on. The other pillars are politics-diplomacy, economic-trade, science-technology and culture-education. According to the joint statement, the leaders agreed to further enhance defence cooperation based on mutual interest and priorities of the two countries which will also contribute to ``greater stability in the wider Indo-Pacific region’’. Despite China’s objection against exploration in the contested SCS waters, India and Vietnam have continued with their partnership in the oil and gas sector, including exploration and production in Vietnam’s continental shelf. The leaders underlined the significance of this ``mutually beneficial’’ cooperation.For India, it’s significant that the joint statement unequivocally condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism. ""They stressed the importance of international collaboration in combating this menace in accordance with international law, particularly the principles of the United Nations Charter, and reiterated their commitment to joint efforts in this endeavour,"" it said.",India and Vietnam announced a new plan of action to boost their comprehensive strategic partnership.

Recurring disasters in Kerala



(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: As the national attention turns to Wayanad where rescue operations are in full swing after deadly landslides which has claimed the lives of over 280 people till now, the Kerala government has issued a directive for the scientists banning them from visiting the affected sites and issuing any statement regarding it.In a letter to the principal secretary of the department of science and technology, the state relief commissioner has asked him to direct all scientific institution to not visit the sites.""You are requested to direct all Science and Technology institutions in the State of Kerala not to undertake any field visits to Meppadi Panchayath, Wayanad which is notified as a disaster affected area,"" the letter said.The order also states that the scientific community should refrain from sharing any statement or opinion without permission.""The scientific community shall be directed to restrain themselves from sharing their opinions and study reports to media. If any study is to be undertaken in the disaster affected area, prior permission shall be obtained from Kerala State Disaster Management Authority,"" the letter stated.Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, however, later asked the officials to take back the order.Meanwhile, new satellite images released by National Remote Sensing Centre, a key centre under Isro, showed the extent of devastation.The high-resolution before-and-after images captures by the Risat (whose radar can penetrate clouds) and Cartosat-3 (advanced optical satellite) show that approximately 86,000 square metres of land slipped away. The resulting debris flow travelled about 8km along the Iruvaiphuzha river, devastating towns and settlements in its path.Climate change, fragile terrain and loss of forest cover created the perfect recipe for the devastating landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district that claimed 123 lives, according to studies conducted over the years. Extremely heavy rain triggered a series of landslides in the hilly areas of Wayanad.According to the landslide atlas released by the Indian Space Research Organisation's National Remote Sensing Centre last year, 10 out of the 30 most landslide-prone districts in India were in Kerala, with Wayanad ranked 13th.It said 0.09 million square kilometres in the Western Ghats and the Konkan hills (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra) were prone to landslides.""The vulnerability of inhabitants and households is more significant in the Western Ghats due to the very high population and household density, especially in Kerala,"" the report read.A study published by Springer in 2021 said all landslide hotspots in Kerala were in the Western Ghats region and concentrated in Idukki, Ernakulam, Kottayam, Wayanad, Kozhikode and Malappuram districts.It said about 59 per cent of total landslides in Kerala occurred in plantation areas.A 2022 study on depleting forest cover in Wayanad showed that 62 per cent of forests in the district disappeared between 1950 and 2018 while plantation cover rose by around 1,800 per cent.The study, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, said around 85 per cent of the total area of Wayanad was under forest cover until the 1950s.According to scientists, climate change was increasing the possibility of landslides in the Western Ghats, one of the eight ""hottest hotspots"" of biological diversity in the world.In August 2018, Kerala experienced a devastating flood that claimed the lives of 483 people and was considered the state's worst flood in a century. The catastrophe not only resulted in the loss of lives but also caused extensive damage to property and livelihoods, prompting the central government to declare it a ""calamity of severe nature"".As Kerala was recovering from the 2018 floods, another tragedy struck in 2019 when a landslide in Puthumala, Wayanad, approximately 10 km from the currently affected areas, claimed 17 lives. In October 2021, heavy rainfall triggered landslides in Idukki and Kottayam districts, resulting in the death of 35 people.According to data provided by the IMD, heavy rainfall and flood-related incidents in 2021 led to the loss of 53 lives in Kerala. Exactly a year later, in August 2022, landslides and flash floods caused by heavy rains claimed 18 lives, damaged hundreds of properties, and forced thousands of people to seek shelter in relief camps, as reported by the state government.During the 2022 rain-related incidents, over 5,000 individuals were evacuated from disaster-hit and disaster-prone regions of the state and accommodated in 178 relief camps. The ministry of earth sciences has reported that Kerala has experienced the highest number of landslides in the country, with 2,239 out of 3,782 landslides occurring in the state between 2015 and 2022.","The Kerala government has issued a directive for the scientists banning them from visiting the affected sites. The order also states that the scientific community should refrain from sharing any statement or opinion without permission. The Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, however, later asked the officials to take back the order.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112202646,imgsize-125164,width-400,resizemode-4/112202646.jpg"
Quota within SC quota: Quite a legal roller coaster for decades-old demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quota-within-sc-quota-quite-a-legal-roller-coaster-for-decades-old-demand/articleshow/112209134.cms,"NEW DELHI: Grievances of the most backward among Scheduled Castes of being deprived of reservation benefits by those socio-economically advanced among them dates back to the 1960s but it took the shape of a legislation for the first time in Andhra Pradesh with the enactment of AP Scheduled Castes (Rationalisation of Reservations) Act, 2000.The law divided SCs into four categories and provided for apportionment of reservation among them - 1 per cent for Group A, 7 per cent for Group B, 6 per cent for Group C and 1 per cent again for Group D.This law was upheld by the HC, but a five-judge Supreme Court bench in EV Chinnaiah case struck it down by ruling that SCs are a homogeneous group and cannot be sub-categorised.In 2006, Punjab Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act was enacted providing for reservation of 25 per cent for SCs and within that, 50 per cent was be given to particular SC castes such as Balmikis and Mazhabi Sikhs in direct recruitment. This was struck down by the HC in 2010 adhering to the Chinnaiah judgment. When Punjab appealed against it, the SC had referred it to a seven-judge bench in 2011. History of deprivation of benefits of reservation to castes within the SC group is decades old. In 1997, the AP govt had set up Justice P Ramachandra Raju Commission, which opined that benefits of reservation had largely gone to a particular caste among the SCs and, therefore, recommended categorising SCs into four groups.In 2001, UP had constituted the Hukam Singh Committee, which found that benefits of reservation had not percolated down to people belonging to the most depressed classes. It said Yadavs alone garnered the maximum share of jobs. It had recommended sub-categorisation of the list of SCs/OBCs.In 2003, Maharashtra had set up the Lahuji Salve Commission to study socio-economic conditions of Mang caste in the list of SCs. The commission recommended sub-classification of SCs as Mangs, the lowest in the caste hierarchy, had not adequately benefited fromquota .In 2005, Karnataka set up Justice AJ Sadashiva panel to identify castes among SCs who had not benefited from quota. The panel recommended division of 101 castes into four categories with 15 per cent of the total reservation of SCs to each of the categories.In 2007, Bihar's Mahadalit panel recommended inclusion of 18 castes as extremely weaker castes from among the list of SCs. In the same year, Justice Jasraj Chopra Committee of Rajasthan recommended that Gurjars, being extremely backward, be provided with better facilities than those available to OBCs. In 2008, Tamil Nadu's Justice MS Janarthanam panel recommended that Arunthathiyars deserved differential treatment in quota.Based on K Ratna Prabha Committee recommendations in 2017, Karnataka enacted a law in 2018 providing consequential seniority to govt servants promoted on the basis of reservation. This law was upheld by the SC.",History of deprivation of benefits of reservation to castes within the SC group is decades old. Grievances of the most backward among Scheduled Castes dates back to the 1960s. It took the shape of a legislation for the first time in Andhra Pradesh in 2000.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112209215,imgsize-1493191,width-400,resizemode-4/112209215.jpg"
Quota row: Supreme Court bats for the deprived among unequals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/quota-row-supreme-court-bats-for-the-deprived-among-unequals/articleshow/112208995.cms,"One judge differs with other six, says SCs are a homogenous

group

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said a Scheduled Caste parent's children studying in St Stephen's College cannot be equated with another SC parent's children who study in rural schools and, hence, cannot claim identical right to avail 15 per cent reservation in jobs and admissions to educational institutions earmarked for SCs .Justice Bhushan R Gavai, the lone Dalit judge in the seven-judge bench that permitted sub-categorisation of castes within the SC community, showed courage in tackling what has been a political hot potato and asked states to devise a framework to identify and eliminate creamy layer among SCs and STs from availing reservation benefits.He said the OBC creamy layer principle can't be applied to SCs and STs.""I am therefore of the view that the state must evolve a policy for identifying the creamy layer even from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes so as exclude them from the benefit of affirmative action . In my view, only this and this alone can achieve the real equality as enshrined under the Constitution,"" he said. CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices Vikram Nath, Pankaj Mithal, Manoj Misra and S C Sharma concurred with Justice Gavai.He said unequals among SCs and STs can't be treated equally and asked, ""Can a child of IAS/IPS or civil service officers be equated with a child of a disadvantaged member belonging to Scheduled Castes studying in a gram panchayat/zilla parishad school in a village?""He said equating children of SC/ST parents, who after availing reservation have reached high positions and ceased to be socially, economically and educationally backward, with children of parents engaged in manual work would defeat the constitutional mandate.In a 281-page opinion replete with quotes of Dalit icon B R Ambedkar, Justice Gavai said children of SC civil servants have access to advanced education and better social environment compared to those of SC parents studying in the hinterland. ""I have no hesitation to hold that putting a child studying in St Paul's High School and St Stephen's College and a child studying in a small village in a backward and remote area in the same bracket would obliviate the equality principle enshrined in the Constitution,"" he said.Advocating framing of a suitable creamy layer exclusion criteria for SCs and STs, different from that applied to OBCs, he said as the Constitution recognises SCs and STs to be the most backward among backward classes, the criteria has to be different from the existing one.""If a person from such a category, by bagging the benefit of reservation, achieved a position of a peon or maybe a sweeper, he would continue to belong to a socially, economically and educationally backward class. At the same time, people from this category, who after having availed the benefits of reservation have reached high echelons in life cannot be considered to be socially, economically and educationally backward so as to continue availing the benefit of affirmative action. They have already reached a stage where on their own accord they should walk out of the special provisions and give way to the deserving and needy,"" Justice Gavai said.Justice Mithal agreed with Justice Gavai but took the creamy layer exclusion policy to a different level. He said, ""The reservation, if any, has to be limited only for the first generation or one generation and if any generation in a family has taken advantage of reservation and have achieved higher status, benefit of reservation would not be logically available to the second generation."" Unlike Justice Gavai's opinion, Justice Mithal's singular opinion would not have binding effect.Justice Bela M Trivedi opined that castes classified as Scheduled Castes are a homogeneous group and cannot be sub-categorised based on degree of backwardness, an opinion which was in sync with the Supreme Court's 2004 ruling by a five-judge bench that was overruled on Thursday by a seven-judge bench by six to one majority.Justice Trivedi disbanded the dynamic interpretation given to constitutional provisions on affirmative action by states for SCs and STs by six other judges - CJI D Y Chandrachud and Justices B R Gavai, Vikram Nath, Pankaj Mithal, Manoj Misra and S C Sharma - and took the strict and literal interpretation to object to the majority opinion favouring sub-categorisation of SCs and devising appropriate creamy layer exclusion criteria for SCs and STs.""While giving a broad and generous construction to constitutional provisions, the rule of 'plain meaning', or 'literal' interpretation, which is the 'primary rule', has to be kept in mind,"" she said.Terming the 2004 judgment in EV Chinnaiah case to be correct law, Justice Trivedi said, ""It is only Parliament by law which can include or exclude from the list of 'Scheduled Castes' specified in the notification notified under Clause (1), any caste, race or tribe or part of or group within any caste, race or tribe. Such notification notified under Clause (1) cannot be varied even by the President by issuing any subsequent notification.""Etymological and evolutionary history and the background of the nomenclature SCs, coupled with the presidential orders published under Article 341 of the Constitution, make the SCs a homogenous class, which cannot be tinkered with by states.""She further said, ""States have no legislative competence to enact the law for providing reservation or giving preferential treatment to a particular caste/castes by dividing/sub-dividing/sub-classifying or regrouping the castes, races or tribes enumerated as the SCs in the notification under Article 341."" She added that this cannot even be done under the guise of taking affirmative action for the weaker of the weakest sections of society.Take for example the practical aspect considered by Justice Gavai to highlight how some castes, because of their socio-economic uplift through high-ranking jobs, have cornered the lion's share of the quota meant for SCs and opposing equitable distribution of reservation benefits.Justice Gavai said, ""I find that the attitude of the categories in the Presidential List opposing such a sub-classification is that of a person in the general compartment of the train. Firstly, persons outside the compartment struggled to get into the general compartment. However, once they get inside it, they make every attempt possible to prevent persons outside such a compartment from entering it.""","Justice Bhushan R Gavai, the lone Dalit judge, showed courage in tackling what has been a political hot potato. He asked states to devise a framework to identify and eliminate creamy layer among SCs and STs from availing reservation benefits. Justice Bela M Trivedi opined that castes classified as Scheduled Castes are a homogeneous group.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112209047,imgsize-1050146,width-400,resizemode-4/112209047.jpg"

""The long-range forecast issued on July 25 indicated good rainfall activity along the west coast and central parts of the country from July 25 to Aug 1.

Justice Trivedi dissented and said the Chinnaiah judgment was constitutionally valid.It firmly said sub-classification of the most backward among the SC community must be based on empirical data, both quantifiable and demonstrable, regarding their backwardness. The logic behind the court's suggestion for keeping the 'creamy layer' out is that children of civil servants and others from among the SCs who have moved up on the socio-economic ladder and received good education are not deserving of quotas.At present, creamy layer exclusion policy is applicable only to Other Backward Classes (OBCs).The CJI authored a 140-page judgment for himself and Justice Misra. Justices Nath, Mithal and Sharma, through separate opinions, agreed with the opinions of the CJI and Justice Gavai. Both the CJI and Justice Gavai agreed with each other, thus making six of the seven judges concur on the constitutional permissibility of sub-classification of SCs.It was Justice Gavai, the lone Dalit judge on the bench, who mustered the courage to hold that those among SC/ST communities who have got top positions in civil services and risen high in socio-economic strata must get excluded from the reservation scheme for scheduled castes, who were socially discriminated for centuries.Justice Mithal took the creamy layer exclusion principle to a different level. “Reservation, if any, has to be limited only for the first generation or one generation and if any generation in the family has taken advantage of reservation and has achieved higher status, the benefit of reservation would not be logically available to the second generation,” he said. In his 281-page opinion, Justice Gavai said, “The state must evolve a policy for identifying the creamy layer even from the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes so as to exclude them from the benefit of affirmative action.

A hot and humid day made way for heavy showers in the evening. Wednesday saw July’s highest single day rain spell

GURGAON: July ended on a wet note as the city witnessed moderate rainfall for around 50 minutes on Wednesday , providing much-needed respite from the oppressive heat and humidity but also leading to waterlogging and traffic snarls in several areas.With 39.5mm of rainfall, Wednesday saw the heaviest spell in July, which otherwise witnessed little rain the entire month.Before Wednesday, 35mm rainfall was recorded on July 3.The showers began at 7pm and continued till around 7.50pm, accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning. As a result, streets were inundated, traffic slowed to a crawl after 7.30pm and over 1km-long tailbacks were witnessed at key spots on NH-8 such as Hero Honda Chowk, Rajiv Chowk and Narsinghpur, as well as on Golf Course Road, Southern Peripheral Road, Udyog Vihar, Civil Lines, Sectors 10 and 44, and Medanta Road. The chaos lasted for an hour as rainwater started receding from roads only around 9pm.The showers also led to a dip in mercury. The maximum temperature was 37.9 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, 1.1 notches down from Tuesday's 39 degrees and 3.9 degrees above the normal. The minimum temperature also went down by 1.7 notches in 24 hours. It was 30.3 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, 4 degrees higher than normal. The humidity index, which fluctuated between 50% and 97% on Tuesday, hovered between 52% and 75% on Wednesday.""Though the rain was a blessing, waterlogging transformed it into a bit of a curse. It took me twice as long to reach home,"" said Mehak Sankar, who was stuck on Golf Course Road for half an hour.""The Narsinghpur service roads on NH-8 were heavily waterlogged as usual. It was an arduous day for commuters returning home from office,"" said Arun Gupta, another commuter.Despite the waterlogging, many welcomed the break from the muggy weather. ""The rain arrived unexpectedly, but it was a welcome surprise. The city required this break from the heat, and so did we. We switched off the AC, which was turned on all day, after the rain as a cool breeze was blowing,"" said Ajay Gulati, a resident of Sector 85.The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) has forecast partly cloudy skies with the possibility of one or two spells of rain or thundershowers till Aug 5. The maximum temperature may hover between 33 and 34 degrees Celsius over the next five days, while the minimum temperature will range between 28 and 30 degrees Celsius, officials said.""Heavy rain is likely in the city on Thursday. Light to moderate rain is likely at most places till Aug 5 over Punjab and Haryana. Thunderstorms or lightning are likely at isolated places during this period. Heavy to very heavy rain is likely to occur in Haryana in the next 24 hours in isolated areas, but the majority of the state will remain dry,"" an IMD official said.The downpour was caused by the monsoon trough moving close to Delhi, the department said, issuing a 'yellow' alert for light to moderate rain in Delhi on Thursday and Friday. In Delhi, this was the second day since the onset of monsoon when heavy rain was seen as Safdarjung, the city's base station, logged 94.4mm rainfall from 5.30pm to 11.30pm.Several stations saw strong wind, while Palam recorded the highest wind speed at 27 kmph, which rose up to 45 kmph at 7 pm, said IMD.","With 39.5mm of rainfall, Wednesday saw the heaviest spell in July, which otherwise witnessed little rain the entire month.

The Mughals' ability to maintain composure despite donning bulky traditional attire and carrying out household chores is something that is rarely discussed, except from their breathtakingly beautiful palaces, graceful dance as depicted in movies, or heartfelt hymns chanted in Allah's honour. But how did the Mughals survive without air conditioning? How did they build cooling architecture? That is the question.In the 21st century.It's as if we continually shatter our own records of hottest days alive. July 22 was the hottest day with the highest temperature ever recorded on Earth. A deadly heat wave across the world and malfunctioning air conditioners claimed many people's lives for a while.Air conditioning in buildings indicates considerable energy use and utility expenditures. Today, while we are developing sustainable heating and cooling technologies to comply with the green construction movement, it is important to note that ecological heating and cooling techniques have been employed for as long as humans have been building homes. Mughal architecture in India provides unique active and passive air conditioning technologies that can be easily incorporated into contemporary buildings.The Mughals employed two elements to regulate the weather around the structure: flora and water. These waterways and fountains were frequently extended into the interiors of structures. The Mughal architects made extensive use of water as a cooling element. Large reflecting pools and water channels, referred to as ""rills,"" were frequently included into the architecture of structures and landscapes.Through evaporation, these water elements not only enhanced the aesthetic appeal but also helped to cool the air. The pools' reflecting surfaces also assisted in deflecting sunlight from the structures, which lessened their ability to absorb heat.One common element of Mughal design was jharokhas, or overhanging enclosed balconies. These buildings promoted natural ventilation in addition to their aesthetic appeal. Jharokhas were positioned strategically to allow air to move throughout the building, limiting direct sunlight and offering shade while also facilitating a steady supply of fresh air.Huge courtyards and verdant gardens were frequently incorporated into the architectural designs of Mughal structures. The environment was significantly cooled by these open areas. Cooler air might flow within the buildings and hot air could exit through the courtyards. Gardens, which frequently have pools and other water elements, produced a microclimate that considerably lowered the temperature.The Mughals also employed inventive cooling methods like terraces and roof gardens. By acting as insulation, these raised gardens assisted in lowering the amount of heat that the roofs absorbed. Through transpiration, the flora on the roof gardens had a cooling effect that improved the comfort of the interior spaces below.Buildings with thick walls and lofty ceilings were among the Mughals' most simple yet effective strategies. As insulators, the thick walls limited the amount of heat that could enter from the outside, keeping the interiors cold. The living areas below were significantly cooler due to the hot air rising to the high ceilings. This type of architecture was especially common in palaces and huge public structures.Large domes and chhatris, or elevated dome-shaped pavilions, were useful features in Mughal design in addition to being decorative. These buildings promoted air movement and offered shade. Because of their high ceilings, the domes assisted in keeping the lower rooms cooler by retaining hot air and letting it to leave through ventilation at the top.Mughal architecture was distinguished by its finely carved jaali screens. Similar to contemporary blinds, these perforated stone screens allowed air to travel through while obstructing direct sunlight, producing a cooling effect. The jaali screens made sure the interiors stayed pleasant even on the warmest days by dispersing sunlight and lowering heat buildup.Mughal buildings were orientated with great care to maximise shade and reduce heat gain. Structures were frequently orientated to benefit from the dominant winds, which improved natural ventilation. Living areas were kept cool and shaded by the use of covered pathways and verandas.","Mughal architects made extensive use of water as a cooling element.

"Delhi coaching center tragedy: 36 hours after saying there were no issues with drainage, MCD contradicts itself",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-coaching-center-tragedy-36-hours-after-saying-there-were-no-issues-with-drainage-mcd-contradicts-itself/articleshow/112181709.cms,"'Measures taken to prevent waterlogging'

NEW DELHI: Municipal Corporation of Delhi seemed to contradict itself Wednesday when it claimed its teams had discovered leakages in the sewer line behind Rau's IAS Study Circle , the site of Saturday's basement flooding that claimed three lives. Just 36 hours earlier, it had told chief secretary Naresh Kumar, who incorporated it in his report to Delhi govt, that there were no problems with the drainage system on Bada Bazar Road in Old Rajender Nagar .""The leakages were identified at the junction where Delhi Jal Board's sewer connects with the coaching centre's. We plan to write to DJB. But it is difficult to comment if this contributed to the waterlogging issue,"" said an MCD official.The water utility, however, refuted the charge.""Our sewer lines are functioning properly and they didn't cause any disruption in the flow of water,"" claimed a DJB officer. ""We got the sewer physically checked and found it functioning normally at the rear of the coaching centre. There was neither a blockage nor had the sewer line burst. MCD officials did not mention anything about leakages to us in any meetings after the incident.""Another DJB official asserted, ""In the last survey of sewer lines, we found the level of water in the back lane very low, at around 1ft. The water was clean and had no smell. So the chances of leakages in the sewer lines can be ruled out.""On inspection of the area, MCD officials found that the terrain profile from Shankar Road to Pusa Road was saucer-shaped, with the lowest point located in front of the affected coaching institute. Therefore, this 200-ft-long space tended to accumulate water during heavy rains.To add to this, the plinth level of the coaching centre building was found lower than in neighbouring buildings. ""In comparison with the plinth height of 2.5ft of the neighbouring building, the coaching centre's plinth was 1.5ft high. The neighbouring buildings also had a protective wall and a wider channel near their entrances for the water to flow to underground tanks,"" said the MCD official.In accordance with the directives of higher authorities, the municipal officials said they had now devised measures to prevent waterlogging on the road. A detailed project report for the construction of an 800-metre drain along the road facing the institute is being prepared. ""We will clear the drain of silt first after demolishing all the illegal ramps built over it,"" said the official, explaining how property owners on the road had constructed ramps across the width of their plots, thus covering the existing drains and making them inaccessible to municipal cleaners.""The new drain will be connected to the barrel drain after constructing a larger pit on Pusa Road to facilitate proper flow of water,"" the official said.","MCD says it found leakages in the sewer line behind Rau's IAS Study Circle.

World's richest woman whose wealth surpasses modern tycoons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/worlds-richest-woman-whose-wealth-surpasses-modern-tycoons/articleshow/112078972.cms,"How Wu Zetian became empress Wu?



Natasa Stankovic Gets Trolled For Sharing Videos of Her Happy Moments with Son in Serbia

When you picture the world's richest people in the world, the names of Mukesh Ambani, Elon Musk, Jess Bezos, Bernard Arnault & family, and Mark Zuckerberg come to the mind. But long before, any of them existed a powerful Chinese Empress Wu Zetian of Tang dynasty , boasted of wealth of around 16 trillion USD , which could overshadow combined net worth of the wealthiest people across the globe.During the 2000 year of dynastic rule in China, there were more than 600 emperors but amongst them all only one female emperor which was an anomaly. Wu Zetian, the only female emperor to rule China, was born in 624 BC and ruled the Tang dynasty between 665 to 705 BC. Zetian, however, was married at the age of 14 but with her intelligence and skills quickly rose to the position of secretary to Emperor Taizong. After the death of the emperor she was made senior concubine- by acquainting Tazong's son- Gaozong. And after his death too- no one was left to question the sole authority of Empress Wu.Emperess Wu Zetian was someone whose political prowess is comparable to notable women, like Joan of Arc, Queen Elizabeth I, and Catherine the Great. Popularly known as Empress Wu, the richest-ever female monarch accumulated the unfathomable fortune, with her astute vision, shrewd techniques, and brutal decisions, that also included killing of her own children, it is said. While she was hailed for some of her decisions like reducing the taxes on peasants that helps in increasing agricultural productivity and thus state revenue, she also took some controversial decisions. The controversy surrounding her life was definitely exaggerated by historians who were prejudiced towards woman with strong ambitions. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence of her cruelty towards the rich and affluent. She also was particularly ruthless towards her enemies real or imagined.As per one of the accounts, her power hunger and paranoia led her to kill one of her own children - her daughter - and depose her sons who were emperors before her. She, however, helped expand the Chinese empire significantly in the 15 years of her reign from 690 C.E. to 705 C.E.Wu Zetian was born in a wealthy family to a timber merchant in 624 AD in Shanxi province. Her father was close to Li Yuan, who eventually ascended to become Emperor Gaozong of Tang and this gave her an opportunity to forge close connections with the royal household.Empress Wu was deeply passionate about literature from a very early age and at the age of 14, she was appointed as a secretary in the Tang Palace, getting an opportunity to work under Emperor Taizong.Subsequently, the emperor's death led her to a Buddhist monastery which was a common practice for all the women associated with the emperor during that time. However her affair with Emperor Gaozong, the deceased emperor’s son and successor, once against brought an unexpected twist in her journey as she once again made her way back to the palace as a concubine.With her cunning and stealthy ways, she soon ousted Empress Wang and ascended to the throne as an empress in the year 655. A major turning point for her was when Emperor Gaozong entrusted the empress with the governance of his empire after his health took a turn for the worse and he started having debilitating migraine-like headaches and vision loss.Thus, started a historic reign that made her the first and only woman to rule China. Well-educated, visionary, and an excellent public speaker, Empress Wu is credited with a number of welfare measures that also boosted trade like reducing taxation to re-opening of silk road to trade.

Critics argue that differing standards between the IBA and IOC create confusion and potential unfairness in competition.Italy's Family Minister Eugenia Roccella and Sports Minister Andrea Abodi have expressed concerns about the lack of uniform criteria at the international level, questioning the fairness and safety of allowing Khelif to compete against other female athletes.The Algerian Olympic Committee (COA) has come to Khelif’s defence, condemning what they describe as “malicious and unethical attacks” by foreign media. The COA has emphasized their unwavering support for Khelif, denouncing the scrutiny as ""baseless propaganda"" aimed at undermining her credibility and morale as she competes at the pinnacle of her career.During her brief but impactful fight in Paris, Khelif faced Italy’s Angela Carini, who suffered a badly hurt nose and was unable to continue, leading to an official abandonment of the match.The swift victory was met with mixed reactions, with Algerian fans in the North Paris Arena showing their support by chanting Khelif’s name, while Carini’s emotional response highlighted the intense pressure and stakes involved in the competition.As the debate over gender eligibility in sports continues, Khelif’s journey at the Paris Olympics is likely to remain under the spotlight, reflecting broader discussions about fairness, safety, and the evolving standards in women’s sports.

KOCHI: A story penned by a 14-year-old student in the digital magazine of the Vellarmala Govt School, which was swept away in the massive landslide at Chooralmala in Wayanad , turned prophetic, as it turned prophetic about the devastating landslide that killed more than nearly 300 people in Mundakkai and Chooralmala.The story, written by Laya A S, a Class VIII student, tells the tale of a bird warning students to flee the village as a big tragedy was imminent.Laya’s father, Lenin, was washed away in the landslide that occurred early on Tuesday morning while trying to save the lives of his family members.The magazine named ‘Vellaram Kallukal’ was released recently in the school as part of the Little KITEs initiative by the Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) project of state govt.The story titled ‘Agrahathinte Duranubhavam’ (The Tragedy of Desire) talks about two girls Alamkrutha and Anaswra who plan a brief outing along the riverbank in their village after school. Walking along the riverside, they arrived at the waterfall area.“While enjoying the beauty of the waterfall, a bird came by. This bird was unusual; it could talk. The bird said to them, ‘Children, quickly escape from here. A great danger is coming. If you want to be safe, run away from here immediately.’After saying this, the bird flew away. Understanding the bird’s warning, the children started running as fast as they could,” reads the story, which recalls the picturesque landscape of Chooralmala and Mundakkai where there is a river and a waterfall, Soochippara.In another part, the story says, “The children were unaware of a major problem: when it rains, landslides and mudslides can occur in the area. The rising water can cause destruction to both humans and the creatures living there, leading to many deaths.”Unnikrishnan, a teacher at the school, said the family of Laya, who left the school this year and joined another school, came to Chooralmala and settled some years ago. Her father lost his life while trying to save Laya.The magazine contains 16 pieces written by students, including stories, poems, and articles. Many of these works depict the scenic beauty of Mundakkai and Chooralmala.The poem ‘Ente Puzha’ by Thanmaya Janeesh, a student of Class III, describes the mild waves in the village river. The story ‘Ee Kuliraruviyude Orath’ (On the Banks of This Stream), written by Alhena, a student of Class VI, mentions a girl who bathes in the river every morning along with her mother.A poem ‘Kilimani Naadam,’ written by Bhagya Sree S, describes the varieties of birds in the village, which sings songs glorifying the beauty of nature.","The story, written by Laya A S, tells the tale of a bird warning students to flee the village as a big tragedy was imminent.

HYDERABAD: Kandi Srinivasa Reddy , who contested the 2023 Telangana assembly elections from Adilabad on a Congress ticket, is facing allegations of rigging the US H-1B visa lottery system.Reddy has outrightly denied rigging the system in such a manner that his staffing company clients have a better chance in the lottery.But a Bloomberg investigative report alleges that Reddy uses multiple company names to submit numerous applications for the same indivi duals, thereby increasing their chances of selection.Reddy, on the other hand, has said that filing multiple entries is legal and questioned why he was being singled out when 5,000 companies used the same strategy. He said his firms got 302 visas of 4.25 lakh in the past five years.An NRI, Reddy founded Cloud Big Data Technologies LLC in 2013.

Neither USCIS nor Reddy’s representatives would confirm or deny the connections, says the report.Lucas Garritson, a Texas lawyer representing Reddy, stated that several of the companies’ visas had been challenged by the USCIS for abusing the lottery system.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals.

North Korea will eye nuclear talks with US if Trump becomes president: Ex-diplomat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-will-eye-nuclear-talks-with-us-if-trump-becomes-president-ex-diplomat/articleshow/112210538.cms,"How will North Korea’s ties help?

Who is Ri Il Gyu?

Ri Il Gyu, a high-ranking North Korean diplomat who recently defected to South Korea, revealed in an interview with Reuters that North Korea is interested in reopening nuclear talks with the United States if Donald Trump wins re-election as president. The country is currently developing a new negotiation strategy to achieve this goal.According to Ri, North Korea has prioritized Russia, the US and Japan as its top foreign policy targets for the coming years.While strengthening ties with Russia, Pyongyang aims to resume nuclear negotiations if Trump returns to office, with the objective of lifting sanctions on its weapons programs, removing its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and securing economic aid .The diplomat believes that the foreign ministry will take charge of the negotiations this time, making it more difficult for Trump to restrict North Korea's actions without offering concessions.Ri also discussed the benefits of North Korea's closer ties with Russia, which include assistance with missile technology and the economy, as well as the potential to block additional sanctions and undermine existing ones.He noted that ""the Russians got their own hands dirty by engaging in illicit transactions and, thanks to that, North Korea no longer needs to rely on the US to lift sanctions, which essentially means they stripped the US of one key bargaining chip.""Ri suggested that Kim Jong Un would be open to holding a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, aiming to secure economic assistance in exchange for concessions on the issue of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea in the 1970s and 80s. Further added that Kim would be willing to change the country's position on the abductee issue, established under his father Kim Jong Il, to obtain economic support from Japan.Ri, who studied at a French school in Algeria and lived in Cuba alongside his late father, a state media reporter, had long dreamed of a life in South Korea. However, it was not until he faced bullying from a colleague and was denied medical treatment in Mexico that he decided to defect.The Covid-19 lockdown further exacerbated hardships at home and for those stationed abroad, with most telephone lines to Pyongyang cut to prevent information from spreading to the outside world.Ri also shared his experience in trying to hinder the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Korea and Cuba, a long-time ally of North Korea.Despite his efforts, he acknowledged that ""establishing relations with Cuba was the best thing South Korea had done since last year,"" and that it served as ""a model example of how the tides of history have turned, and where a normal civilisation of the international community is headed.""","Ri Il Gyu, a high-ranking North Korean diplomat who recently defected to South Korea, revealed in an interview with Reuters that North Korea is interested in reopening nuclear talks with the United States.

"JD Vance’s ‘childless cat ladies’ remark: Are societal pressures, not 'selfishness,' behind America's fertility decline?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vances-childless-cat-ladies-remark-are-societal-pressures-not-selfishness-behind-americas-fertility-decline/articleshow/112210337.cms,"For years, some conservative voices have framed the declining fertility rate in the United States as a moral crisis and a sign of eroding family values . High-profile figures like Sen JD Vance and Fox News commentator Ashley St. Clair have criticized childless Americans, suggesting that they prioritize personal pleasure over family life.In 2021, Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, disparaged what he called ""childless cat ladies"" and criticized their supposed disdain for traditional family values.Last year, St. Clair echoed this sentiment, condemning those without children for seeking self-indulgence instead of pursuing family life.However, experts argue that the reality behind declining fertility rates is far more complex and rooted in societal and economic challenges rather than individual choice. Researchers point out that declining fertility is a global trend, not unique to the US, and reflects broader issues such as the rising costs of child care, housing, and economic uncertainty.""I don’t see it as a lack of commitment to family,"" said Mary Brinton, a sociologist at Harvard University, as quoted by NYT. ""The issues are very much on the societal level and the policy level.""The US fertility rate has been on a downward trend since the end of the baby boom in the mid-1960s, with a more pronounced decline following the Great Recession of 2008. Kenneth Johnson, a demographer at the University of New Hampshire, noted that many anticipated a temporary delay in childbearing due to the economic downturn, but this rebound never materialized.In 2022, the total fertility rate dropped to a historic low of 1,616.5 births per 1,000 women, significantly below the replacement level of 2,100 births needed to maintain population size. The Pew Research Center's recent survey highlights that an increasing number of adults are unlikely to have children, a trend that predates the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, nearly half of US counties reported more deaths than births last year.Experts point to several factors contributing to this decline. The average age of marriage and first childbirth has risen substantially, with the median age for first marriages at 28 and the average age for first births at 27. Financial barriers, such as high housing costs and student debt, along with inadequate support for working families, are significant obstacles.Sarah Hayford, director of the Institute for Population Research at Ohio State University, found that many young adults still desire children but face economic and practical barriers that prevent them from achieving this goal. The rising costs of mortgages and child care, coupled with a lack of supportive policies like paid parental leave, exacerbate these difficulties.Sociologist Karen Benjamin Guzzo of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill believes that a lack of optimism about the future also plays a role. “The decision to have children is the ultimate vote of confidence in the future,” Guzzo said. “When fertility rates are down, it’s because people don’t feel they have a future they’re confident in.”Efforts to reverse the trend have included proposals like former President Donald Trump's ""baby bonus"" and Sen. JD Vance's suggestions for tax breaks and altered voting systems to incentivize parenthood. However, experts note that there is little evidence that such policies are effective on their own. Instead, addressing broader societal issues such as affordable housing, student loan debt, and parental leave may be more effective in encouraging higher birth rates.“In our view, every policy is a family policy,” Guzzo said, emphasizing the need for comprehensive changes to support prospective parents and families.","The US fertility rate has been on a downward trend since the end of the baby boom in the mid-1960s.

'Loss of $900 million': Donald Trump's net worth falls sharply following Kamala Harris’ US presidential bid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-net-worth-falls-sharply-following-harris-us-presidential-bid/articleshow/112209924.cms,"Former President Donald Trump ’s financial stake in Truth Social has taken a significant hit, with its value dropping by $900 million since Vice President Kamala Harris announced her 2024 presidential bid on July 21. The stock of Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social, has fallen by about 23% in that period, including a notable drop on Thursday, as reported by CNN.On July 19, before President Joe Biden 's exit from the race and endorsement of Harris, Trump’s stake was valued at just over $4 billion.By Thursday, the value had fallen to approximately $3.1 billion. This decline reflects a broader trend of volatility for Trump Media's share price, which has been heavily influenced by political developments and market fluctuations.The recent selloff highlights the stock’s role as a barometer for Trump’s potential return to the White House, with Truth Social expected to be a key platform for presidential communications if he wins. Polls showing a tight race between Trump and Harris have further impacted investor sentiment.In June, Trump Media’s stock briefly surged following Biden’s poor debate performance and again last month after Trump survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. However, the company has faced persistent challenges.Truth Social's user engagement has been declining. Data from Comscore, cited by CNN, reveals that unique visitors to the platform fell by 38% year-over-year in June, marking its third consecutive month of declines.Trump Media’s stock, which went public in late March, has experienced extreme volatility, with analysts comparing it to a ""meme stock"" driven by market speculation rather than solid financial performance. Despite the downturn, Trump Media remains valued at $5.1 billion.Trump retains significant control over the company, holding 114.75 million shares and serving as chairman, while Truth Social remains a minor player in the social media landscape. Bloomberg estimates Trump’s net worth at $5.9 billion.
