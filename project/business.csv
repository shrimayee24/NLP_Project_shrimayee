We hope and trust needful circumspection will be observed in future,” the CJI-led bench said while ordering that the HC judge’s controversial remarks be expunged.“However, this court in exercise of its affirmative obligations as a custodian of the adjudicatory process would be failing in its duty if it were not to intervene by expunging the remarks, which we hereby do. The remarks in the July 17 order are accordingly expunged with an expression of caution that such an exercise would not be required to be taken by this court in the future in relation to the same judge or any other judge,” it added.Justice Sehrawat, who was appointed as a judge of Punjab and Haryana HC on July 10, 2017, is scheduled to retire on Oct 30. “To prevent any further damage to the reputation and majesty of the rule of law and the Supreme Court and also of this court, the impugned order dated July 17, 2024, passed by the single judge shall remain stayed till the next date of hearing,” a bench said .","A Supreme Court bench of top five judges on Wednesday expunged “unnecessary, gratuitous and unwarranted’ remarks from Punjab and Haryana HC judge Rajbir Sehrawat.

Bill for oversight of Waqf Boards likely in Lok Sabha today,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bill-for-oversight-of-waqf-boards-likely-in-lok-sabha-today/articleshow/112359721.cms,"Oppn wants bill be sent to parl panel,

Muslim bodies

threaten to launch stir

NEW DELHI: Amid opposition ’s demand that it be sent to a joint committee, the govt is set to introduce the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, in Lok Sabha on Thursday that proposes far-reaching changes to restrain the powers of Waqf Boards to declare a property as ‘Waqf’ and introduce a detailed process to do so, including preliminary survey by the district magistrate instead of the survey officer of the board as a pre-requisite for any such determination.The bill seeks to broaden the composition of the Central Waqf Council and state Waqf Boards by providing for representation of Muslim women and non-Muslim members.The bill also provides for a full-time chief executive officer of Waqf Boards to be appointed by the state govt and who shall not be below the rank of joint secretary to the state govt and not necessarily a Muslim.The most critical of the proposed amendments relates to the repeal of Section 40 of the existing law that empowers Waqf Boards to decide if a property is a Waqf asset, change in the composition of Waqf tribunals and allowing for appeals in high courts against their decisions within 90 days.Accordingly, the provision in the current Act which says “decision of the tribunal in respect of such matter shall be final” will be dropped. Introduced in 2013 under the Congress-led UPA govt , this provision has been a bone of contention.To address a long-pending demand, the bill also provides for establishment of separate Board of Auqaf for Bohras and Agakhanis; besides providing representation of Shias, Bohras, Agakhanis and backward Muslims in Waqf Boards.Issuance of a ‘Waqf deed’ and certification will be mandatory for new properties under assessment.The move comes amid strong opposition by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board which has threatened to launch a mass movement, and organisations like Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind.At the meeting of the Business Advisory Committee , opposition parties demanded that the legislation be sent to a parliamentary committee .Sources said parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju , also the minister of minority affairs, said the govt would take a decision on Thursday.Interestingly, with the department-related standing committees not in place yet, the bill may be forwarded to a special committee in case govt accepts the opposition’s demand.","The govt is set to introduce the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, in Lok Sabha on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: The government is set to introduce a bill to amend the Waqf Act , 1995, to check the unbridled powers, enhanced futher by a 2013 amendment, of Waqf Boards in what has been termed an attempt to introduce transparency and accountability in the regulation and monitoring of over 8.7 lakh properties under control of state boards across the country and weed out corruption. TOI explains what comprises Waqf and what is ailing management of assets under the boards.Waqf refers to properties dedicated exclusively for religious or charitable purposes under Islamic law.Once designated as Waqf, ownership is transferred from the person making the Waqf (waqif) to Allah, making it irrevocable. These properties are managed by a mutawwali, appointed by waqif or a competent authority. Waqf boards control 8.7 lakh properties spanning 9.4 lakh acres across India, with estimated value of Rs 1.2 lakh crore. There are 32 Waqf boards, including two Shia Waqf boards (in Uttar Pradesh & Bihar).Once a property is declared Waqf, it remains so forever. This irrevocability has led to various disputes and claims, some of which, like the claim on two islands in Bet Dwarka, have perplexed courts. Examples of some other disputes include the Bengaluru Eidgah ground, claimed as Waqf property from the 1850s, and the Surat Municipal Corporation building, claimed due to its historical use as a ‘sarai’ during Haj in the Mughal era. Kolkata’s Tollygunge Club and Royal Calcutta Golf Club are on Waqf land, so is ITC Windsor Hotel in Bengaluru. Encroachment on Waqf properties is also a challenge.The concept of Waqf in India dates back to Delhi Sultanate, with early examples including Sultan Muizuddin Sam Ghaor’s (Muhammad Ghori) dedication of villages to Jama Masjid of Multan. Mussalman Waqf Act, 1923, marked the first attempt to regulate it. In independent India, the Waqf Act was first passed by Parliament in 1954. It was replaced by a new Waqf Act in 1995 which gave more power to Waqf boards. The accretion of power has been accompanied by increase in number of complaints of encroachment and illegal lease and sale of Waqf properties. In 2013, the Act was amended and the changes, many argue, conferred unlimited powers on Waqf boards to claim properties in the name of Muslim charity. The amendments made sale of Waqf properties impossible. Neither the mutawwali (custodian) nor the Waqf board has rights to sell a Waqf property.Section 40 of the Waqf Act, 1995, gives Waqf boards the power to decide if a property is Waqf property. There are complaints this power has been misused by vested interests for property grab with the help of the corrupt Waqf bureaucracy. There have also been allegations of misuse of powers given to boards regarding appointment of mutawwalis and cases challenging appointment of managers. The bill proposes to repeal the controversial section altogether and vest powers in the collector. Interestingly, even countries that follow Muslim law do not have a Waqf body with such powers.The main change in definition was made in 2013, when the expression ‘permanent dedication by a person professing Islam’ was replaced by ‘permanent dedication by any person’. After this amendment, it is believed Waqf has opened the floodgates for dedication of property to Waqf boards by any person.Disputes have mounted over the years, and the Waqf bureaucracy has been criticised for inefficacy, leading to issues like encroachment, mismanagement, ownership disputes, and delays in registration and surveys. There are 40,951 cases pending in tribunals which are part of the Waqf system. The problem is compounded by the absence of judicial oversight on decisions of tribunals which exclusively comprise members of Waqf bureaucracy. The law has been under growing public scrutiny after 2013, with complaints coming from Muslim intellectuals, women and different sects such as Bohras, and OBC Muslims.Flaws in the appeal process are also a big concern. For instance, an appeal against a board decision lies with the tribunal but the latter has no timeline for disposal of cases. The tribunal’s decision is final and there is no provision for appeal except under writ jurisdiction in high courts. Moreover, some states don’t have tribunals, making the Waqf bureaucacy the ultimate arbiter.In states with a single Waqf board, the need is felt to have representation from minority sects among Muslims, like Bohras and Shias, as well as OBC Muslims, the Pasmandas. Misuse of ‘Waqf-al-Aulad’ provision to deny inheritance rights to women and orphans in certain cases is another concern sought to be aaddressed by the bill.Sachar Committee’s 2006 report recommended need for regulation, efficient management of records, inclusion of non-Muslim technical expertise in Waqf management and bringing Waqf under the scheme of financial audit, among other things. Similarly, the joint parliamentary committee’s report on Waqf presented to Rajya Sabha in March 2008 recommended revamping the composition of Waqf boards, proposing appointment of a senior officer as CEO for state Waqf boards, stringent action for unauthorised alienation of Waqf properties, stringent punishment to mutawwalis for corruption, creating scope for intervention by HC in some cases, computerisation of Waqf boards and adequate representation to the Shia community in the Central Waqf Council.The idea, govt says, is to modernise management of Waqf properties, protect women’s rights, ensure fair representation in Central Waqf Council and Waqf boards, reduce litigation, have effective coordination with revenue dept and also provide judicial oversight on tribunal decisions.The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has called the bill an interference with personal laws, and threatened to start a mass movement. But the All India Sufi Sajjadanashin Council, the apex body representing Sufi shrines, has welcomed govt’s proposal alleging Waqf boards work in a “dictatorial” manner.","Waqf refers to properties dedicated exclusively for religious or charitable purposes under Islamic law.

They are frustrated and will do anything to push the country, a bright global spot, backwards due to political vendetta . The statement is an invitation to anarchy and shows the anti-democratic outlook of the a party which talks about the Constitution,” Thakur told reporters.His colleagues, Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Sambit Patra also joined in the attack.The sharp response coincides with growing apprehension in govt and BJP quarters over what they call a plot to organise disruptions by engineering protests. Home minister Amit Shah had late last month cautioned BJP CMs against plots to organise protests by farmers and others.Patra said Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who was present at the book launch event along with Khurshid, kept mum about his colleague’s objectionable statement. “This is a serious issue. When we are witnessing such a situation in neighbouring countries, the main opposition party Congress wants the same situation in India,” he told reporters outside Parliament. He also referred to Rahul Gandhi ’s “objectionable” remarks during his visits abroad.Rudy dubbed Khurshid’s comments as “anarchist”. “He is a member of CWC, this is an anarchist statement, I think it is a kind of sedition. It’s unfortunate Congress is resorting to such anarchist statements to hide its failure.”","Former Union minister Anurag Thakur said the Congress neta’s remark had laid bare Congress's wish and intent to create anarchy.

The decision came as the party decided to hold consultations within and outside on the sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes to finalise its stance in the wake of the recent Supreme Court judgement .A brainstorming by the Congress brass, led by Mallikarjun Kharge, with key leaders, decided to hold extensive dialogue with the party’s state units, chief ministers, INDIA bloc allies and civil society members for feedback on the sensitive issue.Sources said the meeting elicited individual views of participants. Many of them criticised the judgment’s extension of “creamy layer” concept to SCs and STs. Meanwhile, in Lok Sabha, DMK’s A Raja slammed “creamy layer” for SCs/STs and urged govt to introduce safeguards to protect the rights of the two communities in the light of the court judgement.The participants discussed the pros and cons of sub-classification while also quoting the views of BSP’s Mayawati and BJP ally LJP’s Chirag Paswan — both have opposed it.The meeting included Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, KC Venugopal, Abhishek Singhvi, Vivek Tankha, Charanjit Channi, Kumari Selja, PL Punia, Mukul Wasnik, Randeep Surjewala, Udit Raj, Rajesh Lilothia, Nasir Hussain and Jairam Ramesh.While the Congress, like other parties, is treading with caution on sub-categorisation, party insiders felt there was need to up the pressure on other fronts where the longstanding reservation pie is shrinking. Udit Raj said the party will renew its demand that the 50% bar on total SC/ST/OBC reservation be relaxed through a constitutional amendment. Also, the Congress will ask govt to fill “backlog vacancies” and institute quotas inoutsourced projects — the logic being that outsourcing of govt work is leading to erosion of reservation available in govt appointments. There is also likely to be increased rhetoric against privatisation of PSUs.Meanwhile, civil society groups will hold a nationwide bandh against sub-categorisation on Aug 21, and will see the involvement of some Congress leaders too.Many feel that sub-categorisation also concerns tribals, besides Dalits, and discussions will have to include the ST representatives. The Congress meeting did not have any ST member. The issue is of special concern to election-bound Maharashtra and Jharkhand because of their large SC/ST population, while Haryana has the highest dalit population in the country after Punjab.",The Congress is set to ratchet up pressure for removal of 50% ceiling on reservation and push for quotas in the big projects outsourced by govt.

The decision was based on evidence from the Phulwarisharif PFI case , which involved a conspiracy to disrupt Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s visit to Patna in July 2022, as well as other ISIS-inspired terror plots under investigation by the NIA and several state police forces.The order of the UAPA tribunal , put out in a gazette notification issued on Tuesday, stated that based on evidence and material provided to it, “it is evident that SIMI continues to engage in unlawful and terrorist activities despite being banned”.It added: “The organization is expanding its ranks by indoctrinating young boys and operating through front organizations. SIMI maintains connections with various terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, ISIS and Indian Mujahideen. It continues to receive both domestic and international funding, which supports its activities in India... it is clear that several accused persons, who have committed various offences across different jurisdictions, have been identified as members or activists of SIMI. By conspiring together, they committed numerous offences aligned with SIMI's ideologies and propaganda”.The tribunal observed that the evidence in cases involving ex-SIMI cadres — who are now either affiliated with Popular Front of India (PFI), also banned under UAPA, or found to be carrying out ISIS propaganda and plotting/executing attacks to further the global terror outfit’s ideology favouring Islamic rule — “effectively establishes the fact that despite the previous bans, SIMI is still active through its members and activists.”One of the key testimonies relied upon by the tribunal while confirming the ban on SIMI is that of NIA officer Vipin Kumar, who had deposed that the key accused in Phulwarisharif PFI case, Athar Parvej and Jalaluddin, were connected with SIMI members and taking their help for planning and commission of terrorist acts.The investigators had recovered incriminating documents titled ‘India 2047: Towards Rule of Islam in India’ that chronicled how PFI intends to replace democratic govt in India with Islamic rule by creating disaffection and getting cadres trained in use of crude weapons, to commit violent acts. Parvej had confessed that he, on PFI’s direction, was preparing a secret group of ex-SIMI members to avenge “atrocities against Muslims and derogatory remarks against Islam” and cited the targeted attacks against Hindu individuals in Amravati and Udaipur. The PFI ‘vision document’ found his Parvej’s home was the basis for declaration of the organization as an “unlawful association” under UAPA in 2022. The entire PFI leadership was arrested in the wake of the ban.","The tribunal established by the Centre to review the ninth extension of the ban on the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) has upheld the ban.

Gig work: A growing appetite

Investing in skills is key

Embracing the future

Preparing for transience

The writer is co-founder, TeamLease, and an independent board director

The Indian job market is at an inflection point. While the traditional full-time model persists, a silent revolution is brewing — the rise of temporary work. Let’s delve into the data-driven future of temporary staffing in India, exploring its potential impact on job structures, skill sets, and the overall employment landscape.Studies by the World Employment Confederation and International Labour Organisation (ILO) paint a clear picture: temporary work is on the rise globally.India is no exception. Reports from TeamLease, a leading staffing firm, indicate a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.3% in the temporary staffing market for 2022. Experts predict this trend to continue, with the temporary workforce potentially doubling by 2030 to touch a staggering 10 million. This points to a significant shift from the present, paving the way for a more transient job market.Gone are the days of temporary work being synonymous with basic, repetitive tasks. A report by global staffing companies highlights a crucial trend — temporary jobs are climbing up the value chain. Companies are increasingly seeking highly skilled professionals for projectbased work, peak seasons, or specialised expertise. This shift is driven by factors like globalisation, technological advancements, and the need for agility. This presents a unique opportunity for skilled professionals.Temporary work can offer:While reports by ILO acknowledge the rise of temporary work, they also caution against job insecurity. But the reality is that traditional job security — with defined career paths and long tenures — is becoming less prevalent and, as a matter of fact, it impedes the ability to maximise dignified earnings in the dynamic world we live in today. Companies are increasingly adopting a projectbased approach, requiring a more adaptable workforce. This doesn’t negate the need for job security, but rather redefines it. The future lies in portable skills, adaptability, and a robust social security system that supports temporary workers.The rise of the gig economy , fuelled by digital platforms, further underscores the growing acceptance of temporary work arrangements. Organisations are showing a greater appetite for gig workers, particularly for tasks like marketing, content creation, and data analysis. This trend is expected to surge — a Nasscom-Aon report predicts a 78% increase in India’s gig workforce by 2025 to reach an estimated 25 million gig workers.This translates into a significant portion of the workforce embracing the flexibility and project-based nature of gig work. While income variability exists, a report by Aspire Circle (a leading gig work platform) indicates an average income of Rs 25,000 per month for skilled gig workers in India. The figure can vary depending on the specific skill, experience level, and platform used. However, it highlights the potential for gig work to provide a competitive income stream for skilled individuals.To truly harness the potential of temporary work, a focus on skill development is paramount. Reports by TeamLease emphasise the need for investments in creating industryspecific skill sets across all levels. Apprenticeship programmes, as championed by the government, can act as a vital gateway to employment, equipping individuals with the necessary skills to thrive in the temporary job market.The future of work in India extends beyond just temporary jobs. It’s a paradigm shift towards a more agile and adaptable workforce. McKinsey’s remote work study reveals that a significant portion of tasks can be done remotely, potentially impacting talent pools for temporary roles. The World Economic Forum ’s “Reskilling Revolution” emphasises the need to equip workers with in-demand skills like complex problem-solving and creativity. Similarly, reports by PwC and EY highlight the rising demand for specialised skills in temporary positions.This dynamic landscape demands a multi-pronged approach. We need robust investments in skill development programmes tailored to the evolving needs of the temporary job market. Apprenticeship initiatives and industry-specific skilling efforts must be prioritised. Additionally, social security measures need to be adopted to provide a safety net for temporary workers.By embracing this future of work, India can unlock a wave of opportunity. It’s time to move beyond traditional models and empower a skilled, adaptable workforce ready to thrive in the transient job market. Let’s equip India for the future, today.As Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate economist, aptly stated, “The key is to be skilled and adaptable. The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” By prioritising skilling and embracing adaptability, India can ensure its workforce is not just prepared for the transient future, but actively shaping it. The writer is co-founder, TeamLease, and an independent board director.","The Indian job market is at an inflection point. While the traditional full-time model persists, a silent revolution is brewing — the rise of temporary work. Companies are increasingly seeking highly skilled professionals for projectbased work, peak seasons, or specialised expertise.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112356202,imgsize-1299503,width-400,resizemode-4/112356202.jpg"
Thin & fair?: Brides-to-be say it’s time to not care,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/thin-fair-brides-to-be-say-its-time-to-not-care/articleshow/112356146.cms,"(mothermonials.com site, enabled with AI, is also assisting women to express themselves better)

Fair. Beautiful. Thin. These attributes once part of matrimonial ads are making way for the new beauty gauge — confidence, intelligence, emotional maturity and a touch of ‘chocolate/caramel skin’ — as society is fully primed to shift from long-held, longunquestioned societal norms.Boxed in by narrow beauty standards perpetuated by matrimonial advertisements with trite descriptors, young women and brides-to-be are coming under unrealistic expectations and pressure.Now, the kids on the marriage block are embracing their authentic selves . Brides-to-be are among the worse impacted by societal pressure to meet beauty standards, often feeling the need to conform to certain ideals just to find a suitable partner.However, a new generation is pushing back against these narrow definitions of beauty. Jenny John, 24, shared her journey of self-acceptance with TOI. Once told her ‘dark’ skin would make marriage prospects tough, Jenny now celebrates her “chocolate/caramel skin” as an asset. “I feel it’s my strength, my beauty. I don’t wonder or fear anymore about getting married. I know there will be people who will love me for who and what I am intrinsically,” she said.Bride-to-be Meghna K expressed similar sentiments. After years of feeling pressured to conform to societal beauty standards, she’s now embracing her brown skin and curvy body. “Growing up, I felt I had to fit certain descriptions to be considered worthy. But now, I realise how limiting and harmful these ideas are. I’ve decided to reject outdated norms and embrace my true self,” she said.It’s not just young adults and brides-to-be. Teenagers have also felt the pressure of this matrimonial culture. “For years, I felt pressured to be fair and slim because that’s what I saw in matrimonial ads,” said Reshma Shirin, a 19-year-old student.“It took me years to take pictures without filters that whitewash us. Society wants us to be whitewashed; when we try, they call us fake. It’s all about the right people who make you feel loved for being yourself. No filters. No whitewashing. Just pure love from people who appreciate your beauty, both inside and outside,” she added.Matchmakers across Bengaluru have noticed this shift in attitudes. Meenaka Kumar, a seasoned matchmaker, observed that men are no longer solely focused on physical appearances, and women are crafting more honest, empowered profiles.“People are looking for traits like smart, financially independent, and politically aware partners,” Kumar noted, indicating a broader change in marriage priorities. Poornima Bhasker, a relationship adviser, echoed these observations.She highlighted that women are making smarter choices and valuing their confidence, intelligence, and emotional maturity over traditional beauty standards . Beauty brand Dove, in partnership with TOI, is trying to turn traditional matrimonials promoting outdated beauty standards into empowering ‘mothermonials’ that inspire society to see brides beyond stereotypes.","Young women and brides-to-be are coming under unrealistic expectations and pressure.

Almost a year ago, we kicked off our Modern Dell efforts across the company to simplify how we operate and reimagine work and customer experiences with AI. For go-to-market teams, we designed an integrated strategy to drive even more customer and partner satisfaction, create new opportunities, redefine what's possible and set the stage for winning over the next 40 years.

We aim to grow faster than the market by seamlessly meeting our customers and partners online, virtually, or in person, to unlock the value of modern IT and AI for their organizations. For our sales teams, we're working to free your time to spend more of it learning and selling. When you spend more time with customers and partners, you know them better, engage further, win more and drive even better outcomes.

Why modernize:

Massive Opportunity: We have a $2.1 trillion total addressable market*, including emerging sectors like AI, and we are committed to capitalize on these opportunities.

Modern Customer Expectations: Customers expect a modern and distinctive experience. We'll engage on their terms — whether in-person, online, or through self-service.

Buyer Landscape Changing: Decision makers are expanding into the functions and business units, requiring us to rethink how we cover our customers.

Modern Seller Expectations: We must free up TIME to enable you to spend it on you most important work — SELLING!

We are starting from a position of strength: We have leading end-to-end solutions, a world-class supply chain, unmatched Global Services, and unparalleled customer reach with the largest GTM [go-to-market] engine in the industry — giving us unstoppable differentiation in the marketplace.

To build on our strengths, realize our vision, and empower you to sell and win, today we are announcing a new Global Sales organizational structure and operating model.

…

One sales team, structure & culture

We're taking a big step toward centralizing sales into one organization as the Consumer and Small Business (CSB) and Client Solution Group (CSG) sales teams join Global Sales.

….

Segmentation and coverage

To simplify how we classify and cover customer, we have:

Consolidated accounts into fewer segments of similar size.

Tightened account executive-to-account ratios across each customer segment with a more integrated and effective Inside Sales-led motion.

…

Winning in AI

The world of AI is moving fast, and we are expanding our AI GTM capability.

We are standing up a new AI Select Sales team, led by Scott Millard reporting to John, to lead AI pursuits for select accounts in close collaboration with the product, marketing and services teams.

Kyle Dufresne and the AI Solutions Sales team will continue to support the GTM teams driving enablement and broad AI opportunities.

…

Leaders will hold meetings in the coming weeks to ensure you understand the approach and what it means for you and Dell Technologies.

Through all of this, we are getting leaner. We're streamlining layers of management and reprioritizing where we invest. We don't do this lightly as we know these changes impact people and our teams.

As we simplify, standardize and focus — and become a more modern organization — we'll extend our lead as the world's best go-to-market sales team. We have a winning strategy to propel our growth. It's a journey, and we'll adjust as we go.

The destination is going to be worth it — it's about winning and winning big!

Good selling,

The national transporter will prioritise Kavach deployment on such sections (5,000 km) and will also roll out installing of the automatic train protection (ATP) system in 10,000 locos and 9,000 km track from Oct.Speaking to reporters, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the tenders for these works will be bid out in the next three months. The section on which the Kavach system will be deployed include Mumbai-Chennai and Chennai-Kolkata rail corridors. He said the Kavach system will be fully deployed on Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Howrah stretch by March 2025. He added that now the railways can deploy 4,000 km of the train protection system annually.“With this we will have Kavach installed in half of the locos or train engines,” he added. Officials added that all new trains will come pre-installed with Kavach 4.0. The system prevents trains from exceeding safe speeds or ‘Passing Signals At Danger’ and automatically controls the train’s speed and can apply brakes to prevent accidents, if the pilot fails to do so.Currently, 1,465 route kilometres of railway network have the Kavach system. Medha Servo Drives, HBL Power Systems and Kernex Microsystems are the three firms that have been certified to deploy Kavach. Another two companies are likely to get the approval in the next two months.Vaishnaw also said that the railways will complete the process of required mapping of the 8,000 stations by December and a tender will be floated for installation of the devices. Sources said while the focus is on faster deployment of the current version of Kavach, the railways is also working on developing Kavach 6.0, which will replace existing automatic signalling.","Railways will come out with a unified Subordinate Rules in the next 7-10 days.

Incentives for hybrids ‘regressive’: Tata Motors Cars MD Shailesh Chandra,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/incentives-for-hybrids-regressive-tata-motors-cars-md-shailesh-chandra/articleshow/112355394.cms,"MUMBAI: Taking on Maruti Suzuki and Toyota who have been campaigning for incentives for hybrids , Tata Motors on Wednesday said any such benefits will be “regressive and waste of govt money” and will “slow down the pace of EV adoption” in the country while making the vehicles globally uncompetitive.“You can’t confuse the country. From a tech perspective, incentivising hybrids is a regression for the country and makes us globally uncompetitive… Do you want the country to go slow on zero emissions tech? Is that the direction you want to set?” Tata Motors MD for passenger cars and EVs Shailesh Chandra told TOI when asked about demands being made by companies such as Maruti, Toyota and Honda for incentives on hybrids.Tata on Wednesday drove in the Curvv EV with an entry price of Rs 17.5 lakh (ex-showroom), and will also launch petrol and diesel versions of the vehicle soon.Chandra said electrics are a must for companies to adhere to CAFÉ norms. “To meet net zero emissions target for every company and the country, you have to have a razor sharp focus — which is a movement towards EVs,” he said, terming hybrid “as a technology that only makes internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles achieve better fuel efficiency, but not zero emissions.”The central govt has given a subsidised 5% GST tax rate for electrics, while fixing over 44% GST for petrol, diesel, hybrids and other larger cars.Companies asking for incentives for hybrids, primarily the Japanese carmakers (Maruti is majority owned by Japan’s Suzuki), have been asking for incentives too, saying the technology helps reduce CO2 emissions over conventional cars while giving better fuel efficiency. UP govt recently paid heed to their demands by doing away with registration taxes on hybrids.Chandra said hybrid is an over two decades old technology, and is being used by some carmakers only because they are yet not ready with electrics and want to meet the fleet emission compliance standards.“Why would somebody regress the country to something which is old and transient? Hybrids are being pursued by players who are under pressure to meet the CAFÉ mandates and are also late in introducing EVs,” he said, adding, “We should not be wasting govt money for this.”Also, he said car companies selling hybrids enjoy healthy margins on them due to good customer demand, and thus do not need govt support. On the other hand, companies selling EVs are subsidising their margins to encourage customers, while also aiding in the setting up of the requisite infrastructure.“I am not earning from EVs, but I am still trying to drive in price parity. I am sacrificing my margins to make the zero emissions technology work. But in hybrids, companies are already earning money, but still want govt support.”He said that hybrids should not be “confused” with EVs. “Just because it uses motor and a minuscule battery and gives higher fuel efficiency than traditional ICE doesn’t make the hybrids as clean as EVs.”",Maruti Suzuki and Toyota have been campaigning for incentives for hybrids.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Earthquake Bakersfield: What's behind strongest tremors felt in Southern California in years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whats-behind-strongest-tremors-felt-in-southern-california-in-years/articleshow/112360434.cms,"A magnitude 5.2 earthquake struck Southern California on Tuesday (PST) night, with its epicentre located about 18 miles southwest of Bakersfield.The US Geological Survey reported that the quake occurred at 9:09 pm (PST), with its epicentre near Mettler, an unincorporated area in Kern County, approximately 85 miles from downtown Los Angeles .The tremor was widely felt across the region, including in Los Angeles, though there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries, as reposted by Los Angeles Times.The initial shock was followed by a series of aftershocks , including a stronger 4.5 magnitude quake that struck less than a minute later, and another at 4.1 magnitude temblor at 9:17 pm (PST).Residents in the Los Angeles Basin, inland valleys, and even as far as Santa Maria, Bakersfield, and Fresno felt the quake.Allen Husker, a geophysics professor and the head of the Southern California Seismic Network at Caltech, explained why so many people felt the quake, especially in the Los Angeles area. Since the earthquake hit at night, when most people were at home and likely resting, they were more sensitive to the shaking than they might have been during the day when they’re busier and more active.Husker also highlighted the influence of the "" basin effect "" in the Los Angeles region. The city sits atop the Los Angeles Basin, a six-mile-deep, bathtub-shaped area filled with soft sand and gravel. This geological feature, stretching from Beverly Hills to northern Orange County, acts like a giant amplifier for seismic waves.“The basin effect ... increases the shaking that you would otherwise normally have,” Husker said.This earthquake was the strongest to hit Southern California in three years. The last time the region experienced a quake of similar magnitude was in June 2021, with a 5.3 magnitude tremor near the Salton Sea. A year earlier, in June 2020, a 5.5 magnitude quake hit the Mojave Desert.Interestingly, Tuesday’s earthquake occurred just 12 miles northwest of the epicentre of the massive 7.5 magnitude Kern County earthquake that struck in 1952. The 1952 earthquake, which occurred due to the White Wolf fault , was felt as far away as San Francisco and Las Vegas, according to the USGS.However, Tuesday's earthquake was not associated with any previously identified faults in the region.","A magnitude 5.2 earthquake struck Southern California on Tuesday (PST) night, with its epicentre located about 18 miles southwest of Bakersfield.

Boeing 737 Max employees that experienced a door plug detachment during a flight in January said that they felt pressure to complete their tasks too fast to avoid mistakes, during a two-day investigative hearing conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday.The hearing deals into the blowout incident on January 5, where a door plug blew out mid-flight as it approached 16,000 feet, the unexpected failure resulted in a large opening on the fuselage, exposing the interior to the outside environment, leading to sudden decompression, oxygen masks deployed from the overhead compartments, catching passengers off guard.The force of the airflow was so intense that it tore off passengers' clothing and violently pulled phones from their hands.The revelation commenced with NTSB investigators questioning Boeing staff about safety concerns within the company and the potential implications for passengers traveling on its widely used aircraft. Earlier, the NTSB had said that the door plug ripped off in mid-flight due to the absence of the four bolts required to secure the door plug in place, the CNN reported.Many of those documents were transcripts of interviews conducted by NTSB investigators during the seven months since the accident.In interviews conducted by NTSB investigators in the months following the accident, a Boeing employee, referred to as ""Assembler Installer Doors B,"" said that the excessive workload at the factory was too great to avoid mistakes from being made.“As far as the workload, I feel like we were definitely trying to put out too much product, right?” said the unidentified Boeing worker. “That’s how mistakes are made. People try to work too fast. I mean, I can’t speak for anybody else, but we were busy. We were working a lot.”Another Boeing employee, identified as a Door Master Lead, revealed to investigators that many aspects of the planes had to be reworked during the assembly process due to discovered issues, such as the door plug that was removed to repair rivets. The worker mentioned that there was no specialized training for handling door plugs compared to regular doors.The Door Master Lead described the situation to the NTSB, stating that his team was ""put in uncharted waters to where… we were replacing doors like we were replacing our underwear.""“The planes come in jacked up every day. Every day,” the second worker added.An FAA inspector at the Boeing factory told NTSB investigators that they have “heard of pressure, [but] haven’t been able to substantiate those claims.”The plane's fuselage, produced by Boeing's supplier Spirit AeroSystems , was delivered to the Boeing factory with the four bolts already installed, as revealed during the hearing testimony. However, due to issues with the rivets near the door plug that required repairs, the door plug was removed to facilitate the necessary work.Despite the presence of Spirit employees at the Boeing plant, communication between the Boeing and Spirit workers on the factory floor was inadequate, as indicated in another interview transcript released on Tuesday.“Well, basically we’re the cockroaches of the factory,” an unidentified employee told NTSB investigators.And a Boeing team captain at the 737 factory said, “We have a lot of turnover specifically because, you know, this can be a stressful job, you know,” the Boeing team captain is quoted as saying in one of the transcripts. “What the company wants and what we have the skills and capabilities to perform at the time sometimes that doesn’t coincide, and so some people get disgruntled; they feel like they’re being overworked; they feel like, you know, that we might be getting taken advantage of,” CNN reported.The flight crew successfully brought the damaged aircraft to the ground, avoiding any severe bodily harm to those on board. Upon landing, medical attention was provided to seven passengers and one crew member for their injuries. The fortunate outcome, with no fatalities, can be attributed to both the expertise of the flight crew and a stroke of good fortune.However, as highlighted by Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the NTSB, during the opening remarks of the hearing, the trauma of being on the flight likely affected many of those aboard the plane.“Injuries we can’t see, which we often don’t talk about, can have profound and lasting impacts on lives and livelihoods,” she said and also issued an apology on behalf of the agency to the passengers on the flight.The public's trust in Boeing suffered a significant blow due to the accident, triggering a wave of federal probes into the company's procedures and the overall safety and quality of its planes.According to the NTSB's preliminary findings, the plane involved in the incident was delivered from the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, just 10 weeks prior, and it was missing the four bolts required to secure the door plug in place.Boeing has since explained that this oversight was due to a simple lack of documentation. When the plane's fuselage arrived at the Boeing factory from supplier Spirit AeroSystems, the door plug and its four bolts were correctly installed. However, there were issues with five nearby rivets, and Boeing employees removed the door plug to repair these rivets.According to CNN, the workers who fixed the rivets failed to generate the necessary paperwork indicating that they had removed the door plug and the four bolts to complete the repair work. As a result, when a different team of employees reinstalled the plug, they were unaware that the plane would be flown in that condition.Instead, they believed they were simply blocking the hole with the plug to protect the fuselage's interior from weather exposure as the plane was moved to another area of the factory compound.It is likely that these employees assumed the existence of paperwork documenting the removal of the plug and bolts, which would have alerted someone further along the assembly line to replace the missing bolts . However, without this documentation, no one on the assembly line was aware.The company may face criminal charges related to the failures that led to the incident, as the FBI has informed passengers and crew members that they could be considered crime victims.Boeing was already facing potential criminal charges prior to the flight due to issues with the 737 Max that were concealed from the Federal Aviation Administration during the initial certification process. These issues resulted in a design flaw on the plane that is believed to have caused two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019, claiming 346 lives.In the first six months of this year, Boeing's sales have dropped by 70%.The NTSB is conducting a crucial two-day investigative hearing to conclude the inquiry into the January 5 incident involving 737 MAX 9 aircraft. The NTSB has stated its intention to “use the information gathered to complete the investigation, determine probable cause, and make recommendations to improve transportation safety.”","Boeing 737 Max employees that experienced a door plug detachment during a flight in January said that they felt pressure to complete their tasks too fast.

Yunus sees ‘many opportunities to heal rifts’ with India

DHAKA: Bangladesh , lumbering through chaos, confusion and violence for three days, will get an interim govt Thursday with Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus at the helm, marking a political comeback for the self-exiled 84-year-old former “banker to the poor” after years of battling corruption and other cases slapped by the erstwhile Sheikh Hasina administration.Army chief Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman held a presser to announce a possible 8pm swearing-in, hours after Yunus’s scheduled 2.10pm (Dhaka time) arrival from Paris via Dubai. “Let us ensure that we make the best use of this new victory. Let us not lose this victory because of any mistake of ours,” he said in an appeal.This is a beautiful country, with lots of exciting possibilities. We must protect and make it a wonderful country for us and for our future generations.” The banker-economist, who won the peace Nobel in 2006 for pioneering microcredit in his native country through Grameen Bank , said he was “looking forward to going back home, see what’s happening, and how we can organise ourselves to get out of the trouble we are in”.In Dhaka, the army chief said the interim govt, which he termed “an advisory council”, might have 15 members. “He (Yunus) is very eager to do this,” Gen Wakar said his address. “I am certain that he will be able to take us through a beautiful democratic process, and we will benefit from this.”The decision to have an interim govt headed by Yunus was sealed at a meeting Wednesday in Bangabhaban, the official residence and workplace of the President, with the chiefs of the three forces, two Dhaka University teachers and coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement in attendance.Prez Mohammed Sahabuddin immediately agreed to the student representatives’ proposal to request Yunus to shepherd Bangladesh out of the crisis, officials said.Yunus, who is set to become the 32nd Nobel laureate to be a head of state, remains a longtime critic of ex-PM Sheikh Hasina, who resigned on Aug 5 in the face of a mass anti-reservation uprising and fled to India.

Yunus, who described Hasina’s ouster as the “second liberation” of Bangladesh, also called for reviving Saarc, which has been blocked by India over Pakistan’s support to cross-border terror.","Yunus won the peace Nobel in 2006 for pioneering microcredit in his native country through Grameen Bank.
