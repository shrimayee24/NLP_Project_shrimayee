NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir LG Manoj Sinha on Thursday ordered the termination of two J&K government teachers found by an internal enquiry to be part of Lashker e Taiba's (LeT) overground network in Jammu division's Reasi and Rajouri districts respectively.The two staffers -- Ghulam Hussain, who joined the J&K education department in 2004 and Majid Iqbal Dar, working there since 2009 -- were dismissed by invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution of India as part of the ongoing, broader crackdown on the terror ecosystem within the Union territory. Nearly 77 J&K govt staffers have been given marching orders under this provision since 2020.Both Hussain and Dar are currently lodged in prison in separate terror cases.Sources in J&K govt told TOI that Hussain was posted at Govt Primary School, Kalwa, Mahore, Reasi but covertly working for LeT to strengthen its terror network in Reasi and the surrounding areas.“The evidence collected by the law enforcement and intelligence agencies has revealed that he was in touch with LeT terrorists Mohd Qasim and Ghulam Mustafa through encrypted messaging applications and was carrying out terror activities at their behest.He would receive terror funds via local conduits and pass them on to families of known terrorists for support, besides using the money for terror recruitment and logistics.Ghulam was arrested in 2023. Sources, citing investigation details, said he was a highly-radicalised terror sympathiser and involved in recruitment of youth into the terror fold.Majid Iqbal Dar was appointed as a laboratory assistant in 2009 promoted as a teacher in 2019. As per the dossier on his terror links, Dar was working for LeT as an OGW and was involved in radicalising youngsters in Rajouri and surrounding areas. Investigation revealed that Dar was engaged in narco-terror activities and maintained a close link with LeT terrorist Mod Jabar. He was a reliable asset to LeT and was using drug money to finance terror activities and radicalise gullible youth, said a source.“Dar’s terror link was exposed in January 2023 when police recovered an IED planted near J&K Bank in Rajouri. During the course of investigation, the police arrested three persons including Dar. It was later revealed that Majid, along with LeT terrorists Jabar and Zohaib Shazad, had planted the IED on the instruction of an LeT handler based in Pakistan. They had received monetary compensation via a conduit,” said an officer.Sources said Dar continues to display radical tendencies inside the prison.","Ghulam Hussain, who joined the J&K education department in 2004, and Majid Iqbal Dar, working there since 2009, were dismissed.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday criticised Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , alleging that Gandhi insulted the Chhath Puja festival as he is ignorant of India's culture since Italy is his ""maternal home"".Addressing multiple rallies in Bihar, Shah said the INDIA bloc will be ""wiped out"" and that voters would ""avenge"" what he called an ""insult to Chhathi Maiyya"". He also referred to an earlier incident where Congress workers in the state allegedly abused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mother.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had held one of his election meetings in the Muzaffarpur on Wednesday, and alleged that the PM had tried to enact a ""drama"" by planning to take a dip in the Yamuna at Delhi, on the occasion of Chhath Puja.He had alleged that Modi gave up his plans to take a dip when it came to light that the spot he had chosen was a puddle created with clean, piped water, since the Yamuna was extremely polluted and not fit for a bath.""Rahul baba has said Modi and others who worshipped Chhathi Maiyya were indulging in drama. His maternal roots are in Italy, and hence he has no idea about the country's culture,"" Shah said, as quoted by PTI. He asked voters to press the EVM button on NDA symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in Italy"".The home minister accused the Congress and its allies of preventing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. He said, ""thwarting for 70 years"" the construction of the temple, which he said had been a matter of struggle ""since the times of the Mughals, and continued under the British"".Shah praised the Modi government for developing a new university at Nalanda, saying ""no Bakhtiyar Khilji will be able to destroy"" it. He also mentioned an ongoing project worth about Rs 850 crore to develop Punaura Dham in Sitamarhi district, which is linked to the birthplace of Goddess Sita. ""In two years from now, you will see PM Modi performing the consecration ceremony (pran pratishtha) at Punaura Dham,"" he said.At a rally in Nalanda, Shah opened his speech with references to Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya. He then criticised the previous RJD governments led by Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi, saying Bihar witnessed ""over 32,000 kidnappings and 12 major massacres"" during their tenure. He said, ""Nitish Kumar ended the ‘jungle raj’... but RJD is trying to bring back ‘jungle raj’ in the state with a new face.""Shah rejected claims by Tejashwi Yadav that the NDA would take back money deposited in women’s accounts under welfare schemes. ""Nobody can dare to take that money back. RJD leaders must give up this diatribe,"" he said.The home minister said that during Nitish Kumar’s time in power, ""there has been a 20 per cent drop in murders while dacoities and kidnappings have gone down by 80 per cent"". He added, ""We are preparing the youth of Bihar to win medals in the 2036 Olympics that will happen in India.""","Amit Shah says Rahul Gandhi insulted the Chhath Puja festival as he is ignorant of India's culture.

Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel didn’t just integrate India. He also helped construct the nation’s democratic institutions...This is the crown jewel of his glittering career. Just after attaining independence from colonial rule in 1947, India was confronted with a major challenge. About 40% of the country was under 565 princely states. Integrating them seamlessly into the fabric of a newly born nation was a masterly act of persuasion. There were some, such as the Nizam of Hyderabad, who held out. That’s when Vallabhbhai Patel, then India’s deputy prime minister and home minister, showed his iron fists. Operation Polo followed, forcing the recalcitrant Nizam to sign “the instrument of accession”. Partition had claimed at least 200,000 lives. Due to Patel’s resolute blend of diplomacy and force, one of the most demanding obstacles to a fully unified India was countered with minimum human cost. Hence, he justifiably became “the Iron Man of India.”The birth of civil services dates back to the early years of British rule. It was “the steel frame” of colonial rule. Which is why many were sceptical about its continuance in free India.Even before Independence, as home minister of the interim govt, Patel had been engaged with the issue of the future of the civil and police services. To that end, he had convened a conference of provincial premiers in Oct 1946. Post Independence, he held the firm view that an all-India merit-based administrative service was fundamental to hold Indians together. His efforts were key to the formation of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Indian Police Service (IPS) as a replacement to ICS. This was a new steel frame for a newly independent nation. He is said to have told young officers to serve the people with integrity and humility.Patel also outlined the purpose of the census and mapped its vision. In Feb 1950, just 10 months before his death, Patel inaugurated a conference of census superintendents in Delhi. In the conference, the deputy PM underlined that the census will play a vital role in determining India’s administrative policies. “Census, he stated, was no longer a mere counting of heads but involved the extraction of valuable scientific data of sociological importance,” a report published insaid. He further elaborated on the outline of the exercise: “…the present census would devote greater attention to the collection and formulation of basic economic data relating to the means of livelihood of the people and other economic activities of the individual…” Patel further said, “I would like to stress Census affords an opportunity for the Government to reach every home throughout the length and breadth of the country. ” Simply put, Patel put together the building blocks of the first census, which began in 1951.If Champaran Satyagraha brought Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to national prominence, the Bardoli Satyagraha did the same for Patel. Like Champaran, Bardoli was a farmers’ protest against imposition of high taxes. Patel’s methodical and disciplined organisation of a mass movement, which led to a cancellation of the tax raise, earned him the endearing sobriquet of Sardar, by which he was referred to by many for the rest of his life. Much before the Bardoli Satyagraha (1928), though, Patel had provided a glimpse of his abilities while assisting Gandhi in Kheda Satyagraha (1918). This was another battle for peasant rights where Patel showcased his pragmatic leadership style and steadfastness to farmers’ cause.On Jan 17, 1948, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel spoke at Chowpatty in Mumbai. The meeting was attended by at least one lakh people. In an hour-long speech, India’s deputy PM said that if the country was to survive as a nation, it needed a strong army.reported: “Mahatma Gandhi did not believe in armed strength, Sardar Patel added. But as a practical man, he could not accept the Mahatma’s advice so far as the military strength of India was concerned. Our army ought to be strong enough that no power would ever think of interfering in India.”",Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was India’s deputy prime minister and home minister.

'NDA Coming To Power With Thumping Majority': Bihar Minister Sanjay Saraogi On Assembly Polls

PATNA: NDA is all set to release its manifesto for the assembly elections on Friday, focusing on creating jobs within the state in sectors such as IT, semiconductors and micro, small and medium enterprises and setting up a contrast with opposition alliance, Mahagathbandhan's bid to draw voters with the lure of govt jobs.The BJP-led alliance's plan presents a contrasting vision and is seen to be ambitious in a state where there is a clamour for cushy govt jobs. In contrast, private jobs, although better paying are seen as riskier, often linked to business cycles and come with features like remuneration being linked to performance.Besides, in the past govts in Bihar have been seen to be more rigid to accommodating the demands of the private sector when it comes to concessions or providing land. The IT sector and MSMEs do not require large tracts of land.With migration being a major issue, NDA's push for creating employment within the state is also likely to address the concern.""There is talent here so why not focus on IT and similar sectors given that professionals from Bihar are working in Pune, Gurgaon and Bangalore,"" said a prominent NDA politician.The focus on MSMEs is seen to be a more pragmatic commitment given that Bihar is unlikely to be able to attract large factories to be set up without having the ecosystem that can cater to the big manufacturing companies.","The BJP-led alliance's plan presents a contrasting vision and is seen to be ambitious in a state where there is a clamour for cushy govt jobs.

8th Pay Commission: What will be the impact of fitment factor on salary?





Central government employees and pensioners can soon look forward to getting higher salaries and pensions respectively, with the Terms of Reference for the 8th Central Pay Commission being approved by the Cabinet this week.The 8th Central Pay Commission has been tasked with submitting a report in 18 months and the recommendations, once approved by the government, will likely be effective retrospectively from January 1, 2026.According to an ET report, the 7th Pay Commission saw a fitment factor of 2.57 being implemented. The fitment or multiplier factor for the 8th Pay Commission will be known after the commission’s report and government’s approval.Manjeet Singh Patel, who heads the All India NPS Employees Federation as National President, told ET that calculation of new basic pay involves multiplying the existing basic salary with the fitment factor assigned by the latest pay commission.To understand this better: take an example where an individual has a basic pay of Rs 35,000. This when multiplied by a fitment factor of 2.11, results in a new basic salary of Rs 73,850.Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: How much salary & pension hike should central government employees, pensioners expect? Top things to know Nexdigm's Director of Payroll Services, Ramachandran Krishnamoorthy, said that percentage-based allowances like HRA will increase proportionally with the revised basic pay upon notification.He was quoted as saying that fixed benefits such as transport allowance undergo separate reviews and their revisions typically follow several months after the implementation of the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations.Whilst dearness allowance isn't the direct determinant of fitment factor, pay commissions tend to consider the DA rate, which is calculated based on basic pay, as one of the crucial elements whilst establishing the fitment factor.To illustrate, Patel explains that with the current DA at 58% and a projected 12% increase by the time the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations take effect, DA could possibly reach 70%.The government then assesses the growth factor, which previously stood at 24%. The pay commission's calculations also incorporate family units, earlier set at 3 but potentially rising to 4 this time. A shift to 4 family units could result in an additional 13% increase. The fitment factor takes into account all of these things.Patel told ET that whilst the fitment factor influences the basic salary and HRA, the DA resets to zero under a new pay commission. As a result, the overall salary increase for central government employees may typically range between 20-25%.In the context of the 7th Pay Commission, a standard factor of 2.57 was implemented uniformly for all positions, Krishnamoorthy said. Whilst the government might maintain this consistent approach for ease of administration, there exists a possibility of introducing a marginally higher multiplier for lower salary bands to reduce income gaps.Also Read | Husband missing for over 7 years: How wife won a case in Chhattisgarh High Court to get central government pension - ruling explained According to Patel, senior-level staff have increased opportunities for career advancement compared to junior staff. Therefore, the commission could potentially allocate higher fitment factors to lower-ranking staff and lower factors to senior positions. Additionally, consideration might be given to consolidating certain pay levels to streamline the pay structure.Currently, central government employees are classified across 18 distinct pay levels.For a central government employee with basic pay of Rs 50,000, the revised salary calculation under a 2.0 fitment factor is straightforward.Krishnamoorthy says if the fitment factor is fixed at 2, then the employee's current basic pay of Rs 50,000 under the 7th Pay Commission would be multiplied by it.Also Read | Income Tax department doubts Rs 10 lakh gift - brother gets tax notice for cash received from sisters; how he appealed & won the case This calculation results in a new basic pay of Rs 1,00,000. The employee would be positioned at the nearest higher cell in the revised pay matrix. Additional benefits such as DA, HRA and transport allowance would then be computed based on this new basic salary.According to Krishnamoorthy, pension revisions for central government retirees typically follow the same fitment factor. Using the 2.0 factor as an example, a pensioner currently receiving Rs 30,000 would have their basic pension increased to approximately Rs 60,000, pending final approval and adjustments.","The 8th Central Pay Commission has been tasked with submitting a report in 18 months.

Rare earth nod comes with no-export rider





NEW DELHI: Govt on Thursday announced ""some Indian companies"" have got approval from China to import rare earth magnets, to be used in automotive and electronics industries.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets whose procurement had been stopped after China put curbs on their sale earlier this year.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday confirmed that some Indian companies have received licences for importing rare earth magnets from China, while responding to questions on the matter.""As far as the question of the latest talks and relaxations that have happened between the US and China (and) as to how it is going to play into our domain, I will come back to you. We have yet to look at it. I am not aware of the technicalities... But I do confirm that Indian companies have received licenses for importing rare earths from China,"" he said.Jaiswal, however, did not give details of the companies that have received permission. Industry sources said the companies include those that supply components to the automotive and electronics industries.However, the imports come with certain restrictions. These include conditions that the magnets cannot be exported to the US, and cannot be used for defence-related industries.The curbs have impacted the production of automobiles, especially electric cars and two-wheelers with companies petitioning govt to take up the matter with China.Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets commercially available. Their high magnetic strength and resistance to demagnetisation make them indispensable in a range of applications, especially where weight and space are constraints.According to experts, these magnets are made primarily from rare earth elements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium - materials that allow for powerful magnetic properties essential in miniaturised and energy-efficient devices. They are typically made from alloys that contain rare earth elements. The most commonly used rare earth magnet is the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet.China is estimated to account for about 70% of global rare earth metals mining and holds nearly 90% of the world's rare earth magnet's production. One of the biggest reasons that China dominates the rare earth magnet industry is its control over the entire supply chain, including mining of rare earth ores, separation and refining of rare earth elements (a complex and environmentally sensitive process), and alloy production and magnet manufacturing.Just in the Indian auto industry alone, about 870 tonnes of rare-earth magnets are required to be imported in FY 2025-26 out of the country's estimated overall requirement of 3,600 tonnes.","MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets.

TOI in its report published on Wednesday highlighted how vehicle owners were facing difficulty in uploading multiple documents online for verification of the FASTag linked to the vehicle. There have been instances when they were informed about blocked FASTag because of incomplete KYV when their vehicles were at the toll gates.","FASTag services won't be discontinued for non-compliant vehicles, says NHAI. Only the front picture showing the number plate and FASTag will be required to be uploaded. Provisions will be made to automatically fetch RC details from Vahan database when the user enters vehicle, chassis or mobile number.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124970801,imgsize-855028,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-image.jpg"

India’s Iran Gambit Pays Off: US Grants India Sanctions Waiver on Chabahar Port For Six More Months

NEW DELHI: US has extended the waiver from sanctions granted last month for the Chabahar port in Iran by another six months, the govt said Thursday. To isolate Tehran, the US state department had in Sept revoked the sanctions exception issued in 2018 for the port that India developed for access to Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pak.Once effective, those operating the port or carrying out related activities under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act are likely to face US sanctions.The port is increasingly important for India's access to Afghanistan at a time when its ties with the Taliban regime in Kabul are on the upswing. Both sides are looking to ramp up their economic ties and the Taliban have appealed to Pakistan to allow India and Afghanistan to trade via the land route.",US Grants India Sanctions Waiver on Chabahar Port For Six More Months.

Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

What is KYV?

The Process

The Pain

If recurring KYCs was not enough, there’s now a KYV that you must go through if you happen to own a vehicle. Short for know your vehicle, this new process that is supposed to sanitise your FASTag is the latest compliance burden to be thrust on Indians.What was the need? Apparently, cases of misuse of FASTags — in some cases by truck drivers who were using tags meant for cars — convinced policy-makers that they needed a nationwide firewall to prevent a bunch of delinquents from misusing FASTags.It was rolled out as a mandatory process, beginning Oct 31, 2024, that requires all FASTag users to submit images of their vehicle and registration certificate to verify that the tag is linked to the correct vehicle. A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiative, KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). To prevent fraud. And if you thought this was a one-time process, you’re wrong. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Why? The possibility of misuse, and ingenious delinquents finding more ways to bend the system.A govt official explained that instances had emerged of people keeping loose FASTags in their pockets or wallets, instead of fixing them on their vehicle windshields, “leading to misuse”.“In some cases, tags issued for cars were used on trucks to pay lower toll charges. KYV will put an end to such misuse,” said another official.A source said since the main thrust of the FASTag rollout was to increase its usage so that toll collection became digitised, there may have been some laxity on the part of banks while issuing them. A KYV, said officials, will “help sanitise the system”.“Ensuring a FASTag is assigned to and affixed on the correct category of vehicle, and that it remains active, is crucial as we prepare to roll out multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system of tolling in which vehicles will neither need to stop, nor slow down as there will be no physical barriers, said a road transport ministry official.Govt aims to bring all national highways that have four or more lanes under MLFF tolling in the next 4-5 years. Therefore, according to officials, one vehicle, one tag is so important.Asked why not detect and disable fraudulent tags or penalise those using multiple tags on the same vehicle, there were no clear answers.According to the circular issued by NPCI, all FASTags need to comply with KYV norms. The process mandates linking the FASTag to the unique Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) and chassis number. FASTag issuers, meanwhile, need to follow the one-vehicle-one tag mandate and replace all tags that are more than five years old.So, anyone with a FASTag must upload their vehicle registration certificate (RC), take a picture of their vehicle from the front and upload that along with the FASTtag and vehicle registration number, besides a side image with the tag and vehicle axles. All these, mind you, must be clearly visible.Issuers need to verify this with the VAHAN database, customer mobile number, and data entered by the point-of-sale agent. FASTags without a valid KYV will get automatically deactivated.While there is great conviction among decision-makers that KYV is the right way to go, there are unpleasant surprises galore that the process is throwing up for people, from being stopped at toll plazas and being told FASTag isn’t working because of “non-compliance with KYV”, to encountering an upload process that involves multiple rounds of clicking photos and sharing documents. Adding to frustrations is its propensity to get stuck — a backend that is simply not prepared to handle such a mammoth job — and sending harried users back to square one.“I was told by a toll gate attendant that my FASTag isn’t working because KYV hasn’t been completed. So, I stopped and had to go through the entire process of taking photos and uploading documents from the toll plaza, just so I could drive on without a penalty despite having a legal and functional FASTag. Govt talks about ease of life, ease of travel, ease of business, etc. How is this ease of anything?” a Delhi resident who recently had to do a KYV at a toll plaza in NCR asked.Having seen people struggle through this, govt officials have started telling banks they should not deactivate tags without calling up customers and informing them about the KYV norm. Sources said the issuer bank, not NPCI, is involved in backend processing of KYV documents.A senior road transport ministry official admitted the process needs to be made easier for the people. Another official said that having a similar process across bank portals and a helpline to guide people could be useful.",KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to prevent fraud.

NEW DELHI: Red Chillies Entertainment has told the Delhi high court that Indian Revenue Service officer and former NCB Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede's defamation suit against its Netflix series The Bads of Bollywood is ""misconceived,"" arguing that the show is ""a work of situational satire"" and that Wankhede’s reputation had already been under public ridicule long before its release.In its detailed reply, the Shah Rukh Khan-owned production house said the web series does not name or depict Wankhede, nor does it contain any defamatory material, adding that ""the plaintiff cannot claim reputational harm where none existed to begin with,"" news agency ANI reported.The affidavit stated that Wankhede's public image had already suffered following the 2023 CBI FIR against him for alleged extortion and corruption, undermining his claim of an ""unblemished record.""""The existence of the FIR and the necessity for interim protection belie the plaintiff’s assertions,"" the reply said, adding that he ""was already the subject of public ridicule and adverse commentary"" prior to the show’s release.Red Chillies maintained that The Bads of Bollywood is a satire on the Hindi film industry, exploring themes of celebrity culture, nepotism, and sensationalism through humor and exaggeration — forms of expression protected under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.Challenging the maintainability of the case, the company also argued that the Delhi high court lacks jurisdiction, since both Wankhede and the principal defendants, including Netflix, are based in Mumbai.Referring to a brief, one-minute-forty-eight-second scene that Wankhede objected to, Red Chillies said it “merely portrays an overzealous officer” and carries no defamatory reference.Quoting the Bonnard v. Perryman principle, the reply urged the court to avoid pre-trial injunctions in defamation cases as they amount to prior restraint on free speech.“Satire allows the satirist to criticise in the harshest terms and is not intended to harm reputation. Whether the comment is malicious or artistic can only be determined at trial,” it said.The company further argued that as a public servant, Wankhede “must not be too thin-skinned” and should withstand fair comment and parody. His petition, it said, was an “attempt to stifle legitimate artistic expression.”The Delhi high court has listed the matter for hearing on November 10, after directing all parties to file written submissions.(With ANI inputs)","Indian Revenue Service officer Sameer Wankhede is suing Red Chillies Entertainment for defamation.

Khattar seeks details of action against builders not completing projects after 3 extensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/khattar-seeks-details-of-action-against-builders-not-completing-projects-after-3-extensions/articleshow/124962677.cms,"Housing and urban affairs minister Manohar Lal Khattar (Photo credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Housing and urban affairs minister Manohar Lal Khattar has sought details of the number of realty projects in which deadlines have been extended and the action taken against developers whose projects remain incomplete even after three extensions. The move comes amid rising concerns over builders failing to meet project completion deadlines despite committing to the same during the mandatory registration process under RERA.As per the minutes of the last meeting of Central Advisory Council (CAC) -- which was attended by representatives of state RERAs, state govts, consumer bodies and builders -- made public this week, Khattar passed the instructions in response to an observation by Haryana RERA chairperson Arun Kumar that the timeline for project completion is declared by the promoter at the time of registration. He had said, “If the promoter fails to deliver the project within this time frame, delay possession charges will be applicable. ”Khattar also said that Rules framed by states for the sector should be vetted at the Central level to ensure uniformity. He further called for action against banks in cases where cash had been withdrawn from escrow accounts without proper permission.An escrow account for a housing project is managed by a bank, which holds homebuyers’ money and releases it to the builder only after certain project-related milestones are met.This ensures use of funds exclusively for project construction and development.At the meeting, representatives of homebuyers and consumers flagged delay in completion of promised amenities and non-adherence to the approved layout plan even in projects that started after the enactment of RERA, which was brought by the Centre to streamline the sector and ensure timely project delivery. They also highlighted the lack of uniformity in Rules notified by state govts and the failure of state RERAs to enforce their orders.A representative of flat owners’ association pointed to the fact that a parent company remains legally unaffected despite its subsidiary company developing a project going insolvent. Acknowledging this, Khattar said, “there should be clarity on where responsibility should lie”.Raising the issue of project de-registration, the Haryana RERA chief noted that some developers have neither started work nor complied with audit requirements despite registration taking place long ago. He stressed that it is essential to examine how such cases should be addressed under Section 8 of RERA, which deals with de-registration.",Housing and urban affairs minister Manohar Lal Khattar has sought details of the number of realty projects in which deadlines have been extended.

PATIALA: Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday launched projects worth Rs 75 crore to give a facelift to the historic Shri Kali Mata temple here.Addressing a gathering after the launch event, Kejriwal claimed that none of the previous governments in Punjab had ever bothered to start these projects of immense public significance.The former Delhi chief minister said that fortunately the AAP government in the state has been bestowed this opportunity and the work will be completed within a year.He said that the Shri Kali Mata Mandir is one of the most revered and historic temples in northern India, stressing that the temple stands as a testimony to Punjab's rich spiritual heritage.Kejriwal said that ""the main shrine is dedicated to Goddess Kali, while the complex also includes an ancient temple of Shri Raj Rajeshwari Ji, another divine form of Shakti"".He said that the temple's importance is evident from the fact that nearly 10,000 devotees visit the shrine daily, around 40,000 every Saturday, and the number rises to nearly one lakh during the Navratri festival.The AAP chief said that the state government has started several projects to give a facelift at Shri Kali Mata temple.He said that the work is underway to ensure clean water for the temple pond from the Bhakra Canal and an amount of Rs 1.15 crore has been approved for this project.Likewise, the temple's existing sewage system and rainwater drainage network are being upgraded and replaced at a cost Rs 49.06 lakh, Kejriwal said.He also said that 'Aam Aadmi Clinic' is being set up within the temple complex at a cost of Rs 25 lakh which will provide medical assistance not only to local residents but also to visiting devotees.Chief Minister Mann said that to enhance the spiritual and aesthetic charm of the temple, a light and sound show will be organized near the pond, modelled after the arrangements at major pilgrimage sites. He said that the project will cost Rs 6.78 crore, and tenders for the work have been issued.He said that the temple's new building, corridor, boundary wall, entry gate, and pond projects collectively have been started.Mann also said that all temple entrances will be redesigned in harmony with traditional architecture.The chief minister said that in consultation with urban planning and heritage experts, a comprehensive master plan is being prepared covering future construction, heritage conservation, pilgrimage facilities, sanitation, parking, and traffic management.He said that to prevent overcrowding and ensure smooth distribution of 'prasad', a token system similar to that at Mata Vaishno Devi temple will be introduced.Mann said that a hall has been constructed within the temple premises for the accommodation of visiting pilgrims, and parking space has been created for 300 vehicles.",Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday launched projects worth Rs 75 crore to give a facelift to the historic Shri Kali Mata temple.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal (United)-led National Democratic Alliance have a 40 per cent chance of retaining power in the upcoming Bihar election, an opinion poll by C Voter predicted on Friday.According to the poll, Rashtriya Janata Dal-led Mahagathbandhan came a close second with 38.3 per cent chance of forming the government. Meanwhile, the new entrant in Bihar politics, Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj, came third in the preference list with 13.3 per cent.The scenario, however, changes when it comes to the preferred choice for chief minister. RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav emerged as the most popular face, securing 36.5% support in the opinion polls.He was followed by Prashant Kishor with 23.2%, incumbent chief minister Nitish Kumar with 15.9%, and Chirag Paswan with 8.8%.When asked who can solve Bihar’s problems, 36.5% of respondents chose the Mahagathbandhan, 12.8% opted for Jan Suraaj, 34.3% preferred the NDA, while 9.4% felt that no one could.Earlier, Tejashwi promised a government job for every household in Bihar and pledged to introduce the legislation within just 20 days of taking office.""NDA government could not provide jobs to the youth in 20 years, but we will bring the Act within 20 days of coming to power and also ensure its implementation within 20 months,"" Tejashwi told reporters at his residence.This comes as parties have geared up for what the Election Commission has called the ""mother of elections.""Seat-sharing talks are in the final stages on all sides. However, constituents of the NDA and the INDIA bloc are grappling with differences over seat-sharing, with smaller allies in both camps jostling for more seats.Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj party declared a list of 51 candidates on Thursday.Amid growing unease in the ruling NDA over the seat sharing, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan reached Patna on Friday and will hold meetings with senior party leaders.According to news agency PTI, sources in the BJP said that the seat-sharing arrangements within the NDA will be finalized in a day or two, and the party will release its first list of candidates soon after that.The JD(U), another alliance partner of the NDA, is also expected to announce its list of candidates very soon, party sources said.According to sources in the NDA, the allies — JD(U) and BJP — are likely to contest 102 and 101 seats, respectively.Union minister Chirag Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), which had earlier settled for around 20–22 seats, is now asking for 45 segments, they said.In the opposition bloc, sources said the RJD is likely to contest 135–140 seats.The party has offered the Congress 50–52 seats, lower than the party’s demand for 70 assembly segments.Sources in the RJD said a meeting of senior party leaders will take place in Patna later in the day to finalize the list of its candidates.In the 2020 assembly polls, the Congress had fought 70 seats but won only 19.The other big constituent of the INDIA bloc, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, also appeared unhappy with the reportedly 20–25 seats being offered to it.The Election Commission has announced the schedule for the Bihar Assembly elections. The 243 Assembly seats will go to the polls in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the counting of votes scheduled to take place on November 14.The total number of electors in the final list stands at 7.42 crore, while there were 7.89 crore electors as of June 24 this year. An Election Commission press release stated that 65 lakh voters were removed from the draft list, and the number of electors in the draft list as of August 1, 2025, stood at 7.24 crore.In the 2020 assembly election, BJP contested 110 seats and won 74, securing 19.8% of the vote share with a strike rate of 43.2%. The Janata Dal (United) contested 115 seats and won 43, with a 15.7% vote share and a 33.5% strike rate.

Delhi Tries to Make It Rain With Cloud Seeding: A High-Stakes Weather Experiment to Fight Toxic Air





NEW DELHI: Experts have termed Delhi govt's cloud seeding trials, held on Tuesday, a ""hugely expensive, temporary and unsustainable"" measure to deal with the capital's toxic pollution. Even if the artificial rain temporarily settles down the pollutants, the pollution will rise in one-two days, they say.According to the MoU signed between the Delhi environment department and IIT-Kanpur, the budget for cloud seeding is over Rs 3.2 crore for five trials —meaning one trial run costs Rs 64 lakh. Three trials have been done in north Delhi, and none of them led to any major rain. Delhi's air quality index (AQI) has been hovering in the ‘very poor' to ‘poor' range for the past few days.Also read: 1st ever cloud seeding: How a freezer experiment in 1946 led to mankind’s first attempt to make artificial rain; know history Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""The city has not yet recorded any substantial rainfall after cloud seeding. Even if the rains wash out the pollutants, the pollution will bounce back quickly. The impact lasts from hours to a couple of days.""Stressing that the initiative is not sustainable, she said, ""It cannot be done regularly for the entire winter season.Such investments need to target actual emission reduction from sources on the ground for sustained air quality improvement to protect public health.""Shahzad Gani, assistant professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT Delhi, said that in the winter season, the weather in Delhi is typically very dry, with very little moisture in the air. The only time it usually rains during winter is when a western disturbance influences the plains.""If it rains due to a western disturbance, there is no point in carrying out cloud seeding. And if an intense spell of rain occurs simultaneously during the cloud seeding process, causing very heavy rain and damage to life and property — even if it is actually unrelated to cloud seeding — who will take responsibility for it?"" he said, adding. ""Why do we adopt silver-bullet technologies like smog towers, smog guns and cloud seeding? There is a need to systematically reduce emissions from different sources. ""Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst of think tank EnviroCatalysts, said addressing air quality requires tackling sector-specific emissions from transport, power and construction. Without that, no real impact can be achieved, he added. ""Cosmetic measures may create short-term visibility benefits but are not sustainable solutions. The focus should instead be on coordinated action across states and agencies through an airshed-based approach that targets the actual sources of pollution,"" he said.Activist Bhavreen Kandhari said cloud seeding can only enhance rainfall when the atmosphere is moisture-deficient and conditions are marginal for precipitation. ""The skies were already rich with moisture, and a western disturbance was forecast to bring natural rain. Under such circumstances, cloud seeding adds little scientific value; it becomes a costly experiment chasing what nature is already prepared to deliver. Clean air will not come from artificial rain, but from sustained reductions in emissions, dust control, and responsible policy,"" said Kandhari.","Experts have termed Delhi govt's cloud seeding trials, held on Tuesday, a ""hugely expensive, temporary and unsustainable"" measure. Even if the artificial rain temporarily settles down the pollutants, the pollution will rise in one-two days, they say. Delhi's air quality index (AQI) has been hovering in the ‘very poor' to ‘poor' range for the past few days.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124880965,imgsize-560228,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/124880965.jpg"
Yes Bank-ADAG loan fraud case: Anil Ambani's son under CBI lens,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/yes-bank-adag-loan-fraud-case-anil-ambanis-son-under-cbi-lens/articleshow/124925266.cms,"MUMBAI: While industrialist Anil Ambani has been chargesheeted by CBI in the Yes Bank loan fraud case, his son, Jai Anmol Ambani , has come under the lens.According to the chargesheet filed recently, the CBI said that as part of its further investigations, it was probing the role of Jai, who was then executive director of Reliance Capital Ltd (RCL), when Reliance Nippon Mutual Fund, part of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani (ADA) Group, subscribed to non-convertible debentures (NCDs) worth 1,160 crore of Morgan Credits Pvt Ltd at a low interest rate and invested 2,250 crore in Yes Bank's AT-1 bonds under Anil's influence as part of a quid pro quo arrangement. Radha Kapoor and Roshini Kapoor, daughters of Yes Bank's former MD and CEO Rana Kapoor , are the promoters/directors of Morgan Credits.The CBI said Anil and Jai interfered in the decision-making process at Reliance Nippon Mutual Fund without informing its Japanese partner, prompting objections and allegations. It said Jai held monthly review meetings with the mutual fund firm's officers, expressed displeasure over their performance, and directed that he be informed of any mutual fund investment of 50 crore or more before execution. This interference led to internal objections, but the directives were eventually withdrawn, the chargesheet stated.It alleged that Anil entered into a criminal conspiracy with Kapoor to get the bank to subscribe to his group companies' NCDs and commercial papers (CPs) worth 3,400 crore ""when there was no demand for them in the secondary market."" It further alleged that Kapoor pushed for the NCDs' acquisition despite knowing that holding them for an extended period would harm the bank.The chargesheet said that in return, Kapoor's wife, Bindu, received credit facilities of 570 crore from Anil's companies at a lower interest rate. ""...Yes Bank Limited suffered a total loss of 2,796.77 crore due to subscribing to NCDs and CPs of RHFL (Reliance Home Finance Ltd) and RCFL (Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd),"" the chargesheet stated.The CBI has named 13 accused in the chargesheet, including Bindu, Kapoor, Radha, and Roshini. None of them has been arrested. The agency also said it is probing the role of another daughter of the Kapoors, Rakhee.The chargesheet said Kapoor and Anil held frequent meetings, but no bank officer attended these. Following these discussions, Kapoor instructed his bank officers to process proposals for Anil's companies, it said.","Jai Anmol Ambani was executive director of Reliance Capital Ltd.

The Asian Arowana: Ancient fish that rules the modern aquarium



The Asian Arowana: From banned species to billion-dollar status symbol



The super red Arowana : The fiery dragon fish worth more than gold

For centuries, dragons have embodied prosperity, power, and mystery in Asian culture. Today, that legend lives on in the Asian arowana, famously known as the dragon fish and hailed as the world’s most expensive aquarium fish. Native to the rivers and swamps of Southeast Asia, this ancient predator moves with elegant precision, its metallic scales shimmering like coins of gold under filtered light. As highlighted by National Geographic, the arowana’s mythical resemblance to dragons has made it a potent symbol of luck and wealth across generations. Coveted by collectors, enthusiasts, and investors alike, it now commands staggering prices, often exceeding the value of gold, transforming a once humble river dweller into a living emblem of prosperity, success, and timeless prestige.The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish. Growing up to three feet in length, it glides through the dark waters of Southeast Asia with hypnotic grace, its large, shimmering scales catching light like polished coins. Two slender barbels extend from its chin, evoking the whiskers of a dragon, a resemblance that fuels its legendary reputation as a bearer of fortune, power, and eternal protection across Asian cultures.This prehistoric species, believed to have existed since the age of dinosaurs, thrives in slow-moving rivers and peat swamps in Borneo, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Yet, it is far from a humble creature. In the modern world, an arowana can command prices as high as £250,000 per fish, a valuation that has elevated it from swamp inhabitant to luxury treasure.In the 1970s, the Asian arowana was added to the list of endangered species under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). The trade ban was meant to protect its dwindling numbers in the wild. Instead, it ignited a new kind of frenzy.The ban transformed the arowana from a simple food fish into an elite, forbidden object of desire. Collectors across Asia began competing for the rare, mystical “dragon fish.” Suddenly, what once sold for a few dollars in a local market became a high-stakes commodity worth tens of thousands.By the late 20th century, farms in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia began breeding the fish legally under government licence. These operations were run like fortresses with guards, surveillance systems, and barbed wire to protect their valuable stock. Each fish was microchipped and issued an identification certificate to prove its legal, captive-bred origin. Despite such measures, black market smuggling and theft became part of the trade’s darker undercurrent.Among the many colour varieties, green, gold, and silver, the Super Red arowana reigns supreme. Found in the remote Kapuas River basin and the Lake Sentarum wetlands of Borneo, its scales shimmer in rich shades of ruby and crimson. In the right light, it appears almost aflame, like a dragon rising from the depths.This rare beauty can sell for astronomical prices. Reports claim that elite collectors, including high-ranking officials and business magnates, have spent more than £200,000 for a single fish. During international fish exhibitions, these rare specimens are transported in tanks escorted by security guards proof that even a creature of water can inspire terrestrial greed and glamour.Former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was said to have owned one himself, paying around £10,000 for his prized arowana. For many, ownership signifies not just wealth, but alignment with luck, prosperity, and spiritual balance.","The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) is no ordinary tropical fish.

CEO’s AI investment drives workforce reduction strategy

Severance package and support for affected employees





Amazon is preparing to eliminate 800 to 1,000 positions in India as part of a sweeping global restructuring driven by artificial intelligence adoption, The Economic Times reported on Wednesday, marking one of the largest workforce reductions at the e-commerce giant’s Indian operations.The layoffs will span critical functions including finance, human resources, and technology, with employees reporting to Amazon’s global teams facing the steepest cuts, ET reported citing sources. The India job cuts are part of a broader plan to reduce approximately 14,000 corporate roles worldwide, announced by Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and TechnologyWhen contacted about the India-specific layoffs by ET, an Amazon India spokesperson referred to Galetti’s global announcement. In a blog post to employees, Galetti said the cuts aim to reduce bureaucracy, remove organizational layers, and redirect resources toward the company’s “biggest bets.”The restructuring follows CEO Andy Jassy’s June 2025 warning that AI would shrink Amazon’s workforce in coming years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote to employees, describing agentic AI as transformative technology that “should change the way our work is done.”Amazon has ramped up AI investments significantly, pouring more than $100 billion into the technology this year compared to $83 billion in 2024. While the company plans continued hiring in AI-related functions, it expects overall workforce reductions as automation handles more tasks previously done by humans.The company employs approximately 1.55 million people globally as of June 30, including roughly 350,000 in corporate roles. This marks Amazon’s second major round of layoffs in recent years, following the elimination of 27,000 positions between late 2022 and early 2023.Most affected employees will receive 90 days to seek internal positions, with recruiting teams prioritizing internal candidates. Those unable to secure new roles within Amazon will receive severance packages, outplacement services, and continued health insurance benefits.Despite strong business performance, Galetti emphasized that rapid technological change necessitates leaner organizational structures to maintain competitive speed and innovation in an AI-transformed landscape.","Amazon is preparing to eliminate 800 to 1,000 positions in India as part of a sweeping global restructuring driven by artificial intelligence adoption.

Azure services back after outage: What 'went wrong and why' hours before Microsoft's Q3 results announcement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/azure-services-back-after-outage-what-went-wrong-and-why-hours-before-microsofts-q3-results-announcement/articleshow/124929960.cms,"Microsoft Azure services restored.

Azure service outage: What happened

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

What went wrong and why





Microsoft Q3 results: Strong growth despite disruption





Microsoft has confirmed that it has fully restored its Azure cloud services after the widespread outage that struck for hours before the company’s scheduled Q3 earnings announcement. The disruption affected critical platforms including Microsoft 365, Outlook, Xbox Live, and Copilot, leaving millions of users across industries temporarily disconnected. As per Microsoft’s Azure Status History, the service outage was caused by a configraution error which triggered cascading failures across multiple regions. The company revealed that it deployed a rollback to a stable configuration which gradually led to service restoration after several hours.As per Microsoft’s Azure Status history, the outage was triggered by a DNS failure in Azure Front Door, a key content delivery and routing service. Between 15:45 UTC on 29 October and 00:05 UTC on 30 October 2025, customers and Microsoft services leveraging Azure Front Door (AFD) may have experienced latencies, timeouts, and errors.Affected Azure services include, but are not limited to: App Service, Azure Active Directory B2C, Azure Communication Services, Azure Databricks, Azure Healthcare APIs, Azure Maps, Azure Portal, Azure SQL Database, Azure Virtual Desktop, Container Registry, Media Services, Microsoft Copilot for Security, Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management, Microsoft Entra ID (Mobility Management Policy Service, Identity & Access Management, and User Management UX), Microsoft Purview, Microsoft Sentinel (Threat Intelligence), and Video Indexer.Customer configuration changes to AFD remain temporarily blocked. We will notify customers once this block has been lifted. While error rates and latency are back to pre-incident levels, a small number of customers may still be seeing issues and we are still working to mitigate this long tail. Updates will be provided directly via Azure Service Health.An inadvertent tenant configuration change within Azure Front Door (AFD) triggered a widespread service disruption affecting both Microsoft services and customer applications dependent on AFD for global content delivery. The change introduced an invalid or inconsistent configuration state that caused a significant number of AFD nodes to fail to load properly, leading to increased latencies, timeouts, and connection errors for downstream services.As unhealthy nodes dropped out of the global pool, traffic distribution across healthy nodes became imbalanced, amplifying the impact and causing intermittent availability even for regions that were partially healthy. We immediately blocked all further configuration changes to prevent additional propagation of the faulty state and began deploying a ‘last known good’ configuration across the global fleet. Recovery required reloading configurations across a large number of nodes and rebalancing traffic gradually to avoid overload conditions as nodes returned to service. This deliberate, phased recovery was necessary to stabilize the system while restoring scale and ensuring no recurrence of the issue.The trigger was traced to a faulty tenant configuration deployment process. Our protection mechanisms, to validate and block any erroneous deployments, failed due to a software defect which allowed the deployment to bypass safety validations. Safeguards have since been reviewed and additional validation and rollback controls have been immediately implemented to prevent similar issues in the future.Microsoft reported strong Q3 earnings despite the massive Azure service outage. The company announced that it witnessed significant growth from its Intelligent Cloud segment with Azure maintaining double-digit growth. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, also stressed on the fact that the company’s commitment to resilience and innovation, noting that Copilot adoption across Microsoft 365 and Bing continues to accelerate.","Microsoft has confirmed that it has fully restored its Azure cloud services.

Bill Gates calls for shift in climate aid





Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates recently said that if given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, he will choose the latter option. In a memo released today, October 28, Gates said that the world’s primary goal should instead be to prevent suffering, specifically in the world’s poorest countries. “I’ll let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria. People don’t understand the suffering that exists today,” he told reporters.Gates emphasized that climate change is a serious problem. However, it alone won’t be the end of civilization adding that scientific innovation may likely curb it. Gates stated that it’s instead time for a “strategic pivot” in the global climate fight: from focusing on limiting rising temperatures to fighting poverty and preventing disease.The memo comes a month before the United Nations climate change conference in Brazil. During a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release of the 17-page memo, Gates said “If you think climate is not important, you won’t agree with the memo.If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo. It’s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who’s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries. ”Bill Gates believes the world’s progress in clean energy has outpaced expectations, thanks to faster innovation and the rise of artificial intelligence. He said affordable solar and wind energy are now replacing coal, oil, and gas plants, helping prevent worst-case climate scenarios.However, Gates warned that funding to help poorer nations cope with climate change is shrinking, as wealthy countries — led by the United States — reduce their foreign aid budgets. “Gavi, a public-private partnership started by my foundation that buys vaccines, will have 25% less money for the next five years compared to the past five years,” Gates said. “Gavi can save a life for a little more than $1,000.”He stressed that vaccines are even more vital in a warming world because “children who aren’t dying of measles or whooping cough will be more likely to survive when a heat wave hits or a drought threatens the local food supply.”Gates pointed to research by the University of Chicago Climate Impact Lab showing that projected deaths from climate change fall by more than 50% when accounting for future economic growth. “Health and prosperity are the best defense against climate change,” he said.Under these conditions, Gates argued that development aid should be spent where it can have the biggest impact. “If you have something that gets rid of 10,000 tons of emissions, that you’re spending several million dollars on,” he said, “that just doesn’t make the cut.”","Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates recently said that if given a choice between eradicating malaria and a tenth of a degree increase in warming, he will choose the latter option.

Read Tesla Board chairman's 'SOS letter' to shareholders on Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-tesla-board-chairmans-sos-letter-to-shareholders-on-elon-musk/articleshow/124895403.cms,"Dear Fellow Shareholders,

As you know, Tesla is at a critical inflection point, and we need your vote to help determine the future direction of our evolving company. Your vote matters, and the deadline for voting is 11:59pm ET on November 5th. The fundamental question for shareholders at this year's Annual Meeting is simple:

Do you want to retain Elon as Tesla's CEO and motivate him to drive Tesla to become the leading provider of autonomous solutions and the most valuable company in the world?

Kathleen and I engaged in a rigorous, seven-month Special Committee process resulting in a highly customized performance plan that aligns shareholder value and measurable business outcomes with the interests of our CEO.

Our goal was two-fold: (1) retain and incentivize Elon to capitalize on the unique opportunities that lie ahead for Tesla and (2) do so in a manner that promotes the development of products and services that will propel our world toward a cleaner, safer, and more prosperous future while creating unparalleled value for our shareholders.

We've done this by challenging Elon with the potential to secure what he values most—meaningful voting influence—conditioned on his commitment to continue leading Tesla for at least another 7.5 years while successfully driving our company to ambitious new heights.

The bottom line is simple: Elon is rewarded only if and when he delivers extraordinary performance that benefits all Tesla shareholders.

When negotiating this performance award, we necessarily considered what Tesla's future without Elon would look like, and we did not believe it was the future that our shareholders deserve. At a time when companies—both big and small—are competing to be the first to bring groundbreaking AI technologies to market, we could not risk losing the best leader in the industry to put Tesla on top.

Now is a pivotal moment for our company to emerge as a leader in AI, and with our exceptional CEO at the helm, we are perfectly positioned to seize it.

Though it's no question that Elon has other pursuits, he has proven that one of the many things that make him unique is his ability to stretch his capacity beyond normal limits and remain successful at Tesla. However, if we fail to foster an environment that motivates Elon to achieve great things through an equitable pay-for-performance plan, we run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision, which have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns.

Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor, with products such as FSD and Optimus, and working to better humanity in the process. While there may be nothing wrong with being just another car company, our Board believes that Tesla can be more, that our shareholders deserve more, and that Elon is the right leader to help us achieve our full potential.

Elon's leadership is also built upon the critical support of our ""tailor made"" governance structure, including our carefully constructed Board. Good governance should be customized to the company, not applied with a ""cookie cutter"" approach, and it is exemplified by the results that Tesla has delivered, and this Board has overseen. We therefore ask you to vote ""for"" the three members of the Board—Ira, Kathleen and Joe—who are up for re-election to ensure that the Board, which has worked alongside Elon for years, complementing and enhancing his efforts to deliver extraordinary shareholder returns, remains in place.

That is why your vote is so consequential to the future of our company. A vote here is both an endorsement of Elon's vision and a vote for Tesla's carefully tailored strategy and governance. I urge you to support Proposal One, which ensures the continued leadership and support of our outstanding and experienced directors, as well as Proposals Three and Four, which aim to keep Elon focused on our mission here at Tesla.

I feel strongly—as do the rest of my colleagues on our Board—that Elon singularly possesses the leadership characteristics and technical manufacturing know-how to keep us on the path towards maximizing long-term shareholder value as well as social good.

We at Tesla are laser focused on exceptional performance—not promises—and we structure our awards in line with this principle.

If you care about building a better world for humanity and supporting our vision for Sustainable Abundance—then you should vote ""FOR"" Proposals One, Three and Four.

If you want Tesla to have a shot at becoming the world's most valuable company—then you should vote ""FOR"" Proposals One, Three and Four.

Please read the Special Committee Report, which is attached to this year's proxy statement, for a more detailed explanation of Kathleen's and my work in coming to the essential conclusions embodied in the proxy statement and how we structured this performance plan to align Elon's incentives with delivering extraordinary performance for all of you.

Thank you for your continued support of Tesla.

Very truly yours,

Robyn Denholm Chairperson of the Board





Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm has issued an urgent appeal to shareholders ahead of the November 6 annual meeting, warning the company could lose significant value if they reject CEO Elon Musk 's proposed $1 trillion compensation package. In a letter sent earlier this week, Denholm cautioned that without the pay plan, Tesla risks losing Musk's ""time, talent and vision"" as he could step down from his executive position or become less engaged with the company. Denholm confirmed she's had direct conversations with Musk about his potential departure, stating there's a ""high probability"" he would back away if the package isn't approved.The unprecedented compensation package includes 12 tranches of stock options tied to ambitious milestones, culminating in Tesla achieving an $8.5 trillion market capitalization—more than quadruple its current $1.44 trillion valuation. Other targets include delivering 20 million vehicles, deploying 10 million FSD subscriptions, delivering one million robots, and operating one million robotaxis.Major proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended shareholders vote against the package, citing concerns about its excessive size and board independence. Musk dismissed the advisors as ""corporate terrorists"" during Tesla's recent earnings call.Shareholders must cast their votes by 11:59 p.m. ET on November 5, with the meeting scheduled for the following day.Read Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm’s letter to shareholders","Tesla CEO Elon Musk is up for re-election at the company's Annual Meeting on November 5th.

China has shut Nvidia out

Nvidia CEO praises Donald Trump

Trump, Xi Defuse Tariff Time Bomb? U.S. & China Edge Towards Ending Trade War | Global Pulse





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came to Washington with a message for the Donald Trump administration. Speaking at he first Nvidia developers' conference, Nvidia CEO cautioned the US government that America cannot win the AI battle if the world, if China fully excludes Nvidia from its vast developer ecosystem. Highlighting Beijing's effective shutdown of Nvidia's operations in the world's second-largest economy, Huang urged US policymakers to reconsider restrictions that could result in Nvidia cede half the planet's AI talent to domestic rivals.""They've made it very clear that they don't want Nvidia to be there right now,"" Huang said at a news conference during the GTC event, revealing that Nvidia has not even applied for U.S. export licenses for its latest chips to China due to the hostile stance from Beijing. ""I hope that will change in the future because I think China is a very important market."" He argued that a policy isolating America from China's developers ""hurts us more"" in the long term, potentially squandering Nvidia's role in powering global AI infrastructure.This is not the first time that Jensen Huang has spoken about the company's falling market share in China.Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022. He said that he has seen Nvidia's dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.Despite the Chinese blockade -- exacerbated by the US export controls that have changed under successive US administrations -- Nvidia reported $500 billion in bookings for advanced chips and announced seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The largest, built with Oracle and featuring 100,000 Blackwell chips, will support nuclear weapons maintenance, fusion energy research, and other national priorities.Jensen Huang credited Trump's ""America First"" policies with revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, noting Nvidia's chip production in Arizona via TSMC, server assembly in Texas, and networking gear in California. ""Putting the weight of the nation behind pro-energy growth completely changed the game,"" he said, thanking Trump directly.The DOE deals underscore Nvidia's pivot to fortified US ties amid China's rejection. Analyst Blake Anderson of Carson Group estimated one supercomputer, ""Solstice,"" could involve $3–4 billion in Nvidia chips alone, though federal discounts may apply from the standard $30,000–$40,000 per Blackwell unit. Huang balanced praise for President Trump who is touring Asia ahead of a Thursday meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Nvidia's chips may feature prominently -- with pleas for market access.Trump initially tightened export bans on China-specific AI chips in his second term but reversed in July. Huang has long contended that barring Nvidia from ~$50 billion in annual Chinese sales hampers U.S. R&D funding, even as Chinese developers reportedly still prefer Nvidia over mandated Huawei alternatives.Beyond government wins, Huang unveiled expansions to offset China losses: A $1 billion investment for 2.9% stake in Nokia, plus the ""Arc"" product line to boost 6G base station efficiency for millions of global sites.","China has shut Nvidia out of its vast developer ecosystem, CEO Jensen Huang said.

President Donald Trump's Big Beautiful Bill has resulted in a $16 billion hit for Mark Zuckerberg 's Meta. Meta Platforms has taken a near $16 billion one-off charge in the third quarter (Q3) related to President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. The company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said that the bill had led the business to take a non-cash income tax charge of $15.93 billion. Meta said that excluding this, its third-quarter net income would have increased by $15.93 billion to $18.64 billion, compared with the reported net income of $2.71 billion. The expense crashed Meta's third-quarter profit.Incidentally, this is the same bill that Elon Musk and President TrumpThe implementation of Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act led to “the recognition of a valuation allowance against our U.S. federal deferred tax assets, reflecting the impact of the U.S. Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax,” Meta said. Meta also said, “We expect a significant reduction in our U.S. federal cash tax payments for the remainder of 2025 and future years due to the implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. ”The markets didn't seem pleased with $16 billion charge taken by Meta, as the company's stock fell sharply lower on Wall Street, though briefly.The shares fell $53.60, or 7 per cent, to $698.99 in after-hours trading on Wall Street but recovered to close at $751.67, up less than 1 per cent.“We had a strong quarter for our business and our community,” Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO, said in announcing the results. “Meta Superintelligence Labs is off to a great start and we continue to lead the industry in AI glasses. If we deliver even a fraction of the opportunity ahead, then the next few years will be the most exciting period in our history.”The company ended the quarter with $44.45 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Meta’s headcount was 78,450 employees as of September 30, up 8% year-over-year.As for quarterly guidance, Meta said that it anticipates fourth quarter total revenue to be $56 billion-$59 billion and full-year 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be $70 billion-$72 billion.","Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms has taken a near $16 billion one-off charge in the third quarter (Q3) related to President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.

Shares will be alloted to investors on November 6.Lenskart plans to utilise proceeds from the fresh issue towards setting up new company-operated, company-owned (CoCo) stores, expenditure on lease and rental agreements for these outlets, and investments in technology, cloud infrastructure, and brand marketing. The company has also earmarked funds for potential inorganic acquisitions and general corporate purposes.It has a price band of Rs 382–Rs 402 per share, and is seeking a valuation of over Rs 69,700 crore on the upper end.The entity’s grey market premium stood at Rs 70 per share, according to ET. This indicates that the company’s shares might list around Rs 472, a premium of 17.41%.SBI Securities has advised investors to “Subscribe for long term”, pointing to Lenskart’s strong business model and its leadership in a market that has major space to grow.The brokerage said listing gains may be limited, but the company’s integrated supply chain, better profitability metrics, and strong brand strength support its long-term growth.Ventura Securities has also given a “Subscribe” recommendation, describing Lenskart as a growth-led business. It cited the company’s technology-focused strategy, AI-driven customer engagement, and a store payback period of under one year, adding that profitability is expected to strengthen as the business expands into additional regions.Nirmal Bang, according to ET, acknowledged that the IPO appears expensive at first, but the valuation holds up when compared with modern retail peers such as Trent and Metro. The brokerage maintained a Subscribe (long-term) stance, referring to Lenskart’s brand strength, premium product mix, and international expansion plans.The company’s market debut follows a strong response in the anchor book. On Thursday, Lenskart garnered bids worth around Rs 68,000 crore from anchor investors, people familiar with the matter told PTI. The bid amount was nearly 10 times the total issue size of Rs 7,278 crore and close to 20 times the Rs 3,268-crore anchor allocation.

It now operates an omni-channel model, offering prescription eyewear, sunglasses, and contact lenses across metro, tier-1, and tier-2 cities, and has expanded internationally to Southeast Asia and the Middle East.The company designs, manufactures, brands, and retails eyewear through facilities in Bhiwadi and Gurugram, supported by regional hubs in Singapore and the UAE.

Lenskart posted a net profit of Rs 297.3 crore in FY25, compared to a net loss of Rs 63.8 crore in FY23, though the profit was aided by one-off gains.Lenskart holds an estimated 4–6% market share in India’s eyewear market, but faces competition in a sector that remains 77% unorganised, according to Redseer, placing the company at a combination of a large opportunity and a highly fragmented market. According to Redseer, Lenskart was the largest seller of prescription eyeglasses in India by volume in FY25.","Lenskart Solutions has opened its initial public offering (IPO) on Friday.

Not extending the caste survey: Tangadagi





BENGALURU: With just a day left for the door-to-door phase of Karnataka's caste-based socio-educational survey to conclude, the backward classes commission Thursday said the exercise has achieved full coverage across all districts except Bengaluru city, where progress stands at 42.3%.Backward classes minister Shivaraj Tangadagi ruled out extending the Oct 31 deadline for field enumeration, but announced an extension of the online self-declaration deadline till Nov 10 to allow more people to participate through the official portal: https://kscbcselfdeclaration.karnataka.gov.inThere are several factors for Bengaluru city to achieve less progress, including several residents participating in the survey at their native places outside the city. And the Unique Household IDs (UHIDs) have been generated based on the number of electricity meters. Some have multiple meters for their houses in the city. If we consider all these factors, the survey in Bengaluru city is also successful,” claimed Tangadagi.He cited his own case as an example to defend why it is lagging in Bengaluru. “I own a house at Dollars Colony in the city and also reside at the govt-allotted house.However, I did not participate in the survey in the city as I had already participated at my native Karatagi in Koppal district,” he said.Tangadagi said enumerators have covered over 1.4 crore households and reached more than 5.5 crore peopleacross the state, excluding Bengaluru city.“We will not extend the deadline for the door-to-door survey. We have time till Friday evening to complete the survey and complete details about it will be shared later,” he added.The ongoing survey covers all backward classes, other castes, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in Karnataka. It is considered one of the most comprehensive data exercises on caste and socio-economic status undertaken by the state.","Karnataka's caste-based socio-educational survey has achieved full coverage across all districts except Bengaluru city, where progress stands at 42.3%.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened flat in trade on Friday on mixed global cues. While Nifty50 was near 25,850, BSE Sensex was below 84,400. At 9:20 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,856.90, down 21 points or 0.81%. BSE Sensex was at 84,379.84, down 25 points or 0.029%.According to market experts, the key support levels are at 25,800 and 25,700, with potential for further decline if these levels are breached.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “The Trump-Xi summit delivered only a one-year truce in the US-China trade war, not a breakthrough trade deal. To that extent market participants were disappointed at the outcome even though there is relief in the declining trade tensions and possible movement towards further progress.”“The rally in the Indian market has been running out of steam when it approaches the record high of 26277 set in September 2024. Renewed selling by FIIs is likely to be a drag on the market in the near-term. The increasing short positions being created by FIIs indicate that they view Indian valuations as relatively higher particularly seen in the light of earnings growth. This view will change only when leading indicators suggest a sustained recovery in earnings.“Meanwhile long-term investors can slowly accumulate fairly-valued growth stocks. India’s recently announced grand maritime strategy entails massive expenditure on shipping. Ship building stocks have great potential for long-term growth.”US stocks dropped on Thursday, with significant losses in the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500. The decline was primarily driven by Meta and Microsoft share price drops due to concerns about increased AI expenditure, alongside investors processing the Federal Reserve's more stringent stance.Asian shares and US equity-index futures advanced following robust earnings reports from Apple Inc. and Microsoft Inc., which triggered a post-market technology sector rally.Oil prices dipped on Friday, moving towards a third consecutive monthly reduction, as strengthening dollar restricted commodity gains, while increased production from major global suppliers counterbalanced the effects of Western restrictions on Russian exports.Foreign portfolio investors sold shares worth Rs 3,077 crore net on Thursday.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Pilgrim travel alert: Saudi Arabia cuts Umrah visa entry validity to one month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/pilgrim-travel-alert-saudi-arabia-cuts-umrah-visa-entry-validity-to-one-month/articleshow/124982621.cms,"Saudi Arabia cuts Umrah visa pre-entry validity to one month, effective next week, for pilgrims/Representative Image

New visa rules and automatic cancellation





Al Arabiya

Aim: Efficient crowd management and improved pilgrim experience





Al Arabiya

Record numbers in the current Umrah season









Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has announced key amendments to the Umrah visa system, reducing the pre-entry validity period from three months to one month. The new rule, which takes effect next week, aims to improve crowd management as the Kingdom anticipates a significant rise in pilgrim arrivals following the end of summer.According to, the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has implemented changes to the Umrah visa regulations to streamline the arrival process. Under the new policy, Umrah visas will now be automatically canceled 30 days after issuance if the pilgrim has not entered Saudi Arabia within that timeframe.Previously, pilgrims had up to three months from the date of visa issuance to travel to the Kingdom. The revised policy now limits that pre-entry window to one month, tightening the timeframe for pilgrims to schedule their visits. However, once pilgrims enter Saudi Arabia, the duration of stay remains unchanged at three months, ensuring visitors still have ample time to complete their pilgrimage and other religious activities.The ministry confirmed that these updated rules will come into effect next week.Explaining the reasoning behind the changes, Ahmed Bajaeifer, adviser to the National Committee for Umrah and Visit, toldthat the adjustment aligns with the ministry’s broader preparations for an expected surge in Umrah pilgrims.The increase is anticipated as temperatures drop in Mecca and Medina, marking the end of the summer season, a period traditionally followed by a sharp rise in pilgrimage activity.Bajaeifer emphasized that the goal is to enable authorities to better organize and manage the growing number of visitors, prevent overcrowding in the two holy cities, and maintain a smooth and safe experience for all pilgrims.Since the start of the new Umrah season in early June, Saudi Arabia has already issued more than four million Umrah visas to international pilgrims. This marks a record-breaking turnout compared to previous seasons, with this year’s figures surpassing expectations within just five months of the season’s launch.Officials say the new measures are part of ongoing efforts to ensure that the expanding number of pilgrims can be accommodated safely and efficiently, while also maintaining the high quality of services provided in Mecca and Medina.","Saudi Arabia cuts Umrah visa pre-entry validity to one month, effective next week, for pilgrims.

Case overview

How the espionage unfolded

John Taylor,

“was supposed to be sold exclusively to the US government and select allies,”

had affected intelligence communities in Australia and the United States.”





Court proceedings and prosecution’s argument

“it’s very important no-one has promised you anything about what I’m going to do [in sentencing],”

Government reaction and statements

“America's national security is NOT FOR SALE, especially in an evolving threat landscape where cybercrime poses a serious danger to our citizens.

Thank you to all the attorneys who worked so hard to secure this guilty plea.”

“Williams betrayed the United States and his employer by first stealing and then selling intelligence-related software to a foreign broker that touted its ties to Russia and other foreign governments. His conduct was deliberate and deceitful, imperilling our national security for the sake of personal gain. Today’s guilty plea reflects our commitment to ensuring that insiders who abuse their positions of trust face serious consequences.”

“We continue to vigorously investigate those who betray our national security by selling valuable US trade secrets to international cyber brokers who support foreign cyber actors. These international cyber brokers are the next wave of international arms dealers and we continue to be vigilant about their activities. The conduct here caused over $35 million of loss to a company in the District of Columbia and allowed non-allied foreign cyber actors to obtain sophisticated cyber exploits that were likely used against numerous unsuspecting victims.”

“Williams placed greed over freedom and democracy by stealing and reselling $35 million of cyber trade secrets from a US cleared defence contractor to a Russian Government supplier. By doing so, he gave Russian cyber actors an advantage in their massive campaign to victimise US citizens and businesses. This plea sends a clear message that the FBI and our partners will defend the homeland and bring to justice anyone who helps our adversaries jeopardise US national security.""

“Peter Williams betrayed the United States and our allies by selling trade secrets. The harm caused by his crimes cannot be undone. The FBI and our partners will aggressively investigate and hold accountable anyone who threatens US national security.”





Who is Peter Williams

Next steps and sentencing





An Australian cybersecurity executive has pleaded guilty in a US court to stealing and selling highly sensitive defence software to a Russian cyber-broker. The case, described by US authorities as a “betrayal of national security”, involves stolen cyber tools worth tens of millions of dollars and marks one of the most serious insider breaches in recent years.Peter Joseph Williams, 39, an Australian national and former executive at defense contractor L3Harris, pleaded guilty before the US District Court in Washington, D.C., to two counts of theft of trade secrets.According to the US Department of Justice (DOJ), Williams “stole and resold” software components designed for national security purposes, including at least eight sensitive and protected cyber-exploit tools. These were meant to be sold “exclusively to the US government and select allies,” prosecutors said.The material, stolen over a three-year period between 2022 and 2025, was sold to a Russian cyber-tools broker that publicly advertises itself as a reseller of exploits to various customers, including the Russian government.Each charge carries a statutory maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the pecuniary gain or loss resulting from the offence.According to court documents and Williams’s signed plea, he exploited his security clearance and access to his employer’s restricted digital infrastructure to copy classified material. He then sold the stolen components to a Russian broker in exchange for cryptocurrency, receiving around $ US 1.3 million (A$2 million) for his role in the scheme.Prosecutors said Williams used an alias,to conceal his identity and maintain encrypted communication channels with the Russian buyer. The contracts he signed involved both upfront and periodic payments for continued technical support.Assistant US Attorney Tejpal Chawla, one of the lead federal prosecutors handling the case in the District of Columbia, told the court that the stolen softwareadding that Williams’s actions “Court documents estimate the losses to the Washington D.C.–based defence company at $US35 million, with the stolen tools believed to have been resold to non-allied cyber actors “likely used against numerous unsuspecting victims.”During the plea hearing, Williams appeared subdued, bowing his head as prosecutors detailed his actions. He admitted to stealing the data, transferring it via encrypted means, and using the proceeds to purchase high-value luxury items, including jewellery, watches, and designer accessories.Authorities have since seized his Washington D.C. residence, funds from multiple accounts, and a collection of 22 watches — five of which were counterfeit Rolexes.Judge Loren AliKhan, who presided over the hearing, warned Williams thatnoting that deportation would follow any custodial sentence.Williams remains under home detention in Washington D.C. until sentencing on 27 January, where he faces over a decade in prison. His lawyer, John Rowley, told ABC outside court: “Oh, he’s going to get a custodial sentence.”US government officials issued a series of forceful statements following Williams’s guilty plea, condemning his actions as a grave betrayal of national security.US Attorney-General Pamela Bondi said:Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg added:US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Ferris Pirro, in an official statement from the Justice Department, described the incident as part of a broader threat landscape.FBI Counterintelligence Division Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky said:Separately, FBI agent Alexander Arnott added in a statement:Williams has a long background in cybersecurity and intelligence, having previously worked for both public and private sector organisations in Australia and the United States. Multiple sources confirmed to ABC that he had worked for the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) during the 2010s.The ASD is responsible for foreign signals intelligence, cybersecurity, and offensive cyber operations under government direction.Before his arrest, Williams served as general manager of Trenchant, a defence subcontractor that develops hacking tools and software for the Five Eyes intelligence network, comprising Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada.His crimes, prosecutors argued, represented a profound breach of trust, not only against his employer but also against the security partnership linking those allied nations.Williams is scheduled for sentencing on 27 January 2026, with prosecutors recommending a sentence exceeding 10 years under US federal guidelines. The presiding judge has discretion to impose a longer term.Authorities emphasised that the plea agreement ensures accountability for “insiders who compromise national security for profit,” with all proceeds of the crimes subject to seizure.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant US Attorneys Tejpal Chawla and Jason McCullough for the District of Columbia, Trial Attorney Prava Palacharla for the National Security Division’s (NSD) National Security Cyber Section, and Trial Attorney Nicholas Hunter for NSD’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.","Peter Joseph Williams, 39, an Australian national and former executive at defense contractor L3Harris, pleaded guilty before the US District Court in Washington, D.C., to two counts of theft of trade secrets.

UAE Emiratisation deadline 2025

Companies with 50 or more employees must ensure that 8% of their skilled workforce are Emirati nationals by the end of 2025.

This requirement is part of a national strategy aiming to reach a 10% Emiratisation rate by the end of 2026.

What is Emiratisation?

Emiratisation fines and MoHRE monitoring

Companies with 50+ staff: Will be required to pay a monthly financial contribution of AED 9,000 for every Emirati not hired to meet the 8% target. This accumulates to AED 108,000 annually per missing employee.

9,000 for every Emirati not hired to meet the 8% target. This accumulates to AED 108,000 annually per missing employee. Companies with 20–49 staff: Those failing to hire the required two Emiratis by the end of 2025 will face a fine of AED 108,000. (This follows a fine of AED 96,000 for missing the 2024 target of hiring one Emirati).

How does Nafis give companies huge financial perks?

Bottom line





With the clock ticking toward December 31, private companies across the UAE are reevaluating recruitment plans, training pipelines, and job structures to align with Emiratisation requirements designed to increase the participation of UAE nationals in the private economy. The Ministry of Human Resources & Emiratisation (MoHRE) has set December 31, 2025 as the firm deadline for private-sector companies to meet their Emiratisation targets. Companies with 50 or more employees are required to increase the number of Emirati nationals in skilled roles by at least 2 percent before the deadline.The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has issued a strict reminder to private sector companies across the UAE: the deadline to comply with the latest Emiratisation targets is December 31, 2025. This initiative is a core component of the UAE's Vision 2030, aimed at boosting the employment of citizens in skilled private sector roles. The requirement involves a 2% annual growth in Emirati staff for skilled positions, broken down into a 1% increase every six months.The primary target structure for large companies is:The mandate has also been expanded to include smaller businesses. Companies employing 20 to 49 workers, particularly those in 14 key economic sectors like Finance, Real Estate, and IT, must hire at least two Emirati citizens by the end of 2025.Emiratisation is a national policy in the UAE aimed at increasing meaningful employment of Emirati citizens across public and private sectors. Its key objectives include boosting the number of UAE nationals in private-sector jobs, reducing reliance on expatriate labour while enhancing workforce diversity, and raising Emiratis’ skills, competitiveness and participation through training, incentives and workplace programmes. The policy is enforced through quotas, monitoring mechanisms and sanctions for non-compliance by employers.Companies that fail to meet these specific quotas by the December 31 deadline will face severe financial penalties starting January 1, 2026.Key Penalties for Non-Compliance:MoHRE has stated its commitment to deal ""firmly with any company proven to have committed fraud."" The ministry has enhanced its surveillance mechanisms, including the use of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, to detect avoidance strategies such as ""Fake Emiratisation."" This fraudulent practice, where companies hire Emiratis in non-existent or misleading roles solely to hit quotas, can result in fines ranging from AED 20,000 to AED 100,000 per case, as well as legal action and a downgrade of the company's classification within the ministry's system.The Emiratisation initiative is driven by more than just penalties; it is strongly supported by the Nafis program, which provides crucial financial and logistical incentives. For Emirati citizens, Nafis offers direct support, including salary top-ups of up to AED 7,000 monthly and various training programs designed to encourage their entry into the private sector.The program also rewards compliant companies that exceed the mandated targets, allowing them to join schemes like the Emiratisation Partners Club. These incentives offer significant advantages, such as up to an 80% reduction on ministry service fees and priority in securing government procurement contracts.This dual approach has fueled compliance, resulting in a remarkable milestone: as of mid-2025, the number of Emiratis working in the private sector has surpassed 152,000 across 29,000 companies, showcasing unprecedented national engagement. The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation urges all firms to actively utilize the Nafis platform to connect with qualified Emiratis and fulfill their national responsibilities before the year-end deadline.The year-end December 31 deadline this year marks a pivotal and defining moment in the UAE’s ongoing drive to integrate more talented Emiratis into the dynamic private workforce. Companies that fully align with the mandated targets will find significant opportunity in government incentives; those that delay risk financial fines, downgraded status, and the growing possibility of strict legal enforcement.","Emiratisation is a national policy in the UAE aimed at increasing meaningful employment of Emirati citizens across public and private sectors.

Outlook for gold investors





Gold prices in Dubai continued their slide on Tuesday, holding below the Dh500 ($136) mark per gram amid weakness in international bullion markets. As of 7 a.m., 24-karat gold was priced at Dh481.25 ($130.00) per gram, while 22-karat traded at Dh445.50 ($120.29) per gram.The decline mirrors the sharp global sell-off seen Monday when gold tumbled below the $4,000 per ounce mark for the first time in weeks, a drop of over 3.2%. Although the metal recovered 0.9% in early Tuesday trading, sentiment remained fragile as traders digested progress in US–China trade talks, which reduced appetite for safe-haven assets.Just a week earlier, on October 21, gold had touched a record Dh525.25 ($141.83) per gram before suffering its steepest single-day fall in more than ten years. Buyers who invested during Diwali’s price peak saw the value of their holdings drop swiftly as global optimism dampened demand for gold.Global crises, such as the Middle East conflict and the war in Ukraine, have stoked demand for bullion, while political turmoil in France and Japan added to the flight to gold.Analysts attribute the slide to renewed hope in trade stability. “With the US–China dispute showing signs of resolution, markets have shifted toward riskier assets, pulling investors away from gold,” said one Dubai-based commodities expert.Attention now turns to the US Federal Reserve, which concludes its policy meeting Wednesday. Markets widely expect a 25-basis-point rate cut, the second in a row, aimed at cushioning slowing growth and inflationary pressure.Adding to the intrigue, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that five contenders are being vetted to replace Jerome Powell when his term expires in May 2026, including Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman, Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett, and Rick Rieder of BlackRock.With gold currently consolidating after several months of record-breaking gains, market analysts warn that heightened volatility may persist until there’s clearer direction on US monetary policy and broader global trade momentum. For now, cautious traders are closely watching whether the metal can hold above the Dh480 ($130) level, considered a key short-term support.Silver, meanwhile, largely mirrored gold’s trajectory, gradually easing from record highs reached earlier in October, when investors flocked to precious metals amid rising geopolitical and economic uncertainty.","24-karat gold in Dubai traded at Dh481.25 ($131) per gram, marking a sharp post- Diwali decline.

Right to work for H-4 visa holders stands as US Supreme Court declines appeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/right-to-work-for-h-4-visa-holders-stands-as-us-supreme-court-declines-appeal/articleshow/124848052.cms,"H-1B Visa Changes Explained: Indian Talent Could Gain Or Lose Depending On Policy





The decade-long legal battle over the right of H-4 visa holders to work in the United States reached closure in mid-October, after the US Supreme Court (SC) declined to hear an appeal by Save Jobs USA, effectively leaving intact lower court rulings that upheld employment authorisation for certain spouses of H-1B visa holders.The SC’s refusal to take up the case brings finality to a dispute that began in 2015, when the Obama administration introduced the H-4 Employment Authorisation Document (EAD) rule. to mitigate the problems faced by certain sections of immigrants (such as the Indian diaspora) who faced backlogs running into several decades to obtain an employment based green card.Under the EAD rule, in those cases where the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card or has got an extension beyond the permitted six years, the spouse holding an H-4 visa can apply for employment authorization.For thousands of families—many of them Indian—the decision ends years of uncertainty over whether spouses, largely women, would be forced to quit their jobs or leave the workforce.This Supreme Court development comes on the back of a key ruling in August 2024, when the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the authority to grant work permits to certain H-4 spouses.The district court had rejected arguments that DHS had exceeded its mandate under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Circuit Judge Walker, relying on earlier precedent in the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers case, had held that Save Jobs USA had failed to meaningfully distinguish its challenge, thereby upholding the district court’s summary judgment in favour of the government. This ruling had already solidified the legal footing of the H-4 EAD, providing relief to nearly a lakh Indian spouses who hold these work permits.With the Supreme Court’s refusal to intervene, the focus now shifts to the future of the H-4 work programme under a Trump administration. Steven Brown, partner at Reddy Neumann Brown, an immigration law firm, in his blog post emphasised that the program’s legal footing is stronger than ever. However, he pointed out that during Trump’s earlier tenure as President, the administration had attempted to end the H-4 EAD through rulemaking, but the proposal never reached final publication. “Under Trump 2.0, DHS could revive those efforts with sharper focus. Possible actions include issuing a new notice of proposed rulemaking to rescind or narrow eligibility for work authorization, or directing internal reviews that slow or suspend EAD adjudications while new regulations are developed. Although any change would still need to follow the notice-and-comment process, the administration might move swiftly and test the limits of executive authority to reshape employment-based immigration policy,” he said.",The US Supreme Court (SC) declined to hear an appeal by Save Jobs USA.
