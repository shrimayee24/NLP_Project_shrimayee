About the Ladki Bahin scheme

A historic mandate

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Eknath Shinde took a moment to celebrate the Mahayuti alliance's resounding victory in the 2024 Assembly elections by acknowledging the role of the state’s women. At an event related to the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana ( Ladki Bahin Scheme ), Shinde clicked selfies with attendees and credited the scheme for the electoral success.Speaking to reporters yesterday, Shinde expressed gratitude saying, “I thank all my ladki bahins in the state and the brothers who voted in large numbers for us. The voting trend is an endorsement of our work. Every section of society supported us because of our development efforts.”NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) chief Sharad Pawar, reflecting on the election results, acknowledged that women’s participation and schemes like Ladki Bahin contributed significantly to the Mahayuti sweep. ""The Ladki Bahin scheme and religious polarisation may have played a role. Women's participation in large numbers could be the reason for this outcome,"" Pawar said while addressing reporters in Karad. Despite the setback, he vowed to revitalize his party and its leadership.Pawar suffered his worst-ever political defeat, with his faction securing only 10 seats, compared to 41 seats won by the NCP faction led by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. The Mahayuti alliance, comprising the BJP (132 seats), Shiv Sena (57 seats), and Ajit Pawar-led NCP (41 seats), emerged victorious with 230 seats in the 288-member assembly. The opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi was limited to just 46 seats.Launched on Raksha Bandhan in August 2024, the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana provides Rs 1,500 monthly to over one crore financially disadvantaged women in Maharashtra. Women aged 21 to 65 years with annual household incomes below Rs 2.5 lakh are eligible.During a trial phase earlier this year, over 30 lakh women received Rs 3,000 directly into their bank accounts. Inspired by Madhya Pradesh's Ladli Behna Yojana, Shinde assured that Maharashtra’s version would continue indefinitely.As trends solidified the Mahayuti victory, Shinde emphasized that public recognition of their development efforts underpinned the success. With women emerging as a key demographic, the Ladki Bahin scheme appears to have played a pivotal role in securing the alliance’s mandate.","Eknath Shinde took a moment to celebrate the Mahayuti alliance's resounding victory in the 2024 Assembly elections.

NEW DELHI: The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will need to use formal diplomatic protocols to serve summons on Adani Group Founder Gautam Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani, in a case involving alleged payoffs of $265 million (Rs 2,200 crore) to secure solar energy contracts.

"‘Marriage equality cannot be won solely through courts,’ says lawyer Rohin Bhat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/marriage-equality-cannot-be-won-solely-through-courts-says-lawyer-rohin-bhat/articleshow/115632747.cms,"Rohin Bhatt

— who represented two couples in the

marriage equality

case in the

last year — reflects on this duality in his debut book ‘The Urban Elite versus Union of India’. In an interview with Sharmila Ganesan Ram, the 26-year-old lawyer talks about the need to recalibrate the LGBTQIA+ movement

As a lawyer representing two couples in the marriage equality case, what was the lead up to the judgment like?

Is that why the narrative braids your personal experiences with the legal?

The book attributes a chunk of the progress made by queer rights activism in India to the work done by AIDS Bhedbhav Virodhi Andolan (ABVA) in the 1990s…

“Queer liberation will not and cannot be won solely through litigation,” you write. What makes you put on your black gown and show up in court daily?

Many argue that marriage itself is a faulty institution. Can marriage equality liberate the queer community?

The wait for the judgment had been long and hard.It felt as if we were holding our breaths. One was obviously anxious and worried about the outcome, for it was certain that the implications of the judgment would be far-reaching not just for the queer community, but also for others who do not have social sanction, like inter-caste and inter-faith lovers, since the Special Marriage Act was being challenged. The judgment was underwhelming, yet consistent with the recent trends in the Supreme Court and the judiciary where the courts have failed to act as an anti-majoritarian force. However, the loss was a much more personal one because I knew that it was not just ‘a’ case, but one that would deeply affect me and my life as well.I think often when one talks about the law, one does it in a neutral fashion, as lofty ideals or formulaic principles that have to be applied to a given set of facts. But the law is hardly that — heart, emotions and psyche play a big role in how cases are decided. With the marriage equality litigation, one, and one’s community, were unwillingly, the subject of the law. The emotions during the hearing were frenzied and all-consuming even after the judgment. This book was not only a way of channelling those emotions as a therapeutic exercise, but also talking about the queer rights movement in India.ABVA presents an early model of a social movement that was inclusive and cohesive. It had no funding, no office. It had members from 24 to 55-year-olds who ranged from residents of some of Delhi’s poshest colonies to pavement dwellers. Their activism was one of the main forces behind making sure that the AIDS (Prevention) Bill, 1989 was withdrawn. The bill allowed for the isolation, forcible testing, questioning of people who were living with HIV and lacked any provision in place which ensured the protection of confidentiality, or the protection of due process of law. Their reports tell us about the struggle that goes in building a movement. Post 2018 and Navtej, I think the queer movement has become much more judicialised. Winning cases is easier than winning hearts and minds. But also because we were, prior to the 2024 elections, political orphans. Few political parties openly supported queer rights. Thankfully, that has changed post-2018.The belief that the Constitution and the courts can work for the proverbial ‘butcher, baker and the candlestick maker’. I don’t think it is these big-ticket cases that make the practice of the law meaningful but the smaller ones, which often don’t make it to the front page of the newspapers, do. Getting a protection order from a violent natal family is one such example. However, to say that we will achieve equality through the courts is perhaps a myopic conclusion. Unless we put in the hard work of movement building, of changing attitudes, of politically lobbying with the State, I do not think queer liberation can be achieved.Marriage, of course, replicates caste and class hierarchies, and queer marriage will do it too. Having said that, there is nuance to it. Our legal system recognises relationships in three ways: blood, marriage and adoption. Now for queer persons to have rights over their assets and their partner, marriage becomes a legitimate legal need. There is a case to be made for radical legal re-imagination of how we look at relationships, such as choosing our families, but that is a long-term project. In the meantime, our rights cannot wait, and marriage is one way of ensuring that partners have rights over natal families which are often sites of violence.","Rohin Bhatt is a 26-year-old lawyer who represented two couples in the marriage equality case in the Supreme Court last year.

COP29: India champions the cause of global south in a historic move of rejecting the climate finance outcome,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cop29-india-champions-the-cause-of-global-south-in-a-historic-move-of-rejecting-the-climate-finance-outcome/articleshow/115631984.cms,"Chandni Raina (Reuters photo)

BAKU/NEW DELHI: India's historic stand of rejecting the climate finance outcome at COP29 on Sunday triggered similar reactions from other developing countries and experts, who viewed India as a champion of the entire Global South .The moment came during the final plenary where India's negotiator, Chandni Raina , led the charge against what was delivered as the “Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3T"" and pinpointed gaps in the document.Belém, a Brazilian city, will host COP30 next year. Experts pointed out that the move to accept a token financial pledge was merely to prevent the collapse of the negotiations in the Azerbaijani capital.Taking on rich nations without mincing words, Raina said, ""Developed countries are taking the lead for a mobilisation goal of a mere sum of $300 billion, and that too to be only reached by 2035, that’s almost 11 years later, and that too from a wide variety of sources. So, it would have to be private, it would have to be multilateral, and there are large amounts of it that will be left for developing countries to mobilise themselves.""""We are disappointed with the outcome, which clearly brings out the unwillingness of developed country parties to fulfil their responsibilities,"" she said, clearly underlining that the outcome at COP29 will further affect developing countries' ability to adapt to climate change, greatly impacting their NDC ambition and its implementation.Speakers from other developing countries, including Bolivia and Nigeria, took a similar line while objecting to the final climate finance outcome during their post-gavel remarks.“COP29 has failed to deliver on its core mandate—binding commitments, real finance, and meaningful action to curb the climate crisis . With the world needing over $1.3 trillion in climate finance by 2030, the agreement on a $300 billion goal by 2035, without a clear indication of what constitutes this finance, is a hollow gesture, a mere fig leaf for inaction,"" said Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).Ghosh, along with former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and other experts, who sought an urgent overhaul of the UN climate talk process, pointed out that the outcome encouraging developing countries to make additional contributions, including through South–South cooperation, undermines the very principle of equity. ""Instead of delivering climate finance, COP29 has delivered a new principle: I pollute, you pay,"" he said.“India, rightly, underscored this inadequacy and the process of adoption. While the outcome reflects the current state of geopolitics as well as domestic politics in some countries in the globe, the developing countries did well standing together. The effort for mobilisation of far more resources for climate change must go on,"" said Manjeev Puri, former Indian ambassador to the European Union and a distinguished fellow, TERI.Referring to other aspects of the outcome amid all-round disappointment, Aarti Khosla, director, Climate Trends, noted that the finer elements, like setting aside funds for least developed countries , is, however, a slight progress. ""Climate is a matter of life and death for some countries. There is also language in the text that refers to a special assessment on access to finance by 2030 - when it will be clear how much of the funds are grants, concessional loans, and the extent of dependence on private finance,"" she said.Underlining that the devil, as ever, will be in the details, Khosla said, ""It is hard to find positive developments at these very tricky negotiations. Baku has given a deal but kept no one happy; everyone has stayed in to retain the spirit of multilateralism.”Calling the COP29 outcome not just a failure but a betrayal, the Least Developed Countries (LDC) group on climate change said, ""The bulldozed New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) is a glaring symbol of this failure.""""Once again, the countries (rich nations) most responsible for the climate crisis have failed us. We leave Baku without an ambitious climate finance goal, without concrete plans to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and without the comprehensive support desperately needed for adaptation and loss and damage,"" the group said in a statement.""We came in good faith, with the safety of our communities and the well-being of the world at heart.

What does the deal on climate finance at COP29 mean?



Overall post-2025 target

Core goa

It will come from a wide variety of sources (public and private; bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources).

It will replace the existing annual $100 billion 2020-25 period target (it was promised in 2009 to mobilise $100 billion per year by 2020).

BAKU/NEW DELHI: The UN climate talks (COP29) concluded on Sunday with a weak outcome on climate finance, prompting rich nations to mobilise merely $300 billion per year by 2035 for developing countries from a ""wide variety of sources,"" including public and private, rather than solely from public finance as was being demanded. The move led India to reject it in its present form, stating the document is ""nothing more than an optical illusion.""Though the amount is part of the overall package of $1.3 trillion per year by 2035 from all public and private sources for developing countries to implement their climate action goals, India, while standing up for the Global South, said the amount would not address the enormity of the challenge the world is currently facing.""The goal is too little, too distant (almost 11 years later). It is 2035, it is too far gone. Our 2030 estimates tell us that we need to do it at $1.3 trillion per year till 2030... The amount that is proposed to be mobilised is abysmally poor. It is a paltry sum... We cannot accept it... We are very unhappy, disappointed with the process and object to the adoption of this agenda,"" said Chandni Raina, India's negotiator, while articulating the country's stand amid a wide round of applause and support from several developing countries in the final plenary.India sought the floor to speak before the decision was adopted, but the finance outcome - New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) - was suddenly gavelled by the COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev.""We informed the Presidency, we informed the secretariat that we wanted to make a statement prior to any decision on the adoption. However, this is for everyone to see. This has been stage-managed. We are extremely, extremely disappointed with this incident... We absolutely object to this unfair means followed for adoption,"" said Raina, Economic Advisor, DEA in the Ministry of Finance, in her intervention.Post-gavel remarks of India and other developing countries, including Malawi, Bolivia, Nigeria, and Pakistan, on the Baku outcome were merely taken as records by the Azerbaijani Presidency and will appear in the footnote of the outcome. It is believed by many observers that the weakclimate finance outcome and India's rejection, endorsed by several developing countries, may impact the countries' update on their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - climate action targets - next year.Asked what India's rejection of the climate finance outcome meant at this juncture, R R Rashmi, Distinguished Fellow, TERI and India's former lead negotiator, told TOI that India, in expressing formal disappointment about the $300 billion NCQG, acted as a leader of the Global South. ""It is significant that, after a long time, India and many other diverse groups within the developing world have shown a common and united stand on this issue,"" he said.Rashmi, however, said it's too early to say anything about the next NDCs. ""The threat of use of unilateral trade measures by developed countries and the domestic policy limitations are a bigger constraint for India,"" he said, in a clear reference to trade barriers such as the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is a tool to put a price through imposing a border tax on carbon-intensive goods, like iron & steel, aluminium, and cement, that are entering the EU.Pointing out such barriers in her intervention, Raina said, ""The Global South is being pushed to transit to low-carbon pathways even at the cost of our growth. We have to face the CBAM measures. There are other measures that are being imposed by the developed country parties to make the transition really not easy. In fact, it is quite difficult to enable such a transition in a very, very competitive hostile environment that we are facing at the moment.""Once CBAM is implemented from 2026, it will put a tariff burden on such products of developing countries, including India and China, and impact their trade.1.: $1.3 trillion per year by 2035, from all public and private sources, for developing countries for implementing their climate action.2.l: Developed countries to mobilise $300 billion per year by 2035 for developing countries.3.: Encourages developing countries to make contributions, including through South–South cooperation, on a voluntary basis.4.: Pursue efforts to at least triple the annual fund flow by 2030 from 2022 levels for adaptation measures.5.: Baku to Belem (host city of COP30 in Brazil) Roadmap to assess progress towards the $1.3 trillion goal, with reports in 2026 and 2027.",The UN climate talks (COP29) concluded on Sunday with a weak outcome on climate finance.

Climbing 8-metre pole must for this Karnataka power sector job; 80% fail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/climbing-8-metre-pole-must-for-this-karnataka-power-sector-job-80-fail/articleshow/115643279.cms,"Representative Image

Pole issue prompted dept to revise policy

BENGALURU: Forget your high school marks or diplomas. For thousands of group D power sector job aspirants in Karnataka , success hinges on a single, daunting challenge: Climbing an 8-metre concrete pole, a task that’s eliminating eight out of 10 candidates before they can even prove their academic worth.The Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited ( KPTCL ) and five electricity supply companies’ (Escoms) recruitment drive for nearly 3,000 group D jobs has turned into an unprecedented test of physical prowess, leaving many qualified candidates literally hanging in the balance.The mandatory poleclimbing test, introduced in 2015, has become a significant stumbling block for candidates applying for junior station attendant (JSA) and junior powerman positions .This direct recruitment has sparked protests from pro-Kannada groups and aspirants who demand a switch to written examinations conducted by either the Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC) or Karnataka Examination Authority (KEA).According to KPTCL officials, a staggering 80% of candidates fail to satisfy this crucial physical parameter, which is non-negotiable regardless of gender. Not all sub-divisions of KPTCL and Escoms have necessary poleclimbing equipment.“Most candidates barely make it past the first couple of metres before giving up,” said a KPTCL official, highlighting a stark regional divide in success rate.While candidates from North Karnataka, familiar with tree climbing, show better performance, those from South Karnataka often struggle, viewing pole climbing as a social stigma.”The challenge has become so significant that the energy department had to revise its recruitment policy in 2014, lowering educational qualifications from 12th pass/ITI diploma to SSLC/10th pass to expand the talent pool.Regional disparityDespite these adjustments, between 2015 and 2019, majority of the 16,300 recruits hailed from North Karnataka districts, underscoring the regional disparity. Energy department officials defend their stance, saying that reduced qualification levels and direct recruitment were necessary responses to previous recruitment challenges.“When the requirement was 12th pass, candidates would often opt for better positions, avoiding these group D jobs. The current system has placed more than 16,300 candidates in recent years,” a senior official explained.","The mandatory poleclimbing test, introduced in 2015, has become a significant stumbling block for candidates applying for junior station attendant (JSA) and junior powerman positions.

Dubai Lindt Chocolate: Germans smuggle and queue up for hours in cold for these luxury Lindt bars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/dubai-chocolate-a-global-frenzy-germans-smuggle-and-queue-up-for-hours-in-cold-for-these-luxury-lindt-bars/articleshow/115641540.cms,"Germans are experiencing a frenzy over pistachio-filled chocolate bars, with their popularity reaching unprecedented levels. The demand is so high that these chocolate bars are being sold for more than 100 euros ($104) online, leading to desperate attempts to get them.Recently, customs officials apprehended a 31-year-old individual attempting to bring 45 kilograms of these sweets illegally from Switzerland into Germany.When Lindt introduced their version in Germany this month, enthusiasts waited in cold weather for hours to purchase the bars. Despite the premium price of up to 20 euros per bar, significantly higher than standard chocolate bars, consumers remain undeterred.""I waited 10 hours.

This substantial confection features a decorated chocolate bar containing various fillings, with its distinctive flavour being pistachio cream.The product gained widespread attention after food influencer Maria Vehera's car video garnered over 100 million views on TikTok.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Who is Santino Pietrosanti?

Pietrosanti's commitment to diversity

Backlash: Is Jaguar's rebranding too ""woke""?

British vehicle company Jaguar 's latest advertisement, ""Copy Nothing ,"" has ignited a firestorm on social media for featuring models and not a single car. Critics have labeled the ad everything from ""pretentious"" to ""a fashion show for people who forgot what they're selling."" Santino Pietrosanti , the self-styled marketing guru who orchestrated Jaguar's controversial rebranding, is at the center of the fierce debate surrounding the car company's shift toward inclusivity and diversity.In Jaguar's 30-second ad, the models walk through abstract scenes while delivering phrases like ""Create Exuberant"" and ""Live Vivid,"" which have been widely mocked. Notably, not a single Jaguar car appears in the entire ad. This absence has baffled many, especially considering the brand's reputation for sleek luxury vehicles.Pietrosanti, a US native, is the head of brand at Jaguar. He now resides in Milton Keynes, England, where he lives with his Scottish husband, Paul, and their cockapoo, Mia, in a £975,000 home, according to The Daily Mail report.At the Attitude Awards last month, dressed in a spangled dinner jacket over a see-through t-shirt, Pietrosanti shared his vision for the rebrand, describing it as a return to Jaguar's roots of ""something truly special.""""We're not just talking about new cars,"" Pietrosanti told the audience, as quoted by The Daily Mail. ""We are talking about all new ways of thinking and embracing the full spectrum of human potential and creativity. Jaguar has always stood for fearless originality, striving to be a copy of nothing. And we believe that every person has the potential to be something unique, something original, and that's what makes us strong.""A key part of Jaguar's transformation, according to Pietrosanti, is its commitment to diversity and inclusion . ""At Jaguar, we proudly stand with the LGBTQ+ community,"" he said. ""Originality and creativity thrive in spaces where people are free to be themselves.""Under his leadership, Jaguar has established over 15 DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) groups, including initiatives focused on Pride, women in engineering, and neurodiversity. Major policy changes, such as creating support for transitioning employees, have been implemented to drive equity and ensure that Jaguar's workforce reflects the diverse society in which it operates.While Pietrosanti's vision has been hailed by some for championing inclusivity and employee empowerment, others have criticized the rebrand as pandering to a ""woke"" agenda. Regardless of the backlash, Pietrosanti remains steadfast in his belief that Jaguar’s commitment to diversity will not only redefine the brand but will also empower its employees and customers alike.""We're on a transformative journey of our own,"" Pietrosanti declared, ""driven by a belief in diversity, inclusion, creativity, policy, and most importantly, action.""","Santino Pietrosanti, head of brand at Jaguar, is at the center of the fierce debate surrounding the car company's shift toward inclusivity and diversity.

Standing behind Gore onstage was Scott Bessent , a hedge fund manager and - at the time - a major donor to Democrats who co-hosted the event.On Friday, Bessent was tapped by Prez-elect Trump to be his treasury secretary.Having won the trust of Trump and his inner circle, Bessent would lead a Republican economic agenda of cutting taxes, culling federal regulations and enacting sweeping tariffs. The selection caps an extraordinary career arc for an investor who was once a protege of the liberal billionaire philanthropist George Soros and who gave money to top Democrats including Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama.""He was very supportive of the causes and the people that we supported,"" said Will Trinkle, a Democrat who co-hosted the event with Gore. He noted Bessent, who would be the first openly gay treasury secretary, was a strong advocate for gay rights and marriage equality.If confirmed by the Senate, Bessent would help Trump as he attempts to remake the US economy. As treasury secretary, Bessent would work to steer tax cuts through Congress, lead trade negotiations with China and help cull federal regulations that Trump believes are stifling the economy. But friends and former colleagues described him as driven by data and intellectually curious, with an ability to work with people from across the ideological and political spectrum.Last spring, when many business leaders were hesitant to back Trump publicly as his legal troubles mounted, Bessent took a different view. He saw Trump as a ""stock that goes up on bad news"". Concerned about the exploding national debt and the need to make changes to the international trading system, Bessent set up a meeting with Trump. In recent months, he has pitched a ""3-3-3"" plan that would aim for 3% economic growth, reduce the budget deficit to 3% of GDP and increase domestic oil production by 3 million barrels per day. He also came up with an idea that would allow the president to essentially sideline the chair of Federal Reserve, although he has backed down from that proposal in the face of opposition.Stanley Druckenmiller, a hedge fund investor, said while Bessent is soft-spoken, he can also be ""tough and persuasive"" and has the right temperament to work for a demanding boss like Trump. ""If anybody can handle it, it's Scott."" NYT","Hedge fund manager Scott Bessent has been nominated by President-elect Trump to be his treasury secretary.

Funding challenges

Toronto's Original Santa Claus parade is set to celebrate its 120th year on Sunday, aiming to spread holiday cheer to an estimated 750,000 spectators. The six-kilometer parade will feature 27 hand-crafted floats and over 2,000 performers.David McCarthy, chair of the Original Santa Claus Parade board of directors, expressed excitement about the event, saying, as quoted by CBC News, “We’re expecting to bring the magic back to the city of Toronto again this year.”Festivities will begin at 10 am at Christie Pits, where children can write letters to Santa, enjoy cookies, and watch a performance by Wiggles star Emma Memma before she joins the parade.At 11:45 am, the Holly Jolly Run—a five-kilometer race with nearly 2,000 participants—will kick off the day. Mayor Olivia Chow will deliver remarks at 12:15 p.m., officially launching the parade.Starting at 12:30 pm at Christie Pits, the parade will follow a modified six-kilometer route due to construction. The procession will travel east along Bloor Street, south on St George Street, and weave through the city before concluding at St Lawrence Market around 3 pm.The parade will be live-streamed on the Santa Claus Parade YouTube channel, offering an alternative to the traditional television broadcast.Toronto police have announced road closures starting at 7 am, with streets reopening by 6 pm. The TTC will increase subway and streetcar services along the route, and special GO Train service will run on the Milton Line.While the parade’s milestone anniversary brings excitement, organizers warn its future is uncertain due to declining sponsorships and rising costs. A $250,000 funding gap remains for this year’s event.A GoFundMe campaign has raised over $125,000 as of Sunday, and recent contributions from the city, province, and a pledge of federal support from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have provided hope. However, McCarthy stressed the need for ongoing community and corporate backing to secure future parades.","Toronto's Original Santa Claus parade will celebrate its 120th year on Sunday.

American Airlines introduces new boarding technology to stop line-cutting at gate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/american-airlines-introduces-new-boarding-technology-to-stop-line-cutting-at-gate/articleshow/115632894.cms,"AI-generated image of passengers at an airport (Picture credit: Canva AI)

American Airlines has launched new technology at over 100 US airports to prevent passengers from cutting boarding lines. The system uses an audible alert to notify gate agents if someone tries to scan their ticket before their assigned group is called.The new software will not allow a boarding pass to be accepted until the assigned group is called, meaning passengers who arrive at the gate too early will be asked to return and wait for their turn.The airline tested the system at three airports: Albuquerque International Sunport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and Tucson International Airport. Following positive feedback from staff and passengers, the technology is being rolled out ahead of the Thanksgiving travel rush .“The initial response from customers and American employees has exceeded our expectations,” said Julie Rath, American’s senior vice president of airport operations , reservations, and service recovery.The new system aims to reduce frustration and potential conflicts caused by line-cutting. Airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt doesn’t view the move as “shaming” customers who cut the line and believes it will ""bring order out of chaos"" at the gate, creating a fairer boarding process .""And I hope it will defuse any potential flare-ups of anger from people who simply think they're entitled to board out of turn... It’s just not fair,"" Harteveldt said.While the technology is designed to create a smoother experience, some question its overall effectiveness. Seth Miller, editor of air travel site PaxEx.aero, acknowledges the benefits of consistent gate control but remains unconvinced that it's ""100% perfect for passengers."" He points out potential issues, such as families booked on separate reservations, that could lead to delays.American Airlines plans to expand the technology to its hub airports and other locations in the coming months. Other airlines might adopt similar systems to address boarding line frustrations.",American Airlines has launched new technology at over 100 US airports to prevent passengers from cutting boarding lines.

A couple in the US state of Connecticut faces charges for stealing nearly $1 million worth of Lululemon apparel over a two-month period across the country. Jadion Richards , 44, and Akwele Lawes-Richards, 45, allegedly stole from stores in multiple states, including Minnesota, Utah, Colorado, New York, and Connecticut.Lululemon Athletica is a Canadian-American brand specializing in athletic apparel for workouts, athleisure, and travel.The thefts occurred in Lululemon stores between September and November 2024, according to a New York Post report.The suspected theft spree ended when Lululemon investigators noticed a significant loss after the pair triggered a security alarm while leaving a store in Woodbury, Minnesota.The couple was arrested on November 14.Upon their arrest, officers discovered credit cards, debit cards, and a Marriott hotel room key. Inside the hotel room, police found 12 suitcases, three of which contained approximately $50,000 worth of Lululemon products. While Richards claimed racial profiling by store employees, Lululemon investigators allege the couple stole at least 45 items valued at $5,000 from various stores the day before.The complaint did not specify how the company investigator determined the estimated $1 million total value of stolen goods. The couple allegedly used various tactics to steal merchandise, including distracting employees while concealing clothing.“This outcome continues to underscore our ongoing collaboration with law enforcement and our investments in advanced technology, team training, and investigative capabilities to combat retail crime and hold offenders accountable,” said Lululemon’s vice president of asset protection to NBC News. “We remain dedicated to continuing these efforts to address and prevent this industry-wide issue.”In addition to the Minnesota incident, the couple is accused of eight thefts in Colorado in October and seven in Utah earlier in November.

Wounded Bangladesh protesters receive robotic helping hand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/wounded-bangladesh-protesters-receive-robotic-helping-hand/articleshow/115619038.cms,"(Reuters photo)

DHAKA: Squeezing rubber-covered robotic prosthetic hands , Bangladesh protesters wounded during the deadly revolution to topple autocratic leader Sheikh Hasina test out replacement arms for their lost limbs.""I'll be able to do some everyday tasks with this artificial hand,"" said student Hafeez Mohammad Hossain, 19, whose right hand was ripped off in gunfire on August 5.It was the same day protesters stormed Hasina's palace as she fled to India by helicopter.In the middle of the chaos, Hossain said a police officer levelled a shotgun at him and fired. He described searing pain as gun pellets lacerated his back and leg.Surgeons picked out the gunshot, but were unable to save his hand.""I can't write anymore,"" Hossain said. ""I'm struggling to learn how to write with my left hand.""On Thursday he was fitted with a prosthetic limb, alongside four other students who also lost their hands during the months-long protests in which at least 700 people were killed during a police crackdown.Robolife Technologies , a Bangladeshi organisation manufacturing artificial hands, said the prosthetic limbs use sensors connected to the nerves to move.The company says it allows users to grasp objects, to type and use a phone.""If you ask me whether they work like organic hands, I'd say no,"" said Antu Karim, who is working on the government-backed project to fit the limbs.""But these hands allow the boys to hold a glass if thirsty, or a spoon to eat,"" he added. ""At least, they won't be looked down upon for not having hands.""- 'Rely on others' -Hasina's 15-year tenure saw widespread human rights abuses , including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents.Limbless protesters held a rally earlier this month demanding the interim government who took over after Hasina's fall support those injured in the protests.Many say they have not received the aid they need.The four other former protesters who had arms fitted on Thursday included Mohammad Mamun Mia, 32, a father of two, whose hand was hacked off by a gang he said was loyal to Hasina's Awami League party.The new arm is far from perfect, but it has made a huge difference.""I'll be able to do some regular tasks with this hand,"" he said, saying that while he cannot work driving a tractor in the fields again, he hopes now to open a small business.Arif Hossain Sagar, 19, had his hand amputated after it failed to heal from an injury he sustained during the protests, and doctors worried about gangrene.""I can't do any regular activities now,"" Sagar told AFP. ""I rely on others for eating or bathing.""The new hand will return a degree of normality to his life, he said.Nayeem Hasan, wounded when attackers pounced on him as he went to donate blood to help those injured after a fire, broke into tears.The new arm would help him fulfil his simple dream.""I have a one-year-old daughter who wants me to hold her,"" Hasan said.","Hafeez Mohammad Hossain's right hand was ripped off in gunfire on August 5.
