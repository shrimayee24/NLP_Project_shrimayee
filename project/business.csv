Mamata Banerjee vs Election Commission: Supreme Court Orders Judicial Oversight in Bengal SIR

NEW DELHI: With nine of the 12 states covered in Phase 2 of special intensive revision (SIR) having published their final electoral roll - including six on Saturday - their combined electorate is down 7.9% to 19.7 crore, as compared to 21.4 crore at the time of announcement of SIR exercise on October 27, 2025.Over 1.7 crore electors have been struck off the electoral rolls of the nine states/UTs - Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Lakshadweep, Puducherry, Goa and Andaman & Nicobar Islands - on account of SIR. While the final electoral rolls of Gujarat, Puducherry and Lakshadweep were published earlier, those for Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Rajasthan, Goa and Andaman & Nicobar were published on Saturday.Interestingly, the range of net decline in electors at the end of SIR varies from a steep 16.9% in Andaman & Nicobar and 13.4% in Gujarat to just 0.3% in Lakshadweep and 3.2% in Kerala. While four of the nine states/UTs recorded net deletions above the 7.9% overall average, it was the opposite in five states/UTs.Three states - West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu - are yet to publish their final electoral roll as part of SIR phase 2.While Tamil Nadu's roll will be out on Feb 23, the timeline for West Bengal is Feb 28 and for UP, April 10.Among the six states where SIR stands concluded, Gujarat saw the highest net decline in its electorate since the start of SIR, at around 68 lakh or 13.4%. Chhattisgarh's electorate shrunk by 11.8% and Goa's by 10.7%. The remaining three states saw a modest decline: with Kerala's final electorate down by 3.2%, Madhya Pradesh's by 5.9% and Rajasthan's by 5.7%.Among the UTs, only Andaman and Nicobar saw a sharp net decline of 16.9% in its electors. Puducherry electorate was 7.6% less than what it was on Oct 27, 2025; the decline in Lakshadweep was just over 0.3%.While Phase 1 of SIR completed last year was exclusive to Bihar, Assam witnessed only a special summary revision. Another 22 states and UTs are yet to conduct SIR. EC recently indicated that it may start the next phase of SIR in April.","Nine of the 12 states covered in Phase 2 of special intensive revision (SIR) have published their final electoral roll.

""Don't Want To Be Dependent On US Or China…"" Macron On AI Innovation

Human capital development critical to realise AI's potential

: The AI Impact Summit concluded here with the adoption of the New Delhi Declaration marking the success of the push by India and other countries in the Global South to frame artificial intelligence as a shared global good rather than an exclusive technological advantage of the rich and developed.Endorsed by 86 countries and two organisations, the declaration sets out a shared global vision for what it calls ""collaborative, trusted, resilient and efficient"" artificial intelligence, whose potential can be realised ""only when its benefits are shared by humanity"" and cautioning that ""the choices that we make today will shape the AI-enabled world that future generations will inherit"".Signatories span the AI powerhouses of the US and China as well as other technology leaders such as Netherlands, South Korea and the EU.Significantly, Pakistan does not figure in the list.Taiwan, the leading semiconductor manufacturer, appeared to have been left out because of sensitivities of China, which has blocked its presence on international fora.Rooted in the principle of ""Sarvajan Hitaya, Sarvajan Sukhaya"" - welfare and happiness for all - a theme PM Modi articulated in his inaugural address on Thursday, the declaration places equity and access at the centre of AI governance, and commits participants to ""foster shared understanding, while respecting national sovereignty, on how AI could be made to serve humanity"".For many developing countries, this emphasis addresses long-standing concerns about technology rules being shaped without their participation.The declaration is organised around seven action pillars, or chakras, covering democratising AI resources; economic growth and social good; secure and trusted AI; AI for science; access for social empowerment; human capital development; and resilient, efficient and innovative AI systems. Together, they aim to translate broad principles into coordinated global action.Several voluntary commitments were announced to support this effort. Among them is the Global AI Impact Commons, described as ""a practical platform to encourage and enable the adoption, replication, and scale-up of successful AI use cases across regions"".The idea is to allow countries to share proven applications in areas such as public services, development and governance, reducing duplication and accelerating impact.Trust and safety form another core strand, with the declaration stressing that ""advancing secure, trustworthy and robust AI is foundational to building trust and maximising societal and economic benefits"". To support this, it takes note of the Trusted AI Commons - a voluntary repository of tools, benchmarks and best practices aimed at helping govts and developers build reliable AI systems across different legal, cultural contexts.With concern for democratisation of AI being one of the drivers of the declaration, it, predictably, emphasises that ""removing structural barriers to and increasing availability of AI research infrastructure can promote the use of AI in scientific research and development across countries"".An international network of AI-for-science institutions is expected to link researchers globally and accelerate AI-driven discovery. Human capital development is highlighted as critical to realising AI's potential.The declaration underlines that ""realising the full promise of AI requires equipping individuals with relevant skills"", backing this with voluntary guiding principles for reskilling and a workforce development playbook.","The New Delhi Declaration marks the success of the push by India and other countries in the Global South to frame artificial intelligence as a shared global good.

'Still battling trauma'

A Pocso court in UP's Banda sentenced to death Friday a former govt junior engineer and his wife for sexually abusing 33 boys over a decade, some as young as three, and selling videos and photographs of their torture on the dark web to customers across 47 countries.Additional district judge PK Mishra said convicts Ram Bhawan (50) and Durgawati (47) inflicted such physical and psychological trauma on the survivors - some required hospitalisation for injuries to their genitals and a few developed squint eyes - that their crimes deserved to be categorised as ""rarest of rare"".""The sheer scale of this victimisation across multiple districts, combined with the extreme moral turpitude of the convicts, marks this as a crime of such an exceptional and heinous nature that it leaves no room for reformation, necessitating the ultimate judicial deterrent to meet the ends of justice,"" says the order. The court directed the UP govt to pay Rs 10 lakh in compensation to each of the 33 victims.Ram Bhawan, who worked in the UP jalkal (waterworks) department, and Durgawati would lure children by offering them access to online video games, money and gifts. They remained active in Banda and Chitrakoot from 2010 till 2020, when Interpol got CBI involved in an inquiry on child sexual abuse content on the dark web.CBI registered an FIR on Oct 31 that year after the trail led to Ram Bhawan and Durgawati.The agency had filed a chargesheet documenting their crimes on Feb 10, 2021.Special public prosecutor Kamal Singh Gautam said the case had an overwhelming amount of evidence of what the children were subjected to.""The survivors are still suffering the psychological trauma caused by the predators"", Gautam said.CBI had medical experts from AIIMS Delhi to examine 25 of the children who suffered severe injuries at the hands of the convicts. The prosecution relied on their reports, digital evidence and the testimonies of the children to build their case and seek capital punishment to those accused in the case.Additional district judge Mishra convicted the couple of offences ranging from aggravated penetrative sexual assault and using children for pornographic purposes to abetment and criminal conspiracy under relevant sections.","A Pocso court in UP's Banda sentenced to death a former govt junior engineer and his wife for sexually abusing 33 boys over a decade.

1 in 7 stroke patients in India under 45 years: National Registry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-in-7-stroke-patients-in-india-under-45-years-national-registry/articleshow/128631939.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: One in seven stroke patients in India is younger than 45 years. Nearly two in five reach hospital more than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Three months later, more than half either die or suffer significant disability.These findings come from India’s largest hospital-based stroke registry analysis, published in ‘International Journal of Stroke’. The study was led by Prashant Mathur of ICMR–National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (ICMR-NCDIR), Bengaluru, along with investigators of the National Stroke Registry Programme.The analysis reviewed 34,792 stroke cases recorded across 30 hospitals between 2020 and 2022, providing one of the most detailed national snapshots of stroke patterns, treatment gaps and outcomes.The mean age of patients was 59.4 years, but 13.8% were under 45, underlining the growing burden of stroke among younger Indians. Nearly 63.4% were men and 72.1% came from rural areas, reflecting disparities in awareness, prevention and access to timely care.Hypertension was present in 74.5% of patients, making it the dominant risk factor. Diabetes affected 27.3%, smokeless tobacco use 28.5%, tobacco smoking 22.6% and alcohol use 20.2%.The study also noted gender differences — women had higher rates of hypertension and diabetes, while men reported greater tobacco and alcohol use.The time taken to get treatment remained the biggest hurdle, according to the analysis. Only 20% reached hospital within the crucial 4.5-hour window for emergency stroke treatment. In contrast, 37.8% reached hospital after 24 hours. As a result, just 4.6% of ischemic stroke patients received intravenous thrombolysis and 0.7% underwent mechanical thrombectomy, it said. Delayed arrival, imaging delays and non-availability of medicines were key reasons for missing treatment.Ischemic strokes accounted for 60% of cases, while intracerebral haemorrhage made up 34.2%.Dr Manjari Tripathi, head of neurology at AIIMS Delhi, said the numbers reinforced a basic message. “Patients must reach the hospital within three hours. Immediate brain imaging is essential, and, if eligible, thrombolysis should be given without delay. Time is brain — every minute lost means neurons lost, leading to disability and long-term dependence. It is vital that people recognise stroke symptoms and seek emergency care early,” she said.Outcomes remain stark as in-hospital mortality was 13.9%, but by three months, nearly 28% had died, indicating that many patients passed away after discharge. In total, more than half had a poor outcome, defined as death or significant disability. Women were more likely than men to have a disability at follow-up, suggesting possible gaps in rehabilitation and post-discharge care. Recurrent stroke within three months occurred in 1.1% of patients.The authors said stronger control of hypertension and diabetes, tobacco cessation, faster referral systems and better access to acute stroke care — particularly in rural India — were critical. Without improvements in prevention and rapid response, stroke would continue to strike early and leave families coping with avoidable disability.","One in seven stroke patients in India is younger than 45 years.

Recurrent miscarriages can be deeply distressing for couples trying to conceive, often leaving them searching for answers and hope. “While many couples experience the emotional pain of repeated pregnancy loss, the underlying cause is not the same in every case. Recurrent miscarriages can result from a variety of factors, and treatment must be tailored to the specific cause,” says Dr Sreevani Kotha, Director and Head, 9M Fertility by Ankura Hospital.She further adds that recurrent pregnancy loss is when a woman experiences two or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 20 weeks of gestation.There can be several reasons for recurrent miscarriage , and the underlying cause is not the same in every case. One of the most common causes is an abnormal number of chromosomes in the developing fetus. When this occurs, the body recognizes that the pregnancy is not developing normally and may terminate it spontaneously. “Although chromosomal abnormalities are more frequently associated with advanced maternal age, they can also occur in younger women,” says Dr Sreevani.In some cases, the uterus may not be conducive to healthy implantation. Structural abnormalities, including fibroids and polyps, can be responsible in such situations. Endocrine problems such as thyroid disorders and diabetes can also lead to spontaneous pregnancy loss. “In a specific autoimmune condition called antiphospholipid syndrome, the body produces antibodies that increase the risk of blood clot formation. This can interfere with the placenta and affect the developing pregnancy,” Dr Sreevani adds, citing another cause.Apart from the above medical issues, environmental factors can also have a significant impact on pregnancy. Smoking, alcohol consumption, excess body weight, and high levels of stress are known to contribute to recurrent pregnancy loss. “In modern times, the effect of environmental factors on pregnancy has increased multifold. These factors don’t just influence recurrent pregnancy loss but also affect the overall fertility rates,” explains Dr Sreevani Signs such as vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain or cramping, persistent back pain, passage of tissue, or a sudden decrease in pregnancy symptoms may indicate a possible pregnancy loss and require immediate medical consultation. Women experiencing dizziness or weakness should also seek prompt evaluation.“Treatment of recurrent pregnancy loss depends on identifying and addressing the underlying cause. A thorough assessment is carried out with an individualized approach, which may include blood tests for hormonal and autoimmune disorders, genetic testing, and imaging studies such as ultrasound to evaluate the uterus,” says Dr Sreevani.Management may include correcting uterine abnormalities through surgery, treating hormonal imbalances, managing chronic medical conditions, or using medications in cases of autoimmune disorders. Lifestyle modifications such as maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding smoking and alcohol, and managing stress are equally important. “In selected individual cases where conventional measures are not sufficient, advanced assisted reproductive treatments may prove helpful for couples in achieving a successful pregnancy,” assures Dr Sreevani. Recurrent pregnancy loss can be emotionally distressing, but it is not uncommon. Modern medical science has evolved multifold, and scenarios that appeared difficult a decade ago can often be effectively managed today. By staying aware and seeking timely care, couples can attain positive outcomes,” concludes Dr Sreevani.","Recurrent pregnancy loss is when a woman experiences two or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 20 weeks of gestation.

This authority allows for a temporary import surcharge (up to 15%) for 150 days to address balance-of-payments deficits.On Friday, Congress leader and former finance minster P Chidambaram also demanded that the government must explain the impact of the judgment on the ""deal"" that was announced on February 6 between the US and India.Chidambaram said he had stated that if the Supreme Court struck down President Trump's imposition of tariffs, the result would be that the US and India would revert to the status quo ante of before April 2, 2025.""Meanwhile, the US has extracted several concessions from India without conceding any.

‘Mahanagar stn was part of Metro plan but dropped later’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mahanagar-stn-was-part-of-metro-plan-but-dropped-later/articleshow/128622676.cms,"Lucknow: Did you know that the Mahanagar area of the city was part of the Metro route in the original alignment plan, but was dropped later? A comptroller and auditor general (CAG) report tabled in the state Assembly on Friday revealed that Mahanagar Metro Station, between IT College Crossing and Badshah Nagar, was mentioned in the DPR, but didn't make it to the final list.The CAG report states that in Dec 2013, the central govt had granted pre-approval for Phase-1A of the Lucknow Metro . The DPR, an MOU between the Centre and UP govt, the finance contract with the European investment bank (EIB), and the project agreement with EIB all specified the construction of 22 stations along the 23-km corridor.According to the DPR, Mahanagar station was projected to get the third-highest passenger footfall in 2015 and the second highest by 2020. A source in the Lucknow Municipal Corporation said the area has two separate wards (Mahanagar and Vivekananda Puri) with over one lakh population.However, the audit found that the executing company -- UP Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) -- built only 21 stations, dropping Mahanagar from the alignment. No evidence was produced to show that any proposal for its exclusion was placed before the central or state govts nor any approval was obtained, the report says.The CAG noted that bypassing the sanctioned DPR violated multiple binding documents — DPR, MoU, finance contract, and the project agreement — and deprived the Mahanagar area of a key Metro facility despite projected high ridership.In Sept 2024, the state govt claimed that the change was not concealed, stating that the ministry of housing and urban affairs had notified the alignment with 21 stations after examining it against the original DPR.The CAG found state govt response unconvincing, noting that while the UPMRC informed MoHUA about other major alterations — such as changing the proposed elevated station at Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport to an underground one — it failed to disclose the removal of Mahanagar station. The audit stressed that any deviation from the approved DPR required a separate, explicit approval from the GoI along with justification, which was neither sought nor granted.Reacting to the CAG report, the UPMRC told TOI that station locations were optimised by dropping Mahanagar. It was appropriate to have both stations 'IT Chauraha' and 'Badshah Nagar' closer to Mahanagar. Usually 1km distance has been maintained between each station.","Mahanagar Metro Station, between IT College Crossing and Badshah Nagar, was mentioned in the DPR, but didn't make it to the final list.

India AI Impact Summit 2026: DGIS Harsh Chhibber Stresses Role Of Sovereign AI In Defence

Despite differences, summit has set stage for cooperation: Indian officials

New Delhi: After a week of packed halls, high-level diplomacy and billion-dollar pitches, several national delegations at the India AI Impact Summit will issue a joint statement on how the world should handle artificial intelligence Saturday, a day later than planned, as the govt works to widen global consensus on the document.The declaration, already backed by over 70 countries, comes amid companies committing to invest more than $250 billion in the country and reinforced India's push to shape global AI agenda for the Global South. Union minister for electronics and IT Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Friday there was ""huge consensus"", with discussions continuing. ""The declaration and its contours will be shared transparently tomorrow,"" he said, adding that India hoped the final signatory count would cross 80.Countries had failed to reach a consensus at the last summit in Paris but there appears to be greater synergy on several issues, among govts and companies.Substantive disagreements also surfaced on global governance. While the UN announced formation of an independent scientific panel on AI, the US delegation warned against centralised global control of generative AI, underlining the difficulty of forging binding global rules.Despite differing views, Indian officials said the summit had laid the groundwork for collaboration rather than confrontation. ""This is about real action, not just paper,"" Vaishnaw said, pointing to bilateral discussions, industry commitments and plans for an expanded AI Mission 2.0.Ashwini Vaishnaw said the scale and diversity of participation underlined global confidence in India's approach. ""World has confidence in India's role in the new AI age. That is very important for all of us,"" he said.According to the minister, over five lakh visitors have attended the summit and the expo, with ""practically every major AI player in the world"" participating.A key highlight, Vaishnaw said, was the acceptance of PM Modi's vision of ""ManavAI"" - AI of the humans, by the humans, for the humans - which places responsible and ethical use of AI at the centre. ""For the first time, discussion on ethical and responsible AI has been brought to the forefront in such a meaningful way,"" he said.Investment commitments also featured prominently. Vaishnaw said infrastructure-related pledges linked to AI, data centres and allied technologies had already crossed $250 billion, while around $20 billion in deep-tech venture investments had been completed. ""Numbers are important, but what is more important is the trust the world has shown in India,"" he said.","India AI Impact Summit will issue a joint statement on how the world should handle artificial intelligence Saturday.

'Global South To Decide Next World Order': Stubb And Rubio Signal Shift, Echoe India's World View

New Delhi: India has emerged as a ""shining beacon"" among Global South nations on AI, but the real challenge now is moving beyond pilots to large-scale, trusted deployment, according to the 'Playbook for National AI Strategy and Implementation' released by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).Based on work across India, Egypt, Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines, the report argues there is no single lever to accelerate AI adoption. Countries instead need a tightly coordinated ecosystem spanning computing, funding, skills, governance and institutional accountability.Saibal Chakraborty, who leads BCG India's tech and digital advantage practice, said India already has a structural edge. ""India has solved a large part of the hard infrastructure and digital public infrastructure problem. Aadhaar, UPI and data centres make it much easier to build AI applications at scale,"" he said. The playbook cites the IndiaAI Mission's facilitation of over 38,000 GPUs, made available at under Rs 60 per hour after centralised govt negotiations with vendors.However, the report flags a financing gap. While India has more than 120 unicorns, private capital largely avoids ""socially sensitive sectors like climate, education and rural solutions"". To address this, the playbook backs govt-led fund-of-funds models for public interest AI use cases.On skills, Chakraborty said scaling artificial intelligence requires senior leadership trust and oversight. Without CEO-level confidence, AI risks remaining stuck in ""cool pilots"" despite strong national ambition","India has emerged as a ""shining beacon"" among Global South nations on AI.

He described ""democratic AI"" as systems that are ""open, transparent, follow the rule of law"" and function as ""a tool for an individual to scale their capabilities, to learn, think, build, create, produce."" In contrast, AI developed in ""autocratic systems"" is ""designed to enhance the central authority, the authoritarian govt,"" rather than empower individuals.Governance, he suggested, is central to the race. Citing Russian President Vladimir Putin's remark that whoever leads in AI will ""win the world,"" Lehane argued that the values embedded in AI systems will shape the global order that emerges.On oversight, he said new rules are inevitable for a general purpose technology. AI safety institutes are emerging in the US and the UK, with India exploring a similar approach.Asked whether OpenAI would support audits of its advanced systems, Lehane said the company is subject to transparency requirements under safety frameworks in US states such as California and New York and works with safety institutes in the US and UK.He drew a distinction between transparency and disclosure of proprietary information, noting concerns about protecting intellectual property. Baseline safety standards can be developed collectively, he said, but countries should retain the ability to deploy AI consistent with societal contexts.

Beyond Oil: How India & US Are Securing the Future of AI Chips

India's talent deep enough to rival challengers: Gor

New Delhi: India formally joined Friday Pax Silica - the US flagship AI and supply chain security initiative that is widely perceived as an antidote to China's influence over critical technologies. Welcoming India, US ambassador Sergio Gor said that the coalition, which comprises some of Washington's closest allies and trusted partners as members, was about ""whether free societies would control the commanding heights of the global economy"" and would define the 21st century economic and technological order.MeitY secretary S Krishnan, US undersecretary for economic growth Jacob Helberg and Gor also signed, apart from the Pax Silica Declaration, a supplementary joint statement that said this partnership signalled a new era in which the world's oldest and largest democracies stood aligned not only in defence of liberty, but in the purposeful pursuit of prosperity and harmony for their peoples.Also read | India-US sign Pax Silica Declaration: New Delhi’s entry ‘strategic and essential’ Together, the two aspire to build an AI future that serves their citizens, strengthens their economies and societies, and refle-cts their shared values of freedom, openness, and the rule of law,"" the statement said.Gor's remarks were more revealing as he said Pax Silica was a coalition of capabilities that replaced coercive dependencies with a positive sum alliance of trusted industrial bases. ""India's entry into Pax Silica isn't just symbolic, it's strategic, it's essential.India is a nation with deep talent, deep enough to rival challengers,"" said Gor, who invited India to join the initiative that now has 11 members, on his first day in office last month.For India, Pax Silica is another significant step forward towards the normalisation of the relationship with the US after both sides finalised the framework for an interim trade agreement this month.According to Gor, India brings strength to the coalition as its engineering depth and critical mineral processing capacity offered critical capabilities to the partnership. ""Peace doesn't come from hoping adversaries will play fair. We all know they won't. Peace comes through strength. India understands this. India understands strong borders. India understands this part of the world. That strength, that sovereignty, is exactly what Pax Silica amplifies,"" said the US ambassador, adding discussions with India were on about building supply chains that would not be held hostage.The Pax Silica Declaration seeks efforts to reduce excessive dependencies and forge new connections with reliable partners and suppliers committed to fair market practices, while acknowledging the importance of addressing non-market practices that undermine innovation and fair competition.Welcoming India to ""co-found"" the future, Gor also said the initiative was about whether innovation happens in Bengaluru and Silicon Valley or in surveillance states that use technology to monitor and control their people. ""We choose freedom. We cho-ose partnership. We choose strength. And today, with India's entry into Pax Silica, we choose to win,"" said Gor.The joint statement prioritised economic security, pro-innovation regulation, stronger physical AI stack and free enterprise saying that the two sides shared the belief that a significant risk facing the free world was not advancement of AI, but the failure to lead it.Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw stressed that cooperation under Pax Silica would further deepen engagement on critical technologies and supply chain resilience under the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.""Technology cooperation remains one of the central pillars of the India-US Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.

'AI Will Create More Than It Destroys': Microsoft India Chief Puneet Chandok Predicts 3-Year Rise

New Delhi: The increasing use of AI language models for information seeking and agentic commerce has put the existing internet business model under pressure, as these companies are crushing publishers, content creators, and small businesses, according to Matthew Prince, chief executive of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare.Explaining the problem, he said that for the past decade, individuals and creators - including researchers and small businesses - have sold subscriptions or shown ads to compensate for their work. But, now AI models scrape and regurgitate information, removing direct interaction between creators and users. ""Google was a great patron, but now things have changed.""For the last 10 years, for every two pages that Google scraped on the internet, they sent back one human visitor. Today, for every 30 pages, they send just one. It has become 15 times harder to get traffic from a Google search. Microsoft performs more poorly - it sends 70 to one. If we look at the pure AI companies, OpenAI takes 37,000 pages from the internet for every one visitor it sends back. In Anthropic's case, it's half a million pages,"" he said.Cloudflare handles almost 20% of internet traffic and works with all foundational model providers. ""The human eyeball traffic, which is the current currency of the internet, is going away. It is never going to return in the same way. We are getting more of our answers from AI than from original sources. And so we have to figure out a new way to compensate creators,"" he said. Prince said the world needs to figure out a new business model for the internet and develop a new rewards system beyond traffic.","Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince says AI models are crushing publishers, content creators, and small businesses.

'India Well Positioned To Lead The World In AI': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman At AI Impact Summit

New Delhi: For years, Europe watched its best AI researchers migrate to the US. India has faced the same challenge - a steady bleeding of top engineering and computer science talent to Silicon Valley. Reversing this flow is central to the global AI race, says Arthur Mensch, co-founder and CEO of French startup Mistral AI. ""Like Europe, India was bleeding talent to the US,"" Mensch said in an interview with TOI. ""The more talent you retain and create value locally, the better.""Founded in 2023 by Mensch, Guillaume Lample and Timothee Lacroix, Mistral AI was created to challenge the opaque, closed nature of ""big AI"" and make frontier models more accessible through open architectures. In just three years, the company has scaled rapidly - reaching a $400 million revenue run rate and targeting over $1 billion in revenue soon. As of last year, it was valued at $14 billion.But for Mensch, the AI race is not just commercial. It is structural - and geopolitical. With Europe heavily reliant on overseas digital infrastructure, particularly US hyperscalers, Mistral has chosen to build its own capabilities.""We don't position ourselves as a sovereign alternative. We position ourselves as a global competitor in the AI race,"" he said. ""But tactically, to have capacity you fully control, you need infrastructure - the servers that run the technology. ""About 60% of Mistral's business comes from Europe and 40% from the rest of the world. Some customers opt for its platform precisely because it can be deployed on their own infrastructure, reducing dependence on hyperscalers.Sovereign AI, he believes, is both a strategic and political necessity. As AI begins to run large parts of the global economy, govts and defence systems cannot risk external control. For businesses, over-dependence weakens negotiating leverage and continuity.India, with one of the world's largest developer pools, has a similar inflection point. ""We've brought many European researchers back to Europe. India has a unique opportunity to do the same. Universities here produce excellent AI and computer science talent. The focus should be on ensuring they innovate and build value here,"" Mensch said. Mistral is currently building commercial partnerships in India, with a local technology centre a possible next step.While rivals such as OpenAI and Anthropic explore IPO paths, Mensch said a listing is ""down the road."" Profitability and global scale would be prerequisites.Mensch argues that much of enterprise AI adoption has stumbled because companies treated GenAI as a collection of tools rather than a platform shift. Early chatbot deployments focused on small productivity gains. ""That doesn't change the bottomline,"" he said. Instead, Mistral focuses on high-ROI use cases that address major sources of business friction.At the core of its strategy is open source. ""If you have access to model parameters, you can deploy wherever you want - including local infrastructure,"" Mensch said. Open models also allow customisation. ""Running a business should not mean over-dependence on a single service provider. I've said it multiple times - Europe cannot become an AI colony of the US.""","'India Well Positioned To Lead The World In AI': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman at AI Impact Summit.

Mamata Banerjee vs Election Commission: Supreme Court Orders Judicial Oversight in Bengal SIR

New Delhi: The Union home ministry on Friday constituted a second empowered committee for West Bengal to fast-track the processing of citizenship requests received under Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA).CAA provides for grant of citizenship to immigra-nts from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh belonging to their six minority faiths - Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi - who entered India before Dec 31, 2014, fearing religious persecution in their home countries.In a gazette notification issued on Friday, the home ministry said West Bengal's new empowered committee - which takes the final call on citizenship applications forwarded by the district-level committee after verification of documents - shall be headed by the deputy registrar general, directorate of census operations of the state.The original empowered committee - set up in accordance with a notification issued by MHA in March 2024 and headed by director, census operations of West Bengal - will continue to be in existence. The new empowered committee, central govt sources told TOI, has been set up as the volume of applications under CAA in the state has increased. Sharing of work is expected to compress the processing time.West Bengal has a significant number of Hindu immigrants, such as those belonging to the Matua community.BJP has been making a major outreach to them to strengthen its electoral prospects in the state.The new empowered committee on CAA allows certain members of the empowered committee as notified on March 11, 2024 - like the jurisdictional foreigners regional registration officer and state informatics officer - to nominate an officer each, not below the rank of under secretary. Other members like an officer of the subsidiary intelligence bureau and postmaster general or a postal officer nominated by him remain the same.Like the original empowered committee, the new panel shall include a representative from the office of West Bengal principal secretary (home) or additional chief secretary (home) and a representative of the jurisdictional divisional railway manager as invitees.","CAA provides for grant of citizenship to immigra-nts from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

New Delhi: A six-year-old girl went missing in 2018. She was last seen with her stepfather. When he was arrested eight days later, he led police to the place where her charred remains were found. Supreme Court found this evidence weak and acquitted him of the murder charge.Finding no other evidence to link the man to the murder except that he was the last person to be seen with the child according to a neighbour and he was the one to lead the police to the victim's bones, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and K Vinod Chandran acquitted him, saying the investigation was botched and left many questions unanswered. ""In the present case, the murder of a six-year-old girl went unpunished and her stepfather was incarcerated on mere conjecture,"" SC said.In the case from Chhattisgarh, what tilted the scales towards the stepfather, Rohit Jangde, was the peculiarity of the interpretation by SC in earlier judgments on the admissibility of a statement by an accused that leads to discovery of fact relating to the crime - in this case, the recovery of the girl's body.More than 65 years ago, SC had ruled that the statement of an accused leading to discovery of facts relating to the crime would be admissible evidence only when it had been made in custody.Justices Kumar and Chandran also relied on a similar interpretation used in a nearly 100-year-old ruling by Calcutta HC.Interestingly in the 1931 judgment, the then CJ of Calcutta HC had expressed anguish that the law permitted reliance on a statement made to police that led to discovery of fact only when the person was in police custody and had termed it absurd, but left it to the legislature to make suitable amends. Relying on these decades-old judgments, SC termed weak the telltale evidence incriminating Jangde.Justice Chandran said even if the evidence was accepted, it would not by itself nail the guilt on the stepfather. ""The knowledge of the accused, which led to the detection of the bone remnants though not acceptable under Section 27 would all the same be acceptable evidence under Section 8, which by itself is a weak piece of evidence. The evidence under Section 8 can only offer corroboration and cannot by itself result in a conviction,"" he said.Acquitting the accused, the bench said, ""The long gap when there was no complaint made about the missing child and the factum of none having questioned the accused, despite the family and police having been told that she went with the accused, tilts the scales in favour of the accused... Pertinent also is that since the corpus delicti was not recovered, there is no time of death specified. We are hence unable to uphold the conviction of the accused, and he has to be necessarily given the benefit of doubt. ""","A six-year-old girl went missing in 2018. She was last seen with her stepfather. When he was arrested eight days later, he led police to the place where her charred remains were found. Supreme Court found this evidence weak and acquitted him of the murder charge.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128624811,imgsize-365742,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court-refuses-to-entertain-pil-on-babur-or-babri-masjid.jpg"

The court has also clearly stated that it is written in the Constitution of India that one can build a mosque; it is a right,” he said.On January 2, Kabir informed about the construction of a hospital and a university, along with the Babri Masjid. “A Babri Masjid will be built here, a hospital will be built, a university will be built, and facilities will be created for the benefit of the people,” Kabir said at an event in Murshidabad.",The plea said that any mosque in the name of Babur or Babri Masjid must not be constructed in any place in India on the ground that Mughal ruler Babar was an anti-Hindu invader.

The ministry has listed almost two dozen requirements under the four labour codes: the Code on Wages, the Code on Social Security, the Industrial Relations Code and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code.A senior government official told ET that although most of the requirements existed under the earlier labour framework, the newly prepared handbook is meant to remove ambiguity and clearly spell out employer responsibilities during the transition. ""It will act as a to-do list for establishments to ensure that no evasion on compliances happens for lack of clarity due to transition from the old labour laws to the new labour codes,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.The four labour codes came into force on November 21, 2025, replacing 29 central labour laws with a unified structure.Under the new system, employers must complete seven foundational compliances from the time a business is set up or a new worker joins. Beyond this, establishments are also required to meet four monthly and five annual compliance obligations. The framework further specifies six event-related compliances that become applicable in situations such as workplace accidents, disease outbreaks, employee exits, maternity benefit cases, large-scale layoffs, and lockouts or strikes within factory premises.Officials indicated that the ministry is in the final phase of finalising central rules under the four codes. The government’s intent is to ensure employers begin complying with statutory requirements early, thereby reducing the scope for litigation later.Among the basic obligations are registering the establishment and securing required licences, maintaining key records on attendance, wages, deductions and overtime, fixing wage periods, ensuring minimum workplace safety standards, enrolling eligible workers for social security, and forming work committees along with grievance redressal bodies.Every month, employers must ensure timely wage payments, deposit social security contributions with the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation and the Employees' State Insurance Corporation, and provide wage slips to workers.On an annual basis, establishments are required to file a unified return, revise minimum wages where applicable, renew licences, carry out safety audits, and conduct annual health check-ups for specified employees aged 40 years and above.In event-based scenarios, employers must report workplace accidents or disease occurrences within 24 to 72 hours, clear final dues within two days and gratuity within 30 days, obtain government approval for layoffs, retrenchment or closure in units employing more than 300 workers, extend maternity benefits where applicable, and issue lockout notices to workers and the relevant authority.","The four labour codes came into force on November 21, 2025, replacing 29 central labour laws with a unified structure.

Senior staff are calling the tools ""broken slop generators""

CEO Julie Sweet had already warned: Adapt to AI or leave

Accenture has started tying promotion eligibility to AI tool usage, telling senior managers and associate directors that advancing to leadership roles will require demonstrating ""regular adoption"" of its artificial intelligence platforms. The move follows CEO Julie Sweet's earlier warning that employees unable to adapt to AI would be ""exited"" from the company — and it appears HR is now putting that stance into formal practice. The consulting giant has also begun tracking individual weekly logins to its AI tools for some senior staff, making it one of the more aggressive internal AI mandates seen at a major professional services firm.According to an internal email seen by the Financial Times, ""use of our key tools will be a visible input to talent discussions."" The policy is set to factor into the company's summer promotion decisions, with Accenture's AI Refinery among the tools being monitored.The reaction internally has been less than enthusiastic. Two people familiar with the changes told the FT they considered some of the tools to be ""broken slop generators,"" and one said they would ""quit immediately"" if the rule directly affected them. Staff in 12 European countries and those working on US federal government contracts are exempt from the new policy.The pushback isn't entirely surprising. Executives at three Big Four firms independently told the FT that getting senior managers and partners to adopt AI has proven far harder than with junior staff. Older, more senior professionals tend to be less comfortable with new technology and more attached to how they've always worked.Julie Sweet has made the company's position clear. She previously told investors that Accenture would ""exit"" employees for whom reskilling on AI wasn't a viable path—and the latest promotion criteria appear to be the formal follow-through on that stance.The firm says it has trained 550,000 of its roughly 780,000 employees in generative AI and spends around $1 billion annually on learning and development. It also recently announced partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic.Still, the urgency makes sense given the context. Accenture's share price has dropped roughly 42% over the past year, and the company is betting heavily that its AI-first repositioning—including rebranding its workforce as ""reinventors""—will reverse that slide.","Accenture is tying senior staff promotions to AI tool usage.

Asha Sharma named new CEO of Microsoft Gaming: Read Satya Nadella’s message to staff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/asha-sharma-named-new-ceo-of-microsoft-gaming-read-satya-nadellas-message-to-staff/articleshow/128634558.cms,"Read Satya Nadella’s message to Microsoft staff

Gaming has been part of Microsoft from the start. Flight Simulator shipped before Windows, and you can practically ray‑trace a line from DirectX in the ’90s to the accelerated‑compute era we’re in today.

As we celebrate Xbox’s 25th year, the opportunity and innovation agenda in front of us is expansive. Today we reach over 500 million monthly active users, are a top publisher across all platforms, and continue to innovate across gaming hardware, content, and community, in service of creators and players everywhere.

I am long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition, and as we look ahead, I’m excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me. Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at Meta, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems. She brings deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth.

Matt Booty will become Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer, reporting to Asha. Matt’s career reflects a lifelong commitment to games and to the people who make them. Under his leadership, Microsoft Gaming has grown to span nearly 40 studios across Xbox, Bethesda, Activision Blizzard, and King, which are home to beloved franchises including Halo, The Elder Scrolls, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Candy Crush, and Fallout.

Together, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward. Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we’ve been talking about succession planning. I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it. He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms. I’ve long admired Phil’s unwavering commitment to players, creators, and his team, and I am personally grateful for his leadership and counsel. He will continue working closely with Asha to ensure a smooth transition.

We have extraordinary creative talent across our studios and a global platform that is second to none. I’m excited for how we will capture the opportunity ahead and define what comes next, while staying grounded in what players and creators value.

Please join me in congratulating Asha and Matt on their new roles, and in thanking Phil for everything he has done for Microsoft and for our industry.

Phil Spencer, Microsoft Gaming CEO is retiring. The software giant has named another Microsoft executive Asha Sharma as the new Vice President and CEO of Microsoft Gaming. Announcing the update, CEO Satya Nadella has sent an email to Microsoft staff where he said: “I’m excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me”. “Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at Meta, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems,” Nadella said.In the message, Satya Nadella also praised outgoing Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer.

Mark Zuckerberg: Product managers at Meta are rebranding themselves after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the earnings call that AI will…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/product-managers-at-meta-are-rebranding-themselves-after-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-said-in-the-earnings-call-that-ai-will/articleshow/128591878.cms,"Meta employees are embracing the title ""AI Builder,"" reflecting a significant shift in how products are developed. This change, highlighted by a product manager's new focus on AI-driven creation, aligns with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision of AI dramatically altering work. Companies like LinkedIn are also redefining roles, empowering individuals to code, design, and manage products with AI assistance.

Zuckerberg set the tone on the earnings call

LinkedIn, Google are making similar moves

Something is shifting at Meta, and it's not just the org chart. Some product managers at the company have started calling themselves ""AI builders""—a quiet but telling sign of how AI coding tools are beginning to blur the lines between who plans products and who actually builds them. It's a small label change, but it points to something bigger: the traditional PM role, long defined by roadmaps and stakeholder meetings, is quietly being rebuilt from scratch.Jeremie Guedj, a Meta product manager with over a decade of experience, announced the change on LinkedIn last week. ""I still can't believe I'm writing this: as of today, my full-time job at Meta is AI Builder,"" he wrote. His official title in Meta's internal systems hasn't changed, but his day-to-day work is now entirely focused on building with AI on what he calls an ""AI-native team."" At least three other Meta employees—a mix of product managers and engineers—also use the term in their LinkedIn bios, as first reported by Business Insider.The shift tracks with what Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the company's Q4 2025 earnings call in January. ""We're elevating individual contributors and flattening teams,"" he said, adding that ""projects that used to require big teams"" are now being pulled off by a single person armed with the right AI tools.He called 2026 ""the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work"" inside Meta.Guedj's new role looks a lot like what that vision looks like in practice—a team where ""humans and AI agents work together, synchronously and asynchronously,"" as he put it.Meta isn't alone here. LinkedIn recently scrapped its associate product manager program and replaced it with an ""associate product builder"" track, explicitly pushing new hires to code, design, and manage products all at once. At Google, at least one product manager told Business Insider that they've been encouraging designers and PMs on their team to ""blur roles a bit.""""AI builder"" isn't an official Meta designation—yet. But as Guedj put it: ""Building has always been my passion. AI gave me the ability to turn ideas into real, working apps. That changed everything.""","Product managers at Meta are calling themselves ""AI builders"" It's a small label change, but it points to something bigger.

CHURACHANDPURVungzagin Valte, a sitting BJP MLA from Manipur’s Thanlon who was brutally assaulted by a mob in Imphal on 4 May 2023, died at 2:19pm at Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon on Saturday after prolonged treatment. He was 61.He is reported to be the first elected representative to lose his life in the communal violence. He is survived by his wife Lalneihmawi, two sons, one daughter, and eight grandchildren.Valte had remained in critical condition since the attack, undergoing months of intensive care and multiple major surgeries, including extended treatment at Apollo Hospital in Delhi for about one-and-a-half years before returning to Churachandpur. On Feb 7, his health suddenly worsened due to pulmonary edema. He was rushed to the district hospital and, on doctors’ advice, air-lifted to Delhi the next day via an air ambulance from Bir Tikendrajit International Airport, Imphal.He was admitted to Medanta Hospital and, after roughly 13 days of intensive treatment, died this evening. He is reported to be the first elected representative to lose his life in the communal violence that began in May 2023.A three-time MLA from Thanlon, Valte was a prominent Kuki-Zo leader known for advocating hill-district tribal interests in Manipur. He first entered the state assembly as a Congress member before switching to BJP and winning the 2022 election with 4,863 votes, a margin of 751 over his nearest rival.On May 4 2023, while returning from a meeting with then CM N Biren Singh in Imphal, Valte’s convoy was ambushed by a mob. He suffered a severe head injury and remained wheelchair-bound. His driver, Thangjoulal, died two days later at RIMS.Throughout his recovery, Valte’s statements alternated between calls for a united Manipur and demands for greater autonomy for the Kuki-Zomi-Hmar people, amid continuing ethnic tensions.The village authorities of Mualnuam, Valte’s birthplace, along with BJP 56 Thanlon Assembly Kendra, have requested state BJP leaders to transport his body via Mizoram so that people in his constituency can pay their last respects before the final rites.The plea to transport his body through Mizoram was made as communication between hill and valley districts is snapped at the moment.From a modest childhood in Mualnuam village in Manipur’s Churachandpur district to three consecutive terms as MLA and a cabinet minister, Valte will be remembered as a banker-turned-leader who lit up the hills by bringing electricity to as many 58 villages.Born on April 3, 1964, he overcame poverty to earn a BA degree and began his career as a research investigator in the state planning department. He later joined the banking sector, serving over two decades in United Bank of India and State Bank of India, where he won multiple national awards, including the coveted SBI Chairman’s Club membership. In 2021, he resigned as chief manager to dedicate himself fully to public service.His political career took off in 2012 when he was elected MLA from Thanlon. He was re-elected in 2017 and 2022 on a BJP ticket. In 2020, he was inducted as cabinet minister for tribal affairs & hills, GAD, and transport in BJP’s first govt in Manipur led by Biren Singh.His tenure was marked by electrification of 58 villages, new healthcare facilities, upgraded schools, and road connectivity to 23 previously isolated villages. He also initiatedas a state holiday, underscoring his commitment to cultural identity.","Vungzagin Valte, a sitting BJP MLA from Manipur’s Thanlon who was brutally assaulted by a mob in Imphal on 4 May 2023, died at 2:19pm on Saturday.

KOLKATA: An exhibition of works by foreign artists who travelled to India between the Uprising of 1857 and Independence in 1947 will be inaugurated at the Alipore Museum in Kolkata on Feb 28 2026, showcasing a late phase of Orientalist art that offered more intimate glimpses of Indian life, often at street level unlike artists in the late 18th and early 19th centuries who sought grand monuments and vast landscapes. The exhibition will continue till May 2.Titled Destination India, the exhibition by DAG will feature artists from Germany, Holland, Denmark, France, America and Japan, besides Britain. It presented painters and printmakers working in a fast-changing India, when images were transmitted as picture postcards from 1880 onwards and photography became the dominant medium of documentation.The exhibition will include works of Edward Lear, who toured India for over a year between Nov 1873 and Jan 1875. Other Orientalist artists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries whose works will feature in the exhibition include William Simpson, Olinto Ghilardi, Marius Bauer, Erich Kips and Hugo Pederson. It will also include artists from further afield such as Edwin Lord Weeks from America and Hiroshi Yoshida from Japan.“When considering British and other European representations of India, the focus is often on the pioneers.The problem with this traditional trajectory is that it overlooks the many interesting artists who visited India—from England and from other European countries—in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These were conventional artists working in oil and watercolour, and various print media, like the earlier pioneers. Some—like Mortimer Menpes and Walter Crane— produced illustrated books, just as James Prinsep and Robert Grindlay had almost a century earlier. They came to India with a different aesthetic sensibility and with different interests. In their works, we find an India—if we can put it this way—that we do not just see, but that we can hear and smell,” said DAG chief executive officer and MD Ashish Anand.Destination India will present scenes such as the daily routine of an Indian bazaar or a haveli, and ordinary people in the streets. It described a shift towards a more intimate and animated version of the picturesque, including a riverside ghat depicted not only for crumbling buildings but also for gaily dressed people, and framed the exhibition as a change in perception and engagement with a land becoming increasingly intertwined with the Western world.The selection brings together people and places of India as seen through the eyes of nearly 40 artists from many countries. New technology did not end older forms of artistic production but encouraged artists in new directions, and the exhibition brought artworks back on display in the subcontinent, many of them almost a century after they were made.It investigated the European artist’s perspective, influenced by romanticism and marred by prejudice, while describing it as important to understanding the shaping of Indian.""Destination India reveals a personal and intimate engagement with India—a tapestry of people and places seen through the eyes of those who found both beauty and meaning in the country’s cultural and social fabric during a time of profound change,"" said Alipore Museum director Jayanta Sengupta.","Destination India will feature artists from Germany, Holland, Denmark, France, America and Japan, besides Britain.

BENGALURU: Will a Vande Bharat ride between Bengaluru and Goa be a possibility? South Western Railway (SWR), Southern Railway and Konkan Railway Corporation Limited (KRCL) approached the railway board earlier this month with a proposal for such a train between Yeshwantpur and Madgaon.According to the proposal accessed by TOI , the train will run six days a week, departing from Yeshwantpur at 6.05am. It will run for more than 12 hours before reaching Madgaon in Goa by 7.5pm.Between the stations, there will be four stoppages — Hassan, Sakleshpur, Subrahmanya Road and Padil.For comparison, Yeswanthpur-Vasco da Gama Express takes nearly 15 hours to cover 700km.While a detailed tentative timetable was proposed, it could be subject to changes, and the railway board has asked the zones to consider starting the train after 6.30am.Despite KSR Bengaluru being the most preferred station in the city, SWR officials pointed to a lack of maintenance slots there.Due to the long distance between the terminal stations, the service will require two Vande Bharat rakes to run simultaneously.However, the railway board expects the train to run at an average speed of less than 50 kmph. In the ghat sections, it could become further limited to 30 kmph.

"India’s coasts sinking up to 44 mm/year, 8.5 million people in high-subsidence zones",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/indias-coasts-sinking-up-to-44-mm/year-8-5-million-people-in-high-subsidence-zones/articleshow/128618326.cms,"Political Clash on US Trade Deal, FTAs Progress, IT Rules Rollout & More





DEHRADUN: Large stretches of India's 7,500-km coastline are sinking, often rapidly, and in many places at rates that rival or exceed global sea-level rise, as per a new study by researchers from the University of Rhode Island, US.The study, the first comprehensive satellite-based assessment of coastal land subsidence along India's shoreline, recorded a maximum subsidence rate of 44mm per year in localised hotspots, while rates elsewhere ranged from a few millimetres to over 20mm annually.Titled ‘Vertical Land Motion and Human Exposure Across India's Coastal Regions', the study analysed eight years (2016–2024) of Sentinel-1 satellite radar data to measure vertical land motion along India's coastline, focusing on areas within a 100-km coastal buffer zone. It was authored by Quantao Zhu, Pei-Chin Wu, and Meng (Matt) Wei of the Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island, along with lead data scientist Estelle Chaussard of FM Global's research division, US.More than 200 million people live within 100 km of India's coast. Of the 207.4 million residents in this coastal belt, 27.1 million (13.1%) live in districts subsiding faster than 2 mm per year. About 8.5 million (4.1%) live in areas sinking more than 5 mm per year, while 3.4 million (1.6%) face severe subsidence exceeding 10 mm per year.Using nearly 4,900 radar interferograms and over 39 million measurement points, the researchers identified major subsidence hotspots in cities including Ahmedabad, Chennai, Amaravati, Kochi, Kakinada, and Kolkata. In Ahmedabad, more than half the metropolitan area is subsiding, with peak rates of up to 44mm per year. In Kolkata, widespread areas are sinking at less than 5mm per year, but localised hotspots reach 13mm per year.Chennai shows mostly localised subsidence under 5mm per year, with peaks up to 11mm per year. Kochi and Puducherry exhibit widespread sinking exceeding 6mm per year across much of their urban areas, with maximum rates of 21mm and 13mm per year, respectively. Kakinada shows rates between 5mm and 19mm per year, with localised maxima reaching 30mm per year.The five major deltas along India's east coast — the Ganges-Brahmaputra, Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery systems — also show extensive sinking, with rates locally reaching 20mm per year or more.Tide-gauge data indicates that sea levels near Kochi have risen much faster in recent years. Between 1940 and 2000, sea level rose at about 1.45mm per year. This increased to around 2.47mm per year between 2000 and 2016, but surged to more than 17mm per year between 2016 and 2025, pointing to a sharp acceleration in relative sea-level rise.Subsidence was mainly concentrated near population centres, found the study. While only 1.7% of coastal land was sinking faster than 5mm per year, 4.1% of the population was exposed to those rates and more than half of severely subsiding areas lay at elevations below 25m above sea level, the study found.On the causes, the study noted that subsidence can result from natural processes such as tectonic activity, glacial isostatic adjustment, and sediment compaction, as well as human-induced factors including surface water drainage, groundwater extraction, mining, and structural loading. However, the findings suggest groundwater extraction is likely the primary driver across much of India, while in delta regions, it reflects a combination of sediment compaction and groundwater withdrawal.The authors warned that conventional coastal risk assessments — which consider only climate-driven sea-level rise — may substantially underestimate future flood exposure. Accounting for land subsidence, they said, is no longer optional but essential for long-term resilience planning along India's coasts.",Study recorded a maximum subsidence rate of 44mm per year in localised hotspots.

Nissan Gravite





KOLKATA: Nissan Motor India (NMI) plans to ride an expanded portfolio of four cars by March 2027 to register a four-fold increase in domestic sales and 40% jump in exports a year later.Speaking to TOI during the unveil of seven-seater MPV Gravite in Kolkata, NMI national strategy officer and sales head Mudit Gupta said the company that had registered consolidated sales of 99,000 units in the domestic and international markets with its sole product, B-segment compact SUV Magnite, hoped to double the sales by March 2028. Incidentally, the consolidated sales (domestic sales of 28,097 units and exports of 71,230 units) registered in 2024-25 was its highest in seven years. In 2025-26, it is on course to register similar figures. Till Jan 2026, it had registered domestic sales of 17,662 units and exports of 69,769 units.""The next 12-13 months will be crucial for the company as we add three products — the Gravite whose deliveries will begin next month; the C-segment five-seater SUV Tekton that will be launched in just over a couple of months with deliveries slated from July and the launch of a C-segment seven-seater SUV in the first quarter of 2027.This will expand our presence from the Rs 6-12 lakh segment at present to over Rs 20 lakh. To increase our reach in the market, we are planning to increase our presence from 150 touchpoints at present to 250 touchpoints by next March,"" said Gupta.NMI hopes to register sales of 1 lakh units each in the domestic and export markets. The company currently exports Magnite and C-segment sedan Sunny to 65 countries. The Sunny is manufactured exclusively for exports.A company spokesperson said both the Tekton and its seven-seater iteration would be exported globally under Nissan's ‘One Car, One World’ philosophy.The new portfolio will also enable Nissan to be on par with alliance partner Renault. While the Nissan Magnite is based on the same vehicle as the Renault Kiger, the newly introduced Nissan Gravite is based on Renault Triber. The Nissan Tekton will be based on the recently unveiled Renault Duster while the seven seater vehicles will also be based on the same vehicles.",Nissan hopes to register sales of 1 lakh units each in the domestic and export markets.

KALYAN: Commuters along the congested Kalyan–Shilphata corridor can soon expect Metro connectivity, with the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) announcing the extension of Mumbai Metro Line 12 under a new project, Metro Line 12A. The move is being seen as a significant step towards improving transport links between Kalyan-Dombivli, Navi Mumbai, Thane, and Mumbai.The extension, cleared with an administrative approval of Rs 8,414.53 crore, was announced under the guidance of Maharashtra deputy chief minister and urban development minister Eknath Shinde The development comes alongside MMRDA's budgetary allocation of nearly Rs 5,000 crore for multiple ongoing infrastructure projects across the Kalyan Lok Sabha constituency.Following the announcement, MP Shrikant Shinde on Friday conducted an extensive inspection of works in progress, accompanied by senior MMRDA, KDMC officials and project contractors.Projects reviewed during the visit included Metro Line 12 (Kalyan–Taloja), Mumbai Metro Line 5, elevated flyovers, and key phases of the ring road network aimed at reducing traffic congestion and strengthening regional mobility.""These projects are critical for transforming mobility in Kalyan-Dombivli and surrounding cities. Delays must be minimised so that citizens receive the benefits at the earliest,"" Shrikant Shinde said, directing authorities to accelerate execution and adhere to timelines.Shrikant Shinde stated that Metro Line 12A will run parallel to the Kalyan–Shilphata Road, one of the region's busiest and most traffic-prone stretches. The corridor will branch from Kalyan Phata, pass through Dahisar Mori, and merge with the existing Metro Line 12 near Khutari village before extending towards Taloja.""The extension of Metro Line 12 is a transformative decision. It will significantly benefit residents of extended Dombivli, Manpada, Katai Naka, Desai Naka, Padalegaon, Kalyan Phata, Gotheghar, Dahisar Mori, Dahisargaon, Kirawali village, Rohinjan, and Khutari village,"" the MP said. He added that the new alignment would help reduce vehicular pressure on Shilphata Road and improve travel times.The revised corridor will span 18.4 km, of which approximately 10.5 km is already under construction. The plan proposes 12 elevated stations.A key feature of the project is its proposed integration with Mumbai Metro Line 14, with common track and station sharing between Katai Naka and Kalyan Phata. The line will also connect to the Nilje depot and is expected to link with the upcoming National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited bullet train station at Thane, enhancing multimodal connectivity across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.","Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority announces extension of Mumbai Metro Line 12.

"Ulhasnagar general body rejects steep water tax hike, clears marginal increase",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thane/ulhasnagar-general-body-rejects-steep-water-tax-hike-clears-marginal-increase/articleshow/128633711.cms,"



ULHASNAGAR: The first general body meeting after the newly elected civic body assumed office turned stormy on Friday, with corporators across party lines opposing the administration’s proposal to double, and in some cases triple, the annual water tax. After a heated debate, the House unanimously approved a marginal increase while rejecting the steep hike.Municipal Commissioner Manisha Awhale had tabled a proposal recommending a substantial revision of water tax rates. The administration suggested raising the annual levy for RCC houses from Rs 3,600 to Rs 8,000, for sheet-roofed houses from Rs 1,800 to Rs 6,500, and for slum and hutment dwellings from Rs 1,200 to Rs 3,000.Officials also proposed higher charges for property reconstruction, increased built-up area, and other civic services, estimating an additional Rs 90.83 crore in annual revenue.The proposal drew sharp criticism, with corporators citing persistent complaints about contaminated and irregular water supply, leakages, and poor responsiveness by the water supply department.Newly elected members, including BJP corporators Sherry Lund and Kanchan Lund, Congress’ Anjali Salve, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi’s Vikas Kharat, and Savita Torane and Mayur Mayekar, described the water situation in their wards as “serious”.They urged the administration to ensure a clean and regular supply before imposing higher charges. “Provide safe drinking water first, then consider a hike,” several corporators said.Shinde Sena corporator Rajendra Singh Bhullar questioned the rise in MIDC’s water bill arrears, asking whether monthly payments had been made. His queries put the administration on the defensive, with Executive Engineer Ashok Ghule and Additional Commissioner Kishor Gavas facing scrutiny alongside the municipal commissioner.Adding to the disruptions, BJP corporator Sanjay Singh raised procedural objections, alleging that the meeting was “invalid” as elections to posts such as nominated corporators and committee chairpersons were yet to be held.In a bid to break the deadlock, Shiv Sena group leader Arun Ashan proposed a compromise. The House unanimously approved revised annual water tax rates of Rs 4,400 for RCC houses, Rs 2,400 for sheet-roofed houses, and Rs 1,500 for slum and hutment dwellings.The administration’s proposal for a steep hike was voted down, with corporators insisting that improvements in service delivery must precede any major increase in civic charges.","First general body meeting after newly elected civic body assumed office turned stormy on Friday.

CAG raises red flag: Lucknow Metro running on weak tracks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/cag-raises-red-flag-lucknow-metro-running-on-weak-tracks/articleshow/128666113.cms,"CAG audit report has revealed that Lucknow Metro tracks are weaker than prescribed Indian Railway standards.





LUCKNOW: Lucknow Metro is running on weak tracks than the prescribed norms. This has been flagged in the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) audit report which was tabled in the UP Assembly by state finance minister Suresh Khanna on Friday.The report raises concerns about the quality of rails being used in the Metro's rolling stock system, specifically regarding their hardness levels.CAG report said that inspection of the Lucknow Metro tracks by IIT-Kanpur revealed that the tracks were less strong than the required standards.The track strength in the depot was found between 229 to 242 BHN (Brinell Hardness Number), while on the main line it was between 291 to 308 BHN. These levels were much below the Indian Railway standards.According to IIT Kanpur, lower hardness means the rails may wear out faster. This can increase maintenance costs and reduce the lifespan of both rails and train wheels. If wheel hardness does not properly match rail hardness, wheels may deform over time, potentially affecting the stability and smooth movement of Metro trains, besides rasing concern for passenger safety.As per Indian Railway standards, Metro rails must meet strict hardness requirements to ensure durability and safety. Rails used in depot areas (HH 880 grade) should have a minimum hardness of 260 BHN (Brinell Hardness Number). While for main line tracks (HH 1080 grade), the required hardness range is between 340 and 390 BHN. Harder rails generally last longer and reduce wear and tear.","CAG report said that inspection of the Lucknow Metro tracks by IIT-Kanpur revealed that the tracks were less strong than the required standards.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
