NEW DELHI: Microsoft founder Bill Gates on Thursday pulled out of AI Impact Summit and not be delvering his keynote address.Originally, Gates was supposed to be one of the primary speakers at the event. However, Gates faced flak after his name appeared in portions of Epstein files released by the US justice department.In a post on X, the Gates Foundation said the organisation will be represented by Ankur Vora, who is president of the Africa and India offices.“After careful consideration, and to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit’s key priorities, Mr. Gates will not be delivering his keynote address. The Gates Foundation will be represented by Ankur Vora, President of Africa and India Offices, who will speak later today at the Summit,” the Gates Foundation said.“The Gates Foundation remains fully committed to our work in India to advance our shared health and development goals,” it added.Gates was featured among the tech moguls, industry leaders, policymakers, founders, and technologists listed as speakers on the official website of the AI Impact Summit, underway in the national capital from February 16–20.The clarification comes against the backdrop of recent allegations against Gates referencing documents linked to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in prison in 2019.Gates’s name appears in portions of documents released by the US Justice Department.In one note cited in the material, Epstein allegedly claimed he had helped Gates obtain drugs “to deal with consequences of sex with Russian girls.” Gates has categorically denied the allegations. In an interview with Nine News, he described them as “absolutely absurd and completely false.”In a separate NPR interview, Melinda French Gates said her former husband’s meetings with Epstein were among the factors that contributed to the end of their 27-year marriage.Earlier, government sources had said that Gates would attend the meeting. However, a spokesperson for his foundation contradicted this, saying, “Bill Gates is attending the AI Impact Summit. He will be delivering his keynote as scheduled.”The summit website on Tuesday, however, did not show his name among the key speakers.","Microsoft founder Bill Gates pulls out of AI Impact Summit and not be delvering his keynote address.

New Delhi: Given the proliferation of financial scams through ponzi schemes, Supreme Court has ruled that conning people of their hard-earned money falls in the category of heinous crimes and that the accused in such offences cannot claim benefit of the liberty-leaning principle of 'bail is the rule and jail the exception'.A bench of Justices Sanjay Kumar and K Vinod Chandran set aside an order of Allahabad HC that had granted bail to the main accused in a cheating-cum-forgery case - who absconded for a long period - on the grounds that his co-accused have been granted bail and it is a cheating case triable by a magistrate, thus categorising it as a non-heinous offence. ""We may note that the value of life and liberty of members of society is not limited only to their 'person', but would also extend to the quality of their life, including their economic well-being,"" said Justice Kumar.Justice Kumar wrote the judgment in the financial fraud case that raises the threshhold for economic offenders to get bail by putting them on a par with those charged with heinous crimes. ""In offences of a pecuniary nature, where innocent people are cheated of their hard-earned money by conmen, who make it their life's pursuit to exploit and feast upon the gullibility of others, the aforestated factors must necessarily be weighed while dealing with the alleged offenders' pleas for grant of bail,"" he said in the judgment.Referring to the accused person's activities of forging names and identity cards, and his intention to dupe and cheat people, the bench said this demonstrates that he is a career criminal and a menace to society.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu on Wednesday pitched for greater federalism, with the state assembly tabling the Justice Kurian Joseph Committee report on Centre-state relations that recommended diminished powers for the governor and a greater role for states in constitutional amendments.In Part-1 of the report, which runs into 387 pages, the three-member panel said for the appointment of state governors, Article 155 of the Constitution should be amended ""to bind the President to appoint one of the three names approved by a majority of the state assembly"". It recommended a non-renewable five-year term for governors and proposed they be barred from holding any further constitutional office except that of the President and the vice-president.CM MK Stalin called for constitutional amendments and structural reforms to decentralise powers and provide greater autonomy to states. ""How long should we remain the receiver and the Union the provider?"" he said.Governors should not hold office in a political party or any office of the executive, legislature or judiciary in the five years preceding appointment, the report said. It also sought amendments to impose timelines for gubernatorial and presidential action on bills, with deemed assent on expiry, citing the framework laid down by Supreme Court in April 2025.The committee recommended doing away with the governor's address at the start of an assembly session and divesting the governor of the statutory role of chancellor of state universities. ""Dissolution (of the legislative assembly) shall be ordered solely on ministerial advice,"" it suggested.The panel sought a larger say for states in elections, education, health, delimitation and GST. The report slammed the three-language formula and suggested the country shift from ""weak trilingualism to high-proficiency bilingualism"". It said India must abandon the ""one nation one language"" policy and urged Union govt to correct Census distortions by ending misclassification of 53 languages as dialects of Hindi.On territorial integrity, the panel said the consent of the affected state legislature should be obtained before the President recommends introducing a bill to create a new state, and that the same principle should apply to altering the area, boundaries or name of a state.The report said the ""one nation, one election"" proposal should be withdrawn as it violates the basic structure of the Constitution.

AI Impact Summit: Facing Backlash Over China-made Robo Dog, Galgotias University Told To Leave Event

NEW DELHI: IT secretary S Krishnan on Wednesday said that exhibitors at the AI Impact Summit must not display items that do not belong to them, as a controversy continued over a Chinese-made robotic dog showcased by Galgotias University.“Exhibitors must not display items that are not their,” Krishnan said, amid questions over the display of the robot at the summit venue in New Delhi, news agency PTI reported.The IT secretary said that the government wants only genuine work to be showcased at such platforms and stressed the need to avoid disputes over exhibits.“We want genuine and actual work to be reflected in the way that people exhibit in expos. The idea is not to sort of use this as an opportunity in any other fashion. We don't want the controversy surrounding the exhibits presented here. So I think it's essential that a code is followed there. Misinformation cannot be encouraged. So we don't want the controversy around this. I'm not getting into whether they are right or wrong. We just don't want the controversy.”The controversy erupted during the AI Impact Summit 2026 , held at Bharat Mandapam after a robotic dog exhibited by the university under the name “Orion” was identified as the Unitree Go2, a commercially available quadruped robot manufactured by Chinese firm Unitree Robotics and sold in India for around Rs 2–3 lakh.The summit, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is positioned as a flagship event to showcase India’s advancements in artificial intelligence. The display drew criticism as the machine was alleged to have been presented as an in-house innovation at an event focused on promoting domestic AI capabilities.Government sources earlier said that the university was asked to vacate its stall following the row, and its pavilion’s power supply was reportedly cut off after it was directed to leave the expo.In a press statement issued after being asked to vacate the premises, the university expressed regret over the confusion and said it arose because Professor Neha Singh, who was managing the stall, was unaware of the product’s technical origins.“We at Galgotias University wish to apologise profusely for the confusion created at the recent AI Summit. One of our representatives, manning the pavilion, was ill-informed. She was not aware of the technical origins of the product and in her enthusiasm of being on camera, gave factually incorrect information even though she was not authorised to speak to the press... Understanding the organisers’ sentiment we have vacated the premises,” the statement read.The issue escalated after Professor Singh, while presenting the robot to DD News, said, “We are the first private university investing more than 350 crore rupees in artificial intelligence… So Orion has been developed by the Center of Excellences and as you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes.” She also described the robot as capable of surveillance and monitoring tasks.Her remarks triggered scrutiny after observers recognised the machine as an off-the-shelf product sold globally by Unitree Robotics.In an earlier clarification, the university said it had neither built nor claimed to have built the robotic dog, and that its objective was to help students learn using globally available technologies.“Let us be clear - Galgotias has not built this robodog, neither have we claimed. But what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies right here in Bharat,” it said.Professor Singh later said the controversy stemmed from a lack of clarity in communication and that the university had introduced the robot to inspire students, not to claim manufacturing credit.",IT secretary S Krishnan said exhibitors at the AI Impact Summit must not display items that do not belong to them.

NEW DELHI: Indian naval cadets will now get dedicated “floating classrooms” at sea as the Indian Navy has launched ‘INS Krishna’, the first in a new series of indigenous three cadet training ships (CTS).Unlike earlier when training opportunities at sea were limited, these “dedicated floating classrooms and living labs” have been designed to provide cadets with hands-on experience in navigation, seamanship and watch-keeping in real-world sea conditions. The three ships, which will serve as the backbone of the Navy's sea training infrastructure for the next 30 years, will host trainees soon after they complete their basic training ashore.In keeping with the Naval traditions, Anupama Chauhan, wife of CDS General Anil Chauhan, launched INS Krishna in the presence of the CDS and senior officials of the armed forces and ship-builder Larsen & Toubro (L&T). INS Krishna (designated ‘Yard 18003)’, which was constructed at the L&T shipyard in Kattupalli near Chennai, is planned for formal delivery and operational availability to the Navy by year-end.The ships will also be used for training cadets from friendly foreign countries, enhancing India’s defence cooperation.In addition to training, these ships can be used for non-combatant evacuation operations, humanitarian aid and disaster relief, and search-and-rescue operations.Krishna can accommodate 20 officers, 150 sailors and 200 cadets simultaneously. It has three classrooms (70 cadets each), a dedicated training bridge, and a chart house. With a displacement of approximately 4,700 tonnes, it can attain a maximum speed of 20 knots with an endurance of 60 days at sea.","The Indian Navy has launched ‘INS Krishna’, the first in a new series of indigenous three cadet training ships (CTS) These “dedicated floating classrooms and living labs” have been designed to provide cadets with hands-on experience in navigation, seamanship and watch-keeping.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128523417,imgsize-91890,width-400,resizemode-4/krishna.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya on Wednesday informed the Bombay high court that he cannot specify when he will return to India as he is legally barred from leaving the United Kingdom.In a statement submitted through his counsel Amit Desai, Mallya said that he does not have an active Indian passport and is also restrained by court orders in England and Wales from travelling outside the UK.The submission came after a bench of Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad last week made it clear that it would not hear his plea challenging the order declaring him a fugitive economic offender unless he returns to India.The court had asked Mallya to clarify whether he intended to come back to the country.Mallya, who has been based in the UK since leaving India in March 2016, has filed two petitions before the high court, one challenging the order declaring him a fugitive economic offender and another questioning the constitutional validity of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act.In his statement read out in court, Mallya said that he cannot give a definite date for his return as his passport was revoked by the Indian government in 2016 and because courts in England and Wales have prohibited him from leaving the country.“Mallya is not permitted to leave or attempt to leave England and Wales or apply for or be in possession of any international travel document. In any event, the petitioner is unable to precisely state when he will return to India,” Desai read out from the statement.The senior counsel further argued that Mallya’s physical presence in India was not necessary for the court to hear his pleas against the fugitive tag and the provisions of the Act.“If he (Mallya) were to appear in India, then all these proceedings would be rendered irrelevant as the statute says that once the offender appears in the concerned court of law, then all these orders would be set aside,” Desai told the court.Mallya, 70, faces multiple cases of alleged fraud and money laundering linked to the default of loans amounting to several thousand crores. He was declared a Fugitive Economic Offender in January 2019 by a special court hearing cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.The high court has directed the Union government to file its reply to Mallya’s statement and posted the matter for further hearing next month.","Vijay Mallya tells Bombay high court that he cannot specify when he will return to India.

NEW DELHI: Galgotias University on Wednesday apologised after a controversy erupted over the display of a Chinese-made robotic dog at its stall during the AI Impact Summit expo at Bharat Mandapam. In the statement however, the university blamed the woman professor for the fiasco.The university issued a press statement after it was asked to vacate its pavilion at the summit. In the statement, it expressed regret over the confusion and said it arose because Professor Neha Singh, who was managing the stall, was unaware of the product’s technical origins.“We at Galgotias University, wish to apologise profusely for the confusion created at the recent AI Summit.

Power supply to the pavilion was also reportedly cut off after the university was directed to leave the expo.The AI Impact Summit 2026, inaugurated by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is a flagship event focused on promoting India’s advancements and capabilities in artificial intelligence.The controversy escalated after Professor Neha Singh, while presenting the robot earlier, told DD News, “We are the first private university investing more than 350 crore rupees in artificial intelligence and we have a dedicated data science and artificial intelligence block on the campus. So Orion has been developed by the Center of Excellences and as you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes.”“It's quite naughty also. It's quite naughty also and it can perform small tasks of surveillance, monitoring,” she added.Her remarks led to scrutiny after observers identified the robot as the Unitree Go2, a product sold globally by Unitree Robotics.In its first clarification issued after the row broke out, the university stated that it had neither built nor claimed to have built the robotic dog, emphasising that its focus was on student learning.“Let us be clear - Galgotias has not built this robodog, neither have we claimed. But what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies right here in Bharat. Innovation knows no borders. Learning should not either. We will continue to source the best technologies from across the world so our students can study them, challenge them, improve upon them—and ultimately create world-class solutions from India for the world. ”In a subsequent statement, the university said concerns about “propaganda” against it were misplaced.“We at Galgotias, faculty and students, are deeply pained by the propaganda campaign against our university. We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavour to make students learn AI programming and develop & deploy real world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing AI talent is need of an hour.”Professor Neha Singh also addressed the controversy, saying, “The controversy happened because things may not have been expressed clearly. I take accountability that perhaps I did not communicate it properly, as it was done with a lot of energy and enthusiasm and very quickly, so I may not have come across as eloquently as I usually do. Also, the intent may not have been properly understood. One important point is regarding the robot dog—we cannot claim that we manufactured it. I have told everyone that we introduced it to our students to inspire them to create something better on their own. Our university contributes to building future leaders by providing cutting-edge technologies in the field of AI, and it will continue to do so.”The issue also drew sharp reactions from the Opposition.The Congress party said on X: “The Modi government has made a laughing stock of India globally, with regard to AI. In the ongoing AI summit, Chinese robots are being displayed as our own. The Chinese media has mocked us. This is truly embarrassing for India. What is even more shameful is the fact that Modi’s minister Ashwini Vaishnaw is indulging in the same falsehood, promoting China's robots at the Indian summit.”“The Modi Government has caused irreparable damage to the image of the country - they have reduced AI to a joke - a field in which we could be world leaders given our data power,” it added.Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi described the summit as a “disorganised PR spectacle.” In a post on X, he said, “Instead of leveraging India's talent and data, the AI summit is a disorganised PR spectacle - Indian data up for sale, Chinese products showcased.”","Galgotias University apologises after controversy over display of Chinese-made robotic dog at its stall during the AI Impact Summit expo at Bharat Mandapam.

'Switzerland actively contributing to development of technical standards',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/switzerland-actively-contributing-to-development-of-technical-standards/articleshow/128533580.cms,"Swiss President Guy Parmelin

How should countries deal with

AI regulation

? Is there a need to have a new agency? Will a regulatory set up stifle innovation and development of AI but how do you deal with challenges such as deep fake?

Switzerland is chairing the OSCE for the third time this year. In that capacity, what are you proposing to do to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict? Also, what do you make of India’s efforts to reach out to both sides for a ceasefire and return to dialogue and diplomacy?

Last one year has been turbulent for trade? How much cushion have trade deals such as those with India provided?

Given unilateral tariff actions over the last 10 months, what is the way forward ad WTO’s powers are completely undermined and there is a rush of bilateral trade agreements around the globe?

The global order is changing, whether it is trade, arms reduction or countries threatening or attacking others. Where are things headed, is this a transition phase?

Some believe that migration concerns are hyped up and there is a need get people to help at a time when European population is declining. But migrants come with their own challenges, especially problems with adjustment and backlash. How do you balance the two at a time when you are seeing a backlash against certain migrant groups?

Swiss President Guy Parmelin backs a governance framework for AI that does not rely on a single instrument and calls for societal norms that guide users. Excerpts from an interview with TOI:Over the past 200 years, mankind has established thousands of legal, technical and societal norms to “regulate” the development and use of engines in a vast number of different machines and vehicles, with different levels of harmonization, based on the specific context of use. Like engines, we think that also AI cannot be “regulated” by a single instrument, but we will need to develop a governance framework consisting of many instruments to cover different aspects of the development and use of AI. Switzerland is therefore actively contributing to the development of technical standards for AI, of binding and nonbinding legal instruments, like the recommendations of UNESCO or the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) and the Council of Europe framework convention on AI, which has been elaborated among 55 countries from all around the world and is the first binding international treaty on AI. But we also need societal and cultural norms that guide us when using AI in our specific contexts.Under the first priority of its OSCE Chairpersonship (“Helsinki Principles – for lasting peace”), Switzerland is committed to a just peace in Ukraine, based on international law and the Helsinki Principles. In his capacity as OSCE Chairman-in-Office, Federal Councillor Ignazio Cassis visited Kyiv (Feb 2) and Moscow (Feb 5-6) together with the OSCE secretary general to offer dialogue and to make sure all relevant actors know what the OSCE could contribute in the context of a negotiated settlement.Ultimately, it is up to the States to decide whether to make use of it.Free trade agreements such as the Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) are an important tool, especially in challenging times for trade policy. They enable the Swiss export industry to tap into new markets and diversify. This strengthens Switzerland’s standing as a business location and boosts its ability to generate added value, create new jobs and preserve existing ones.The WTO has long been under severe stress, but despite institutional paralysis, around 74% of global trade still takes place on MFN terms, underscoring the system’s continued relevance. It remains the only global institution that monitors members’ trade measures and offers a permanent forum for dialogue among 166 economies. In a context of rising tensions and challenges to established rules, Switzerland will continue to champion multilateralism and support WTO reform to preserve rules-based trade. WTO members broadly share this view: they have repeatedly signalled strong willingness to engage in meaningful reform, especially in view of the 14th WTO Ministerial Conference.The international order is undergoing a deep and far-reaching transformation. Democracy is under pressure worldwide. Tariffs are being raised, trade agreements dismantled, international rules ignored. It is not the rule of law that prevails, but the rule of might. Joint solutions are pushed aside by unilateral action. Great powers assert their interests, some wage wars to restore old empires. So, today, we are at a turning point. A turning point between progress and regression, between global cooperation and geopolitical rivalry. Between democratic renewal and authoritarian relapse. We have to actively shape this transformation. In this context, Switzerland is keen to diversify and deepen its relations with democratic partners like India that are proponents of international law and the rules-based international order and have considerable global influence and reach.Switzerland recognizes that human mobility is a global phenomenon. People have always moved in response to economic, social, political, security and environmental challenges, in search of opportunities and/or safety. Fair, regular and safe migration can be a driver of sustainable development and of economic resilience, growth and prosperity for both countries of origin and destination. However, unsafe and irregular migration come with risks and challenges, even more so for young people and women. Switzerland – as a small but highly globalized country - has a strong interest in an international system of migration governance that addresses the risks associated with unsafe migration and forced displacement while leveraging the benefit of migration for the economy and the people. To address challenges but also build on opportunities, Switzerland’s foreign policy on migration is characterized by a partnership approach with countries of origin, transit and destination.",Switzerland is chairing the OSCE for the third time this year.

What can Estonia offer to the world and India in terms of AI and tech?

AI is still developing so fast. We don't know what's going on, let's say in three months or even two weeks.

Could you give us a sense of the digitalisation that has happened in Estonia?

How are you ensuring privacy of data?

What has been the increase in productivity as a result of digitalisation?

What are the areas of cooperation you see with India?

What are your views on regulation of AI?

Estonia is widely using AI in edu and wants to collaborate with India. In an interview with TOI’s Surojit Gupta, Estonia’s President Alar Karis talks about how they’ve built trust while rolling out citizen-centric e-services. Excerpts:n We can provide to India and the rest of the world our experience and how we digitalised our society. One important thing we should share with the rest of our world is how we are building trust when we go for digitisation or using AI. You should build trust not only between technologies, but also between govts and societies as a whole.But we are prepared and we try to use this new technology smartly. This is what we can tell India. India is also a digitalised country, so we learn from each other.In Estonia, everything is online. That means you can even get married online. I mentioned tax, I mentioned prescriptions, basically everything. One startup, instead of using lawyers, is using AI. It doesn't mean we don't need lawyers anymore, but we can focus on things which are more important as there are queues in Estonia to get to the court.Privacy is getting more and more important with AI technology. Data may belong to citizens, but data privacy, especially medical care, is a concern. We see in Europe, in some countries, how difficult it is to introduce ID cards as people are concerned about the data.Someone has calculated that it has raised GDP by 5%. That is a calculation that's just done by officials. It makes your life very comfortable. In some countries, it's very difficult to fill up the tax forms. For us, it's pre-filled. It takes maybe a couple of minutes if you don't have anything to add. It makes the whole thing transparent. For medical prescriptions, you don't have to go to a doctor. He knows what your illnesses are and they give you a prescription, you see it right away and you go to a pharmacy.Like India, Estonia values education. We can collaborate on this. We started AI Leap. We provided computer access to schools 30 years ago. Now, we are doing the same with AI. We teach teachers and students how to use AI smartly. We've collaboration with OpenAI and Google and asked them to provide a platform that suits students' needs in Estonia. AI Leap is in every school and we are learning how to use it and how to actually change the whole system of how we teach students.Regulations are needed. We try to ensure there are worldwide regulations, at least on a certain level. But every country is different. There are limits with technology and there are rules and regulations.","Estonia is widely using AI in edu and wants to collaborate with India.

People must be careful of risks while developing technologies: AI expert,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/people-must-be-careful-of-risks-while-developing-technologies-ai-expert/articleshow/128533187.cms,"Visitors explore cutting-edge AI gizmos at the summit on Wednesday

New Delhi: Current frontier models of AI are developed by a handful of companies and in countries such as the US and China, while most other countries are ""passive victims of things they built"", Yoshua Bengio, professor of computer science at University of Montreal, said at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on Wednesday.Emphasising that only a handful of countries leading this domain is ""unacceptable"", Bengio, who is widely considered as an AI pioneer said nations must take this up at the highest diplomatic level. Frontier models in AI are the most advanced, large-scale, general-purpose machine learning models that currently push the boundaries of capability, multimodality (text, image, audio, video), and performance.Yoshua said it's not just a question of morality, but also sovereignty. He added this is also related to concentration of power. ""If AI capability continues to grow, there's a real possibility that there'll be a huge discrepancy, even more than there is now, between the models, let's say, in the US and China and the models that are being developed in other countries. And that could give those two countries or whoever is leading huge economic power. .."", noting that ""...the stability, the geopolitical stability that we've known since the Second World War could just go up in flames.I'm not saying it's going to happen, but when you introduce so much power and when it is concentrated in such a way, there's a real danger that you're going to break the house.""These observations are significant at a time when India is spearheading the campaign for democratising AI.On what India should be careful with regard to AI, Bengio said people should be mindful of the effects or the risks that are being taken that are going to affect society while developing the technologies. ""We need to understand it scientifically. We need to understand it socially because there's a social component psychologically in the case of AI because we're talking about systems that interact with people and language. So, a country like India could contribute to that understanding,"" he said.He also said there is a dire need to carry out independent risk assessment before deploying open AI models. ""If the risks are not too large compared to the benefits, because clearly there are benefits to sharing, in particular in developing countries like here in India, then sure, you should absolutely go open. But if you see that the risks cross a threshold of social accessibility, then you should not. So this way we might be able to get the benefits of open source when it makes sense and we could prevent catastrophic uses otherwise,"" Bengio said.The professor also drew a parallel to how thorough risk assessment is carried out before allowing the sale of medicines and the same should be followed when using Artificial Intelligence in the public.""You can't do whatever you want that's going to make you money. You need to first show to an independent party, like representing the govt, that your product is not going to be harmful. But there's no such thing right now. It's a scandal,"" he said.","Current frontier models of AI are developed by a handful of companies and in countries such as the US and China.

‘Social Media Curbs For Children Only After Careful Consideration’

New Delhi: Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Wednesday underlined the need to strike a balance between development of artificial intelligence and regulation, and asserted that govt will use a mix of technical regulations and laws going forward.""India's approach has been a techno-legal approach, a combination of using technical solutions, and legal structures. That approach is now appreciated by the global community. Some geographies have in the past used only regulation or a legal approach. That has not really delivered the kind of results which are needed,"" the minister told TOI in an interview.Given that innovations have a long runway, heavy regulation may not be required at this stage. ""This is probably the first innings of the first match of a test series,"" he quipped.The minister said Big Tech ""is pretty much working in sync"" with society and policymakers.Asked about restricting access of children to social media, Vaishnaw said that currently discussions are underway. ""There is a discussion going on about the impact of social media on children and how it should be dealt with. Several countries have imposed restrictions and prohibitions and in India too, industry and public other stakeholders are discussing the issue.The right solution will emerge only through thoughtful deliberation. ""He also said that AI offered a lot of opportunities for Indian IT companies.""The IT industry is also very cognizant of the challenges and they are pivoting very rapidly away from the old model to create a new model of providing services, from software as a service to AI-based services. There are thousands and thousands of legacy systems in the world. Those legacy systems will have to be modernised, and our IT services companies are best placed to modernise them, using the new AI-based solutions,"" Vaishnaw said, adding that the govt, academia and industry are harmonised.Asked about the PM's comments asking IT companies to diversify beyond services to products and platforms, the minister said industry is calibrating these changes. ""They were trying to measure what this change would bring to their sector... Lots and lots of very focused, small models is what the IT industry is putting their emphasis on, which can be placed in an enterprise where trust is the most important factor,"" he said.Vaishnaw added that the IT industry has devised a bouquet of small models, and our sovereign models are complementing that.","Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw underlined the need to strike a balance between development of artificial intelligence and regulation.

New Delhi: In the single biggest attachment of properties, ED on Wednesday said it has attached assets worth over Rs 10,000 crore of Pearl Agro Corp Ltd (PACL) in a money laundering case. These properties are located in Punjab's SAS Nagar, Rupnagar, Zirakpur and Mohali.With this, the value of total attachments against PACL and its promoter Nirmal Singh Bhangoo and his family exceeds Rs 17,600 crore. The last biggest attachment was also against this group when the agency, in Jan this year, attached 37 properties worth over Rs 2,000 crore, including a prime plot worth over Rs 1,500 crore near Jaipur airport and others in Ludhiana.The PACL, a multi-level marketing company that promised allotment of plots to lakhs of people across the country, tricked investors and regulators alike for close to two decades and managed to collect more than Rs 48,000 crore, siphoning most of this money to purchase assets in India and overseas, according to an assessment by the ED.""In most cases, land was never delivered, and approximately Rs 48,000 crore remains unpaid to investors,"" ED said. The scheme involved use of multiple front entities and reverse sale transactions to conceal fraud and generate wrongful gains, it added.The case is based on a probe ordered by the Supreme Court and a directive issued to SEBI to constitute a panel to dispose of the land bought by PACL and distribute the sale proceeds to the investors.","The properties are located in Punjab's SAS Nagar, Rupnagar, Zirakpur and Mohali.

MUMBAI: Vijay Mallya , founder of the defunct Kingfisher Airlines , is ""unable to precisely state when he will return to India"", his solicitors said in a statement before Bombay HC.He is entitled to challenge the validity of Fugitive Economic Offenders (FEO) Act provisions without being in India and, following orders passed by courts in England, he is ""not permitted to leave or attempt to leave England and Wales, or apply for or be in possession of any international travel document"", the statement added.Senior counsel Amit Desai for Mallya tendered the statement submitted by his solicitors, Kanga and Company, before Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad. The bench remarked that the note was not a signed affidavit.The Union home ministry, in a fresh affidavit on Tuesday, however, said Mallya's affidavit dated Feb 10 was not in conformity with HC's Dec order asking him when he would return to India. The affidavit, affirmed in London, says he made bona fide offers of settlement and the Union finance ministry's disclosure in Lok Sabha in Dec of Rs 15,006 crore recovered by banks against Kingfisher Airlines' borrowings made the recovery in excess of the Rs 6,200 crore debt recorded by Debt Recovery Tribunal in 2017.Mallya's petition challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of FEO Act could be heard even when he was not in India, said the statement of Feb 18, citing a Nov 2025 top court order permitting those declared FEOs and absconders to be represented by lawyers in India while being physically outside the country.Mallya's lawyers also said his petitions - one challenging the special trial court order dubbing him an FEO and the other challenging FEO provisions - needed to be heard separately.The Centre, represented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta and ASG Anil Singh, accompanied by ED's counsel Prashant Mishra said Mallya had been absconding since March 2, 2016. He was declared a ""fugitive offender"" by the special court in Jan 2019, following which extradition proceedings stood initiated and are at an advanced stage in the UK.Mehta said once Mallya was extradited, or chose to return, he would be strictly dealt with under Indian laws and the Constitution.The HC, which at one point was inclined to dismiss Mallya's petition, did not do so after Desai persuaded it not to, and contended that Mallya's assets were seized and, even in England, he was not allowed to leave the country or hold a passport.The HC then directed Mallya to file a fresh affidavit reiterating the written statement, as well as comprehensively showcasing such orders passed by courts in England. ED is to file its affidavit in rejoinder thereafter. The HC posted the matter to March 11. It also orally remarked that Mallya took no steps since the filing of his petition in 2019 to get it heard.","Vijay Mallya is ""unable to precisely state when he will return to India"", his solicitors said in a statement before Bombay HC.

TOI

NEW DELHI: Space promoter and regulator IN-SPACe on Wednesday announced an AI inspired seed fund scheme of Rs 6 crore for startups or people interested in developing AI applications in the space sector.The seed fund initiative is aimed at accelerating AI-driven innovation across India’s private space ecosystem through targeted financial and institutional support. Vinod Kumar, director, promotion directorate, Indian National Space Promotion & Authorization Centre, made the announcement while speaking at a specialised session of the AI Impact Summit in Delhi titled “Beyond Earth: How AI is Powering the Next Era of Space Exploration”.Talking toon the sidelines of the event, Kumar said, “Nowadays, AI applications are being used on ground in the space sector and in orbit. AI is now in every part of the space sector. Keeping this in mind, we have announced this new seed fund for any applicant that can replace any traditional method in the space sector with an AI application. We will invite applications from such startups, companies or even persons, and shortlist such five entities and provide them a grant of Rs 1 crore each for such AI applications.So, a total of Rs 6 crore has been announced.”When asked whether this grant amount will be increased, the director said, “Rs 6 crore is the initial seed fund. Rs 1 crore is sufficient for the application part. When any company’s idea is built up, then we have the technology adoption fund for that purpose, there we will provide the company Rs 35 crore. Even up to Rs 60 crore venture capital fund is available for such companies.” The last date for receipt of applications is March 20.On how prevalent is AI in Isro’s day-to-day work, the INSPACe director said, “AI is used for data analytics like hazard detection, AI is being used for processing data from satellites, and even human robot ‘Vyommitra’ developed for the Gaganyaan mission is also using AI. Even for the ground testing of a satellite we are using AI. For example, checking any crack in thousands of solar cells, we use AI. AI has entered our system. ”He also disclosed that “a fully autonomous and advanced version of Vyommitra, based on AI, will be used in the upcoming Bharatiya Antariksh Station that will come up by 2035”.On how INSPACe is helping startups, the director said, “Currently, there are 390 space startups. We have received 850+ applications from startups in various aspects of the space sector, who are seeking our help. There are 12 courses we have designed in the space sector. And, over 58 colleges have added space applications in their curriculum. Many private companies have set up their own space facilities. But where companies are not able to have their own set up, INSPACe or Isro provide them help or do the hand-holding. ”The director said, “Both space and AI are burgeoning sectors, and their convergence holds strong potential to transform how we explore and operate in complex and remote environments through autonomous and intelligent decision making. We are keen to see how non-govt entities use this opportunity to develop solutions that serve national priorities over the long term.”","The seed fund initiative is aimed at accelerating AI-driven innovation across India’s private space ecosystem.

NEW DELHI: From inaccessible police stations and a policing system inadequately equipped to respond to concerns of persons with disabilities (PwDs) to inaccessible courtrooms and the justice system lacking crucial manpower like sign language interpreters and denying easy access to legal aid, a new report by National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP) presents a grim picture of the situation on the ground.The study “Status of access to justice for persons with disabilities” highlights significant systemic barriers preventing PwDs from accessing law enforcement, courts and legal aid in India, despite strong legal protections under Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016.The report draws from a survey of 355 people, including those with disabilities, caregivers, disabled people’s organisations and family members of PwDs from 30 states and Union territories. These included 258 males and 96 females, with 1 individual preferring not to disclose their gender. The highest number of respondents came from Chhattisgarh, followed by Gujarat, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.The analysis also presents insights based on interviews with lawyers, field visits to police stations and data obtained through the Right to Information Act.Nearly 72% of the survey respondents were unaware or only minimally aware of their entitlements under RPwD Act.Of those who needed to reach out to police, only 15% of respondents used an online portal to submit a police complaint. While they found the mode accessible, there were challenges like navigating the interface, delays in response, occasional technical glitches and concerns over follow-ups.The findings reveal that 48.9% of respondents had visited a police station, 38% of them had gone there to file a complaint and 40% had visited for document verification or attestation.As many as 56.5% of respondents reported facing infrastructure barriers like lack of ramps, lifts and wheelchairs while visiting a police station. Other barriers highlighted by them include lack of scribes for visually impaired persons, a negative attitude and communication issues. A significantly high percentage of respondents (52%) said the police were not approachable.The field visits the report draws from were conducted at 13 police stations across Assam, Maharashtra and Gujarat -- five each in Assam and Maharashtra, and three in Gujarat.Sharing their challenges, 69% of police officials cited lack of training as a major barrier in handling cases of PwDs, highlighting the need for structured capacity-building programmes.","A new report by National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP) presents a grim picture of the situation on the ground.

JAMMU: Tourist arrivals in Jammu and Kashmir have shown signs of revival after a deep slump following the April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack , state govt said Wednesday.Replying to a cut motion of Peoples Conference legislator Sajad Lone, govt said the terror attack severely impacted tourism, livelihoods and all stakeholders linked to the sector. However, govt initiated a series of measures, including promotional outreach, to restore confidence and revive tourism. These efforts, it said, have yielded encouraging results, reflected in improved footfalls during the winter season. CM Omar Abdullah holds charge of the tourism department.According to official data tabled by govt in the assembly, 29.4 lakh domestic tourists and 43,654 foreign tourists had visited Kashmir in 2024, while 5.1 lakh pilgrims visited Shri Amarnath cave shrine the same year.In 2025, the numbers declined as J&K recorded 11.1 lakh domestic tourist arrivals and 22,993 foreign tourists, while 4.1 lakh yatris undertook the holy Amarnath pilgrimage.Tourism currently contributes about 6.98% to J&K’s Gross State Domestic Product.Earlier, tourism was hit in 2020 and 2021 following Covid-19 outbreak soon after the notification of J&K Tourism Policy-2020. However, with the easing of Covid restrictions, the sector gradually recovered and registered strong growth in subsequent years.The J&K tourism policy envisages an investment of Rs 2,000 crore per year in the sector during the initial phase, and generation of 50,000 jobs annually.The Omar govt said in FY 2025-26, it spent Rs 3,961.79 lakh on day-to-day operations and maintenance and Rs 1,703.45 lakh on creation and upgradation of infrastructure for tourism development authorities and tourist circuits across 21 development authorities. Major authorities, including Pahalgam, Gulmarg, Sonamarg, Patnitop and Lolab-Bangus-Drangyari, are working to improve the facilities.Nearly 200 tourism assets were identified for outsourcing and monetisation, and 196 have already been taken up.","Tourism currently contributes about 6.98% to J&K’s Gross State Domestic Product.

Uttarakhand achieves 1 GW solar energy capacity boosting green energy push and local jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/uttarakhand-achieves-1-gw-solar-energy-capacity-boosting-green-energy-push-and-local-jobs/articleshow/128518899.cms,"Representative Image

Uttarakhand has crossed a major renewable energy milestone, surpassing 1 gigawatt (GW) of installed solar power capacity. The state’s total installed solar capacity now stands at over 1,027.87 megawatts, underlining its growing push towards clean and sustainable energy.Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the achievement reflects the Centre’s policy focus on renewable energy under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He said the Prime Minister’s vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat and emphasis on green energy had encouraged states like Uttarakhand to turn solar power into a people-driven movement.According to Dhami, coordinated implementation of central schemes and state-led initiatives has also opened up self-employment opportunities for youth and local entrepreneurs. He expressed confidence that Uttarakhand would further consolidate its position among India’s leading solar energy states in the coming years.The milestone has been achieved through a mix of grid-connected rooftop solar projects, ground-mounted plants, installations on government buildings, solar pumps for agriculture, and solar schemes for domestic, commercial and industrial consumers.Of the total installed capacity, around 397 MW has come from ground-mounted projects, 241 MW from rooftop solar installations under the PM Surya Ghar scheme, 137 MW under the Chief Minister Solar Self-Employment Scheme, 110 MW through commercial net metering, 51 MW from captive solar plants, 37 MW from canal-top and canal-bank projects, and 26 MW from solar installations on government buildings.In addition, more than 100 MW is currently being installed under the Chief Minister Solar Self-Employment Scheme, along with 30 MW from captive solar plants and 13.5 MW on government buildings. These efforts have contributed to reducing carbon emissions, improving energy self-reliance, and generating local employment.The Uttarakhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (UREDA) has played a key role in driving solar adoption across the state by implementing projects, providing technical support, raising awareness, and extending solar solutions to remote and mountainous areas.Officials said supportive policies, subsidies, simplified approval processes and incentives for private investment have helped accelerate solar growth. The state government has set further targets to expand solar capacity, deepen outreach in remote regions, and boost public participation as part of its long-term sustainability goals.","The state’s total installed solar capacity now stands at over 1,027.87 megawatts.

The accused arranged transportation for the victims from India to Myanmar, illegally via Thailand.On reaching Myanmar, the trafficked victims were forced to work in cyber scam companies, creating fake social media profiles and engaging with people in the USA, UK, and Canada to convince them to invest in fraudulent cryptocurrency apps, NIA investigations revealed. On refusal, the victims were confined and coerced by the scamsters to continue engaging in the illegal cyber activities.

'Not a single speck of dust can be secular'

Ghar Wapsi

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Wednesday criticised the United States and China, alleging that ""western countries spread fundamentalism,"" and asserting that India holds solutions to many of the world's problems.Speaking at a Shodharthi Samvad programme at Lucknow University, Bhagwat said, ""Western countries spread fundamentalism. Their thinking is to become powerful, live on their own, and abandon the rest, eliminating those who become obstacles. This is what America and China are doing today.""Bhagwat maintained that India can offer solutions to global crises but must first strengthen itself.""Today, India has the answers to the problems the world is facing. If we want to become a world leader, we must become powerful in all areas. The world only believes it when truth is backed by power,"" he said.""Research plays a major role in changing India's direction and condition. Truthful information should be brought to light. We will not be able to understand India through ignorance,"" he added.He further alleged that Western powers had distorted India's traditional education system.""Westerners have messed with education. They replaced our education system and imposed their own, so they could find black Englishmen to do the work. What the British did wrong must be rectified,"" he said.""Today globalisation means marketisation, which is dangerous. We talk about Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. That means we consider the entire world as our family. Unless everyone is happy, no one can be happy,"" he said.""Therefore, our lives should be restrained, not consumerist. A life of restraint and sacrifice is in our cultural self-realisation,"" he added.Speaking on religion, Bhagwat said that religion remains eternally relevant and governs the laws by which the universe operates. ""The eternal nature of religion is always relevant. Religion is the laws by which the universe operates. Not a single speck of dust can be secular,"" he said.""Religion brings happiness to everyone. Religion is applicable in everything we do. Our behaviour changes according to religion, country, and time. Religion tells us that we should live with everyone, not alone,"" he added.Bhagwat also stressed the importance of environmental protection, urging people to adopt sustainable practices in daily life.Earlier on Tuesday, Bhagwat expressed concern over ""a decline in the Hindu population"". According to a release, he called for a halt to religious conversions allegedly driven by greed or coercion.He said the process of ""Ghar Wapsi"" (homecoming) should be accelerated and that those who return to Hinduism must be supported.Bhagwat further stated that Hindus should have at least three children. Citing scientific studies, he claimed that a society with an average of fewer than three children faces long-term decline. He added that newly married couples should be informed of this view.","Mohan Bhagwat: Western countries spread fundamentalism. India holds solutions to many of the world's problems, he said.

Declares all pending or future claims under this category invalid

Opposition protests

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Mahayuti government in Maharashtra has formally cancelled the five per cent reservation for Muslims in jobs and education.The Social Justice Department on Tuesday issued a Government Resolution (GR) cancelling its 2014 order that had granted a 5 per cent reservation to the Muslim community in educational institutions and government and semi-government jobs — a provision that had already been legally invalidated over a decade ago.The reservation was introduced in July 2014 through an ordinance, classifying Muslims under the Special Backward Class-A (SBC-A) category. However, the policy was challenged in the Bombay High Court, which stayed its implementation in November 2014.The five per cent reservation for Muslims was introduced in July 2014 by the then Congress–NCP government through an ordinance. The move came alongside a 16 per cent reservation for Marathas and was pitched as a response to socio-economic data indicating backwardness among sections of the Muslim community.The quota was not framed as religion-based. Muslims were classified under a new category, Special Backward Class-A (SBC-A), and the benefits were to apply to government jobs, semi-government posts and admissions to educational institutions.The ordinance was cleared just months before the 2014 assembly elections, making it politically contentious from the outset.Almost immediately after the ordinance was issued, it was challenged in court.Petitioners argued that reservations based on religion violated constitutional principles and that the quota breached the 50 per cent ceiling on reservations laid down by the Supreme Court in earlier judgments.In November 2014, the Bombay High Court stayed the implementation of the ordinance. This meant the quota could not be operationalised unless the stay was vacated or the policy was reworked.Meanwhile, the ordinance also faced a procedural hurdle. Under the Constitution, an ordinance must be converted into law by being passed in the legislature within a stipulated period. The Maharashtra legislature did not take up the ordinance before the deadline of December 23, 2014, causing it to lapse automatically.Subsequently, Supreme Court, while deciding a Special Leave Petition against the high court’s order, effectively upheld the legal position that the quota could not continue.As a result, the five per cent Muslim reservation never came into force in practice.Despite the ordinance having lapsed and the courts having stayed its implementation, the original 2014 government resolution was never formally withdrawn. Over the years, this created administrative ambiguity, with sporadic applications for caste or validity certificates under the SBC-A category.The Maharashtra government said the latest GR is meant to remove this ambiguity by formally cancelling all decisions and communications linked to a quota that has no legal standing.The new directive:The government has underlined that no existing benefits are being withdrawn, since the quota was never operational.Congress leaders have strongly criticised the move, arguing that even if the quota was legally stalled, formally scrapping it sends a political message of exclusion.Mumbai Congress MP Varsha Gaikwad described the decision as ""harmful to democracy"" and said it would push Muslims away from the mainstream. She argued that instead of cancelling the quota, successive BJP-led governments should have explored legally sustainable ways to address backwardness among Muslims.NCP (SP) spokesperson Crasto said the decision proves that the BJP doesn't value Muslim leaders of the party and its allies. ""It also shows that these Muslim leaders won't get justice from the BJP,"" he claimed.","The reservation was introduced in July 2014 through an ordinance, classifying Muslims under the Special Backward Class-A (SBC-A) category.

'Prohibition causing significant financial losses': NDA allies nudge Nitish Kumar to reconsider liquor ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/prohibition-causing-significant-financial-losses-nda-allies-nudge-nitish-kumar-to-reconsider-liquor-ban/articleshow/128500424.cms,"NEW DELHI: Calls for a rethink of Bihar’s decade-old liquor ban have resurfaced within the ruling alliance, with NDA allies urging chief minister Nitish Kumar to review the policy. Union minister Jitan Ram Manjhi said the principle of prohibition was not flawed but its implementation had gone awry.“We have been saying for a long time that the liquor policy is not wrong, and prohibition should be implemented. However, there are flaws in its implementation,” he said.""In our state, the enforcement officers catch those very people, while those who do large-scale smuggling are being let off after taking money. Nitish Kumar should take action. Prohibition is causing significant financial losses to the Bihar government, and Nitish Kumar should address this,"" Manjhi told ANI“Prohibition is causing significant financial losses to the Bihar government, and Nitish Kumar should address this,” Manjhi said, urging stricter action against corruption in enforcement.The ban, introduced in 2016 when Nitish Kumar was heading the Mahagathbandhan government, has led to more than 8.43 lakh cases and nearly 12.8 lakh arrests, as per an earlier report by TOI Yet concerns over revenue have intensified. Before prohibition, Bihar earned over Rs 3,000 crore annually from liquor sales. With fresh welfare commitments likely to cost upwards of Rs 28,000 crore — including direct cash transfers to women, higher pensions and electricity subsidies — the state’s stretched finances have prompted murmurs within the NDA about whether the ban is sustainable.Bihar’s fiscal deficit stood at 9.2% of GSDP last year.Rashtriya Lok Morcha MLA Madhav Anand, also an NDA ally, called in the Assembly for a “detailed review” of the law. “It is 10 years since the prohibition law was enacted… An assessment should be made as to what we have gained and lost in the last ten years,” he said, claiming liquor remained available through home delivery and that drug use among youths had risen.","Jitan Ram Manjhi said the principle of prohibition was not flawed but its implementation had gone awry.

VIJAYAWADA: Amid the ongoing political slugfest between the TDP-led NDA alliance and the YSRCP over the supply of ghee by Maharashtra-based Indapur Dairy to the Tirupati trust, TTD chairman B R Naidu clarified that the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) remained TTD’s largest ghee supplier, meeting 62% of the trust’s total requirement. He dismissed the YSRCP’s allegations that Indapur Dairy bags contracts only when the TDP comes to power in the state.B R Naidu released ghee procurement data for 2024–25 to substantiate his claims.According to the TTD chief, following a series of complaints and concerns expressed by millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe over the deteriorating quality of the sacred Tirupati laddu — allegedly due to the procurement of adulterated ghee during the erstwhile YSRCP regime — the newly constituted TTD trust board passed a series of resolutions to procure pure cow ghee from reputed dairies across the country in a transparent manner, strictly adhering to FSSAI specifications.“Ever since the revised ghee procurement guidelines came into effect, seven rounds of tenders were called for ghee procurement. Seven reputed national dairies — including KMF, Mother Dairy, Indapur Dairy, Sangam Dairy, Premier Agri Foods, Kolhapur Dairy and Govind Milk — participated in the tender process,” B R Naidu said.“While KMF bagged four out of the seven tenders to supply 60 lakh kg of ghee, the KMF management expressed difficulties and agreed to supply only 10 lakh kg out of the 20 lakh kg tender quantity in the tender floated in October last year.Overall, KMF supplied 50 lakh kg of ghee, accounting for 62% of the total ghee procured by TTD between 2024 and 2025,” the TTD chief noted.B R Naidu further clarified that Indapur Dairy qualified in only two of the seven tenders floated by TTD and secured orders to supply 10 lakh kg of ghee. Dismissing allegations that Indapur Dairy participates in TTD ghee supply tenders only during the TDP regime, he said the dairy took part in the tender process about six times between 2019 and 2024 during the YSRCP regime.Rejecting allegations of an abnormal spike in ghee prices procured by the Tirupati trust, the TTD chairman underlined that ghee prices fluctuate based on multiple parameters. He asserted that the rates at which TTD procured ghee from national dairies were in line with the indicative prices of the National Cooperative Dairy Federation of India (NCDFI) and the Indian Dairy Association (IDA).",B R Naidu released ghee procurement data for 2024–25 to substantiate his claims.

Stock market today: Indian equity benchmarks are slowly inching upwards, with Nifty50 and BSE Sensex opening in green after three days of gains. While Nifty50 was above 25,850 in early trade, BSE Sensex rose over 100 points. At 9:18 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 25,861.55, up 42 points or 0.16%.

Improvement in earnings recovery and indications of continuation of this uptrend have brought the mid and smallcaps back to the radar of investors. At the institutional level, there is a trend of selective accumulation of mid and smallcaps. Even mutual funds which had flagged the valuation concerns of the mid and smallcaps have started approaching the segment with optimism.“However, even now, largecaps have valuation comfort while mid and smallcaps are trading at much higher valuations. Nifty is trading at around 20 times FY27 estimated earnings while the NSE midcap and NSE smallcap indexes are trading at 28 and 24 times estimated FY27 earnings.

Actor Rajpal Yadav has been released from Tihar Jail today on an interim bail in Rs 9 crore cheque bounce case. The next hearing will take place on March 18 and till then, the actor has been released. As he thanked the country, fans and Bollywood for all the support, now the businessman who had filed a case against the actor, has finally spoken on the matter. Businessman Madhav Gopal Agrawal, who had loaned Rs 5 crore to the actor for his 2012 directorial venture Ata Pata Laapata, has spoken out about the prolonged legal dispute.Agrawal revealed how his association with Rajpal began and how the financial disagreement unfolded over the past 14 years. He revealed in a conversation with News Pinch, A that during the early phase of the conflict, he visited the actor’s residence and ""cried in front of him like a child,"" explaining that the funds he had lent were themselves borrowed from others. He said he repeatedly requested Rajpal to provide a specific date so a fresh agreement could be drafted.Agrawal, who represents M/s Murali Projects Pvt Ltd, said he was first introduced to the actor by MP Mithilesh Kumar Katheria.According to him, Rajpal had insisted that the film was nearly complete and that without immediate financial support, ""everything would go to waste"".Initially hesitant, Agrawal claimed he eventually agreed to the loan after Rajpal’s wife, Radha, sent him emotional messages appealing for help. He emphasized that the agreement clearly stated that repayment would not be influenced by the film’s box office performance, censor certification, or any other hurdle. The actor, he said, had also provided a personal guarantee.The businessman added that the transaction was strictly a loan and not an investment, noting that investments typically do not involve personal guarantees or post-dated cheques.When repayment deadlines passed without payment, Agrawal contacted Rajpal, who allegedly told him he lacked the funds. This led to three supplementary agreements being signed, along with the issuance of new cheques.Also See: Rajpal Yadav urges industry to give him work following his exit from prison: 'Jinhone madad ki hai wo ek aur madad kar dein' Agrawal further recounted that when megastar Amitabh Bachchan attended the film’s music launch event, he realised that, as per the agreement, the negatives and payment were to be handed over once the film was completed. Consequently, he approached the court seeking a stay on the film’s release.According to Agrawal, Rajpal later assured him that repayment would only be possible after the film hit theatres. Trusting this assurance, he agreed to a settlement and had the stay order lifted. However, the film failed commercially.By 2013, with no resolution in sight, Agrawal moved court again. Following judicial intervention, a settlement amount of Rs 10.40 crore was agreed upon. Though Rajpal issued several cheques toward the payment, all were dishonoured, pushing the matter further into legal proceedings.Also See: Rajpal Yadav seeks smoking rooms in jail after interim bail in Rs 9 crore cheque bounce case: 'Like KBC, prisoners deserve lifelines' Concluding his remarks, Agrawal stated that as a businessman, his sole objective is to recover his money.","Rajpal Yadav released from Tihar Jail today on an interim bail in Rs 9 crore cheque bounce case.

From Wall Street to global philanthropy





Stephen Schwarzman, the co-founder and chief executive of global investment firm Blackstone, is preparing to transfer most of his estimated $48 billion personal fortune into a philanthropic foundation, according to documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. If implemented, the plan would significantly expand the Stephen A. Schwarzman Foundation and could place it among the world’s largest charitable organisations. Schwarzman has said his philanthropic focus is centred on artificial intelligence, education and preparing societies for rapid technological change.The Wall Street Journal reported that Schwarzman and his team are planning a major expansion of the Stephen A. Schwarzman Foundation, which reported $65 million in total assets in 2024. Internal documents reviewed by the newspaper said the foundation recently hired an executive director to oversee future growth and long-term strategy. Neither Blackstone nor the foundation responded to requests for comment.Schwarzman is a signatory to the Giving Pledge, which encourages the world’s wealthiest individuals to donate most of their fortunes to charitable causes.His net worth is estimated at about $47.8 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. If nearly all of that wealth is eventually transferred to the foundation, it would place it alongside major global philanthropies such as the Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust.In his Giving Pledge letter, Schwarzman said advances in artificial intelligence and computing could reshape employment, education and global competitiveness. He described an urgent need for societies to prepare for these changes and said these concerns had already led him to fund large-scale initiatives linked to AI, research and education.Schwarzman has also cited family influences on his approach to giving. He has said his grandfather regularly sent medical supplies to children overseas, while his father extended credit to newly arrived immigrants while running a small business in Philadelphia. He has described these experiences as shaping his view of philanthropy as both a responsibility and a privilege.Schwarzman began his career at Lehman Brothers in 1972 after earning an MBA from Harvard Business School. He rose to become a managing director before leaving in 1985 to co-found Blackstone with Peter G. Peterson. The firm launched with $400,000 and later grew into one of the world’s largest asset managers. Today, Blackstone oversees more than $1.3 trillion across private equity, real estate, private credit and infrastructure.Beyond domestic giving, Schwarzman has supported global education initiatives. In 2013, he founded the Schwarzman Scholars programme at Tsinghua University in Beijing, which funds a one-year master’s degree in global affairs and is often compared to the Rhodes Scholarship.In 2018, Schwarzman donated $350 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to establish the Schwarzman College of Computing. The gift was the largest in the university’s history. MIT said the funding was aimed at advancing artificial intelligence research while integrating ethical and societal considerations into computing education.In recent interviews, Schwarzman has said he now defines his legacy by what he is building for the future rather than past financial achievements, with philanthropy, education and technology at the centre of that long-term vision.","Schwarzman has said his philanthropic focus is centred on artificial intelligence, education and preparing societies for rapid technological change.

JABALPUR: ""I didn't argue emotionally — I simply placed the law as it is,"" said Atharva Chaturvedi, 19, a NEET aspirant recalling the moment he stood before the country's highest court with the Constitution and past judgments to support his case.Atharva cleared NEET 2024–25 with 530 marks out of 720 as an EWS candidate, but he was left out of the admission process because a clearly implemented EWS reservation policy was absent in private medical colleges in Madhya Pradesh. He chose to fight the case himself without engaging a senior advocate.Atharva said he argued his own case before the Madhya Pradesh High Court and the Supreme Court of India and secured relief after he was denied MBBS admission under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota in private medical colleges in Madhya Pradesh.Before the High Court, he cited the 103rd Constitutional Amendment and said Articles 15(6) and 16(6) mandated 10% EWS reservation in private, non-minority educational institutions. The court directed the state to complete the process of increasing seats and implementing EWS reservation in private medical colleges within a year.However, the policy remained unimplemented in the following admission cycle. Despite securing an EWS rank of 164 in NEET 2025–26, he again did not get admission and moved the apex court through an online petition.On Feb 10, as a bench headed by Chief Justice Surya Kant was rising for the day, Atharva Chaturvedi sought 10 minutes to present his case, and the bench agreed.Invoking its powers under Article 142, the Supreme Court observed that the petitioner was denied admission due to circumstances beyond his control and that state authorities failed to comply with earlier judicial directions.The court directed the National Medical Commission and the Madhya Pradesh govt to ensure his admission to an MBBS course in a private medical college, and warned that further delay would cause irreversible harm to a deserving candidate.""I was nervous initially,"" Atharva told TOI, ""but I studied the earlier orders carefully. I knew the law was on my side, so I just followed the legal provisions.""He said his advocate father, Manoj Chaturvedi, helped him understand previous judgments, but said the decision to argue his case personally was deliberate. ""Travelling to Delhi repeatedly was difficult and expensive. That's why I chose to file the petition online and appear virtually,"" he said.Court observers said the bench was struck by the clarity with which he explained constitutional intent, reservation policy and administrative lapses, which they said was rarely seen even among experienced lawyers.As people asked him why he wanted medicine degree when, they said, the courtroom seemed to be calling, Atharva continued preparing for NEET with the aim of becoming a doctor.","Atharva Chaturvedi, 19, was denied MBBS admission under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota in private medical colleges in Madhya Pradesh.

MEERUT: A case has been registered at Delhi Gate police station of Meerut against a woman and her daughter for allegedly residing in India for a prolonged period without Indian citizenship.The action follows a police inquiry based on a complaint filed by a local resident. Authorities stated that the allegations are currently under investigation.According to complainant Rukhsana, Farhat Masood traveled to Pakistan in 1988 and married a Pakistani national, Saba alias Naji (now 56). It is alleged that Saba later came to India and, in 1993, brought their daughter Aiman Farhat (now 33), who was born in Pakistan, into the country on a Pakistani passport.The complaint claims that Indian citizenship was never obtained for the daughter. The complaint further alleges that the mother and daughter procured identity documents on the basis of forged papers and used them for travel purposes. Rukhsana also raised serious allegations that Saba's relatives have links with Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI and expressed suspicion that the two may have gathered information from sensitive locations in India.SP (City) Ayush Vikram Singh, ""On the basis of a preliminary inquiry, a case has been filed and Saba Masood has been arrested. Investigation is on about other allegations, and action will be taken accordingly.""The case was filed under BNS sections 318 (4) (cheating), 336 (3) forgery, 340(2) using forget documents as genuine and 351 (criminal intimidation).The family, however, refuted the charges. ""My mother travelled to Pakistan when she was eight-month pregnant. She was supposed to return before the delivery, but experienced labour pains in the eight month and Aiman was born prematurely. The mother could not have come back without the infant and the Indian consulate gave permission to travel. Besides, as per the Section 3 of the Indian Citizenship Act, a child's citizenship is decided by the citizenship of her father.

Indian IT sector stocks have been bleeding for the last few days, facing a massive selloff on increasing fears that artificial intelligence (AI) tools and models will hit the basic revenue model of the technology sector.The index tracking Indian IT sector stocks such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd. has lost a massive $56 billion in market capitalization after Anthropic PBC introduced a tool that some market participants consider a potential challenge to traditional outsourcing business models.But is the situation really so bad for the Indian IT sector? Does the future look bleak, or is the scare around impact of AI overdone?According to a Bloomberg analysis, for investors who remain positive about India’s IT services sector, the recent ‘AI scare trade’ has opened a window to accumulate stocks of companies which are viewed as capable of coming out strong amid pessimistic forecasts about the industry’s future.The brutal selloff in Indian technology stocks has been particularly noticeable across Asia, where the region’s strong hardware manufacturing base continues to be regarded as essential to the broader artificial intelligence ecosystem.The NSE Nifty IT Index has declined by about 15% since the announcement made earlier this month by Anthropic PBC, putting it on course for its steepest monthly fall since March 2020.Although technology stocks in China and Australia with significant software exposure have also come under pressure, the drop has drawn particular attention in India, where IT companies have long been regarded as key drivers of the country’s economic growth narrative.Strategists at HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. believe the concerns may be exaggerated, noting that Indian IT companies could benefit as more enterprises seek assistance in adopting and embedding AI solutions within their operations. Investors such as PPFAS Mutual Fund also argue that the industry has the flexibility to adjust effectively to evolving technological demands.“Whenever a major technological change occurs, IT firms have historically adapted by upgrading skills and aligning services with client requirements,” Raunak Onkar, research head and fund manager at the $17 billion fund house, which increased its exposure to Indian software companies last month was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.He added that these businesses have consistently succeeded by delivering cost-effective expertise at speed.This constructive outlook reflects expectations among some investors that the recent decline in Indian IT stocks could eventually reverse. Globally, tech stocks have borne the brunt amid concerns about how AI-driven tools might affect companies, especially those whose business models rely on delivering efficiency and productivity improvements for clients.India’s IT outsourcing industry first gained global recognition in the late 1990s when it assisted Western corporations in addressing the Y2K problem, a computer-related risk that threatened widespread disruptions at the turn of the millennium.Since that period, these companies have navigated multiple global economic slowdowns and technological transitions, adapting through phases that included the emergence of mobile communications and the expansion of cloud computing.At present, concerns have emerged that advances in artificial intelligence and robotics could undermine the traditional software services model. However, analysts such as Stephen Bersey of HSBC Holdings Plc argue that such assumptions are misguided and lack logical grounding.In a note dated February 9, Stephen Bersey said that software is important for coordinating interactions between AI-generated outputs and the existing enterprise systems. It is crucial to enable smooth digital operations across AI and non-AI components. He is of the view that Indian IT firms have spent decades developing and delivering enterprise-grade software solutions at scale, and this positions them well in this evolving landscape.Despite this optimism, some observers remain cautious. Critics argue that the efficiency gains delivered by AI could ultimately reduce revenue potential for outsourcing firms. According to Phanisekhar Ponangi, co-founder of Mavenark Asset Managers Pvt., the concerns surrounding AI’s impact on the sector should not be dismissed lightly.He said that for nearly three decades, information technology companies built their success on the promise of delivering higher efficiency for clients. According to him, the sector now faces a significant transition as artificial intelligence shortens project timelines and lowers workforce requirements, with “the client will pocket the productivity gains.”Some market experts, however, believe the industry has already anticipated these changes and is positioning itself accordingly. Companies have increasingly highlighted artificial intelligence initiatives during earnings calls and have begun reporting revenue linked to such offerings. In January, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. stated that its AI-led solutions are generating annualised revenue of about $1.8 billion, with growth of roughly 17 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis.Manu Rishi Guptha, a portfolio manager at MRG Capital, said investors may be overlooking two factors that could support Indian IT companies. According to Guptha, strong cash reserves can help firms navigate business model changes triggered by AI. Also, a relatively young workforce is capable of adapting quickly to tech shifts.Guptha added that the recent decline in share prices could represent an opportunity rather than a setback, noting that order inflows have remained steady while valuations have corrected. The Nifty IT index is currently trading at about 20 times forward earnings estimates, marking its lowest valuation level since April 2023.",The index tracking Indian IT sector stocks such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd. has lost a massive $56 billion in market capitalization. The NSE Nifty IT Index has declined by about 15% since the announcement made earlier this month.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128456932,imgsize-86286,width-400,resizemode-4/it-sector-selloff.jpg"
