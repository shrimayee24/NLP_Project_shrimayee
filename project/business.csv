75% of India's 'disengagement problems' in eastern Ladakh resolved: Jaishankar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/75-of-indias-disengagement-problems-in-eastern-ladakh-resolved-jaishankar/articleshow/113303570.cms,"NEW DELHI: Describing India's ties with China as complex, foreign minister S Jaishankar said roughly 75% of India's "" disengagement problems "" in eastern Ladakh were resolved and India could look at ""other possibilities"" if the disengagement process was fully completed and peace and tranquility restored on the border.Jaishankar, however, said the two countries were faced with a bigger issue of militarisation of border that has affected the entirety of their ties because ""you can't have violence at the border and then say the rest of the relationship is insulated from it"".Foreign minister Jaishankar has said in the past that the standoff in eastern Ladakh, which started in May 2020, was about forward deployment, and not land grab.""We made some progress in the ongoing negotiations. I would say roughly you can say about 75% of the disengagement problems are sorted out,"" he said, speaking at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy in Switzerland. ""We hope that if there is a solution to the disengagement and there is a return to peace and tranquility, then we can look at other possibilities,"" he added.Ties between the two countries are yet to normalise in the absence of disengagement at a couple of remaining friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The minister also said what happened in 2020 was a violation of multiple agreements for reasons which were still not entirely clear to India. ""We can only speculate about it. The Chinese actually moved a very large number of troops to the LAC at the border and naturally in response, we moved our troops up. It was very difficult for us because we were in the middle of a Covid lockdown at that time,"" he said, describing the development as dangerous.""Now, we could see straightaway that this was a very dangerous development because the presence of a large number of troops in these extreme heights and extreme cold in near proximity could lead to a mishap. And that's exactly what happened in June 2022,"" he said, referring to the Galwan Valley clashes . Jaishankar said the issue for India was why China disturbed peace and tranquility and why it moved those troops and how to deal with this very ""close-up situation"".""We have now been negotiating close to four years and the first step of that is what we called disengagement which is their troops go back to their normal operating bases and our troops go back to their normal operating bases and where required we have an arrangement about patrolling because both of us patrol regularly in that border, as I said it is not a legally delineated border,"" he said.","India's foreign minister S Jaishankar said roughly 75% of India's "" disengagement problems "" in eastern Ladakh were resolved.

Bulldozer justice like bulldozing laws of land: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-bulldozer-justice-like-bulldozing-laws-of-land/articleshow/113304869.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that government authorities indulging in ' bulldozer justice ' amounts to ""running a bulldozer over the laws of the land"", Supreme Court on Thursday held that such actions are against the law and said involvement in crime is no ground for demolition of a property.This is the second time this month that the court has come down heavily on demolition of property of those accused in various crimes.On September 2, an SC bench had said law does not permit the destruction of the family shelters of even convicts, and agreed to frame guidelines to be followed across all states to prevent arbitrary demolitions.The practice, which was initiated by Uttar Pradesh government as a punitive measure against accused persons, is being replicated by others, including Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.On Thursday, hearing the plea of a family from Gujarat whose home the municipal authorities had threatened to bulldoze, a bench of Justices Hrishikesh Roy, Sudhanshu Dhulia and S V N Bhatti strongly disapproved of the practice. It said the entire family could not be punished by demolishing the house for the offence allegedly committed by one member.""The court cannot be oblivious to such demolition threats, inconceivable in a nation where law is supreme,"" it said. Such actions, ""may be seen as running a bulldozer over the laws of the land"", it added.In a country where actions of the State are governed by the rule of law, the transgression by a family member cannot invite action against other members of the family or their legally constructed residence. Alleged involvement in crime is no ground for demolition of a property. Moreover, the alleged crime has to be proved through due legal process in a court of law.”Agreeing to hear the petition, the bench issued notice to the Gujarat govt and restrained the municipal authority from taking any action against the property.Senior advocate Iqbal Syed, appearing for the petitioner, placed before the bench the revenue record of the property to show that there was no illegality in the construction of the house in which the family has been living for the past two decades. He also referred to the resolution passed in 2004 by the gram panchayat which granted permission to build the residential house.The municipal body allegedly threatened to demolish the house after a criminal case was registered against one of the family members. The petitioner alleged that the law should take its own course against the person accused of the crime but the whole family should not be punished.“But the Nagar Palika or others in the shadow of the Nagar Palika, should have no reason to either threaten or to take any steps such as using bulldozer, to demolish the legally constructed and legally occupied house/residence of the petitioner,” the petition said.After a brief hearing, the apex court granted interim relief and posted the hearing after four weeks. “In the meantime, status quo in respect of the petitioner’s property is to be maintained by all concerned,” it noted.","The practice was initiated by Uttar Pradesh government as a punitive measure against accused persons.

NEW DELHI: India and China agreed to redouble their efforts and work with emergency to achieve complete disengagement in the remaining areas in eastern Ladakh, which India sees as essential for normalising Sino-Indian ties , in a meeting between NSA Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi on the margins of the BRICS NSAs meeting in St Petersburg.A Chinese readout, which didn’t specifically mention disengagement, said they discussed progress in border talks and agreed stability in ties is in long-term interests of both countries.The Doval-Wang meeting was the latest in a series of high-level diplomatic engagements in the past couple of months that focused on achieving a breakthrough in the ongoing negotiations to complete the disengagement process and end the military standoff that started in May 2020.Apart from two rounds of diplomatic talks in the past few months to address the remaining issues, external affairs minister S Jaishankar also twice met Wang in July on the margins of multilateral events to underscore the need to end the impasse and restore LAC peace and tranquillity.``The meeting gave the two sides an opportunity to review the recent efforts towards finding an early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC, which will create conditions to stabilize and rebuild bilateral relations,’’ said the Indian government in a statement.Doval conveyed to Wang that peace and tranquillity in borders areas and respect for LAC are essential for normalcy in bilateral relations, underlining that both sides must fully abide by relevant bilateral agreements, protocols, and understandings reached in the past by the 2 governments.Doval had met Wang on the sidelines of the BRICS NSAs meeting in Johannesburg last year too. Like last time, they agreed that the India-China bilateral relationship is significant not just for the two countries but also for the region and the world.Jaishankar and Wang in July had called for ``strong guidance’’ to end the standoff and, while a breakthrough has remained elusive, both sides have sounded positive about the negotiations. China said after the diplomatic talks last month that both sides had narrowed differences and agreed to reach a solution acceptable to both sides as soon as possibleBoth sides have intensified engagements for disengagement in remaining areas also because they realise any breakthrough can pave the way for a bilateral meeting between PM Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping at the BRICS summit in Kazan in October. The leaders will come face to face for the first time in Kazan since their” informal’’ meeting at the same summit in Johannesburg last year. Modi had used the meeting to raise concerns about the unresolved border issues, while calling for expediting the disengagement and de-escalation process. That meeting though was mired in a controversy over who first proposed it. While China said Xi spoke to Modi on the latter’s request, India denied it saying it had only responded to a pending Chinese request for a bilateral meeting between the leaders.",NSA Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi met in St Petersburg.

NEW DELHI: Faced with a huge financial burden caused by the ruling of a nine-judge bench of Supreme Court enabling states to collect royalty on extracted minerals and to levy tax on mineral-bearing land, Centre has sought a review, pointing out several ""errors apparent in the judgment"".Interestingly, the Centre has roped in Madhya Pradesh as a co-petitioner to seek review of the July 25 judgment in an open court hearing and argued that the issue raised by it ""pertains to the fundamental rights of the citizens of the country and raises larger issue of public interest and grave injustice would ensue if the application for oral hearing of the review petition is not allowed"".When senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi , appearing for some mineral-rich states, sought early listing of pending cases relating to dues before a regular bench to follow the nine-judge verdict and give the intended financial relief, solicitor general Tushar Mehta and senior advocate A M Singhvi told a bench led by CJI D Y Chandrachud about filing of the review petitions by the Centre and a Tata group entity.""Review of a Constitution bench judgement,"" exclaimed the CJI.Dwivedi said the review plea was indicative of the fact that PSUs, who have benefited immensely from extraction of minerals without paying royalty or tax on mineral-bearing land for decades, did not want to pay the minimum amount fixed by the apex court.After Centre and private companies requested the court to make the levies on minerals by states prospective, the nine-judge bench, with Justice B V Nagarathna dissenting, had clarified on Aug 14 that arrears of royalty and tax on mineral-bearing land would be paid in instalments to states from 2005 over the next 12 years. It was also clarified that arrears would not attract interest.The financial implication for public sector undertakings, without interest, has been estimated to be Rs 70,000 crore.

""There is a delay of 27 days in deciding the detenu's representation by the central govt and 20 days by the detaining authority,"" SC said and quashed the detention order on this ground.The man, A K Mohd Shaji , was put under preventive detention for a year from Sept 2, 2023, under Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities (Cofeposa) Act, 1974. Though the grounds of his arrest were communicated to him on Sept 6, 2023, his representation against detention was sent by prison authorities by post which never reached the central govt.Analysing the rights of detenues, the bench deprecated the conduct of Thiruvananthapuram jail administration and said, ""We find that the superintendent of the central prison and correctional home has acted in a thoroughly callous and casual manner. It is the duty of the transmitting authorities to send the representation of the detenue promptly. Though it is the corresponding duty of the detaining authority to consider the said representation and decide it swiftly, the same has been followed only in breach in the present matter.""Charging the jail authorities with failing in their duties, SC said, ""In the present era of technological advancement, jail authorities could have very well sent the copies of the representation to the detaining/appropriate authority either by email or at least a physical copy could have been sent by speed post (acknowledgement due) so there could have been some evidence of the said being sent to the competent authority and could have been tracked.""","The man, A K Mohd Shaji, was put under preventive detention for a year from Sept 2, 2023, under Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities (Cofeposa) Act, 1974.

Govt to develop Mausam GPT in 5 years to share weather information,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-to-develop-mausam-gpt-in-5-years-to-share-weather-info/articleshow/113306697.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian weather scientists hope to have enough expertise in the next five years to not only enhance rain but also suppress it, along with hail and lightning, in certain areas at will. This means, if Delhi or any other city wants to suppress rains during, say, Independence Day celebrations, scientists would be able to do it through interventions.Similarly, rain/hail can be suppressed in cities during floods.“We want to go for initial experimental artificial rain suppression and enhancement. Lab simulations (cloud chambers) will be done in the next 18 months, but we’ll definitely go for artificial weather modification in the five-year time scale,” said M Ravichandran, secretary, earth sciences ministry (MoES), on Thursday elaborating on Mission Mausam which got the Cabinet’s nod a day earlier.On whether rains could be suppressed on August 15, Ravichandran said: “We can think of it (through weather modification)”. Under the Mission Mausam mandate, scientists will also work on incremental improvement of weather forecast systems in the country in terms of further raising short- and medium-range forecast accuracy by 5-10%.Under the Mission, which aims to make India climate smart and weather-ready by not letting any weather phenomena, including even cloud burst, remain undetected, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) along with other scientific institutions of the MoES will also develop and launch ‘ Mausam GPT ’, a chatGPT like application, that will help users to get quick weather related information in both written and audio form in the next five years.Suppression and enhancement of rain techniques are already being used through cloud seeding, using aircraft, in a limited way in the US, Canada, China, Russia and Australia among others. There have beencloud seeding projects, called overseeding, aimed at reducing hail in order to prevent damage to fruit orchards and grain fields in a couple of these countries.“Cloud seeding and cloud modification is a complex process. We have done a lot of experiments with cloud seeding to enhance rain with limited success. But not much has been done on cloud suppression,” Madhavan Rajeevan, former MoES secretary, told TOI.He said though there is a scope in India for weather modification, its science is not well understood and technology is complex. “In my opinion, we should start doing research in weather modification and we need investments,” said Rajeevan.The government has initially approved Rs 2,000 crore over two years for the Mission Mausam to create a more ro bust forecasting system for dealing with the impacts of extreme weather events and climate change . Later, more funds will be earmarked for it.Critical elements of the mission include the deployment of next-generation radars and satellite systems with advanced sensors and high-performance supercomputers, the development of improved earth system models and a GIS-based automated Decision Support System for real-time data dissemination.India is already experimenting with artificial rain making techniques, involving cloud seeding using aircraft, and have done some pilot projects in Maharashtra and elsewhere. It is being done to study cloud microphysical characteristics through a research programme, called Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX).","Indian weather scientists hope to have enough expertise in the next five years to enhance rain and suppress it, along with hail and lightning, in certain areas at will.

"IAF wants Tejas jet production to be ramped up, even as supply of delayed US engines to begin from Nov",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-wants-tejas-jet-production-to-be-ramped-up-even-as-supply-of-delayed-us-engines-to-begin-from-nov/articleshow/113301206.cms,"NEW DELHI: Grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons when at least 42 are needed to tackle China and Pakistan, the IAF has called for majorly ramping up the production rate of indigenous Tejas fighter jets , even using the public-private partnership route.The good news is that US company General Electric is now likely to begin from Nov onwards the much-delayed supply of GE-F404 turbofan jet engines, which power Tejas Mark-1A fighters, after defence minister Rajnath Singh flagged the matter during his visit to Washington last month.IAF wants to induct around 300 Tejas fighters over the next 15 years, which will require defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics ( HAL ) to step-up its production rate in a major way.“The issue is matching production capacity with our requirements. The way forward is to diversify production lines, have more public private partnerships or joint ventures with private partners to have multiple weaponry lines as well as multiple production lines,” IAF chief Air Chief Marshal V R Chaudhari said, on the sidelines of the multi-nation Tarang Shakti exercise in Jodhpur.On the supply of aero-engines, HAL is slated to get delivery of at least two GE-F404 engines per month from Nov onwards, as per the fresh commitment given by General Electric, officials told TOI.“The assurance is there. But whether the delivery of the aero-engines actually begins in Nov remains to be seen,” an official said. The delay in the delivery timeframe of 99 GE-F404 aero-engines, which were to begin in March, is one of the major problems that has hit the production schedule of the first 83 Tejas Mark-1A jets, which were contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal inked in Feb 2021, as was reported by TOI earlier.All these 83 “improved” Tejas Mark-1A jets were to be delivered to IAF in the February 2024-February 2028 timeframe. “Under the contract, the first jet was to be delivered by Feb-March this year, but it will probably come only by Nov now. At best, HAL will be able to deliver only eight of 16 jets that were to be delivered in the 2024-25 fiscal. All this will have a cascading effect down the line,” the official said.Another Rs 67,000 crore contract for 97 more Tejas Mark-1A fighters is also now being finalized, with the defence ministry issuing the tender to HAL earlier this year.India and the US, of course, are now also conducting the final techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of GE-F414 jet engines by General Electric and HAL for the Tejas Mark-2 fighters in India, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion.The cabinet committee on security in August 2022 had cleared the over Rs 9,000 crore development of the Tejas Mark-2 fighters with the more powerful GE-F414 engines. IAF plans to induct six squadrons (108 jets) of Tejas Mark-2, which will have a longer combat range and greater weapon-carrying capacity than the Mark-1A variant.Under the long developmental saga of the Tejas, IAF till now has only got 35-36 of the first 40 Mark-1 fighters that were ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in March 2006 and Dec 2010.","IAF wants to induct around 300 Tejas fighters over the next 15 years.

On the need to focus more on reducing road accidents and vehicular pollution , he also suggested that there is a need to either convert the vehicles manufactured before 2000 (pre-BS) or to phase them out.Responding to a question on whether there is any plan to increase the speed limit, Jain said, “We will think of increasing the speed limit the day there is improvement in road discipline in our country. I have suggested to our minister that we should not increase the speed limit.” He said over four lakh road crashes and 1.5 lakh deaths are a matter of huge concern.Though Union road transport minister Nitian Gadkari had been talking about increasing the speed limit, last week he also spoke about large-scale violation of traffic rules while speaking at the Global Safety conference. “Large scale violations of traffic rules and lane driving are coming in the way of increasing the maximum speed limit even on access-controlled highways. There is little fear of or respect for law,” he had said.Speaking about the need to find ways out to deal with old polluting vehicles, which were produced before the Bharat Stage emission norms kicked in, Jain said they are seeking opinion from all stakeholders, including vehicle manufacturers.“Certain categories of vehicles (commercial) manufactured before 2000 cause 15 times more pollution. Do you feel such vehicles should run at a time when the country is facing a huge problem of pollution?” he asked.",Road transport secretary Anurag Jain said govt is not in favour of increasing the maximum speed limit on highways from the current 100 kmph to 120 kmph on National Highways.

The Union Cabinet recently announced several key initiatives aimed at enhancing healthcare accessibility, boosting renewable energy, and promoting electric mobility across India. Among these, the expansion of the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) now offers comprehensive health coverage to all senior citizens aged 70 years and above, regardless of income or socio-economic status.In addition, the government approved substantial outlays for hydropower projects and introduced the PM E-Drive Scheme to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles, replacing the FAME programme.Here's all you need to know about the new insurance coverage under Ayushman BharatThe union cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , has given the green light to the new initiative designed to offer extensive health coverage to senior citizens aged 70 and above.

Who is Jared Isaacman? Billionaire who stepped out of SpaceX capsule for first private spacewalk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-jared-isaacman-billionaire-who-stepped-out-of-spacex-capsule-for-first-private-spacewalk/articleshow/113295047.cms,"Who is Jared Isaacman?

What is a spacewalk?

Two astronauts from a SpaceX capsule orbiting Earth conducted the first-ever private spacewalk on Thursday. Jared Isaacman , a 41-year-old billionaire, and Sarah Gillis, a 30-year-old SpaceX engineer, ventured outside the Crew Dragon spacecraft while tethered to it, as their two crewmates observed from within the capsule.Isaacman was the first to exit the spacecraft at approximately 6.52 am ET (1052 GMT), followed by Gillis, making them the first non-government individuals to perform a spacewalk.The entire event was live-streamed on SpaceX's website.Upon emerging from the spacecraft, with Earth's half-lit surface glimmering 700 km (434.9 miles) below, Isaacman remarked, "" said Isaacman after exiting the spacecraft.Prior to the spacewalk, the Crew Dragon capsule underwent complete depressurization, and the crew relied solely on their lightweight, SpaceX-designed spacesuits for oxygen, which was supplied through an umbilical connection to the spacecraft.Although the spacewalk itself was planned to last only about 30 minutes, the entire process, including preparation and safe completion, took one hour and 46 minutes. The spacewalk officially concluded around 8am ET.It was the first-ever extravehicular activity (EVA) utilizing commercially developed equipment, innovative procedures, and the brand-new SpaceX EVA suit.Jared Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur, founded a payment processing company, Shift4 Payments, at the age of 16 in his parents' basement in New Jersey. The company has grown to process over $260 billion annually, catering to prominent clients such as Hilton and KFC, according to Forbes.Isaacman has also made significant contributions to the aviation industry. He set a record for the fastest flight around the world in a light jet, completing the journey in ""61 hours, 51 minutes, and 15 seconds."" Additionally, he established Draken International, which boasts the largest private fleet of military jets and provides training to Air Force pilots.Earlier, Isaacman’s space journey follows his 2021 Inspiration4 mission, the first all-civilian spaceflight.The other crew members other than Isaacman on this mission are Scott Poteet, a former US Air Force lieutenant colonel, and two SpaceX team members: Anna Menon, a lead space operations engineer, and Sarah Gillis, an engineer in charge of astronaut training.The mission aims to study how the human body reacts to deep space environments. These investigations will build upon decades of research conducted with government astronauts aboard the ISS.Meanwhile, the main goal of the spacewalk is to assess the performance of SpaceX's newly designed spacesuits. Created in-house by SpaceX, these suits are intended for use in a variety of missions, including those in Earth orbit and potentially beyond.According to Euro News, the EVA spacesuits, specifically designed for this mission, are equipped with cameras and heads-up displays that provide astronauts with real-time information about their suit's status while outside the vehicle. The report also mentioned that the suits incorporate ""improved thermal management"" to enhance the astronauts' comfort and safety during the spacewalk.""Building a base on the Moon and a city on Mars will require thousands of spacesuits.The development of this suit, and the EVA performed on this mission, will be important steps toward a scalable design for spacesuits on future long-duration missions,"" Elon Musk's SpaceX said in a post on X.Sharing a video of one of the astronauts, SpaceX said, ""Commander Jared Isaacman has egressed Dragon and is going through the first of three suit mobility tests that will test overall hand body control, vertical movement with Skywalker, and foot restraint.""A spacewalk, also known as an extravehicular activity (EVA), occurs when an astronaut exits their spacecraft while in space.""Any time an astronaut gets out of a vehicle while in space, it is called a spacewalk. A spacewalk is also called an EVA. EVA stands for extravehicular activity,"" according to US space agency Nasa's website.Spacewalks serve various purposes, such as allowing astronauts to conduct scientific experiments outside their spacecraft. During these walks, they can attach experimental setups to the exterior of the vehicle and study the effects of the space environment on different materials and objects. Spacewalks also enable astronauts to test new equipment and perform maintenance tasks, including repairing satellites or their own spacecraft.In the past, only government astronauts with extensive training have performed spacewalks. Since the creation of the International Space Station (ISS) in 2000, there have been approximately 270 spacewalks on the ISS, and Chinese astronauts have conducted 16 spacewalks on Beijing's Tiangong space station.","Two astronauts from a SpaceX capsule orbiting Earth conducted the first-ever private spacewalk on Thursday.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Elon Musk labels Australia's government 'fascists' over proposed misinformation fines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-labels-australias-government-fascists-over-proposed-misinformation-fines/articleshow/113307591.cms,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk labeled Australia 's center-left government as "" fascists "" after Canberra threatened to impose fines on internet platforms, including X , to curb the spread of misinformation online.On Thursday, the Labor government announced it would fine internet platforms up to 5% of their global revenue for failing to prevent the dissemination of misinformation.With this new legislation, Australia has joined global efforts to regulate borderless tech giants, Reuters reported.Under the proposed law, online platforms would be required to establish codes of conduct to prevent the spread of dangerous falsehoods and obtain approval from a regulator.

Rare 12th-century picture stone discovered in Germany featuring Christian imagery; read on to find out more,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rare-12th-century-picture-stone-discovered-in-germany-featuring-christian-imagery-read-on-to-find-out-more/articleshow/113250765.cms,"Picture stone: Key features and historical significance



Purpose and future of the picture stone



Also Read |

In a remarkable archaeological discovery, a homeowner in Klotzow, Germany, has unearthed a rare 12th-century "" picture stone "" while conducting construction work. This ancient artefact, known as a ""bildstein,"" is a valuable addition to the limited number of such stones found along the Baltic coast of Germany and Poland, with only about 20 having been discovered to date.The intricately carved stone features a detailed depiction of a figure believed to be Otto of Bamberg , a prominent bishop known for his role in spreading Christianity throughout the Pomerania region.Otto, who lived from 1060 to 1139, was instrumental in the Christianization of what is now modern-day Germany and Poland and, and was noted for his diplomatic and religious influence in the area.The carving on the stone includes a figure dressed in a cap, shawl, and robe, and holding what appears to be a banner. A distinctive cross etched onto the shawl suggests that the figure could be a high-ranking religious official. This detail aligns with historical records indicating that Otto of Bamberg was known to have worn a pallium—a special garment granted to archbishops and bishops—when he received one from Pope Paschal II in 1111. The pallium’s presence in the carving supports the theory that the stone depicts Otto.The precise purpose of these mediaeval picture stones remains a topic of scholarly debate. They might have served as memorials or tombstones commemorating important individuals of the time. Given the religious symbolism of the cross on this particular stone, it is likely that it was intended to honour a significant figure in the Christianization of the region.Following further analysis, the stone is set to be permanently displayed in Klotzow, providing the local community and visitors with an opportunity to explore this important piece of mediaeval history. The discovery not only enhances the understanding of the Christianization process in Pomerania but also sheds light on mediaeval religious art and practices.","A homeowner in Klotzow, Germany, has unearthed a rare 12th-century "" picture stone "" This ancient artefact, known as a ""bildstein,"" is a valuable addition to the limited number of such stones found along the Baltic coast of Germany and Poland.

'Earth sure looks like a perfect world': 1st private spacewalk a success,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/earth-sure-looks-like-a-perfect-world-1st-private-spacewalk-a-success/articleshow/113308460.cms,"Two private astronauts moved outside their spacecraft early Thursday, conducting the first-ever commercial spacewalk. The spacewalk was the centerpiece of Polaris Dawn , a collaboration between Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jared Isaacman , a billionaire entrepreneur who is leading the mission. ""Back at home, we all have a lot of work to do, but from here, Earth sure looks like a perfect world,"" he said while standing in the hatch of the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule with the planet above his head.The successful operation further reinforces that space travel is no longer the exclusive province of professional astronauts working at governmental space agencies like Nasa, and now neither is the derring-do of spacewalks, when astronauts are protected by just their spacesuits from airless doom.The Polaris missions - this one is the first of three - aim to accelerate technological advances needed to fulfill Musk's hope of sending people to Mars someday. Bill Nelson, the Nasa administrator, cheered the spacewalk, which the govt space agency played almost no role in. ""Today's success represents a giant leap forward for the commercial space industry,"" he posted on the social platform X.The spacewalk officially began at 6:12am EST with the flow of oxygen into the astronauts' spacesuits. That was almost three hours later than originally planned, but the operation proceeded without a hitch. Because there is no airlock in the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft used for the flight, the only way to perform a spacewalk is to let all of the air out of the spacecraft. Nasa and Soviet astronauts conducted spacewalks in a similar manner in the 1960s.First turning a hand crank, Isaacman opened the top hatch of the capsule and moved outside, where he conducted mobility tests of his spacesuit. His sojourn in the vacuum of space was brief: After a few minutes, Isaacman reentered the capsule, and another crew member, Sarah Gillis, a SpaceX engineer, moved outside and performed the same mobility tests. Although the two other crew members, Scott Poteet and Anna Menon, remained inside the vehicle, they were also wearing spacesuits inside the airless capsule.It was the first time that four astronauts were simultaneously exposed to the vacuum of space. After Gillis reentered, she closed the hatch, and the inside of the spacecraft was slowly repressurised. Less than two hours after it started, the spacewalk was over. A key goal of the Polaris Dawn mission is the development of more advanced spacesuits that would be needed for any attempt at off-world colonisation by SpaceX. Before the launch, Isaacman mused about how someone stepping onto Mars might one day wear a future version of the spacesuit that SpaceX developed for this mission. ""A huge honour to have that opportunity to test it.""Closer to Earth, commercial spacewalks could open up other possibilities once impossible to imagine, such as technicians repairing private satellites in orbit. Isaacman has even suggested that the second Polaris mission could attempt a trip to Nasa's aging Hubble Space Telescope to perform repairs and extend its life in orbit.The spacewalks by Isaacman and Gillis were short and modest in complexity. Unlike frantic scenes in science fiction movies, they waited patiently as air was slowly evacuated from their capsule. Then they moved methodically, following a carefully planned choreography that lasted only a few minutes. After opening the hatch, Isaacman pulled himself upward using a railing mounted to the top of the Crew Dragon. He never let go of the spacecraft as he performed a series of movements to test the capabilities of the spacesuits. When his time was up, he moved back down into the Crew Dragon, and Gillis then repeated the same actions.The Polaris Dawn crew's cautious approach was a reminder that space is an inherently inhospitable and dangerous environment, and during spacewalks astronauts are enclosed in a small bubble of air - their spacesuits - that keep them from suffocating in the vacuum of space. No astronauts have ever died or suffered serious injury during a spacewalk.There have been over 270 spacewalks conducted at the ISS since 1998 largely without incident. (Astronauts at the ISS enter and exit the space station through airlocks, minimising the amount of air that is released into space.)

NTSB chair calls out Boeing’s ‘safety culture problem’ as FAA chief set to testify before Senate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ntsb-chair-calls-out-boeings-safety-culture-problem-as-faa-chief-set-to-testify-before-senate/articleshow/113303579.cms,"Boeing factory workers threaten strike over pay

Boeing is facing increased scrutiny over its safety practices as the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) administrator prepares to testify before the Senate on the agency's oversight of the company. The hearing, scheduled for September 25, will focus on Boeing’s safety culture , following recent concerns raised by Jennifer Homendy, Chair of the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ).Homendy stated that Boeing has a ""safety culture problem"" that must be addressed, particularly with its workforce, which reportedly lacks trust in the company.Homendy’s remarks come after a mid-air emergency involving an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX in January, which has led the FAA to intensify its oversight of Boeing. The upcoming Senate hearing , led by Senator Richard Blumenthal, will delve into how the FAA has handled Boeing’s safety issues, raising questions about both the company and the regulator's responses.Meanwhile, Boeing is also grappling with labour unrest as tens of thousands of factory workers, primarily in Seattle, have voted on whether to strike, potentially halting production of its best-selling planes. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers is considering the move due to dissatisfaction with Boeing’s recent contract offer, which includes a 25% pay rise over four years.Union members, some of whom gathered in protest, argue that the offer falls short of their demands for a 40% pay rise and the reinstatement of traditional pensions. Boeing has urged workers to accept the deal, warning that a strike would hurt the company’s recovery and damage trust with customers. If approved, the strike would impact the production of Boeing’s 737 Max, 777, and 767 models, further compounding the company’s ongoing challenges.","FAA administrator to testify before the Senate on the agency's oversight of the company.

There has also been a 20-30% tariff increase on electricity and other energy products, hitting the common man hard.Pakistan's external debt obligations exceed $130 billion, with concerns raised by financial experts regarding the potential inflationary impact of the country’s debt-driven approach to fiscal deficit management.The February general election produced Shehbaz Sharif-led shaky coalition government, which now has the challenging task of tackling deep-rooted structural problems to pull the $350-billion economy out of its misery.Since joining the multilateral lender in 1950, Pakistan has secured 24 IMF bailouts, the latest being subject to approval by the lender's executive board and the confirmation of necessary financing assurances from the country's development and bilateral partners.","Islamabad has been working on implementing conditions from the IMF to complete a $7 billion, 37-month loan programme agreed in July.
