'Father had different dreams for me': CJI Gavai reflects on early struggles; gets emotional,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/father-had-different-dreams-for-me-cji-gavai-reflects-on-early-struggles-gets-emotional/articleshow/122123642.cms,"File photo: Chief Justice of India Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai (Picture credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai on Friday offered a rare glimpse into his personal journey, sharing deeply emotional memories of his family’s struggles and sacrifices during an event organised by the Nagpur district court bar association.Gavai, who became the 52nd CJI last month, choked up with visible emotion in his eyes as he recalled how his parents shaped his path in life and law.“I wanted to be an architect,” the CJI revealed, “but my father had different dreams for me. He always wanted me to become a lawyer, a dream he could not fulfil himself,” according to news agency PTI.Gavai spoke about his father’s dedication to BR Ambedkar’s cause and the burden his family carried. “My father gave himself to the service of Ambedkar. He wanted to be an advocate himself, but couldn’t fulfil that wish as he was arrested for being part of the freedom movement,” he said.Raised in a joint family, Gavai recalled how his mother and aunt bore the responsibilities of the household after his father’s imprisonment.In a moving tribute, the Chief Justice remembered how his father, when his name was recommended for judgeship, said, “If you remain a lawyer, you will only go after money, but if you become a judge then you will walk on the path laid down by Ambedkar and do good for society.”Gavai added, “My father always thought that one day I would become the Chief Justice of India. Sadly, he passed away in 2015. But I am glad my mother is there to see this.”The emotional moment was briefly lightened by Gavai’s recollection of a celebrity case. He joked about the day a cheque bounce case involving actor Hema Malini brought a large crowd to court, recalling, “There was so much crowd in the courtroom that day to get a glimpse of Hema Malini… but we couldn’t help but enjoy the moment.”Looking ahead, he hinted at writing his memoir post-retirement in November this year.",Chief Justice of India Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai choked up as he recalled how his parents shaped his path in life and law.

IIT-Madras eyes global top 50 with major expansion plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-madras-eyes-global-top-50-with-major-expansion-plans/articleshow/122122083.cms,"NEW DELHI: Indian Institutes of Technology and IISc are unlikely to break into the list of world’s top 50 universities unless they run full-fledged medical colleges, IIT-Madras director Professor V Kamakoti has said, revealing that the institution is considering setting up a medical college to overcome this gap in its portfolio.In an exclusive interaction with TOI, Kamakoti said IIT-M has already begun internal discussions on establishing a medical college, which would be integrated with its engineering and science departments, as part of its long-term vision, and is looking for a large hospital.Further, the institution has planned a global outreach through its proposed research centres in Dubai, Malaysia, and Germany and a sustainability campus in Puducherry, another important parameter for global rankings that Indian institutions lag on. In what’s an unconventional move, IIT-M has formalised a platform to help its students prepare for civil services exams.“If you want to come into top 50 (in global rankings), you must have a medical school,” Kamakoti stressed, adding, “The top-ranked universities all have global campuses, deep-research collaborations, and, critically, medical schools”.He added: “This is not just about rankings — it’s about enabling convergence in areas like AI in healthcare, biomedical engineering, and public health.A medical college will amplify our research depth and societal impact”.On the plan for developing a sustainability-focused campus in Puducherry, the director said, “This campus will be a living laboratory for climate, water, and energy research”. Explaining the move, he added: “Sustainability is now a global benchmark in rankings. That’s why we’ve started School of Sustainability under School for Interdisciplinary Studies. It’s aligned with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Every project must resonate with these goals — from green tech to zero-emission housing. Auroville collaborations in Puducherry are a part of this vision”.To expand global footprint, the institution will go for research collaborations and set up satellite centres in Dubai, Malaysia, and Germany. These will encourage Indian researchers to work on global problems and offer Indian students cross-border learning.“It’s called IITM Global,” Kamakoti said, detailing the vision behind the international outreach. “If you solve an issue for India, you’ve solved it for the world. Our IITM Global will take these to Malaysia, Germany, Dubai (by this academic year), and beyond.”Kamakoti also highlighted IIT-M’s initiative to nurture engineers for civil services. To enable this, institute has created Pragati, a platform to guide and support UPSC aspirants on campus. “We want our students to start early — during BTech or MTech — with structured preparation, peer interactions, and access to faculty and civil servants who’ve walked that path,” he said.“We’re not just a tech school anymore — we’re shaping India’s future in several ways,” Kamakoti summed up.",Indian Institutes of Technology and IISc are unlikely to break into the list of world’s top 50 universities unless they run full-fledged medical colleges.

First Indian to reach the ISS Boosts India's space journey toward 2035 goals

As night enveloped Cape Canaveral, India entered a new dawn when the Falcon-9 rocket lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 2.31am ET (12.01pm IST). In the pilot seat of 'Dragon', the Axiom-4 space capsule that would take a four member crew to the International Space Station on Thursday, was India's group captain Shubhanshu Shukla ""Namaskar, mere pyaare desh vasiyon,"" Shukla radioed to Earth minutes after entering space. ""What a ride! We are orbiting Earth at a velocity of 7.5km per second (27,000 kmph)."" Later, PM Modi congratulated the mission and posted that Shukla ""is on the way to become the first Indian to go to the ISS"".Shukla becomes the first Indian to cross the 'Karman line' in over 41 years, after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma's flight on the Soviet Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984. Shukla's message from space - ""this isn't the beginning of my journey to ISS, but beginning of India's human space flight programme"" - reflects India's ambition to have its own space station by 2035 and crewed missions to Moon and beyond.After multiple postponements, Ax-4 mission lifted off Wednesday carrying commander Peggy Whitson (US), 65, mission pilot Shukla, 39, and mission specialists Sławosz Uznanski (Poland), 41, and Tibor Kapu (Hungary), 34, on a 14-day mission to ISS.Earlier, the symbolic ""crew handover"" took place. The four astronauts waved to their families before heading to the launchpad in a Tesla. Strapped into the Dragon capsule, the crew underwent final checks as the countdown proceeded. Post lift-off, the capsule separated from the second stage nine minutes, 38 seconds later, beginning its journey to ISS. The capsule, now named 'Grace', is expected to dock with ISS at 4.30pm IST on Thursday.Dragon capsule ""Grace"" separated from Falcon 9 nine minutes after launch and is now orbiting Earth at 27,000kmph. Nose cone deployed. Navigation instruments and docking sensors exposed as the spacecraft begins its precision chase of International Space Station.Grace circles Earth once every 90 minutes. The journey isn't a straight line and docking isn't immediate. Over the next 24 to 28 hours, the capsule will execute a series of thruster burns - each timed to the second - to raise & fine-tune its orbit, aligning perfectly with the station's trajectory.A slight delay could shift the narrow rendezvous window. Onboard systems track position in real-time using GPS, radar, and sensors, continuously updating Grace's path against that of the ISS.F inal approach begins Thursday. Dragon will stop at predetermined waypoints, starting 400m out and moving in stages. At each halt, ground controllers and onboard software assess whether conditions are right to proceed.At 20 metres, laser sensors and cameras take over. Grace creeps forward at just a few centimetres a second, lining up precisely with Harmony module's docking port.Soft capture comes first - magnetic guides gently pull the capsule into place. Then hard capture follows, as mechanical latches lock and seal the connection. Hatch opening is not immediate. Engineers on Earth conduct pressure and leak checks before approving crew transfer.Aboard are four Axiom-4 astronauts and a fifth member - Joy, a soft, white baby swan toy serving as the mission's zero-gravity indicator. Joy carries personal meaning: chosen with Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla's six year old son, Kiash, fondly called Sid - in mind.""Our first ideas all included animals,"" said mission specialist Tibor Kapu.

Poll Do you believe that the investigation into the Air India Dreamliner crash will uncover the true causes within a month? Yes, the investigation will be thorough. No, it will take longer.





NEW DELHI: Data from a black box of the Air India Dreamliner that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 has been downloaded at Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau lab, govt said Thursday. Intitial information about causes leading to the accident is likely to be known in the next seven to 10 days.With the black boxes being examined locally, the final report is expected to be out in a month, instead of the six-month time frame given earlier, sources said. Civil aviation ministry said the crash protection module from the front black box was safely retrieved, and on Wednesday, the memory module was accessed.While the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of AI-171 which crashed within minutes of take-off was recovered on June 13, the Flight Data Recorders (FDR) were found in the debris three days later.Like the earlier practice, this time too, there were plans to send the black boxes to the US for examination, especially as it involved the first Dreamliner crash. But on the suggestion of the top leadership, it was decided to send them to the AAIB lab, sources said.As a result, the two were flown to Delhi in separate Indian Air Force planes last Tuesday.“The analysis of CVR and FDR data is under way. These efforts aim to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the accident and identify contributing factors to enhance aviation safety and prevent future occurrences. All actions have been taken in full compliance with domestic laws and international obligations in a time-bound manner,” the official statement said.Information about the causes is being expected in record time, in less than a month, as this is the first example of the data of a plane that crashed in Indian territory being examined in the country’s labs itself, said a senior official. The lab is compliant with international standards.A team of over 20 experts from National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the US, who arrived in Ahmedabad on June 13, are now in the Capital, examining the data with Indian experts.The delay in announcing the composition of the team probing the AI-171 crash a fortnight after the accident has raised questions about the investigation. The govt statement defended the process followed.“Following the unfortunate accident (on June 12), AAIB promptly initiated an investigation and constituted a multi-disciplinary team on June 13, 2025, in line with prescribed norms. The team, constituted as per international protocol, is led by DG AAIB, and includes an aviation medicine specialist, an air traffic control (ATC) officer, and representatives from NTSB which is the govt investigating agency from the state of manufacture and design (US), as required for such investigations,” it said. Apart from DG AAIB GVG Yugandhar, names of others on the probe panel have so far not been made public.","Data from a black box of the Air India Dreamliner that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 has been downloaded at Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau lab, govt said Thursday.

In India, health insurance is generally often an afterthought, something you purchase for tax benefits, or workplace compliance. And many of us assume that having a policy means being protected. Sure, there’s protection, but is it enough?Imagine this scenario: a family member is hospitalised, and there’s a comforting thought:But as bills arrive, comfort gives way to confusion. There are deductions for choosing a certain room, charges for procedures that aren’t included, and diagnostic costs that must be paid out of pocket. Suddenly, what looked like full protection feels anything but that.This isn’t just one person’s story, it’s increasingly common. And it raises a critical question: is your health insurance truly designed for the way healthcare works today?Healthcare has evolved dramatically over the last decade. There are more treatment options, earlier interventions, and a broader focus on prevention and recovery. With that has come a rise in costs, even for everyday care.Yet not all insurance plans have kept pace. While many policies offer a dependable foundation, some still have limitations that can leave policyholders exposed.Let’s take a closer look at what this means in real life.Imagine your policy has a room rent cap of ₹4,000. You’re admitted to a hospital and opt for a private room that exceeds the cap by ₹1,000 a day. Because of this, your entire claim; doctor’s fees, medicines, procedures, and tests; is reimbursed at only 80-90% on the claim.That one small upgrade leads to proportionally lower payouts across your bill. Plus, non-medical items like admission kits and registration fees aren’t covered; leaving you to cover the gap out of your pocket.These are part of your everyday healthcare journey. Having a policy that covers it all is crucial.Out-of-pocket healthcare spending in India continues to be high. Even with insurance, individuals often bear a significant share of healthcare costs.As health needs become more complex, insurance cover should reflect that shift. A good comprehensive health plan is structured around how people actually seek and receive care across hospitals, clinics and homes.Take, for example, a couple planning a family. A comprehensive plan would ensure maternity benefits are accessible, newborn care is covered from day one, and even vaccinations are included in the first year.Similarly, someone undergoing surgery should have access to pre-operative diagnostics, a second opinion if needed, and rehabilitation support post-discharge.A coverage that supports the entire spectrum, from pre-hospitalisation to post-recovery, secures both health and finances. A thoughtfully designed health policy not only responds to illness but anticipates life’s medical milestones. These features are what define meaningful coverage:Covering medical expenses before admission and after discharge helps manage the full treatment arc.Especially valuable for critical illnesses, this provides clarity and confidence before proceeding further.If the full coverage amount is used, it’s automatically restored for future use in the same year.Often overlooked, certain policies offer support for acute dental or eye-related treatments.Good comprehensive plans cover both the recipient’s treatment and the donor’s hospitalisation, including complications.Some plans offer home care; useful for post-surgery recovery, chronic illnesses or conditions that require clinical supervision without hospitalisation.For couples facing fertility challenges, some plans offer financial support for assisted reproductive procedures, helping make parenthood more accessible.Covers delivery expenses (normal or caesarean), congenital conditions, and early vaccinations for your baby.If recommended for obesity-related health issues like diabetes or cardiac risks, this is included after a waiting period.Some health plans now reward healthy habits with wellness points that are redeemable for renewal discounts.Select plans also include free expert teleconsultations and AI-based face scan to track vitals making preventive care digital-first and accessible.Regular check-ups are often included as part of the cover, encouraging preventive care and early detection of potential health issues.If you’re unsure whether your plan is truly comprehensive, use this checklist.It’s easy to treat health insurance as a box to tick. But when life takes a turn what matters is whether your cover holds up. Taking the time to reassess your plan is not only prudent, but essential. The right cover is the one that stands by you through the full spectrum of health: hospital, home, recovery, and beyond.That’s why it helps to go with an insurer that has seen it all. With over 19 years of experience and 1 crore+ claims settled, STAR Health has shaped its policies around the realities people face every day.Because in healthcare, the true cost is not what you pay for a policy; It’s what you pay when your policy falls short.","Maternity care often comes with a long waiting period or may not be included at all. dental and ophthalmic treatments are typically excluded, even though they’re common medical needs.

The United States deployed its B-2 Spirit bombers in Sunday's strikes on three key nuclear facilities in Iran. The aircraft, sometimes also referred to as the “Stealth” bomber, has an Indian connection - a naturalized US citizen from India was involved in the development of the plane's propulsion system.The engineer, Mumbai-born Noshir Gowadia, was later sentenced to over 30 years in prison for sharing classified military information with China, with which Beijing developed a cruise missile exhaust system to make Chinese cruise missiles resistant to detection.According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Gowadia, now 81, was first arrested in October 2005 on a criminal complaint which alleged that he ""wilfully communicated"" national defense-related information to a person ""not entitled to receive it.""As per information produced during the trial, Gowadia worked with Northrop Grumman Corporation - the makers of B2 bombers - for almost 20 years, from approximately 1968 to 1986. During this time, he contributed to the development of the unique propulsion system and low observable capabilities of the B-2; he also continued to work on classified matters as a contractor with the with the United States government until 1997, when his security clearance was revoked.Evidence displayed at the trial showed that Gowadia visited China six times between June 2003 and July 2005 to provide defense services in the form of design, test support and test data analysis of technologies for the purpose of helping Beijing build a cruise missile system by developing a stealthy exhaust nozzle.At the time of his arrest, Gowadia had been paid at least $110,000 by the Chinese.Gowadia was found guilty in August 2010, following six days of deliberation after a trial spanning nearly four months in Honolulu. In January 2011, he was handed a jail term of 32 years.(This is a top Google Trends topic)",Mumbai-born Noshir Gowadia was sentenced to over 30 years in prison for sharing classified military information with China.

MUMBAI: Uddhav and Raj Thackeray will hold a joint protest march of their parties here on July 5 against what they allege is the imposition of Hindi in Maharashtra's schools from Class 1 through the new three-language policy.This will be the first time that the two will come together on a political platform after Raj's decision to quit Shiv Sena to form MNS nearly two decades ago.There has been speculation of a possible reunion of the estranged cousins for the coming civic polls; the protest march is being seen as the first step in that direction.Initially, Uddhav and Raj had on Thursday announced two separate marches: on July 6 and 7 respectively.According to Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut, Raj dialled him Friday and said it would not be good to hold two marches for the Marathi language in this way and a joint movement could have a big impact. Raut said he then spoke to Uddhav, who agreed ""without hesitation."" The march will mostly be from Girgaum Chowpatty to Azad Maidan. Both parties have said it will be non-political and no party flags will be displayed.MNS functionary Sandeep Deshpande and Sena (UBT) MLA Varun Sardesai also met on Friday at a restaurant in Dadar (W), further fuelling speculation that the parties would come together not just for the protest but for the BMC polls too.Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray also met Deshpande at an event on Friday, where they greeted each other; Deshpande has fought the 2024 assembly polls against Aaditya from Worli and lost.Marathi language expert Deepak Pawar, who had called for a protest on July 7, said Marathi language activists will join the July 5 protest and continue protests on July 7 if govt doesn't roll back its three-language policy. The opposition and several groups have criticized the state govt, alleging it is trying to impose Hindi as the third language, though the govt has said Hindi is not mandatory.After issuing a GR on June 17 on the third-language policy, the govt took two steps back this week, first by saying it would have wide-ranging consultations before finalizing the policy and second by saying the third language would be taught via the play-way method, only orally, in Class 1 and 2, with no textbooks for students and no tests or exams.Raut said Raj initially told him he had no idea about the UBT Sena's march.When he discussed Raj's message of having one march with Uddhav Thackeray , Raut said that ""he said he too was not in favour of a separate march but as July 6 is Ashadhi Ekadashi, it would be difficult to reach the people. I conveyed this to Raj Thackeray. After talking to Uddhav Thackeray, we suggested July 5 as the date. Raj Thackeray agreed to it after talking to his colleagues... This march will be without any political agenda. Through it, govt will see the strength of the Marathi people.""Education minister Dada Bhuse had met Raj on Thursday to explain the govt's stand, but Raj had said the govt's view wasn't acceptable. Deshpande said, ""Raj Thackeray took the initiative and called Sanjay Raut and the date of the march was decided. We are inviting all parties, including Marathi-loving office-bearers of BJP and Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena.""It's a good thing the Thackerays are keeping aside political differences and coming together as Marathi manoos. They will decide if they will come together politically. For now, we are focusing on the march.""The protest will change the political direction of Maharashtra. The protest is not Raj or Uddhav Thackeray's, it belongs to the Marathi manoos.""Sardesai said there was dialogue between Sena (UBT) and MNS. ""We are asking everyone to join the protest, so we met to plan the march,"" he said.MNS functionaries said they were reaching out to Congress, NCP and NCP (SP) netas along with other parties and organisations to invite them for the march.",Uddhav and Raj Thackeray will hold a joint protest march of their parties on July 5. This will be the first time that the two will come together on a political platform.

Mazagon Dock's Lanka deal to give India big foothold in region,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mazagon-docks-lanka-deal-to-give-india-big-foothold-in-region/articleshow/122120471.cms,"Lanka deal to herald our emergence as global player: MDL

NEW DELHI: In a major development, Mumbai-based defence shipyard Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited is poised to acquire a controlling stake in Sri Lanka's largest shipyard, Colombo Dockyard PLC (CDPLC), in a deal worth almost $53 million.The move marks the first international acquisition by India's largest shipyard that builds submarines, warships and other vessels, and will provide it with a 'strategic foothold' in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).China, of course, has made deep strategic inroads into Sri Lanka. Chinese Navy's expanding presence in IOR, along with its hunt for additional logistical hubs in the region, has emerged as a major security challenge for India.The $53 million investment will be carried out through a combination of primary infusion and secondary share purchases, including the acquisition of shares from Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd, the current majority shareholder.Upon completion, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions, Colombo Dockyard PLC (CDPLC) will become a subsidiary of Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL). Mazagon Dock chairman and managing director Capt Jagmohan told TOI that the proposed acquisition of a controlling stake in CDPLC, which has been approved, is a ""gateway"" towards achieving the shipyard's ambition of transforming into a regional maritime player first and then into a global shipbuilding enterprise.""With CDPLC's strategic location at Colombo port, proven capabilities, and strong regional presence, this step will position MDL as a key player in South Asia and lay the foundation for our emergence as a global shipyard,"" Capt Jagmohan said.CDPLC has more than five decades of experience in shipbuilding, ship repair and heavy engineering. ""It has a track record of delivering complex offshore support vessels, cable-laying ships, tankers and patrol boats for clients across Japan, Norway, France, the UAE, India and several African nations,"" another MDL official said.CDPLC is currently pursuing a pipeline of orders over $300 million, which includes cable-laying ships, multi-purpose utility ships and newbuild fleet support vessels.""With MDL's support, particularly in technology sharing, access to Indian supply chains, and entry into Indian and allied maritime markets, CDPLC is well positioned for a financial turnaround and long-term growth,"" the official said.MDL, on its part, continues to do well in India. In partnership with German company ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), MDL is on course to bag the mega project to build six new stealth diesel-electric submarines for the Navy. The initial cost of these submarines, with both land-attack cruise missiles and air-independent propulsion (AIP) for greater underwater endurance, was estimated to be around Rs 43,000 crore when it got the 'acceptance of necessity (AoN)' by the defence ministry several years ago. It will now be around Rs 70,000 crore, as reported earlier by TOI.Another major contract for MDL in the pipeline is the proposed construction of another three French-origin Scorpene submarines with AIP at a cost of around Rs 38,000 crore. These three new submarines, if approved, will add to the six Scorpene or Kalvari-class submarines already built at MDL for over Rs 23,000 crore.","Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited is poised to acquire a controlling stake in Sri Lanka's largest shipyard.

'Water is Our New Red Line': Pakistan Army Chief Warns India Over Indus Waters Treaty Suspension

Neutral expert backed Indian projects

Significance of IWT

What is Indus Waters Treaty?

India Will Talk To Pakistan Only On Terror, No Indus Water For Now: Jaishankar's BIG WARNING

NEW DELHI: India on Friday dismissed the Court of Arbitration under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty as illegal, firmly rejecting its authority.The ministry of external affairs snubbed the “supplemental award” by the ""illegal"" Court of Arbitration for asserting its authority to hear the Kishenganga and Ratle hydropower cases in Jammu and Kashmir.The ministry also highlighted that the court was constituted in violation of the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960.Supplemental award issued by the Court of Arbitration refers to a follow-up decision specifically on whether the tribunal has the legal authority (competence) to hear the case about India’s Kishenganga and Ratle projects -- not on the projects themselves, but on the court’s jurisdiction.""India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,"" the MEA statement said.After the dastardly Pakistan-backed terrorist attack in Pahalgam, the government placed the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.In a strong statement, the foreign ministry said the treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan ""credibly and irrevocably"" ceases its support for cross-border terrorism.""Until such time that the Treaty is in abeyance, India is no longer bound to perform any of its obligations under it,"" the statement said.""India, therefore, categorically rejects this so-called supplemental award as it has rejected all prior pronouncements of this body,"" the issue read.Calling the move a ""charade at Pakistan’s behest"", the government called the ""supplemental award"" another desperate attempt by Islamabad to escape accountability for its role as the global epicentre of terrorism.""Pakistan's resort to this fabricated arbitration mechanism is consistent with its decades-long pattern of deception and manipulation of international forums,"" the ministry added.This year in January, a neutral expert upheld India's stand after seven questions were raised in relation to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects on matters related to the Indus water treaty.""India welcomes the decision given by the neutral expert under Paragraph 7 of Annexure F to the Indus Waters Treaty, 1960. The decision upholds and vindicates India’s stand that all seven (07) questions that were referred to the Neutral Expert, in relation to the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects, are differences falling within his competence under the Treaty,"" MEA said after the decision.""It has been India’s consistent and principled position that the Neutral Expert alone has the competence under the treaty to decide these differences. Having upheld his own competence, which comports with India’s view, the neutral expert will now proceed to the next (merits) phase of his proceeding. This phase will culminate in a final decision on the merits of each of the seven differences,"" it added.In 2017, the World Bank, which is the facilitator of the treaty, had said that India was allowed to construct hydroelectric power facilities on tributaries of the Jhelum and Chenab rivers with certain restrictions under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).IWT was signed between India and Pakistan for sharing of waters of the Indus Basin. Under the treaty, the total waters of the eastern rivers - Sutlej, Beas and Ravi - was allocated to India for unrestricted use while the waters of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - was allocated largely to Pakistan.India is, however, permitted to use the water of western rivers for domestic use, irrigation and generation of hydro-electric power. But India has not been fully utilising its legal share due to lack of storage capacity.Though India has right to create water storage capacity up to 3.6 million acre-feet on western rivers as per IWT, not enough storage capacity has been created. Besides, out of estimated power potential of 20,000 MW, which can be harnessed from power projects on western rivers, only 3,482 MW capacity has been constructed.","India rejects the Court of Arbitration under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty as illegal.

For them, this is not just a spectacle; it’s a field laboratory where decades of preparation for India’s human spaceflight future are converging into real, tactile understanding.“This is the first time we’re seeing these operations up close—till now, it was all just documentation,” said a senior Isro official closely involved with the mission. “For us, this hands-on exposure is valuable. Add to this the science Shux will do at ISS, and it only gets better.”Part of Isro’s delegation are eight engineers, Isro doctors and one doctor from IAF’s Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM), which was involved in the initial screening and selection of astronauts for India’s Gaganyaan On Thursday, the team got rare observational experience spread across the Johnson Space Center (JSC) and Axiom’s Mission Control in Houston. These individuals aren’t simply shadowing American counterparts; they’re embedded observers in restricted environments where much of the true know-how of human spaceflight resides.For instance, on the day the Dragon capsule docked with the ISS, the Isro team was not just allowed into the JSC to watch operations unfold live. “We were on the audio loop, listening to mission control discussions. We saw what control operations did, how many docking attempts were made, what kind of error parameters were being monitored. These are not things you’ll find in any public webcast or document,” the official said.While Nasa does publish mission sequences, the real-time judgement calls, procedural fluidity, and console data are generally inaccessible to the outside world — unless, as in this case, you’re a partner with boots on the ground.Isro’s access will deepen further. “They’re setting up a dedicated conference room for us, where live console data will flow in,” the official said. There’s more than docking being studied.With Gaganyaan planning to carry out multiple docking ops in the years ahead — and with India’s future space station on the horizon — Isro engineers are keen to absorb the choreography of mission ops in real environments.“We’ve done one docking so far. But a space station will require many. Watching this from inside Nasa's systems gives us critical learning that we can’t replicate in India just yet.”Medical operations, too, are under the Isro lens. Two doctors from the agency are part of the Houston team and are already participating in alternate-day medical conferences with Shukla aboard the ISS.“It’s a private medical conference link—used routinely by Nasa and Axiom—and our doctors are now involved in that process. This is how they’ll learn the medical rhythms of human spaceflight,” the official said.As part of India’s learning curve in astronaut rehabilitation and post-flight recovery, the doctors will also observe Shukla’s reconditioning phases, both immediately after his return and during follow-up weeks in the US.The team is split between Axiom’s control centre and JSC’s, depending on the operation. While JSC largely handles docking and mission dynamics, Axiom leads crew management, flight surgeon coordination and private astronaut interfaces.Axiom’s mission centre is where people from Hungary and Poland are stationed too but because they don’t have Nasa agreement like Isro does, they don’t have JSC access like the Indian space agency.

A local court in south Kashmir’s Anantnag on Friday rejected the bail application of a man accused of raping a 70-year-old Maharashtrain tourist in Pahalgam over two months ago, stating that the “revered” and elderly guest “was treated so shockingly in a land of saints and seers”, that she would forever regret her choice to visit Kashmir.“It is not an isolated act to be ignored, but a reflection of a highest degree of depravity and sick mentality prevailing in the society, which must bow its head in shame and invites a serious introspection as to what it stood for, and how that has now collapsed,” principal sessions judge Tahir Khurshid Raina said.The alleged crime occurred on April 11. The prosecution told the court that the woman was alone in her hotel room in Pahalgam when the accused barged in, gagged her using a blanket, and raped her before fleeing through the window of the room.“This court, which every day witnesses the reflection of the probity level of this society, expresses its concern that it is hopelessly getting eroded on various fronts,” the judge said. The sooner the “sheet-anchors, conscious keepers, watchdogs, and philanthropists of this society” rise to the occasion to check what is going wrong in the moral front of the society, the better it will be for saving Kashmir as the “paradise on earth in its truest sense”, he said.“Mere meadows, mountains, lush green fields, forests, springs, rivers, rivulets and gardens will not come to the rescue of Kashmir as a desired tourist destination,” Raina added.The judge said Kashmir’s rich cultural values, combined with hospitality par excellence, have attracted tourists from across the world. These tourists, in turn, have enriched the culture and value system of Kashmir to a level that matches the global standard of civilisation.Raina said the crime has “cast a shadow over the said legacy of Kashmir” and also relates to Pahalgam, which is not known in the world today for good reasons, contrary to the status it enjoyed in the past.",A local court in south Kashmir’s Anantnag on Friday rejected the bail application of a man accused of raping a 70-year-old tourist. The alleged crime occurred on April 11.

""I share good relations with the descendants of the Salar Jung family, so they gifted the land to me,"" he said.Police commissioner Pravin Pawar said Thursday that Jawed was summoned based on a complaint by a lawyer from Parbhani, flagging the ""hibanama"" (gift deed) in his name for what is regarded as ""prime land"" at Dawoodpura along Jalna Road in Sambhajinagar.""We will scan Jawed's income tax returns and details of any other source of income. He needs to explain why anyone from the Salar Jung family would make a gift deed in his name, giving away three acres in a prime location,"" inspector Sambhaji Pawar, part of the EOW team probing the land transfer, told TOI.Members of the Salar Jung family who signed the deed - Mir Mazhar Ali Khan and six of his relatives - are still to respond to EOW's notice to have their statements recorded, the officer said.Vilas, who represents Paithan constituency, protested against police allegedly dragging him and his father into the controversy over a land transfer deed in Jawed's name. ""EOW officials questioned me, too. Although Jawed is our driver, we don't have control over everything he does. In any case, hibanama is a legally valid process of gifting assets,"" he said.Several members of the Salar Jung family served as prime ministers to the erstwhile Nizams of Hyderabad.The gift deed executed by Mazhar Ali and six others states that they received their share of three out of 12 acres belonging to the clan at Bagsherganj in Dawoodpura after a prolonged litigation lasting till Jan 30, 2023. Police have found out that the gift deed in favour of Jawed was executed around the same time.Lawyer Mujahid Khan, whose complaint led EOW to initiate the probe, said his curiosity was piqued by the fact that Jawed wasn't even remotely related to the Salar Jung clan.""Why would the descendants of Salar Jung from Hyderabad give a gift deed to a person working as a driver in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, and that too after winning a legal battle for the same property. Also, a hibanama is legally valid only between blood relatives. The Salar Jung descendants and the driver are not only unrelated, they belong to two different sects of Islam.""Repeated calls to numbers belonging to members of the Salar Jung family went unanswered.","Jawed Rasul Shaikh is Shiv Sena MP Sandipanrao Bhumre's driver.

NEW DELHI: Data from a black box of the Air India Dreamliner that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12 has been downloaded at Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau lab, govt said Thursday. Intitial information about causes leading to the accident is likely to be known in the next seven to 10 days.With the black boxes being examined locally, the final report is expected to be out in a month, instead of the six-month time frame given earlier, sources said. Civil aviation ministry said the crash protection module from the front black box was safely retrieved, and on Wednesday, the memory module was accessed.While the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of AI-171 which crashed within minutes of take-off was recovered on June 13, the Flight Data Recorders (FDR) were found in the debris three days later. Like the earlier practice, this time too, there were plans to send the black boxes to the US for examination, especially as it involved the first Dreamliner crash. But on the suggestion of the top leadership, it was decided to send them to the AAIB lab, sources said.As a result, the two were flown to Delhi in separate Indian Air Force planes last Tuesday.""The analysis of CVR and FDR data is under way.

Palm Beach Gardens is about to become a hotbed for youth hockey and ice sports—thanks to the backing of NHL legend Wayne Gretzky. A brand-new indoor ice facility is set to break ground this July at Plant Drive Park, bringing year-round skating opportunities to South Florida in a move that blends elite hockey pedigree with strong community engagement.The project is a collaboration between the City of Palm Beach Gardens and the Palm Beach North Athletic Foundation, which successfully raised the funds to bring the vision to life. While Florida is known more for its beaches than its blue lines, the upcoming venue will give local athletes a chance to lace up their skates in a state-of-the-art environment—and do so under the influence of “The Great One.”The new facility won’t just be another ice rink—it’s set to become a premier destination for hockey development in the region. Highlighting its launch will be the Gretzky Invitational, a youth hockey tournament expected to attract top young talent from across North America.Alongside the tournament, the facility will also host training camps operated by the Gretzky Hockey School, a program known for developing youth players with a strong emphasis on skill, discipline, and love of the game.By tying his name to the facility and lending his brand to its programming, Gretzky is continuing his lifelong mission to grow the sport beyond traditional hockey markets.While hockey is front and center, the new complex is designed to serve a broad array of ice sports. It will also accommodate figure skating competitions and offer public access for recreational skating year-round. This gives Palm Beach Gardens residents a unique recreational resource that is rare in South Florida—and opens doors for kids who previously had limited access to the sport.Also Read: Who are Wayne Gretzky’s kids and what do they do?

The Minnesota Timberwolves lock in Sixth Man of the Year Naz Reid with a massive extension



The Minnesota Timberwolves may have solved one of their biggest offseason puzzles before free agency even opened. According to multiple reports, Naz Reid is expected to remain in Minnesota after agreeing to a five-year contract worth up to $125 million. The 25-year-old forward has declined his $15 million player option to sign a long-term extension, a move that shows the franchise’s confidence in his growing role alongside rising superstar Anthony Edwards Shams Charania of ESPN broke the news on X: “Just in: Minnesota Timberwolves' Naz Reid intends to sign a new five-year, $125 million contract to stay with the franchise, including a player option, sources tell ESPN. Critical agreement between the Wolves and Reid's agents, Sean Kennedy and Jeff Schwartz of Excel Sports.”Charania followed up with added context that shows how rare Reid’s decision is in today’s NBA . “Reid declined a $15 million player option for next season and chose to stay with Minnesota despite a vibrant market developing of teams interested with similar money but with starting roles. The 2024 Sixth Man of the Year and Minnesota are locked in for the long term.”Reid has been one of the crucial superstars of the Timberwolves’ postseason success, helping them reach back-to-back Western Conference Finals.He averaged a career-best 14.2 points per game last season while also becoming a vital part of their offensive spacing. His ability to stretch the floor makes him a valuable partner to Rudy Gobert and Julius Randle. His partnership and support of Anthony Edwards in the games will continue.Charania added more weight to his value: “He is one of just three NBA players over the last three seasons to score 2,000 points off the bench.” That level of production is rare for non-starters, making the Timberwolves’ commitment easier to justify.Also Read: Magic Johnson and his wife Cookie Johnson enjoy a yacht costume party during their Greece summer getaway [See Pic] Still, questions remain about the long-term structure.

Microsoft sued by authors for allegedly using pirated books to train AI model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/microsoft-sued-by-authors-for-allegedly-using-pirated-books-to-train-ai-model/articleshow/122088854.cms,"Authors accuse Microsoft of copyright infringement

Lawsuit demands damages and a court injunction

Legal backdrop: A turning point in AI copyright battles

Microsoft yet to respond publicly

A growing challenge for the AI industry





A group of prominent authors, including Pulitzer Prize winner Kai Bird and New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino, has filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, accusing the tech giant of illegally using pirated versions of their books to train its AI model known as “Megatron. ” Filed in a New York federal court on June 25, the suit claims that Microsoft copied nearly 200,000 copyrighted works without permission to develop AI systems that mimic the authors’ unique writing styles, themes, and voices. This marks another major legal challenge in the growing debate over AI training and copyright law.The plaintiffs allege that Microsoft used a massive dataset of pirated digital books to train Megatron, a generative AI model designed to produce human-like text. According to the complaint, the AI’s ability to replicate the tone, syntax, and narrative patterns of copyrighted works demonstrates a clear violation of intellectual property rights. The authors argue that their creative output was exploited to build a product that competes with them in the marketplace, without their consent or compensation.The writers are seeking statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work, along with a court order to block Microsoft from continuing its alleged unauthorised use of their materials.While the exact number of infringed titles remains unclear, the plaintiffs claim that thousands of authors’ works may have been used without licence or attribution. The case could set a precedent for how courts handle AI training involving copyrighted content.This lawsuit comes just one day after a California judge ruled that AI firm Anthropic may have made “fair use” of copyrighted material in training but could still be liable for using pirated versions of books. It was the first US decision to address the legality of using copyrighted texts in generative AI development. The Microsoft case adds further momentum to a wave of lawsuits from writers, artists, and media outlets challenging how their work is used by tech companies.According to Reuters, Microsoft has not issued an official response to the allegations. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment when contacted by reporters. Meanwhile, legal observers say this case will be closely watched for its implications on the future of AI development and intellectual property rights.Tech firms including Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic have all faced similar legal scrutiny in recent time. The central argument from the companies is that using public data for AI training qualifies as “fair use” under US copyright law. However, rights holders argue that this approach undermines creators' control and devalues their work. As AI models become increasingly sophisticated, courts should define clearer boundaries around what constitutes ethical and legal data usage.","Lawsuit demands damages and a court injunction against Microsoft.

70% of Indian teens spend 7 hours online: ISKCON monk warns of mental health fallout

A spiritual path grounded in scientific wisdom



Gauranga Das’s unique approach to leadership



Books that bridge the gap between worlds



The Art of Resilience

The Art of Focus

In a moment that appealed to seekers of spirituality as well as tech enthusiasts, there was an unforgettable exchange between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The discussion between them, which had started lively with a jocular remark about being youthful, soon turned into an introspective discussion on the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility.Gauranga Das, a graduate from IIT Bombay, who now heads programs in sustainable living and spiritual education, used the moment to highlight some of the most pressing concerns of our digital times - mental health and the increasing digital addiction epidemic.The difference between these two IIT graduates was more than physical or professional; it was philosophical. While one sits at the head of one of the most influential tech giants in the world, the other has dedicated his life to leading people to inner understanding and spiritual direction. The meeting wasn't merely a reunion; it was a comparison of two radically different directions based on the same intellectual heritage. It was an effective metaphor for the decisions contemporary society must make today: progress without equilibrium, or innovation backed by internal wellness.Gauranga Das and Sundar Pichai, though having started at the same time at IIT, followed different career paths early on in life. Pichai went into technology and became the CEO of Google, a company that is at the heart of the digital revolution. Das instead went down the path of spiritual discovery and service, becoming an ISKCON member and dedicating himself to bringing ancient wisdom into modern settings.Their meeting at the India Global Forum 2025 was noticed when Pichai noted the way young Gauranga Das looked compared to his age. Das responded with an answer that went viral instantly for its simplicity and profundity:This one sentence highlighted a wider discussion regarding what it means to live from purpose rather than performance. It also spawned a wider debate regarding how spiritual tools can assist with coping with rising levels of stress inflicted as a result of round-the-clock digital interaction.In his address to the forum, Gauranga Das reported shocking statistics regarding digital addiction, specifically social media. Based on the information he provided, more than 230 million individuals globally are addicted to social media. In India alone, 70% of adolescents spend as much as seven hours per day on the net, a figure that indicates increasing worry for parents, teachers, and mental health professionals.Das linked these figures to the wider problem of declining mental health worldwide. Referring to world trends, he identified that one in seven individuals is presently suffering from some sort of mental health difficulty. These are anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and chronic stress; maladies that are increasingly being attributed to excessive exposure to digital content and a mindfulness deficit in daily life.This was not simply an attack on technology, but a call to awaken to how we engage with it. Das leveraged the platform to promote a more holistic digital life, one that includes frequent breaks, mindful use, and spiritual anchoring.Gauranga Das is not only a monk who has spiritual wisdom; he is also an engineer who has been trained and who has a deep understanding of how technology functions and how it may affect human psychology. This makes him uniquely qualified in matters that lie at the interface between science and spirituality.Das is also a senior member of the Governing Body Commission of ISKCON and the director of Govardhan Ecovillage (GEV), a green living community that was established under the inspiration of Radhanath Swami. GEV is not only an ashram, it is a widely acclaimed model of how to apply ancient wisdom to modern sustainability practices. It won the UN World Tourism Organization Award in 2017, and it is also accredited with key United Nations organisations such as UNEP, ECOSOC, UNCCD, and CBD.Under Das's stewardship, GEV has turned into an exemplar of the way communities can be in harmony with nature yet maintain essential spiritual principles. It should not be astonishing that numerous young professionals, such as engineers, physicians, and policy makers, now journey to the Ecovillage for leadership training and retreats.Aside from his work in the Ecovillage, Gauranga Das also heads the Govardhan School of Public Leadership, an institution that prepares wannabe civil servants of India.

These books have spoken to spiritual seekers as well as working professionals seeking down-to-earth, real-life counsel on surviving life's stress.In interviews and talks, Das has consistently emphasised that spiritual tools are not exclusive to monks or renunciants.

What is the Ganga water agreement between India and Bangladesh?

The water-sharing agreement of 1996 between India and Bangladesh was established to resolve disputes regarding the Farakka water allocation.

The discord arose following the 1975 activation of the Farakka barrage, which channelled water from the Ganges to the Hooghly River to ensure the Calcutta port remained navigable.

The agreement established terms between India, the upstream nation, and Bangladesh, the downstream nation, for sharing Ganges water at Farakka - a barrier constructed on river Bhagirathi, approximately 10 kilometres from Bangladesh's border.

The Farakka Barrage's construction facilitated a 40,000 cusecs water diversion into a feeder canal serving the Kolkata Port Trust.

The current protocol allocates 35,000 cusecs of water alternately to both nations for 10-day periods during the lean season from March 11 to May 11.

Ganges Water Sharing Treaty with Bangladesh to be revised?

While renewal requires mutual agreement, New Delhi is eyeing a fresh treaty that addresses its present developmental requirements, sources told ET.The agreement, which was formalised in 1996 when Sheikh Hasina began her first tenure as Bangladesh's Prime Minister, established a framework for distributing Ganga's flow at the Farakka Barrage in West Bengal during the critical dry period from January 1 to May 31 annually.Also Read | China plays hardball!

According to these sources, India seeks to modify the treaty to accommodate its requirements for irrigation, harbour maintenance, and electricity production.The West Bengal administration reportedly supports the Central government's position, considering that the treaty's existing provisions are insufficient for their requirements.Also Read | India bleeds Pakistan dry: Water at ‘dead’ levels in Pakistan's dams; bigger Indus river plans in the works - top points to know","The water-sharing agreement of 1996 between India and Bangladesh was established to resolve disputes regarding the Farakka water allocation.

“It was an opportunity that allowed me to film my autobiographical movie, The Requiem Boogie, in the house where so many childhood memories in it actually took place. It has been a very special and magical four years. Collectively and in coordination with Mr. Musk and his team, we took the steps we are taking now.”

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reportedly reclaimed ownership of actor Gene Wilder ’s iconic Bel-Air home after the late star’s nephew, Jordan Walker-Pearlman , defaulted on a loan he received from the tech billionaire to purchase the property in 2020. Musk initially acquired the single-family Los Angeles home in 2013 for $6.7 million. In 2020, he had expressed intentions to sell the property, stating at the time that he planned to “own no house.” It was later revealed that Musk had lent Walker-Pearlman and his wife, Elizabeth Hunter, $6.7 million to buy the home from him. However, the couple reportedly fell behind on loan payments, prompting Musk to move to foreclose on the property in July 2024.According to a report by Realtor.com, Musk had planned a public auction for the property in December 2024.

The asking price was later reduced to $9.5 million in November 2024.That same month, Walker-Pearlman and Hunter were notified that the property was scheduled for auction in December 2024.

Investment will continue, with or without Microsoft: Softbank CEO

SoftBank is ‘all in’ on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. CEO and Founder Masayoshi Son said the company is betting heavily on the artificial intelligence startup, with planned investments worth 4.8 trillion Japanese yen (around $33.2 billion). Son said he believes OpenAI, currently unlisted and not profitable, will eventually become “the most valuable company in the world.” Speaking at a shareholder meeting, Son said SoftBank’s long-term goal is to play a leading role in the era of artificial superintelligence (ASI)—a concept he described as AI that is 10,000 times smarter than humans. The Japanese tech conglomerate has been expanding its partnership with OpenAI this year, including joining the $500 billion Stargate project.During the meeting, Son also revealed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had once asked SoftBank for a $10 billion investment before Microsoft signed its now well-known partnership with the AI firm. “I said, yes, I would,” Son told shareholders. But Altman eventually went with Microsoft.Microsoft recently lost its exclusive cloud provider status with OpenAI and hasn’t approved a reported restructuring plan to make OpenAI a traditional for-profit company.Despite the changing relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, Son said SoftBank’s commitment remains firm. The company earlier stated it might reduce its stake if OpenAI doesn’t restructure by December 31, but Son clarified on Friday that their support will continue “regardless of what happens with Microsoft.”Masayoshi Son says OpenAI is key to SoftBank’s vision of building the world’s largest ASI platform. He aims for the company to become the “organizer of the industry in the artificial superintelligence era” within the next decade.SoftBank owns Arm, the UK-based chip company, and recently acquired U.S.-based chip designer Ampere for $6.5 billion. It is also reportedly exploring the creation of a $1 trillion AI-focused industrial complex in the United States.","SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son says the company is betting heavily on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.

How PewDiePie’s T-Series showdown became a symbol of creator independence

Felix Kjellberg, popularly known as PewDiePie , has officially fallen out of; a major moment for a creator who once reigned supreme. This shift reflects more than just subscriber numbers; it highlights YouTube's evolving algorithm, the rise of Shorts-based creators like, and PewDiePie’s own transition toward a quieter, family-focused life in Japan. Once the face of independent content creation, he now uploads occasionally for fun, no longer driven by metrics. Though no longer at the top, his legacy as a pioneer of online content and YouTube culture remains unmatched and deeply influential.PewDiePie started his YouTube career in 2010 with simple gaming Let's Plays. His unpolished humour, passionate personality, and genuine interaction allowed him to cut through the initial noise on YouTube. In. Between 2014 and 2017, he was also the, as reported.But PewDiePie was more than just another gamer; instead, he became a figure of independent creator culture, meme culture, and a community-driven paradigm that valued personality above polish. His style changed from horror gaming to vlogs, comedy sketches, meme reviews, and music, and he became one of the most diverse creators on the platform. Time magazine acknowledged his cultural influence inby including him on theirhas finally surpassedof leading the top positions on YouTube, as revealed in a report by. Kimpro828's short-form, viral content tailored for YouTube Shorts has seen his channel gain immense subscriber bases, helping him surpass PewDiePie to take theThis progression emphasizes a significant change in YouTube's algorithmic priority. Whereas PewDiePie previously dominated with long-form, personality-focused uploads, his exclusion from the Shorts platform has emerged as a turning point in his fall in rankings. He has never made a single YouTube Short, while others such as kimpro828 have used the format's blowout reach to drive their growth.In the creator economy today, success is increasingly tied to high-throughput, crew-operated channels optimized for YouTube's algorithmic tastes. Channels such as MrBeast, T-Series, and Cocomelon now dominate the uppermost charts by creating optimized, scalable content for worldwide audiences.Conversely, PewDiePie opted to take a more intimate route, retreating from the competitive pace. He started posting less regularly, prioritizing quality, enjoyment, and relationship building with his core group of followers.he explained to his viewers. PewDiePie’s drop in rankings is no mystery; he has been semi-retired since 2022, following his relocation to Japan with his wife, Marzia Kjellberg (formerly Marzia Bisognin). The couple, who met online in 2011 and got married in 2019 at London’s Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, have embraced a quieter lifestyle.They had their first child, a son, Björn, in 2023. Posting the happy news on Instagram, Marzia captioned, ""11/07/2023 Welcome to the family, little Bjorn."" The duo now concentrates on home life, household renovations, and the occasional update for fans. With fatherhood and a quiet home life on their minds, PewDiePie has clearly opted out of the daily uploads, giving personal contentment more priority over being a dominant force on the platform.Numerous fans nostalgically recall PewDiePie's legendary subscriber war against T-Series in 2019 a campaign that became a cultural phenomenon for YouTube itself. The ""Subscribe to PewDiePie"" movement was a meme bigger than itself; it symbolized creator-driven authenticity against corporate content. Even though he ultimately lost the competition, the face-off managed to rally the online world around the principles PewDiePie stood for: independence, humor, and communion.Now, MrBeast has taken the crown that PewDiePie once held. With more than 408 million subscribers, MrBeast is leading the platform by a wide margin leaving even T-Series far behind with more than 100 million subscribers. Although PewDiePie is no longer part of YouTube's top 10, he perhaps does not need to be any longer. His legacy as the pioneer of digital content is untouchable. He created a template for future creators, made a career on YouTube possible, and demonstrated to the world how one human could wield global power without a brand name behind them.","PewDiePie drops out of YouTube’s top 10 channels after leading generation of creators.

‘It's not too late to change course’: Bill Gates

How to detect hidden cameras in a hotel room, just with your smartphone

Microsoft founder and former CEO Bill Gates has once again raised concerns over the impact of US government cutting funding for global health. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), he warned that this could result in an additional 8 million child deaths by 2024. Gates cited a Lancet study on the cumulative impact of reductions in American aid. “It found that, by 2040, 8 million more children will die before their fifth birthday. To give some context for 8 million: That's how many children live in California, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio combined,” Gates said.In the post, he writes “When the United States and other governments suddenly cut their aid budgets, I know for a fact that more children will die.”He said he has worked in the global health space for over 25 years and has seen how important aid is in saving lives. “Over the past 25 years—the same span of time I spent leading Microsoft—I have immersed myself in global health: building knowledge, deepening expertise, and working to save lives from deadly diseases and preventable causes. During that time, I have built teams of world-class scientists and public health experts at the Gates Foundation , studied health systems across continents, and worked in close partnership with national and local leaders to strengthen the delivery of lifesaving care,” he writes.“Global health aid saves lives. And when that aid is withdrawn—abruptly and without a plan—lives are lost,” Gates warned. “At this point, I know as much about improving health in poor countries as I do about software,” he further stated.Microsoft founder Bill Gates said that U.S. cuts to global health aid are already causing problems. He pointed out that important programs like tuberculosis testing and malaria prevention are slowing down, and life-saving medicines are getting delayed.Gates recently visited Nigeria and Ethiopia and said he saw for himself how healthcare services there are being affected by the funding cuts.Still, Gates said there is time to fix the situation. “It’s not too late to change course,” he wrote on X. He urged the U.S. Congress to restore funding for major programs such as PEPFAR (the U.S. plan for AIDS relief) and the Global Fund.",Microsoft founder and former CEO Bill Gates has once again raised concerns over the impact of US government cutting funding for global health.

HYDERABAD: The full court of the Telangana high court, comprising all its judges, law officers, registrars, and members of the bar, on Friday accorded a warm farewell to Justice G Radha Rani, who demitted office upon superannuation.Acting Chief Justice Sujoy Paul and advocate general A Sudarshan Reddy praised Justice Radha Rani's distinguished judicial career, commending her contributions to jurisprudence, social justice, and unwavering commitment to constitutional values.In his address, the advocate general highlighted her legacy not only through her judicial pronouncements upholding truth and justice, but also her deep concern for a casteless and equitable society. He said that Justice Radha Rani condemned honour killings and consistently emphasised that the law must safeguard individual freedom and equality.She believed caste to be a deep-rooted cause of enduring injustice, and envisioned a casteless society-a vision, the AG said, young generations must strive to realise. Recalling her public engagement, the AG noted that in 2022, Justice Radha Rani participated in the golden jubilee celebrations of the Kula Nirmulana Samithi at Indira Park, where she spoke passionately about the urgent need to eradicate casteism in Indian society.Quoting her words, he said that although India adopted a progressive, people-centric Constitution, the ideals of equality and fraternity are yet to take deep root in public consciousness.In her farewell speech, Justice Radha Rani expressed heartfelt gratitude to her colleagues, staff, and the legal fraternity, reflecting warmly on her time on the bench. She fondly remembered her father, Gurijala Sitaramaiah, a noted humanist who encouraged inter-caste marriages within their own family.","The full court of the Telangana high court, comprising all its judges, law officers, registrars, and members of the bar, on Friday accorded a warm farewell to Justice G Radha Rani.

This deferment occurred because Pranay's wife, Amrutha Varshini, wasn't notified until after arguments began.





HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Friday deferred the hearing of a criminal appeal filed by Thirunagaru Sravan Kumar, one of the convicts in the honour killing of Dalit youth Perumalla Pranay Kumar, which took place in Miryalaguda, Nalgonda district, in 2018.Sravan Kumar has challenged the life sentence awarded to him by a Nalgonda district court and is seeking to have the conviction set aside.The court postponed proceedings after it was brought to its attention that notice had been served to the complainant, Amrutha Varshini, Pranay's wife, only after arguments in the appeal had commenced. Amrutha's counsel strongly objected to the continuation of the hearing, pointing out that substantial submissions had already been made on behalf of the petitioner (Sravan Kumar) before the complainant was formally notified. Sravan Kumar is Amrutha's paternal uncle.The high court said that although it had directed the additional public prosecutor (APP) on April 22, 2025, to ensure that notice was served to Amrutha, the actual serving of notice took place only on June 12, after several rounds of arguments had already taken place.Meanwhile, the public prosecutor (PP) opposed hearing the petition for suspension of sentence, citing the absence of lower court records, which he said were essential for the court to fairly evaluate the appeal.In response, Sravan Kumar's counsel argued that detailed arguments had been presented since May 1, 2025, and all relevant documents were already before the court.However, the court recorded that the high court registry had received the trial court records, and that paper book preparation-a compilation of trial documents for the appeal-was underway as of June 16, 2025.In the interest of procedural fairness and to ensure all parties are adequately represented, the high court ruled that the suspension petition would be heard only after the paper books are completed and shared. It also directed Sravan Kumar's counsel to re-argue the matter in full, once the documents are circulated, to provide the complainant and all parties a fair opportunity to respond.","Thirunagaru Sravan Kumar is one of the convicts in the honour killing of Dalit youth Perumalla Pranay Kumar, which took place in Miryalaguda, Nalgonda district, in 2018.
