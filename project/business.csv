"Digital divide: Working computers in just 57% of India's schools, internet in 54%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/digital-divide-working-computers-in-just-57-of-indias-schools-internet-in-54/articleshow/116867829.cms,"Dropout rates rise from 5.2% in middle school to 10.9% at secondary stage: Study

India's school infrastructure presents a mixed picture of progress and persistent challenges, as highlighted in the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) 2023-24 report. While over 90% of schools have basic amenities like electricity and gender-specific toilets, advanced facilities such as functional desktops, internet access and ramps with handrails remain limited.Only 57.2% of schools have functional computers, 53.9% have internet, and 52.3% are equipped with ramps, underscoring significant gaps in accessibility and tech readiness.The enrolment landscape has seen changes, with total number of students down by 37 lakh to 24.8 crore in 2023-24. Boys account for 51.9% of enrolments and girls 48.1%. The shift from aggregated school-level data to individual student records, facilitated by Aadhaar-linked unique educational IDs, is a step forward. ""Student-wise data gives a more accurate picture of the education system,"" said a ministry official, adding that the new methodology may partly account for the observed variations.This approach marks a departure from the earlier school-level aggregated data, enhancing the monitoring of progression and retention. The introduction of unique educational IDs alongside Aadhaar aims to streamline beneficiary identification for government schemes, reducing duplication and promoting equitable resource distribution.Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) reveals disparities across educational levels. While the preparatory level boasts a GER of 96.5%, the foundational level is at a mere 41.5%. Middle and secondary levels are at 89.5% and 66.5%, respectively. Dropout rates also rise sharply at higher education levels, from 5.2% in middle school to 10.9% at the secondary stage. Retention rates reflect a similar trend, plummeting from 85.4% at the preparatory level to just 45.6% at the secondary stage.Disparities among states further complicate the picture. West Bengal has 79% foundational and preparatory schools but only 11.6% secondary schools, creating a risk of higher dropout rates. Conversely, Chandigarh's 75.6% secondary schools indicate a focus on higher education but highlight a shortage of foundational institutions at 6.1%. Infrastructure gaps and teacher deployment issues exacerbate these challenges. ""Despite efforts under NE, infrastructure gaps hinder our progress toward universal education. Optimising resources is key to meeting the ambitious targets for 2030,"" the ministry official added.Teacher deployment and pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) remain critical issues. Several states, including Jharkhand, Bihar, and West Bengal, exceed NEP-recommended PTR of 30:1 at the secondary level. In contrast, Delhi and Chandigarh have optimal PTRs aligned with NEP norms. However, states such as Assam, Odisha, and Karnataka face underutilised infrastructure due to low student-to-school ratios.NE prioritises inclusion and equity, and UDISE+ data offers a snapshot of representation. Girls constitute 48.1% of total enrolments, and minorities account for 20%, with Muslim students representing 79.6% of this group. Social category data shows that 45.2% of students belong to the OBC category, followed by 18% SC and 9.9% ST students. Aadhaar seeding stands at 79.4% nationally, but states like Meghalaya (24.1%), Bihar (38.8%), and Manipur (51.8%) lag, which could impact targeted interventions.""Universal access to education and reducing dropout rates by 2030 is a primary goal of NE and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),"" the report states. Aadhaar-linked educational IDs enhance dropout tracking and re-enrolment efforts while streamlining governance for schemes like Samagra Shiksha and PM POSHAN.Despite strides in foundational enrolment, transition rates between educational stages remain uneven. While 98.1% of students progress from foundational to preparatory levels, only 83.3% transition from middle to secondary education. These statistics underscore systemic challenges in retaining students and ensuring smooth educational progression. The UDISE+ report serves as a call to action for optimising infrastructure, improving teacher deployment, and addressing disparities in enrolment and retention. These measures are essential for realising NEP's vision of equitable and inclusive education by 2030.","The enrolment landscape has seen changes, with total number of students down by 37 lakh to 24.8 crore in 2023-24.

BHOPAL/INDORE: Trucks carrying hazardous waste left over from the 1984 gas tragedy began rolling out of the abandoned Union Carbide site in Bhopal for a disposal plant in Pithampur, 230km away, on Wednesday night, even as workers of other factories in the industrial estate near Indore voiced concern about their safety.""Transportation to Pithampur has begun. The convoy has been fortified with the highest security protocol ever witnessed in movement of industrial waste in the country,"" said MP gas relief & rehabilitation department director Swatantra Kumar Singh.TOI had reported Wednesday that the trucks were loaded and ready to move. At 9pm, the convoy carrying 337 metric tons of waste in sealed containers set out from Bhopal, escorted by police and emergency vehicles along a green corridor.Forty years of wait and four days of suspense had ended. The scars of the world's worst industrial disaster may never heal, but a chapter from the tragic episode is drawing to a close. It would take about seven hours to reach the final destination, said Singh.The convoy of 40 vehicles stretched over a kilometre. Twelve trucks are carrying the hazardous cargo. It's a no-halt, no-stop journey to Pithampur Waste Management Pvt Ltd, where the waste will be incinerated. Five district administrations are on high alert. Around 700 security personnel have been deployed for the convoy.""The 337 MT of UCIL waste will undergo scientific disposal within three to nine months,"" said Singh.It took strong words from Madhya Pradesh HC to get the administration moving on the long-pending disposal of this toxic waste. ""Are you waiting for another tragedy,"" a division bench of Chief Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Vivek Jain had asked the authorities in their Dec 3 order. HC set a deadline of four weeks to shift the hazardous waste for disposal.Singh has repeatedly assured all safety factors have been taken care of and there is no risk to the environment, land, or people around the disposal plant at Pithampur.On Wednesday, aiming to ease anxiety among Pithampur residents and industrialists about the Union Carbide waste disposal, MP pollution control board regional officer in Indore Shriniwas Dwivedi issued a video statement explaining the safety precautions. ""A special shed has been created with a concrete floor. It is leakproof,"" Dwivedi says in the video, adding: ""No activity will be carried out that will affect the people, farm, property, land or environment.""At Pithampur, however, workers at other plants are worried about potential fallout. ""Employees are scared. We are receiving calls from family members of our employees enquiring about the situation in Pithampur. Some employees have requested leave. The circumstances are extraordinary and everyone is under immense pressure,"" said Dr Darshan Kataria, an industrialist at Pithampur.Another industrialist from Pithampur Sector 2, where the waste disposal factory is situated, said he has lost count of calls made to various govt departments and fellow industrialists regarding contingency measures.""What occurred in Bhopal was an unfortunate accident, but what is happening now can be handled by taking everyone in confidence. It presents a difficult situation and is deeply unsettling for us as we cannot be immune to the problem,"" said Rajendra Modi, director of an engineering products manufacturing unit in Pithampur.Local industrialists say govt officials neither initiated discussions with them nor apprised them about safety measures implemented for industries and residents in proximity to the disposal facility.Swatantra Kumar Singh has, through public statements, repeatedly allayed safety concerns and assured disposal and incineration shall be conducted under expert supervision without any adverse consequences.",Trucks carrying hazardous waste left over from the 1984 gas tragedy began rolling out of the abandoned Union Carbide site in Bhopal. Workers of other factories in the industrial estate near Indore voiced concern about their safety.

2024 was India's hottest year since records began in 1901,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2024-was-indias-hottest-year-since-records-began-in-1901/articleshow/116867730.cms,"Slightly more rainfall than normal in Jan, forecasts IMD

NEW DELHI: 2024 was by far the warmest year on record in the country since 1901, IMD said Wednesday. It also noted that the last three months of the year (Oct-Dec) together were the warmest on record whereas Oct 2024, individually, was the warmest month in 123 years.With an annual mean temperature of 25.75 degrees Celsius, 2024 was 0.65 degree C above the long-term average (1991-2020 period). The previous warmest year, 2016, had an anomaly of 0.54 degree C. As annual averages go, the difference of 0.11 degree C between the mean temperature in 2016 and 2024 is quite huge.The record heat in India was in sync with worldwide rise in annual average temperatures as global warming accelerates. World Meteorological Organisation has observed that 2024 was globally the warmest year on record, exceeding the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degrees C of warming above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels for the first time. This follows on from the record-breaking 1.45 degrees C rise in 2023, the previous globally warmest year on record.Releasing the outlook for January, IMD said monthly minimum (night) temperatures are likely to be ""above normal"" (warmer) over most of India except parts of UP and Rajasthan, some parts of MP and Gujarat and portions of east India such as Bihar, where normal to below normal temperatures are likely.IMD chief M Mohapatra, however, said ""above-normal cold wave days"" are expected over western and northern parts of central India during the month of Jan.Specifically asked about the weather situation in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh (Jan 13-Feb 26), Mohapatra said though there was a possibility of below normal (colder) minimum (night) temperature during the period, IMD would provide more precise forecast closer to the religious festival.Probabilistic forecast map for Jan, released by Met department, shows the possibility of colder day and night (normal to below normal minimum/maximum temperatures) in the region, Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, during the month.Otherwise, the monthly maximum (day) temperatures for Jan are likely to be above normal (warmer) for ""most parts of the country except some parts of the northwest, central and adjoining east India and central parts of South Peninsula"" where it is likely to be normal to below normal.As far as rainfall is concerned, Jan is likely to witness slightly more rainfall than normal rains for the month - a situation which may be helpful for the standing rabi (winter sown) crops during the period if its distribution is uniform.IMD said, ""Monthly rainfall for Jan over north India consisting of seven meteorological subdivisions (East Uttar Pradesh, West Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh) is most likely to be above normal,""It said the monthly rainfall even over the country in Jan is also most likely to be above normal. ""Above-normal rainfall is most likely over most parts of the country except some parts of northwest India and some pockets of the northeast and central India where normal to below normal rainfall is likely,"" said Met department.","2424 was by far the warmest year on record in the country since 1901, IMD said Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister and senior BJP leader Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday said Hindus staying in Bangladesh should not be encouraged to come to India as they are patriotic Bangladeshis who do not want to leave their land despite ""tremendous atrocities"" they face there. He also praised the Hindus in Bangladesh for acting ""very maturely"" by not coming to India. Sarma's remarks evoked a strong retort from the Congress which accused the BJP and RSS of exploiting the plight of Hindus for their political gains.""I explained why the Hindus are not coming. I think the numbers are very less. Whoever wanted to come must have come earlier, thirty or forty years back. These are the people who do not want to come out of Bangladesh. They must have some affinity to the soil of the land. They must be patriotic Bangladeshis. Even after tremendous atrocity they do not want to come out of Bangladesh because their forefathers were in that land. I think we should also not encourage them to come into India. Prime Minister is working overtime to give security and to create a condition of security in Bangladesh itself,"" Sarma said.""Bangladesh Hindu people are acting very maturely and they are not coming. At least we have not detected any Bangladeshi Hindu in Assam in the last five months,"" he added.""We have put the security forces on high alert at the International Border following the unrest in Bangladesh to check infiltration. The police have detected a good number of illegal immigrants on a daily basis along the International Border. However, no Hindu infiltrator from Bangladesh was arrested in the last five months,"" the Assam chief minister said calling the situation ""very worrying.""Reacting sharply to the Assam chief minister's remarks, Congress leader Rashid Alvi accused the BJP and RSS of exploiting the Hindus.""The statement of Assam CM proves that the BJP and RSS only exploit the Hindu community and they have nothing to do with their problems. The BJP and its government at the Centre are anti-Hindu. They are not bothered about what is happening with the Hindus in Bangladesh. Their only objective is to talk about Hindus during elections and provke their sentiments for political gains,"" Alvi said.""There are a lot of Hindus in Bangladesh. Indian government raises this issue only within India for political gains,"" he added.The Assam chief minister also blamed the textile factory owners, especially in Tamil Nadu, for encouraging the infiltration of workers from Bangladesh.""After the unrest in Bangladesh, the textile industry collapsed there. So workers working in the textile industry in Bangladesh are coming to India. They are trying to enter the country to go to the textile industries in Tamil Nadu, and ""owners of these industries are incentivising them to come to get cheap labour. I have also discussed this issue with Union home minister Amit Shah in my last meeting. So this is a very worrying issue for us because we have never detected so many infiltrators before,"" Himanta Biswa Sarma said.The Hindus in Bangladesh have been faced increased atrocities amidst the ongoing political turmoil after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina 's ouster in August last year. Attacks targeting minorities, primarily Hindus, have increased in Bangladesh since then.The Centre for Democracy, Pluralism and Human Rights (CDPHR) last month presented a report on the state of minorities in Bangladesh. The report titled 'Bangladesh Minorities Under Siege: A Wake-Up Call for the International Community' details the incidents of violence and unrest affecting the Hindu communities in the country in the wake of the political changes.According to the report, there were 190 reported cases of looting, 32 homes were set on fire, 16 temples were desecrated and two incidents of sexual violence were recorded between August 5 and 9 after Hasina's resignation.By August 20, the number of reported incidents had increased significantly, with 2,010 total cases of violence against the Hindus, including the desecration of 69 temples and attacks on 157 families, the report states.The report claims that the situation for religious minorities continued to deteriorate despite the formation of an interim government under Muhammad Yunus on August 8.",Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said Hindus staying in Bangladesh should not be encouraged to come to India.

How Manmohan-era retail firm contributed to Chandrababu Naidu's Rs 931 crore wealth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-manmohan-era-retail-firm-contributed-to-chandrababu-naidus-rs-931-crore-wealth/articleshow/116859142.cms,"NEW DELHI: After the release of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) report on the wealthiest politicians,Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu's family firm Heritage Foods Ltd issued a clarification, stating that approximately 82% of CM's wealth worth Rs 931 crore is on account of his kin's shareholding in a dairy product retailing firm.His family's ownership in a dairy retail enterprise was established during India's economic liberalisation under Manmohan Singh over 30 years ago, according to company officials.Heritage Foods Ltd, established in 1992 and listed publicly in 1994, has no direct shareholding by Naidu. However, his wife Bhuvaneswari Nara 's 24.37% stake, valued at roughly Rs 763 crore, contributes to the Andhra chief minister's reported wealth.The ADR has identified Naidu as the wealthiest chief minister with assets exceeding Rs 931 crore.Heritage Foods officials emphasised that the company operates purely in dairy retail, avoiding sectors typically associated with crony capitalism like infrastructure.The company's success relies solely on consumer acceptance, without government subsidies or support. Notably, the firm's establishment preceded Naidu's chief ministership, occurring when he was merely an MLA, and its stock market listing came before his elevation to the chief minister position.In the early 1990s, Chittoor district in united Andhra Pradesh, Naidu's home region, led in milk production.The district experienced a milk surplus and marketing challenges for dairy farmers in 1992.Following Dr Manmohan Singh's economic liberalisation in 1991-92, various sectors, including dairy, welcomed private investment and entrepreneurship.Capitalising on this opportunity, Naidu launched Heritage Foods in 1992, investing Rs 50 lakh initially to establish the first milk chilling unit in Chittoor, supported by Bank of Baroda loans. He served as managing director for two years.Upon becoming minister in 1994, Naidu stepped down, with his wife assuming the role of executive director and later managing director. The company's public listing in 1994 showed a market capitalisation of Rs 25 crore, which grew alongside the company's expansion.The organisation cleared all loans from Bank of Baroda and other nationalised banks, achieving debt-free status post-COVID.Currently, Heritage Foods commands a market value of Rs 4400 crores, generates Rs 3750 crores in revenue, and maintains operations across 12 Indian states. Its asset base stands at Rs 600 crores, with recognised strength in quality dairy products and distribution.The enterprise operates under the leadership of Managing Director Bhuwaneswari Nara and Executive Director Nara Brahmani, Naidu's daughter-in-law, who has served for a decade. Brahmani, married to Nara Lokesh, holds a Stanford business school degree and brings experience from prominent global dairy organisations.","Heritage Foods Ltd, established in 1992 and listed publicly in 1994, has no direct shareholding by Naidu.

Singh attributed Manipur’s ongoing challenges to what he called the “sins of the Congress,” singling out decisions made during previous administrations.“Everyone, including yourself, is aware that Manipur is in turmoil today because of the past sins committed by the Congress,” Singh said, directly addressing Ramesh on X.He cited the repeated settlement of Burmese refugees and the signing of the Suspension of Operations (SoO) Agreement with Myanmar-based militants, which he claimed were initiated under the tenure of then-Union home minister P Chidambaram.Ramesh had earlier questioned why PM Modi had avoided visiting Manipur despite the state’s prolonged unrest. “Why can't the Prime Minister go to Manipur and say the same thing there? He has deliberately avoided visiting the state since May 4th, 2023, even as he jets around the country and the world,” Ramesh remarked.Singh defended Modi’s stance, turning the spotlight on Congress’s past handling of ethnic conflicts in the region. “The clashes began in 1992 and continued at varying intensities for around five years (1992–1997). This period marked one of the bloodiest ethnic conflicts in northeast India, deeply affecting relations between the Naga and Kuki communities in Manipur.""""Did Shri PV Narasimha Rao, who served as the Prime Minister of India from 1991 to 1996 and was the President of the Indian National Congress during this time, come to Manipur to extend an apology? TheKuki-Paite clashes claimed 350 lives in the state. During most of the Kuki-Paite clashes (1997–1998), Shri IK Gujral was the Prime Minister of India. Did he visit Manipur and say sorry to the people?” Singh asked.The chief minister argued that Congress’s focus on politics was undermining efforts to resolve Manipur’s core issues. He also referenced his recent apology to victims of the 2023 violence, “The apology I extended today was a sincere act of expressing my grief for the people who have been left displaced and become homeless.”Singh’s remarks followed his New Year’s Eve address, where he outlined measures for Manipur’s recovery, including a significant reduction in violence and a roadmap for rehabilitation and development. The state has reported a sharp decline in casualties and unrest since May 2023, with over 2,000 displaced families returning home and numerous welfare initiatives launched.“Our commitment is unwavering. These measures not only aim at rehabilitation but also aspire to propel Manipur towards self-reliance and growth,” the Manipur CM said.","Manipur chief minister N Biren Singh has sharply countered Congress leader Jairam Ramesh’s criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s “absence’ from the conflict-hit state.

Agricultural women workers were 32% more likely to undergo a hysterectomy compared to other occupation groups, said the study published in the 'Journal of Medical Evidence' recently. It found a high number of hysterectomies - many unnecessary - among Indian women. The prevalence of hysterectomy in women aged 25-49 years was 4.8% as per National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-16) and increased slightly to 4.9% in NFHS-5 (2019-21).The study also found that seven out of every ten hysterectomies are performed in private health facilities, while 32.2% of hysterectomy surgeries are performed in public health facilities. ""Private practitioners are emphasising the need for hysterectomy with a profit motive even for benign conditions which can be treated with less invasive methods and medications,"" said authors Gaurav Gunnal of Deonar-based International Institute of Population Sciences and Dr Sudeshna Roy of National Institute of Health and Family Welfare, New Delhi.For instance, in Maharashtra, while 2.2% of professional women in 25-49 age group underwent hysterectomy, the percentage was double (4.4) for agricultural workers. In Andhra Pradesh, the corresponding numbers were 10.3% for professional women and 14.5% for those from the agriculture sector. Women from the states of Andhra Pradesh (12.6%), Telangana (11.1%), Bihar (8.6%), and Gujarat (6.2%) reported highest prevalence of hysterectomy.""Overall, the prevalence of hysterectomy was high amongst women in the age group of 40-49 years, rural residents, Hindu, OBC, illiterate, middle and richer wealth quintiles, three and above parity, early age at childbirth, obese, and covered under health insurance,"" it said. ""Women belonging to households with health insurance coverage are more likely to undergo hysterectomy than women from households without proper coverage,"" said Gunnal.The main causes for hysterectomy were prolonged excessive bleeding (55.4%), followed by fibroids/cysts (19.6%) and uterine disorder (13.9%). The authors blamed cultural and social influences for the trend: ""Menstrual taboos and limited knowledge about reproductive health contribute to the high prevalence of hysterectomy, with some women opting for it to avoid menstrual issues or due to fear of reproductive health cancers,"" they said.",Study: Agricultural women workers were 32% more likely to undergo a hysterectomy than other occupation groups.

NEW DELHI: It will take some more days for the government to allot land for former PM Manmohan Singh’s memorial as spaces for construction of a memorial can be only given to a trust, which in this case is yet to be established, sources said. They added that even in the case of a memorial for former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, land was allotted to the Atal Samiti Nyas (Trust), which was registered more than a month after his death.The government can earmark the land for the memorial but it has to be built by a trust, officials said.Sources said some preliminary assessment of available land parcels in the Rajghat area is being carried out for Manmohan Singh’s memorial. “It will take some more days as the trust, which is yet to be established, needs to apply for the land,” a source said.A member of the Atal Samiti Nyas, which built the Sadaiv Atal (the samadhi and memorial of Vajpayee), recalled that after the demise of the former PM, the trust was established. “We applied for land, and subsequently, an MoU was signed with the Central Public Works Department (CPWD). The design of the samadhi was made by the School of Planning and Architecture. The trust released fund for construction to the CPWD,” the member said.Vajpayee’s memorial is spread over 1.5 acres of land at the Rashtriya Smriti Sthal, where he was cremated on Aug 17, 2018. “Because of a change in policy, the land was allotted only to the trust,” the member said.TOI has learnt that the government is now looking at options to zero down on one to 1.5 acre land in the areas meant for memorials around Raj Ghat for Singh. They added that it takes at least four to five days for registration of a trust.Sources in Congress said they have no fresh update on the memorial.At present, there are 19 memorials in and around the Rajghat complex, which includes that of former presidents, PMs and deputy PMs. The two exceptions are Sanjay Gandhi and Lalita Shastri, the late wife of former PM Lal Bahadur Shastri.","The government can earmark the land for the memorial but it has to be built by a trust, officials said.

Exciting, but still a long way to go A major step forward for India’s space program

24 POEM Payloads

India on Monday got a step closer to becoming part of an elite group of nations with space-docking technology — ability to mate two spacecraft in space — with Isro ’s putting two small satellites weighing 220 kg each, into orbit.The satellites, part of the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission, lifted off around little past 10pm on the PSLV-C60 from the first launchpad at the spaceport in Sriharikota.They were placed in a 475-km circular orbit some 15 minutes later. The first of the two satellites was separated 15.1 minutes after lift off, and the other happened at 15.2 minutes.As per M Sankaran, director, UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), the satellites — ‘chaser’ and ‘target’ spacecraft — launched separately will initially be released with a small relative velocity between them.As reported by TOI earlier, the satellites, through a series of carefully choreographed manoeuvres, will distance from each other over the next few days before Isro attempts to dock them. If Isro manages this successfully, India would have taken the first serious step towards mastering the technology, something only the US, Russia and China boast of as on date.“The rocket has placed the satellite in the right orbit. The satellites moved one behind the other. Their distance will increase to about 20km over the next few days before we close the gap and attempt the docking. We’re hoping to complete docking in the coming week. The nominal date for this is Jan 7,” Isro chairman S Somanath said soon after the launch.The mission is crucial for India’s future space endeavors including Chandrayaan-4 and the planned Bhartiya Antriksh Station (BAS), as confirmed by Isro chairman S Somanath.In addition to the primary docking experiment, the PSLV Orbital Experimental Module (POEM) carried 24 innovative payloads, including several groundbreaking experiments: India’s first astrobiology payloads are among the highlights, featuring RV College of Engineering’s microbiological experiment studying gut bacteria behavior in space, and Amity University's investigation of spinach growth in microgravity.Isro is also launching its own CROPS (Compact Research Module for Orbital Plant Studies) payload to demonstrate seed germination in space, a robotic arm designed to capture space debris and a sophisticated inter-satellite communication system. Isro will demonstrate a unique “walking” robotic arm with 7 degrees of freedom, intended for future space station operations.The private sector has also sent payloads on POEM: PierSight, an Ahmedabad-based startup, launched Varuna, a precursor to what could be India’s first private Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite for maritime surveillance. The company aims to establish a 32-satellite constellation by 2028 for comprehensive ocean monitoring.The other payloads are Mumbai-based Manastu and Bengaluru’s Bellatrix Aerospace, both testing their respective green propulsion technologies, while GalaxEye from Bengaluru is showcasing their SAR signal processing technology and TakeMe2Space from Hyderabad is demonstrating nanosatellite subsystems.Other educational institutions participating include SJC Institute of Technology and MIT World Peace University. SJC from Karnataka is sending a multimode message transmitter payload that can transmit audio, text, and image messages from a satellite to the ground using FM modulation and the VHF band. It is designed to provide amateur radio satellite services globally. It was designed in collaboration with Isro’s URSC.","Isro launched two small satellites weighing 220 kg each, into orbit.

Bill Belichick’s 24 Year Old Girlfriend Jordon Hudson Slams Haters



Jordon Hudson Has Stayed By Bill Belichick’s Side Despite The Trolling



Bill Belichick, the former head coach of the New England Patriots and the current coach of the University of North Carolina, has been in the news lately for his relationship with 24 year old Jordon Hudson who is younger than him by close to fifty years. While Bill has remained unaffected by the trolling the couple has received due to the age gap, it seems like now his girlfriend has made a statement about their relationship and slammed the ones who trolled them.Jordon recently shared glimpses from their New Year's Eve celebrations where it looks like the couple opted for a peaceful celebration at a high end restaurant.While sharing a picture of their drinks, she wrote, “ I can’t wait to take punches for you in 2025. Keep swinging, Keyboard Warriors.”While Bill was not tagged in her Instagram stories it is safe to assume it is Bill she was talking about since she also added about how this is their “third midnights’ kiss”. She added, “Cheers!!! To our third midnights’ kiss. “Not only this, Jordan also added in her Instagram story that even though this is their “fourth calendar year”, nothing changed between them except “public knowledge”. While Jordon did not directly address the hate and trolling they have been receiving since the time they went public about their relationship, she has also reassured Bill that she will not “wait to take punches” for him in this new year.This is a very strong statement by Jordon who mostly does not seem to be talking about their relationship that much in public even though she keeps sharing pictures with her boyfriend, Bill, on her Instagram account.

They remained in contact and started dating when Bill broke up with his ex partner. Since then the couple have been very open about their relationship and are “unfazed” by the hate they receive on a regular basis over their forty eight years of age gap.As per sources, despite the huge age gap, they are very much compatible with each other and also share interests in sports and being outdoors.

A step forward for global space exploration A historic milestone for India's space program

NEW DELHI: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is set to reach a historic milestone with its 100th rocket launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in January, ISRO Chairman S Somanath announced.This achievement will be highlighted by a Geosynchronous Launch Vehicle (GSLV) mission, following Monday’s successful PSLV-C60 mission, which marked the 99th launch from the Sriharikota spaceport.India on Monday took a major step towards joining an exclusive group of nations with space-docking technology — the ability to mate two spacecraft in space. ISRO successfully placed two small satellites, each weighing 220 kg, into orbit as part of the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission.The PSLV-C60 rocket, which lifted off just after 10 PM from the first launchpad at Sriharikota, placed the satellites into a 475-km circular orbit about 15 minutes later. The first satellite separated 15.1 minutes after launch, followed by the second at 15.2 minutes.M Sankaran, Director of the UR Rao Satellite Centre (URSC), explained that the 'chaser' and 'target' spacecraft were launched with a small relative velocity, allowing them to move towards each other for potential future docking operations.Speaking after the successful PSLV-C60 launch, Somanath highlighted the significance of the milestone: ""So, all of you have seen the majestic lift-off and the launch of the SpaDeX (Space Docking Experiment) rocket, and for us, this is the 99th launch of any vehicle from Satish Dhawan Space Centre. That is also a very important number. So, we are going for the 100th launch at the beginning of the next year.""Monday’s PSLV-C60 mission paves the way for more complex docking experiments, with Somanath noting, ""There will be many more SpaDeX varieties, including complex missions of docking systems in the coming days.""ISRO’s ambitious plans continue into 2025, with the NVS-02 navigation satellite scheduled for launch in January using a GSLV rocket. This follows the successful deployment of the NVS-01 satellite in May 2023, marking the first of the second-generation satellites for the Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) services.The PSLV-C60 launch was initially scheduled for 9:58 PM on December 30 but was rescheduled to 10 PM following a ""conjunction study"" to ensure no close proximity between satellites in orbit. Somanath explained the process: ""If you find there is any close proximity between satellites, then we have to move the current satellite a little bit. Either, we delay it or make it early, so that this proximity condition does not occur.""","Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) set to reach a historic milestone with its 100th rocket launch in January.

As the work-life balance debate continues to spark conversations globally, Indian billionaire and industrialist Gautam Adani has added his voice to the discussion in a light-hearted yet thought-provoking manner. Known for his business acumen and influence in the corporate world, the Adani Group Chairman recently shared his perspective on achieving happiness through work-life balance. His comments come amidst heightened discussions, sparked by Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy ’s advocacy for a 70-hour workweek. Adani's humorous and relatable remarks shed light on the individuality of balance, emphasizing the importance of personal happiness over societal expectations.In a video shared by news agency IANS on December 26, Gautam Adani expressed his views on how one can strike a harmonious balance between work and personal life. Speaking candidly, he stated, ""If you enjoy what you do, then you have a work-life balance. Your work-life balance should not be imposed on me, and my work-life balance shouldn't be imposed on you.""Adani highlighted the importance of personal choice, emphasizing that individuals should determine what brings them happiness. ""You should decide if you are happy with spending, say, four hours with your family. And if someone’s spending eight hours, toh biwi bhaag jaegi (the wife will run away),"" he joked, eliciting laughter while underscoring his point.For Adani, the true essence of work-life balance lies in mutual happiness. ""If it brings you happiness and the other person is also happy, then that’s the true definition of work-life balance,"" he added.Adani’s remarks arrive amidst the ongoing debate triggered by Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, who has advocated for the younger generation to commit to a 70-hour workweek. Murthy, who has previously spoken about working up to 90 hours weekly during his career, has positioned hard work as a responsibility for those who have benefited from government-subsidized education.Murthy’s comments have faced mixed reactions. While some praised his dedication to societal betterment, others criticized the suggestion as impractical and detrimental to mental health. Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal’s endorsement of Murthy’s views also sparked online backlash, particularly from younger professionals who argue for the importance of work-life balance and well-being.The work-life balance debate reflects broader cultural shifts in professional values and expectations. While older generations often prioritized hard work and long hours as a means to success, younger professionals increasingly value flexibility, mental health, and quality time with loved ones.Adani’s take offers a middle ground, encouraging individuals to define balance based on their personal circumstances rather than societal norms. His humor and relatability resonate with a wide audience, showcasing the importance of individuality in achieving harmony between work and life.The debate around work-life balance highlights the need for businesses to adapt to changing workforce dynamics. Companies are increasingly recognizing the benefits of promoting employee well-being, including higher productivity, reduced burnout, and improved retention rates.Leaders like Adani, with their candid and practical insights, can influence corporate policies by advocating for personalized approaches to work-life balance. Such perspectives encourage a more inclusive and supportive work environment, fostering both personal and professional growth.","Indian billionaire and industrialist Gautam Adani has added his voice to the work-life balance debate.

South Korea plane crash: Catastrophe was waiting to happen?

Devastating collision results in only two survivors

Experts decry concrete wall as ""criminal"" in location

Wall placement criticized by experienced pilot

Frangible Obstacles Are Standard Safety Requirement, Say Experts

Regulatory defense: The wall was built according to South Korean regulations

Experts suggest alternative materials to prevent tragedy

Bird strike and emergency landing attempt contributed to the tragedy

Could more runway space have prevented the crash? Experts disagree

Aviation expert insists crash could have been avoided

Debate over airport safety design continues as investigations proceed

A catastrophic crash in South Korea, which killed 179 people aboard Jeju Air Flight 7C2216 , has sparked intense debate among aviation experts about the placement of a concrete wall near the end of the runway at Muan International Airport .The Boeing 737, which skidded off the runway after a bird strike minutes before landing, collided with the wall, erupting in a devastating fireball that left only two survivors – both flight attendants sitting at the rear of the aircraft. The tragic crash has raised significant questions about the safety of the airport’s design, particularly the wall that stood at the end of the runway, reported the New York Post.David Learmount, former pilot and safety editor for Flight International, voiced strong concerns about the structure's location. ""Not only is there no justification for it to be there, but I think it's verging on criminal to have it in such a location,"" he told Sky News. According to Learmount, having a hard obstacle about 660 feet from the end of the runway is unheard of in modern aviation.Lufthansa pilot Christian Beckert also criticized the wall’s position, calling it ""unusual"" and dangerous. ""Normally, at the end of a runway, you don't have any structures like that. It’s simply not standard practice,"" he said.Experts point out that obstacles near runways are typically required to be ""frangible,"" meaning they should be designed to break apart easily on impact to minimize damage to aircraft. Chris Kingswood, a veteran pilot, further explained that the fuselage of a plane is light by design and not meant to withstand high-speed impacts, particularly with a solid structure like a concrete wall.The wall, which was part of an installation for a localizer antenna—a device that helps pilots align with the runway—was built according to South Korean regulations, according to Ju Jong-wan, director of the Aviation Policy Division at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport. However, many experts are questioning whether the use of such a hard structure was the best solution.Hwang Ho-won, chairman of the Korea Association for Aviation Security, suggested that if the antenna had been made from a different material, the tragedy might have been avoided. Ju also stated that the government would reconsider the regulations in the wake of the deadly crash, which is now the deadliest air disaster in South Korea’s history.In addition to the wall’s controversial position, the crash’s cause has been linked to a bird strike that occurred shortly before the plane attempted an emergency landing. The pilot, with nearly 7,000 hours of flying experience, informed air traffic control that he would circle around for another landing attempt. Unfortunately, the plane was unable to regain altitude in time and came down on the wrong end of the runway, with its landing gear and braking systems failing.While some experts argue that the crash could have been avoided if there had been more space at the end of the runway, others, like aviation journalist Sally Gethin, believe the outcome may have been inevitable. “Even with more space, the plane seemed to maintain speed, which could have resulted in a similar catastrophic outcome,” she said.However, Learmount insists that there was enough room for the aircraft to slow down safely and believes that, had the aircraft not collided with the concrete wall, the outcome could have been different. ""I think everybody would have been alive,"" he said.As investigators continue to probe the causes of the crash, the debate over the safety of the airport's design—and whether the concrete wall played a critical role in the tragedy—is likely to intensify.","Jeju Air Flight 7C2216 crashed into a concrete wall near the end of the runway at Muan International Airport in South Korea, killing 179 people.

'Concerning': Elon Musk criticises Bezos' ex-wife MacKenzie Scott for $16 billion donation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/concerning-elon-musk-criticises-bezos-ex-wife-mackenzie-scott-for-16-billion-donation/articleshow/116717882.cms,"Elon Musk and MacKenzie Scott (Picture credit: PTI/X)

Tech mogul Elon Musk described the philanthropic efforts of MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, as ""concerning."" His comment came in response to a social media post scrutinising Scott’s extensive donations, alleging that her initiatives primarily fund non-profits promoting divisive ideologies rather than addressing pressing global issues.The post highlighted Scott’s “trust-based philanthropy ,” which involves providing no-strings-attached grants to over 2,500 non-profits. It alleged that her focus on causes such as racial equity, immigrant rights, and LGBTQ justice feeds what the post described as an “NGO/non-profit complex,” creating jobs for individuals seeking to validate their expensive degrees. The post further detailed Scott’s $16 billion in donations over five years, noting her wealth remains substantial at $36 billion, boosted by Amazon’s rising stock price.Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has become one of the most prolific philanthropists in recent years. Through her “Yield Giving” initiative, she has pledged more than $19 billion since 2019 to causes ranging from girls’ education in Africa to affordable housing in the United States. Scott has championed a transformative approach to philanthropy, providing large, unrestricted grants that allow organisations to allocate funds as needed.In 2024 alone, Scott made repeat donations to several organisations, a rare move given her typical “one-time grant” approach. For example, CAMFED, which supports girls’ education in Africa, received its third donation this year. Another notable beneficiary, Enterprise Community Partners, was unexpectedly awarded an additional $65 million after initially receiving $50 million in 2020.This year also marked a significant shift in Scott’s giving strategy, with her introducing an open-call application process for the first time. Over 6,000 non-profits applied, and Scott committed $640 million to more than 360 organisations, far exceeding her initial promise. Grantees praised the unrestricted nature of her grants, describing them as transformative not only for individual organisations but also for entire sectors like affordable housing.","Elon Musk described the philanthropic efforts of MacKenzie Scott as ""concerning"" His comment came in response to a social media post scrutinising Scott’s extensive donations.
