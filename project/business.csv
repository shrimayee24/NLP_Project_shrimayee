"'Tirupati laddu ghee had pig & beef fat, fish oil': Row rages in Andhra Pradesh; TDP, YSRCP lock horns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/tirupati-laddu-row-lab-reports-confirm-lard-tallow-in-ghee-supplied-for-tirumala/articleshow/113499408.cms,"TIRUPATI: The TDP govt in Andhra Pradesh on Thursday made public laboratory analysis of the cow ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala temple trust for making its famous Tirupati laddu prasadam during the term of the YSRC govt . It revealed the presence of foreign fats including lard (clarified pig fat), tallow (beef fat) and fish oil.SEE ALSO: '3 lakh laddus daily, Rs 500 crore revenue annually': Tirupati's sacred sweet takes a sour turn after ghee adulteration charges The samples also contained fats from vegetable sources like coconut, linseed, rapeseed and cottonseed.The analysis was conducted on July 23 after the government received complaints of change in taste of the laddu prasadam.Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu had sparked a major controversy on Wednesday when he told NDA allies that animal fat had been found in the ghee for the laddus when YSRC was in power. YSRC had reacted angrily, denying the allegations and claiming it to be one of Naidu’s political stunts.The analysis by the Centre for Analysis and Learning in Livestock and Food (CALF) of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB), however comes with a caveat - there can be chances of false positive results in certain circumstances. The report lists several conditions where a result could go wrong, including in cases like overfeeding cows with feed rich in vegetable oils, underfeeding cows or the milk being subjected to technological treatments like removal of cholesterol.The report is silent whether the adulterants were deliberately added or crept in through feeding conditions and other factors.Naidu’s allegation and the NDDB’s report have shocked millions of devotees of Lord Venkateswara across the globe as the Tirupati laddus are considered Maha Prasadam and carry a high sentimental value.The TDP govt had in June appointed senior IAS officer J Syamala Rao as the new executive officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) which manages the temple complex. As part of streamlining measures, an inquiry was ordered into the alleged poor quality, taste and texture of the laddus.TTD constituted an expert committee to look into the quality of the prasadam. The members included Dr B Surendranth, former principal scientist of the National Dairy Research Institute, Vijayawada, Bhaskar Reddy (dairy expert), Prof B Mahadevan (IIM-Bangalore) and Dr G Swarnalatha from the Telangana Veterinary UniversityApart from suggesting several measures to TTD to restore the taste and quality, the committee also sent samples of the ghee to NDDB, Gujarat. The lab reports, issued in July, confirmed the presence of foreign fats. TTD returned the ghee stocks supplied by AR Dairy Foods, Dindigul, in Tamil Nadu and blacklisted the contractor. Then, TTD selected Karnataka Milk Federation to supply the ghee.TTD sources said that while cow ghee was procured from the blacklisted contractor at Rs 320 per kg, the Tirupati trust is now procuring ghee at Rs 475 per kg from the Karnataka federation.TTD prepares and distributes about 3 lakh laddus to the devotees every day at Tirumala. Every year, the trust earns around Rs 500 crore from laddu sales alone.","The TDP govt in Andhra Pradesh made public laboratory analysis of the cow ghee samples supplied to the Tirumala temple trust for making its famous Tirupati laddu prasadam.

New Lankan president: A curveball India prepared for; Anura Kumara Dissanayake against Adani project but backs Indian security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-lankan-president-a-curveball-india-prepared-for-akd-against-adani-project-but-backs-indian-security/articleshow/113576472.cms,"NEW DELHI: With Marxist leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake winning the hotly contested Sri Lankan presidential poll, India is faced with another challenge in the neighbourhood of dealing with a leader who remains a relatively unknown quantity. However, with its $ 4 billion-worth assistance that helped Lanka tide over an unprecedented economic crisis and recent outreach that had the Indian government hosting him earlier this year, India is perhaps in a lot better position to absorb the shock than it was in Bangladesh.India’s high commissioner Santosh Jha was the first diplomat to call on the president-elect and congratulate him, saying India, as a civilisational twin, was committed to deepening ties for the prosperity of the people of both countries.After his swearing-in on Monday, the 55-year-old National People’s Power alliance leader will become the first Leftist president to head a Lankan government. A marginal player till now in Lankan politics, who got only 3 percent votes in the last election, Dissanayake defeated the pro-India leader of opposition, Sajith Premadasa, after a historic counting of second preference votes, as no candidate could get more than 50 percent votes. He eventually won with 42.31 percent votes.While India followed the elections with a non-partisan approach, it would have ideally liked incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe or Premadasa to win for the sake of continuity, if nothing else. This would have allowed a more sure-footed Indian government to build upon the goodwill generated by its recent handholding of the strategically important Indian Ocean neighbour through a period of acute crisis.Despite the traditionally anti-India stance of his Marxist- Leninist party JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna), the Indian government reached out to Dissanayake, popularly known as AKD, in February inviting him to visit the country. The invitation acknowledged his increasing popularity, especially among the youth, on the back of widespread anger over the mishandling of the crisis and a pro-poor, anti-corruption “agent of change’’ image that proved decisive in an election dominated by issues related toSri Lanka ’s economic recovery. These included a controversial IMF bailout deal he wants renegotiated. Both foreign minister S Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval met him in Delhi.Interestingly, during his visit to India, Dissanayake agreed to visit the Amul plant in Gujarat after alleging that the Indian dairy giant was planning to take over dozens of Lankan state owned dairies.The Indian mission in Colombo has remained in regular contact with Dissanayake.For India, the key priorities in Sri Lanka remain the need to address the requirements of the India-origin Tamil community, including full implementation of the 1987 13th Amendment to the Constitution, expediting connectivity, energy and other projects as China expands its footprint and a more humanitarian approach towards Indian fishermen. It’s also important for India that Sri Lanka, in line with a bilateral agreement, doesn’t allow China military use of its ports in a manner prejudicial to India’s interests.While many have speculated that Dissanayake might seek stronger ties with China, it’s important for India that he said recently he won’t allow anyone to use his country’s sea, land and airspace to threaten India.The socialist leader made headlines recently by saying he will scrap a wind power project by the Adani group , which has run into problems because of environmental issues, saying it violates Sri Lanka’s “energy sovereignty”. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, which promotes cross-border trade and investment, is said to have emphasised before Dissanayake that the project might help attract more investments into the country.Dissanayake is also learnt to have expressed concerns before Indian officials about corruption and lack of transparency in the execution of some of Chinese flagship projects, like the Hambantota port and Colombo port city project. India believes that while he might look to remodel some of the projects, it’s unlikely he will revoke any. “His focus on corruption and the need for transparency is in line with India’s stand against opaque lending practices. Indian projects are based on the needs of the local people,’’ said an official here.Dissanayake has sounded ambivalent about the 13th Amendment and his party has strongly opposed the 1987 India-Sri Lanka accord but, barring Premadasa, no other major candidate, not even Wickremesinghe, had promised its full implementation. While seeking Constitutional changes, Dissanayake has said it’s important to implement provisions that can establish peace and to focus on the future, not the past. ``To do that, Tamil people should be given a strong guarantee of rights in politics. They must be given a right to make decisions for themselves,’’ he said earlier this year.","Anura Kumara Dissanayake will become the first Leftist president to head a Lankan government. India's high commissioner Santosh Jha was the first diplomat to call on the president-elect and congratulate him.

The remarks, seen as a reference to the passing of Anna Sebastian Perayil , have drawn sharp criticism from opposition party Congress, with some calling her comments ""outright cruel.""Perayil, who passed her CA exams in 2023, had been working at EY's Pune office for just four months before her death in July.In a letter to EY India Chairman Rajiv Memani, Perayil's mother alleged that her daughter had been overworked, facing a ""backbreaking"" workload that affected her ""physically, emotionally, and mentally."" The government has announced an investigation into the work environment at EY following her death.Speaking at an event at a private medical college on Saturday, Sitharaman discussed the incident without directly naming Perayil or EY.""…A woman who had studied CA well, unable to cope with the work pressure ... two-three days ago, we received a news—she died unable to cope up with the pressure,"" Sitharaman said.She emphasized that while educational institutions prepare students academically, they must also impart life lessons, particularly in stress management and inner strength, which she linked to spirituality.""What should families teach—whatever you study and the job you do, you should have the inner strength to handle that pressure, and this can be achieved through divinity only,"" Sitharaman stated. ""Believe in God, we need to have God's grace. Seek God, learn good discipline. Your Atma shakti will grow only from this. The inner strength will come only with growing Atma shakti.""Sitharaman called on colleges and universities to integrate divinity and spirituality into their curriculum to help students cope with life's pressures. ""Then only will our children get the inner strength; it will help in the progress of them and the country. That is my strong belief,"" she added.Congress general secretary K C Venugopal, however, strongly condemned Sitharaman's remarks, accusing the government of being insensitive to the plight of young professionals.""It is downright cruel on the part of the finance minister to blame Anna and her family by suggesting that she should have learned stress management at home. This kind of victim-blaming is despicable, and no words can convey the anger and disgust one feels because of such statements,"" Venugopal said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).He also criticized the government for failing to address corporate exploitation of young professionals, adding, ""The toxic work environment should have triggered an honest review of corporate practices and led to necessary reforms that protect employees.""The government has yet to respond to the Congress leader's statements.","Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has urged educational institutions to include stress management lessons.

Instead of such direct acquisitions, India is now pushing for co-development and co-production of advanced weapon systems under the ambitious defence-industrial cooperation roadmap finalized in June last year.While no such joint project has been sealed till now, Modi and Biden “recognised the remarkable progress” achieved under the roadmap, including “ongoing collaboration to advance priority co-production arrangements for jet engines, munitions, and ground mobility systems”.India and the US, for instance, are conducting techno-commercial negotiations to jointly produce GE-F414 jet engines for the Tejas Mark-2 fighters here, with 80% transfer of technology for around $1 billion.The fact-sheet also mentioned that the US demonstrated its Stryker armoured infantry combat vehicle, with the Javelin anti-tank guided missiles, on the margins of the joint `Yudh Abhyas’ exercise that concluded in Rajasthan on Saturday.TOI had earlier reported that the discussions were in an advanced stage for the joint manufacture of the eight-wheeled Strykers, with the Indian Army projecting a requirement for around 530 such vehicles, though there is some criticism about indigenous options being ignored in the process.The two leaders also welcomed efforts to expand other defence-industrial partnerships, including for the co-development and co-production of unmanned surface vehicle systems to strengthen undersea and maritime domain awareness, as well as enhance India's MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) capabilities for the repair of aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles.Modi and Biden also lauded ongoing efforts to deepen the bilateral military partnership and interoperability to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific, noting that India hosted the largest and most complex bilateral tri-Service exercise “Tiger Triumph” till date in March.“The leaders commended work to advance cooperation in advanced domains, including space and cyber, and looked forward towards the Nov 2024 bilateral cyber engagement to enhance the cyber cooperation framework. Areas of new cooperation will include threat information sharing, cybersecurity training, and collaboration on vulnerability mitigation in energy and telecommunications networks,” it said.Under a MoU on the deployment of military liaison officers, India will now post a Colonel-rank officer to the US Special Operations Command at Florida, while another officer will go to the Indo-Pacific Command at Hawaii.","The govt-to-govt deal for the 31 high-altitude long-endurance remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), with 15 Sea Guardian drones earmarked for Navy and 8 Sky Guardians each for Army and IAF, is set to be inked in mid-Oct.

'Visvesvaraya made technocracy fashionable',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/visvesvaraya-made-technocracy-fashionable/articleshow/113576765.cms,"Sharmila Ganesan Ram



Among the most famous Indian engineers of the 20th century was the legendary Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya. What factors prompted you to pick him as the subject of your new biography 'Engineering a Nation'?



To explore Visvesvaraya's life, the book argues, is to understand the emergence of the Indian nation itself...



The 500-odd-page biography is suffixed by 200 pages of citations. Walk us through the research process.



A museum, a college, a terminal, a memorial trophy-- Visvesvaraya's name lives on in many forms in Karnataka. Is his legacy well-known outside the state? Do you think he received his due?



What role did Bombay play in his trajectory?



While Gandhi was against the idea of industrialisation, Visvesvaraya swore by it as a tool for nation-building. Did the two men see eye-to-eye?



Much like your subject, you too chose to go abroad. After studying electrical engineering, you pursued postgraduate work in the history of science, medicine and technology at Oxford University (MSc) and Imperial College London (PhD). What prompted this leap from science to history/from the future to the past of the future, if you will?



The Indian Science Congress--a 1914-born annual forum in which a lot of attendees in recent years have made controversial claims about India's achievements in the history of science spanning the existence of stem cell technology to fleets of aircraft in ancient India and Sri Lanka--did not happen this year. What does this (both the event and its cancellation) say about India's relationship with science and history? Also, did you miss it?



If he were alive, what would Visvesvaraya have to say about AI, UID, UPI and present-day India?

If he were alive, legendary 20th-century civil engineer Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya would likely be excited about AI , guesses historian Aparajith Ramnath whose book ' Engineering A Nation ' delves into the scientist's century-wide life and legacy. Apart from being an early proponent of economic planning and large-scale industrialisation, Mysore-born Visvesaraya--whose birthday on September 15 is celebrated as Engineer's Day in India, Sri Lanka and Tanzania --was also an ardent technocrat whose work continues to touch sugarcane farmers in Maharashtra and Karnataka, picnickers in the Brindavan Gardens, and city dwellers across the country who enjoy a piped water supply.Even as India grapples with politically skewed biographies and pseudo science, the author talks toabout the need for nuance while researching historically important scientists and engineers such as VisvevarayaSix years ago, your first book 'The Birth of an Indian Profession' explored the history of engineers in India between 1900 and 1947. How did the role of engineers evolve during these interwar years?In those years, new types of engineers came to prominence, namely those working in large-scale industries. (Earlier the profession was dominated by engineers in public works, railways, and the military.) Not only that, there was an increasing presence of Indian engineers as opposed to expat British engineers. A good example of the new type of engineer would be PN Mathur, a metallurgist who worked for Ford in the US before joining the Tata Iron and Steel Company in the 1920s.Like most of us, I’d heard of Visvesvaraya while growing up. While researching my first book, I kept coming across nuggets on him, and realised he was an exceptional figure. I was intrigued by the question of what made him so influential and legendary. What was the historical context in which he worked? How did his engineering expertise and his views on economic development take shape and evolve? To try and understand some of these things, I decided to research his life and career.Visvesvaraya lived from 1861 to 1962, a period that saw so many fundamental developments in the history of the Indian nation. Moreover, he was involved, directly or indirectly, with many of them: the popularisation of economic planning, the conception of constitutional autonomy within the British empire, the evolving status of the princely states, the emphasis on industrialisation and large dam projects. He worked with the most prominent Indian politicians of his time, but also with institution-builders, scientists, and engineers. He made technocracy fashionable, something that has reverberations down to the present day.I began by reading existing accounts of Visvesvaraya, which gave me a good sense of what was known about him and what had not been explored yet. I decided I wanted to rely on primary sources as far as possible. I went to various government and private archives in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, and Mysuru. I found records related to his time in the Bombay PWD, studied his correspondence with politicians and others, and combed through his own extensive collection of government reports and newspaper cuttings. I also looked at records related to his close associates such as Walchand Hirachand. Digitised databases of official reports and newspapers from his time were immensely helpful. The biggest challenge was the subject’s reticence – he was a private person who didn’t leave behind too many personal letters or diaries, and it was difficult initially to probe beyond the public persona. But by immersing myself in the available sources, I hope I have been able to illuminate his personality and his thought process.You’re right, he’s ubiquitous in Karnataka. But while he enjoys name recall in other parts of the country, I don’t think his significance on the national stage is adequately appreciated. Yes, he had a huge influence on princely Mysore, but his canvas was much wider. He advised on dams and waterworks across undivided India and even in Aden. He worked closely with national politicians like MM Malaviya and MR Jayakar. He played a key role in bringing the concept of economic planning to the fore. He influenced technical education policy.Visvesvaraya spent close to 25 years in Poona and other parts of Bombay Presidency as a PWD engineer. During this time he absorbed the colonial philosophy of irrigation, but also made his own extensions based on his experiences, including that of famine in the Deccan. He got to know industrialists and intellectuals interested in national politics, especially MG Ranade and GK Gokhale. Later in life, he split his residence between Bangalore and Bombay city for many years. This meant he continued to be in close contact with developments in the industrial and commercial worlds, as well as with politicians on the national stage.The two shared a respectful relationship, and tried hard to find a meeting ground through their correspondence. But ultimately they were unable to agree on the question of large-scale industrialisation in particular, and of course their visions for India were quite different. I think Visvesvaraya’s views on the centrality of science and tech came partly from his education in colonial institutions, but mainly from his study tours to Japan, Europe, and America. Japan in particular was an important model for him.I drifted into engineering without thinking too deeply about my options. While I did alright in my studies, I found myself most excited by the courses I took outside of my main subject, and the general reading I was doing. After deep reflection, I realised I had a long-standing, if dormant, interest in history, and that I had questions about how we’d got to where we were in terms of engineering, IT, and related fields. This prompted me to switch fields. I think the time in graduate school abroad helped me understand my country a bit better by giving me some distance. Interacting with mentors and other scholars from around the world also helped broaden my perspective and look at Indian history as part of global developments.I’m not aware of the deeper reasons behind the cancellation/postponement—I think we’ll have to wait a year or two to understand its significance. But as far as historically unsupportable claims about science and tech in ancient India are concerned, they seem to indicate a deep insecurity. With the many strides India has made since Independence, isn’t it time to be more confident and look at our own past objectively?In the age of rampant misinformation, pseudo-science and questionable history textbooks, why is revisiting the professional lives of scientific and technical practitioners important?It’s important because there is a tendency to create icons, hollow out the complexity of their lives, and use them selectively to support present-day agendas. This points to the need for nuanced biographies in general. Especially when it comes to scientists and engineers, it’s always important to understand how their thinking evolved, how they were conditioned by the social and political context, and what assumptions they made. We need to look at primary sources in as much detail as possible, and study their lives with an open mind.Always difficult to answer these! My guess is that he would have been largely excited by the first three, to the extent that they could be applied to improve public health and material prosperity. Yet I think he would have been critical of several aspects of the present situation. He would find our cities disorderly, lament the continuing existence of poverty, and disapprove of the cultural chauvinism in much of today’s public discourse.",Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya was one of the most famous Indian engineers of the 20th century.

That is the reason why voting will be high,"" said Sultan, seconded by Abdul Qadar and Mohd Yaseen. It is a view expressed by Mohd Saleem in Bijbehara and Tahir in Srinagar.

"Ukraine war, Global South, IPEF on agenda as PM Modi heads to US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ukraine-war-global-south-ipef-on-agenda-as-pm-modi-heads-to-us/articleshow/113502254.cms,"NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi’s bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden on Saturday will see substantive talks on carrying forward the Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership, including through exchange of agreements for formalization of India’s accession to 2 additional pillars – clean economy and fair economy - of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and another related to the India-US dug framework.While the Russia-Ukraine war is expected to figure prominently in the Modi-Biden engagement, and also the Quad meeting later in the day, in the outgoing president’s Wilmington hometown in Delaware, the Indian government remained non-committal on proposing any peace initiative of its own. Modi is expected to brief Biden in detail about his recent meetings with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukraine counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy.""Talks are ongoing between the leaders. As for putting forward any proposal, we'll have to see how much consensus is reached and whether we can reach a stage where a proposal can be put before a larger audience. So, I think we need to wait a little,"" said foreign secretary Vikram Misri, when asked if India will come up with a specific peace proposal either at the UN, where the PM will address the summit of the future, or in the engagements in Delaware. While seeking peace proactively, India has not budged from its original position that it won’t mediate directly or propose any peace formula of its own.On the IPEF, Misri said India will be formally joining the additional pillars, while negotiations for India’s participation in the trade pillar continue. IPEF, which comprises 14 Indo-Pacific countries as members, aims to strengthen economic cooperation for advancing growth and prosperity in the region. It’s structured around 4 pillars – trade, supply chains, clean economy and fair economy in that order. India is yet to join the trade pillar. ""We are joining pillars 3 and 4 and the overarching agreement, an administrative arrangement on how things will move forward. So, at the end of this exercise, we would have done 2, 3, 4 and the overarching agreement. Work and discussion on the trade pillar continue at this point in time,"" said Misri.On the sidelines of the Quad summit , Modi will also have bilateral meetings with his Australia and Japan counterparts, Anthony Albanese and Fumio Kishida. Asked if he would meet former president Donald Trump or Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus at the UNGA in New York, Misri said meetings are still being scheduled, keeping in mind time available.Modi will arrive on September 22 in New York, where he will participate in a technology roundtable with CEOs and also address an Indian diaspora event. On Monday, he will address the UN summit of the future, taking upGlobal South concerns about ongoing conflicts and calling for inclusive and equitable sustainable development.""There is an obvious deficit of development in the world at large and the Global South is at the risk of being left behind on account of current developments. The world is also playing catch-up in so far as fulfilment of the very important Sustainable Development Goals is concerned. So, I would imagine that the Prime Minister's message and India's message will take many of these issues into consideration and highlight India's approaches on all of these issues,"" said the foreign secretary.A ""signature initiative"" that will be unveiled by Quad in Delaware is the Cancer Moonshot, through which the grouping aims to implement innovative strategies to prevent, detect, treat, and alleviate the impact of cancer on patients and their families. ""And to begin with, we intend to collaborate in reducing the burden of cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific region,"" said Misri. Apart from discussing the threat from China in the Indo-Pacific, the Quad meeting will focus on issues related to health security, climate change, critical and emerging technologies, HADR infrastructure, connectivity, maritime security and counter-terrorism.",PM Narendra Modi's bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden on Saturday will see substantive talks on carrying forward the Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership.

Dating scam: How a woman lost Rs 3.37 lakh in 'friendship fraud' on Tinder and was saved from further loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/dating-scam-how-a-woman-lost-rs-3-37-lakh-in-friendship-fraud-on-tinder-and-was-saved-from-further-loss/articleshow/113576631.cms,"How an alert bank official saved her from losing more money

A 43-year-old art director from Mumbai has fallen victim to a sophisticated online scam, losing a significant sum of money to a man she met on Tinder. According to police reports, the woman befriended a person named ""Advait"" on the dating app last month, leading to what she believed was a budding relationship.The scammer, posing as Advait, claimed to be abroad and intended to visit Mumbai on September 16.On that day, the woman received a shocking call from someone purporting to be a Delhi customs official. The caller informed her that Advait had been detained at the airport with a large sum of Euros.In a moment of panic, the woman was told that she needed to pay Rs 3.37 lakh via UPI to secure Advait's release. Following the caller's instructions, she transferred the money. However, the fraudster later demanded an additional Rs4.99 lakh for further expenses.While attempting to transfer this second amount at her bank, a vigilant bank official sensed something was amiss. The staff member questioned her about the transaction and quickly alerted her to the potential fraud. Thanks to their timely intervention, she was spared from losing more money.The police have since registered a case of cheating at the Versova police station against unidentified individuals, and investigations are ongoing.This incident echoes a previous case in which a 33-year-old woman from Malad fell victim to a similar scam. She was duped of Rs 2.45 lakh by a man who claimed to be a doctor visiting from the UK, also entangled in customs issues.As these cases highlight the growing trend of online scams, experts urge users of dating apps to remain vigilant and cautious, especially when sharing personal information or money with new acquaintances.","A 43-year-old art director from Mumbai has fallen victim to a sophisticated online scam.

Pro models gain traction as price drops, vanilla iPhone also finds more buyers this year

AI on hold, but hardware upgrades drive majority sales



Analysts predict another record quarter for Apple

Apple's highly anticipated iPhone 16 series hit stores across India on Friday, September 20, 2024, drawing enthusiastic crowds in one of the fastest-growing markets for the iPhone-maker in the last few years. Industry experts sees this as a sign of Apple further bolstering its presence in India, as they suggests growth in number of sales from last year and record quarter for iPhone-maker in the country.The only-two physical locations of Apple Stores in Mumbai and New Delhi buzzed with excitement, as eager customers formed long queues outside stores, with some waiting since the previous night to be among the first to own the new devices.The launch event, which began at 8 AM, saw a mix of pre-order customers and walk-ins, all eager to experience Apple's newest offerings.""The atmosphere in Mumbai for this phone is absolutely electric,"" said Ujiwal Shah, who waited for over 21 hours to be first in line at the Bandra-Kurla Complex store. This sentiment was echoed across the country, with similar scenes unfolding at the Select CityWalk mall in New Delhi.Tarun Pathak, Research Director at Counterpoint Research , noted, ""Our channel checks yesterday indicated a strong opening for iPhone 16. Some of the sellers reported 18-20% opening day sales compared to last year.""While lines formed outside the retail locations, quick-commerce platforms, like Blinkit and BigBasket, promised the iPhone 16 on people's doorstep in just 10 minutes. The stocks ran out in a couple of minutes on the two apps, a similar trend seen during the pre-order day on e-commerce stores.Many customers still chose to visit physical stores, citing the desire for an immersive Apple experience. ""I came at 6 AM and couldn't wait to get the new phone in my hands,"" said one customer, a customer from Noida who came down to Delhi and was particularly excited about the improved zoom camera and the new Dessert Titanium colour of the iPhone 16 Pro .Prabhu Ram, VP of Industry Research Group at CyberMedia Research (CMR), noted, ""Our initial assessment indicates that the iPhone 16 series, including both the base and Pro models, has been well-received in the market.""Beyond the new iPhones, many customers coupled their purchases with AirPods 4 , while others also bought the new Apple Watches, upgrading their whole ecosystem. ""I'm going all in on the Apple ecosystem this time,"" grinned Rahul Kapoor, showcasing his new iPhone 16, AirPods 4, and Apple Watch. ""It's a big investment, but the seamless integration is worth every rupee.""However, not all customers were successful in their quest for the new iPhone. Amit Gupta, a walk-in customer who arrived at noon, left empty-handed. ""I thought coming during lunch hour would be smart, but they were already out of the Pro models,"" he sighed. ""I guess I'll have to try my luck online or wait for the next stock.""The Day 1 dynamics differed between India and the United States, Apple’s home market. Counterpoint Research data indicates that US stores had more inventory available for walk-in customers compared to previous years. In contrast, Indian stores saw longer queues and higher demand for pre-orders, particularly for the Pro models.Out of the four models, the regular iPhone 16 is seen to be the crowd's pick this year, however the reduced prices of Pro models this year, starting Rs 1,19,900 compared to starting price of Rs 1,39,900 for the iPhone 15 Pro models, has seemingly bought-in more takers for the iPhone 16 Pro models than in the recent years.""The more accessible pricing on the Pro models compared to their predecessors has made them more appealing to a wider range of consumers,"" said Ram.""The iPhone 16 seems like gaining massive popularity"" said Pathak, who suggests that there has been a ""lot of demand for the base 16 variant compared to last year"" in India.Ram notes, ""The ongoing premiumization trend in the Indian smartphone market provides favourable tailwinds to drive upgrades."" This shift is evident in the strong performance across the iPhone 16 range.Apple iPhone 16 series have launched without the much-anticipated Apple Intelligence AI software pre-installed. Apple has been heavily marketing these AI features since June, but users will need to wait for software updates to access them fully.Interestingly, Counterpoint Research noted that in the US, ""Buyers are upgrading because they are looking to upgrade – Apple Intelligence did not appear to be a primary purchase mover. Many users are coming from older devices such as the iPhone 12, iPhone 11 and even older.""This trend is mirrored in India, but with additional factors driving purchases. Pathak from Counterpoint Research explained, ""Plus, a lot of people upgrading from older 11s or iPhone 12 are finding 16 a great upgrade."" He further elaborated on the Indian market, stating, ""Hardware features like camera, battery and Apple silicon got a good upgrade compared to last year's base model."" These improvements are particularly appealing to Indian consumers looking for substantial upgrades from their older devices.When asked about the reasons behind people buying the new iPhones despite the absence of Apple Intelligence at launch, Pathak added, ""Apple Intelligence-ready iPhones is one reason for people switching to new models even though roll out will happen later.""The iPhone 16 marks a significant milestone for Apple's strategy in India. For the second time in a row, India-made iPhones were made available globally on the day of the official release, underscoring the country's growing importance in Apple's supply chain.With the festive season approaching, analysts expect further boosts in sales, especially for the premium Pro and Pro Max models. The availability of made-in-India iPhones – the Pro models are reported to be assembled later this year in the country for the first time ever – could also contribute to shorter lead times and improved availability for Indian consumers.Pathak shared an optimistic outlook: ""We believe Apple is likely to have a record new iPhone sales quarter in India and with this momentum it is likely to reach our estimated 12 million iPhone sales in India.""Prabhu Ram from CMR added, ""The ongoing premiumization trend in the Indian smartphone market provides favourable tailwinds to drive upgrades in the Indian market. CyberMedia Research anticipates a substantial 30% year-over-year growth compared to the iPhone 15 generation in the launch quarter."" He further projected, ""This growth trajectory positions Apple to potentially capture up to 8% of the hypercompetitive Indian smartphone market by the end of 2024.""Apple also plans to move 25% of its iPhone production to India by 2025, aligning with the country's "" Make in India "" initiative. Foxconn , one of Apple's key contract manufacturers, has already been producing the regular iPhone models in India, and reports suggest that Apple's manufacturers will also begin assembling the Pro models in the country this year.The success of the iPhone 16 launch day in India, coupled with the introduction of made-in-India units and innovative delivery methods, signals a new chapter in Apple's relationship with one of the world's fastest-growing smartphone markets.","Apple's highly anticipated iPhone 16 series hit stores across India on Friday, September 20, 2024.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Elon Musk says future space traveler to go to Mars could be you — Here's how,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-plans-five-uncrewed-starship-missions-to-mars-in-two-years/articleshow/113582006.cms,"Elon Musk announced on Sunday that SpaceX is preparing to launch around five uncrewed Starship missions to Mars over the next two years.In a post on social media platform X, Musk confirmed the timeline, saying that these missions will coincide with the next Earth-Mars transfer window , set to open in two years.""No matter what happens with landing success, SpaceX will increase the number of spaceships travelling to Mars exponentially with every transit opportunity.We want to enable anyone who wants to be a space traveler to go to Mars! That means you or your family or friends – anyone who dreams of great adventure,"" SpaceX CEO added in his tweet.The success of these uncrewed flights will determine the timeline for SpaceX’s first crewed mission to Mars. Musk indicated that if the uncrewed missions land safely, crewed missions could begin in four years. However, any major challenges could push the crewed timeline back by another two years.Musk, known for adjusting timelines on Starship's readiness, had previously stated that the first uncrewed mission to Mars could take place within five years, with humans landing on the planet in seven years.In June, SpaceX achieved a key milestone when a Starship rocket survived a fiery reentry and completed a full test mission, landing successfully in the Indian Ocean after its fourth attempt.Musk envisions Starship as a next-generation spacecraft designed to transport people and cargo to the moon and, eventually, Mars.Meanwhile, Nasa delayed its Artemis 3 mission, the first crewed moon landing in over 50 years, to September 2026, which will use SpaceX’s Starship. Originally scheduled for late 2025, the delay is due to development uncertainties.In June, Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa cancelled a private mission around the moon aboard Starship, also citing delays in the rocket’s development.","Elon Musk announced on Sunday that SpaceX is preparing to launch around five uncrewed Starship missions to Mars over the next two years.

Economic focus

Campaign context: Economic hardships, stemming from a severe financial crisis, dominated the election campaign. Public anger was prevalent due to the ongoing austerity measures.

IMF agreement: Dissanayaka intends to modify the IMF deal rather than cancel it, with plans to reduce income taxes and sales taxes on essentials like food and medicine.

Historical context

Geopolitical considerations

India-Sri Lanka relations: Dissanayaka's party assured India that Sri Lanka's territory would not be used against any nation, amid concerns about China's growing influence in the region.

Wickremesinghe's tenure: The outgoing president's strict austerity measures stabilized the economy but led to increased poverty, with rates doubling to 25% between 2021 and 2022.

Public discontent: Widespread dissatisfaction with the previous government's policies was a key factor in Dissanayaka's rise.

Security and voting conditions

Ensuring Sri Lanka's sea, land, and airspace are not used in ways that threaten India or regional stability.

Carefully considering the impact of economic measures on Sri Lanka while recognizing the importance of India's support in development efforts.

Safeguarding regional security while leveraging economic opportunities to Sri Lanka's advantage.

Adopting a strong foreign policy that aligns with global conditions and serves Sri Lanka's national interests effectively.

Trip to India



Balancing act



Nonaligned foreign policy: Central to Dissanayake's strategy is a commitment to a nonaligned foreign policy. This approach seeks to maintain a delicate balance between India and China, allowing Sri Lanka to engage with both powers without becoming overly dependent on either. Dissanayake's recent diplomatic outreach to India, including a visit in February 2024, reflects this strategy. During his meetings with Indian officials, he emphasised the importance of strengthening bilateral ties while ensuring that Sri Lanka's sovereignty and interests are upheld.

Economic engagement: Dissanayake recognises the economic significance of both India and China for Sri Lanka's recovery from its recent economic crisis. He has expressed intentions to invite foreign investment in sectors where Sri Lanka lacks capacity, such as renewable energy. By fostering economic partnerships with both nations, he aims to leverage their investments for national development. This pragmatic approach is designed to enhance Sri Lanka's economic resilience while avoiding the pitfalls of debt dependency that have characterized past engagements, particularly with China.

National/maritime security: Dissanayake has assured that his administration will maintain cordial relations with India concerning national security and defense. This assurance is crucial given India's historical concerns about China's increasing influence in the region, particularly following the controversial leasing of Hambantota Port to a Chinese firm. Dissanayake's stance suggests an awareness of India's strategic interests and a desire to mitigate any potential security risks arising from China's presence in Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka has elected Anura Kumara Dissanayake as its new president, marking the first time in the country's history that a Marxist leader has assumed the role.Dissanayake, the 56-year-old leader of the National People's Power (NPP) alliance, secured a narrow victory in the presidential election after counting of votes entered a second round - another first in the island nation's history.Sri Lanka's election commission formally announced the results on Sunday evening, confirming that Dissanayake had defeated incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe.The commission said on its website that Dissanayake won the presidency with 42.31% of the vote, pushing opposition leader Sajith Premadasa to second place and Wickremesinghe to a distant third. Dissanayake is due to be sworn-in on Monday.The election, which was dubbed a three-cornered contest, was seen as a referendum on the economic reforms aimed at steering Sri Lanka out of its severe economic crisis. Many voters were primarily concerned with the soaring inflation, escalating cost of living, and rising poverty in the country.Dissanayake's victory marks a significant shift in Sri Lankan politics, as the country grapples with the aftermath of the mass protests that ousted Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022.The new president will face the challenge of steering the country towards economic recovery while addressing the pressing issues of inflation and the cost of living.Dissanayake is the leader of the historically anti-India Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ( JVP ).JVP's founding leader, the late Rohana Wijeweera, lectured on ""Indian expansionism"" during the 1980s and the lessons portrayed India as an ""enemy of Sri Lankan interests"". The party also vehemently opposed the Indo-Lanka accord of 1987 – signed by Sri Lanka's then-president JR Jayewardene and India's Rajiv Gandhi.JVP led an insurrection rooted in opposition to Indian influence over Sri Lanka after the signing of the accord. It was violently put down by government forces.Despite his party's anti-India record and pro-China leaning, Dissanayake has expressed a desire to engage with India and maintain cordial relations.The new Sri Lanka president has signaled a shift in stance, indicating readiness to work with diverse international actors, including India, which has a significant interest in Sri Lanka. He, however, has also stated that Sri Lanka will not become subordinate to any power in the geopolitical race between India and China.In interviews to media outlets in the run up to the elections, Dissanayake has outlined his key policies:In early February 2024, Dissanayake visited New Delhi on an invitation from the Indian government, meeting with external affairs minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.During the meeting, they discussed bilateral relations and the mutual benefits of further deepening ties. Jaishankar emphasised that India, with its Neighbourhood First and SAGAR policies, will always be a reliable friend and trusted partner of Sri Lanka.Responding to media queries after returning from New Delhi, Dissanayake had insisted that high-level meetings with India did not indicate a changes in the party’s ""political or economical policies"".""We can gain a lot from India when it comes to sectors such as information technology,"" he had said, adding that NPP was hoping for India's assistance in such areas.""We are hoping to transform the country by leading the people, and in this transformation we need international support … we will need capital and technology. We can't win as an isolated country, we need to strengthen international relations,"" Dissanayake said.Dissanayake's diplomatic approach represents a significant departure from the strategies employed by previous Sri Lankan leaders. Unlike his predecessors, Dissanayake has embraced a more proactive and balanced foreign policy that aims to strengthen ties with diverse global powers, including India and China.Past Sri Lankan leaders have often been perceived as aligning more closely with either India or China, leading to concerns about over-dependence and geopolitical tensions. Dissanayake's balanced approach represents a significant shift in Sri Lanka's foreign policy, emphasising nonalignment, and the pursuit of Sri Lanka's national interests on the global stage.",Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been elected as Sri Lanka's new president. It is the first time in the country's history that a Marxist leader has assumed the role. His election marks a significant shift in Sri Lankan politics as the country grapples with the aftermath of mass protests that ousted Gotabaya Rajapaksa.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-113568931,imgsize-1154619,width-400,resizemode-4/113568931.jpg"
Sri Lanka's presidential election heads to second round of counting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lankas-presidential-election-heads-to-second-round-of-counting/articleshow/113573570.cms,"Sri Lanka's presidential election on Sunday entered a second round of counting, marking the first time no candidate secured the required 50 per cent of the votes needed for an outright victory. The election results revealed a tightly contested race, with Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna party’s broader front, the National People's Power (NPP), leading the first round with 5.63 million votes, or 42.31 per cent of the total.Following Dissanayake was Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), who garnered 4.36 million votes, or 32.8 per cent. Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe trailed significantly, receiving only 2.29 million votes, or 17.27 per cent, which resulted in his elimination from the race. Election Commission Chairman R M A L Rathnayake said, “Though Dissanayake and Premadasa have secured the maximum votes, neither has surpassed the 50 per cent threshold. Therefore, we are now counting the second preference votes to determine the eventual winner.”Sri Lankans cast their votes on Saturday in the first presidential election following the country's severe economic crisis in 2022. The election employs a preferential voting system , allowing voters to rank up to three candidates in order of preference. If no candidate achieves an absolute majority in the first round, the second and third-choice votes are taken into account in a subsequent round of counting.Rathnayake emphasized the uniqueness of this election: “No election in Sri Lanka has ever progressed to the second round of counting. In the past, candidates have always emerged as clear winners based solely on first-preference votes.”As the counting continues, voters are keenly watching the results, hoping for a leader who can guide the nation towards recovery and stability. The outcome will be determined once all cumulative votes and preference votes are tallied, paving the way for a new chapter in Sri Lankan politics.","Sri Lanka's presidential election on Sunday entered a second round of counting, marking the first time no candidate secured the required 50 per cent of the votes needed for an outright victory.

"UK Coal Plant Closure: UK set to close its last coal plant this month, only clean energy from October",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-set-to-close-its-last-coal-plant-this-month-only-clean-energy-from-october/articleshow/113576448.cms,"The shift to clean power

BATHINDA: The energy think tank Ember in its new analysis released on Friday has revealed a rapid shift from coal in the UK, as the last remaining coal plant Ratcliffe-on-Soar is set to close on September 30. Coal, which accounted for 39% of the UK’s total generation in 2012, falling to 0% in October 2024. Power sector emissions plummeted by 74% over that time, as coal’s share of power was largely replaced by wind and solar .“The era of coal-free power begins. The UK has achieved something massive, shifting its power system from a huge polluter to one where renewables are thriving, in an astonishingly short period of time”, said Ember analyst Frankie MayoThe closure of Ratcliffe power station marks a historic moment, ending a reliance on coal power that began in 1882 with the world’s first coal-fired power station at the Edison Electric Light Station in London. Coal played a major role in national energy supply throughout the 20th century, and although there was a decline in the 1990s, coal still supplied 39% of UK electricity in 2012.From 2012, coal began to fall rapidly. From 2012 to 2023, 15 coal power plants closed or switched fuels, with coal-free days becoming increasingly common. This was made possible by UK policies incentivising the rapid deployment of renewable power, while at the same time tightening restrictions on highly polluting coal power plants.Coal power was effectively replaced by wind and solar, which quadrupled their power generation since 2012 when coal’s rapid decline began. As coal generation fell from 39% of British power in 2012 to 1% in 2023, the share of wind and solar electricity increased from 6% to 34%. This was driven by wind power, which alone grew 315% (+62 TWh) in the same period. Wind and solar growth of 75 TWh since 2012 displaced an estimated 28 million tonnes of coal, and avoided £2.9bn in coal costs.The coal power phase-out was achieved without a switch from coal to gas. Gas generation did spike from 2015 to 2016 as an increase to the Carbon Price Support meant that gas became cheaper than coal. However, since then, gas generation has declined and as of 2023 gas generation was level with 2012 (100 TWh).By rapidly phasing out coal and scaling up renewables, the UK achieved a massive drop in power sector emissions. The rapid decline in coal power since 2012 avoided 880 million tonnes of emissions, which is equivalent to more than double the UK’s total economy-wide emissions in 2023.Ember report highlights that the UK's shift away from coal was driven by five main factors: ambitious decarbonisation targets , the introduction of a rising minimum carbon price which made the economics of coal less favourable, strong policy support for wind power, market reforms, and investments and innovations in the grid. This can inform the UK’s efforts to reach the next major milestone: a clean power system by 2030.“The work to build a clean power system will continue. To cut the need for expensive imported gas, to lower energy bills and to generate clean electricity which will enable the rest of the economy to transition too”, said Mayo.","The last remaining coal plant Ratcliffe-on-Soar is set to close on September 30.

"Princess Kate shines as most beloved royal, but poll shows Harry and Meghan’s popularity dips",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/princess-kate-shines-as-most-beloved-royal-but-poll-shows-harry-and-meghans-popularity-dips/articleshow/113570820.cms,"The Princess of Wales has cemented her status as the most beloved member of the British royal family , according to a new Ipsos poll . The survey, which asked Britons aged 18-75 about their views on the royals, found that 66% hold a favorable opinion of Kate, Princess of Wales. The 42-year-old royal, who recently resumed duties following cancer treatment, outshone her royal counterparts in the poll, receiving only 10% unfavorable feedback.Prince William followed closely behind, with 65% of respondents viewing him favorably.His popularity far eclipsed his small 13% unfavorable rating, reaffirming his strong position in the public’s heart, report the Post.Rounding out the top three was Princess Anne, who garnered 62% favorability. Known for her no-nonsense demeanor, Anne was even dubbed a “badass” earlier this year after she expertly managed an unruly horse at the Trooping the Colour ceremony. She continues to maintain her reputation as a reliable and steadfast royal.While King Charles did not top the charts, the monarch enjoyed a respectable 56% favorability rating in his second year on the throne. Despite battling cancer, the king remains largely well-liked, with Britons appreciating his leadership during challenging times.However, it’s a different story for the king’s estranged son, Prince Harry , and daughter-in-law, Meghan Markle. With a favorability rating of just 28%, Harry's public perception has taken a significant hit, with 46% holding an unfavorable opinion. Meghan Markle fared even worse, with only 21% of Britons viewing her favorably, and a staggering 53% unfavorable rating. Only Prince Andrew, embroiled in scandal, ranked lower, with just 10% holding a positive opinion and 66% viewing him unfavorably.The poll highlights the monarchy’s enduring appeal. Less than a quarter of Brits (23%) believe Britain would be better off without the monarchy, while 44% think the country would be worse off if the institution were abolished.“This recent poll paints a picture of the Royal Family’s enduring appeal,” noted Gideon Skinner, Senior Director of UK Politics at Ipsos. “It’s also noteworthy that over half of Britons believe King Charles is performing well in his role, and only a minority want to abolish the monarchy, suggesting a degree of stability in the Royal Family’s image.”Interestingly, Harry and Meghan’s favorability was higher among younger Britons, with many expressing support for the prince’s return to the UK as a working royal. Despite this, no current royal rivals the late Queen Elizabeth II in terms of popularity. A separate Ipsos survey from May 2022 revealed that an impressive 86% of Brits were satisfied with the Queen’s performance, just months before her passing.The poll underscores a complex royal landscape—while the younger generation may show some leniency towards Harry and Meghan, the traditional core of the monarchy remains firmly intact, with Kate, William, and Charles holding strong in public opinion.","The Princess of Wales is the most popular member of the British royal family, according to a new Ipsos poll.
