'Political black comedy at its darkest': MK Stalin slams Yogi Adityanath over 'hate' remark amid language row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/political-black-comedy-at-its-darkest-mk-stalin-slams-yogi-adityanath-over-hate-remark-amid-language-row/articleshow/119569568.cms,"MK Stalin (left), and Yogi Adityanath

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Thursday hit out at Yogi Adityanath , after the UP CM criticised Stalin over the three-language row and delimitation, saying that Tamil Nadu CM was trying to create divisions based on region and language.""Tamil Nadu’s fair and firm voice on two-language policy and fair delimitation is echoing nationwide—and the BJP is clearly rattled. Just watch their leaders’ interviews,"" Stalin said in a post on X.He added, ""And now Hon’ble Yogi Adityanath wants to lecture us on hate? Spare us. This isn’t irony—it’s political black comedy at its darkest.""In an interview with the news agency ANI, UP CM Yogi said that Stalin was trying to create divisions based on region and language because he felt his vote bank was at risk.Adityanath questioned why Hindi should be ""hated"".On being asked about the opposition to the Hindi language in Tamil Nadu, Yogi said, ""The country should not be divided on the basis of language or region. We are grateful to Prime Minister Modi ji for organizing the third generation of the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam in Varanasi. Tamil is one of the oldest languages in India, and its history is as ancient as Sanskrit. Every Indian has respect and reverence for Tamil because many elements of Indian heritage are still alive in the language. So, why should we hate Hindi?""Adityanath had also dismissed Stalin's concerns about delimitation, calling it a ""political agenda.""""Look, the home minister has said this very clearly on this matter. This is Stalin's political agenda under the guise of the meeting. I believe that after the home minister's statement, no questions should arise on this issue,"" he said.On February 22, the first Joint Action Committee (JAC), led by Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin, urged the central government to ""not penalise"" the states that have effectively implemented the population control program.Replying to Adityanath's statement, Stalin wrote, ""We don’t oppose any language; we oppose imposition and chauvinism. This isn’t riot-for-votes politics. This is a battle for dignity and justice.""Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin has accused the Union government of trying to impose Hindi and has refused to implement the three-language formula under NEP. Tamil Nadu's refusal to adopt the three-language policy under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has revived the long-standing debate on language.The debate over NEP is focused on its three-language formula, which Tamil Nadu fears may lead to the introduction of Hindi in the state. Stalin has raised concerns that the policy gives more importance to Hindi over regional languages, which he believes affects the state's linguistic identity and autonomy. The central government, however, says that NEP encourages multilingualism and allows flexibility in language education.Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has denied that Hindi is being imposed, saying that states have the freedom to choose their languages under the policy.The dispute grew after the central government withheld Rs 2,152 crore meant for Tamil Nadu’s Samagra Shiksha scheme, citing the state’s refusal to implement NEP. Tamil Nadu has historically opposed the three-language formula, considering it a step toward promoting Hindi, while the central government argues that the policy is intended to help students access job opportunities in different regions.",Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin hit out at Yogi Adityanath after the UP CM criticised Stalin over the three-language row and delimitation.

He noted that efforts are ongoing to address the damage from the 2020 clashes, adding, ""We genuinely, sincerely think that this is in our mutual interest.""India and China reached a disengagement agreement in October for Depsang and Demchok, the last two friction points in eastern Ladakh. Days later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks in Kazan, leading to decisions aimed at improving bilateral relations .Jaishankar highlighted the importance of managing differences to prevent them from turning into disputes.

He pointed out that while America has developed AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok, and China has introduced DeepSeek, India’s progress in AI remains unclear.""China has DeepSeek, the US has ChatGPT, Grok, but where does India stand in this era of Artificial Intelligence?"" Chadha asked in the Upper House of the Parlaiment.He questioned whether India was falling behind in AI and if the country would be able to develop its own generative AI model.Citing data from 2010 to 2022, Chadha said that 60 per cent of the world’s AI patents were registered by the United States and 20 per cent by China. ""Between 2010 and 2022, 60 per cent of the world's AI patents were registered by the USA, and 20 per cent by China. India, the fifth-largest economy in the world, managed to capture only half a per cent. It is true that the USA and China have a head start of four to five years, but this is because they have invested in their research, academia, and AI development,"" Chadha said.""It is said that 15 per cent of the total AI workforce consists of Indians. Around 4,50,000 Indian AI professionals are working in foreign countries. This means that India has talent, hardworking people, brainpower, and a digital economy. However, despite all this, India has become a consumer of AI today, not a producer,"" Chadha further said.He also noted that India has over 90 crore internet users, yet the country is primarily an AI consumer rather than a producer.Chadha also referred to OpenAI founder Sam Altman’s comments, where he described India's AI potential as ""disappointing."" He urged the government to focus on becoming a producer of AI.To strengthen India’s position in AI, Chadha suggested steps such as producing indigenous AI chips, creating a dedicated AI infrastructure fund, providing research grants, offering tax incentives, and preventing talent migration.""The time has come when India should become an AI producer rather than an AI consumer. For this, we need to start making indigenous AI chips in the country. We should start an AI Infra Fund. We should also stop talent migration so that India's top-tier AI talent remains in the country,"" he said.He pointed out that financial investment in AI needs to increase, noting that the US spends 3.5 per cent of its GDP on AI research, China 2.5 per cent, while India spends only 0.7 per cent.""In the future, the nation that dominates AI will lead the world and become a global guru.

'Unfortunate... law should take action': Adityanath on Kunal Kamra row



Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath , in an exclusive interview with news agency ANI, addressed critical issues spanning politics, governance, and religious matters while taking strong positions on several topics.The interview covered significant ground, from allegations of foreign interference in the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections to the state's contentious bulldozer policy.The chief minister also expressed his stance on the ongoing row over remarks made by comedian Kunal Kamra during his show in Mumbai.The Uttar Pradesh chief minister affirmed that people from all religions are safe in the state, emphasising that communal harmony is maintained when Hindus feel secure. He said, ""If Hindus are safe, then Muslims are also safe. In Uttar Pradesh, Muslims are the safest. Before 2017, riots would see both Hindu and Muslim properties burning. After 2017, riots stopped.""""A Muslim family is the safest among a hundred Hindu families. But can 50 Hindus be safe among 100 Muslim families? No. Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are examples,"" Yogi said.Speaking about Sanatan Dharma , he called it the world's oldest religion and said, ""Sanatan Dharma followers have never sought to convert others or establish dominion over them. We see the world as a family.""""A Muslim family is the safest among a hundred Hindu families. They will have the freedom to practice all their religious deeds. But can 50 Hindus be safe among 100 Muslim families? No. Bangladesh is an example. Before this, Pakistan was an example. What happened in Afghanistan? If there is smoke or someone is being hit, we should be careful before we get hit. That is what needs to be taken care of,"" Yogi said, while adding that he treats everyone equally.Yogi accused the opposition of using foreign funds to influence the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, with the Congress and INDIA bloc being directly involved. He accused NGOs, social media platforms, and digital media of being used to spread false propaganda against the BJP.He pointed to billionaire investor George Soros as one of the figures allegedly involved in financing these efforts and warned that further revelations would expose more details.""Congress and opposition parties did propaganda and they had not only spread propaganda, but foreign money was also involved in it. George Soros had already announced it... Many facts will come to light. Through NGOs, social media platforms, digital media, they spread propaganda on a large-scale propaganda in various parts of the country that BJP will change the constitution, if PM Modi will come, they will bring a new constitution, all kinds of things they have said,"" CM Yogi Adityanath told ANI.""I am saying that foreign money was involved in the Lok Sabha elections throughout the country in which Congress and other parties of the INDIA bloc were directly involved in it and through that, they tried to influence the elections. This action falls under the category of treason. You are taking money from a foreign power and influencing the country's elections,"" he added.Yogi Adityanath strongly defended ' Maha kumbh ' amid opposition criticism, particularly from West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee , who labelled it ""Mrityu Kumbh"" following a stampede incident that claimed lives of .....""Every day from Bengal, from January 13 to February 26, 50,000 to 100,000 devotees used to come to Prayagraj. The West Bengal Government got scared to see the crowd as their railway stations and airports were filled with people heading to Prayagraj... Whether it is the West Bengal Government, the Congress, the RJD, or the Samajwadi Party, whatever they have said about the Mahakumbh is an example of their appeasement. It is an example of insulting the faith of India. But the Mahakumbh has proved that it was a Mrityunjay Mahakumbh,"" the UP CM stated.He further mocked Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra, branding it as ""Bharat Todo Abhiyan"", and accused him of tarnishing India’s image on foreign soil.""Rahul jaise kuch namune rehne chahiye jisse ek rasta hamesha ke liye saaf hota rahe aur acha rahe"", Adityanath said, suggesting that Gandhi’s political presence ultimately benefits the BJP.Responding to criticism over his government's ""bulldozer action,"" Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath defended the policy, stating that those who take the law into their own hands will face consequences within the legal framework.""Those who believe in justice, justice is done for them. Those who take justice and law into their own hands, they are taught a lesson within the framework of law. It should be explained in the language they understand,"" Adityanath said.Justifying strong action against criminals, he said that if someone resorts to violence, the government must respond accordingly. ""If someone comes as a violent person to attack us, should we stand in front of him? No, if he comes as a violent person, we will have to respond to his violence there,"" he added.Yogi Adityanath vowed to revive as many temples as present in Sambhal. He said that the authorities have till now identified more than 54 pilgrimage sites in the city, and efforts are underway to locate the remaining ones.""Jitne bhi honge, sab dhundenge. Jo Bhagwan ne aankh di hai, wo dekhe ki Sambhal mein kya hua. Sambhal satya hai,"" he declared. He also questioned the legitimacy of mosques built on ruins of vandalised Hindu temples arguing that Islam itself does not recognise places of worship constructed by destroying others.Regarding the Mathura mosque dispute, Adityanath maintained that the state government is abiding by the court’s directives but hinted at potential action, saying, ""Who knows what could have happened by now?""In relation to Kunal Kamra's recent remark on Eknath Shinde, Yogi Adityanath said that the freedom of expression does not mean that individuals can use it to attack someone else, adding that law should take action against such people ""who are creating differences in the country.""""Freedom of expression is in the realm of law. It should be in the realm of constitutional values. And in that realm, there is freedom of expression. The freedom of your personality cannot be used to attack someone else. It is unfortunate that some people have considered the freedom of this individual as their birthright to divide the country and increase the division. And I feel that the law should take action against such people who are creating a difference in the country,"" CM Yogi said.","Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath addressed critical issues spanning politics, governance, and religious matters in an exclusive interview with news agency ANI.

"‘Santosh’, UK’s Oscar entry, blocked in India?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/santosh-uks-oscar-entry-blocked-in-india/articleshow/119558852.cms,"Censors’ decision disappointing and heartbreaking: Suri

Santosh, the UK’s official entry in the Oscars’ international feature category and a Bafta nominee for best debut feature, has been blocked by Indian film censors, according to a report in UK daily Guardian.Written and directed by British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri , the film was made in India and is in Hindi. According to the Guardian report, Central Board of Film Certification refused to clear the film over concerns about its negative portrayal of police — “depicting deep-rooted misogyny, discrimination against Dalits and the normalisation of mistreatment and torture by police officers.”Several CBFC board members TOI spoke to said they were unaware of reasons behind uncertainty over the release in India. “The film also grapples with the issue of sexual violence in India , particularly against lower caste women, and the rising tide of anti-Muslim prejudice in the country,” adds the report.Author and CBFC board member Ramesh Patange said, “I attend movie reviews once a month, and my role is limited to that. Only the chairman is privy to the board’s day-to-day functioning.” Other board members declined to comment, saying only CBFC chairperson Prasoon Joshi would speak on the issue. Efforts to contact Joshi were unsuccessful at the time of going to press.CBFC board member and filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri told TOI from Puducherry that he was unaware of any issues with the film.“In my personal capacity, not as a representative of any organisation, I feel deeply distressed that a society which considers itself the spiritual leader of the world is so insecure that it resorts to censorship. Only an insecure society censors art in any form Art, creativity, and literature form the soup that nourishes society. Without it, a society cannot grow,” said Agnihotri.The Guardian report says Sandhya Suri descibed the censors’ decision as “disappointing and heartbreaking”.It also quotes her as saying the censors had demanded a list of radical cuts so lengthy and wide-ranging that they would be impossible to implement, adding that the list of cuts demanded went on for several pages, and included concerns about themes relating to police conduct and wider societal problems “which are deeply baked into the film”.“It was very important to me that the film is released in India so I did try to figure out if there was a way to make it work. But in the end it was just too difficult to make those cuts and have a film that still made sense, let alone stayed true to its vision,” the Guardian report quoted Suri as saying.","Santosh, the UK’s official entry in the Oscars’ international feature category and a Bafta nominee for best debut feature, has been blocked by Indian film censors, according to a report in UK daily Guardian.

NEW DELHI: The United States is cracking down on “bots” blocking substantial visa interview appointment dates in India, leaving many applicants with no option but to pay agents about Rs 30,000-35,000 per person to get the same in time for their proposed visit.The US embassy in India said on Wednesday on X: “Consular Team India is cancelling about 2,000 visa appointments made by bots. We have zero tolerance for agents and fixers who violate our scheduling policies. Effective immediately, we are cancelling these appointments and suspending the associated accounts’ scheduling privileges (sic).”“We will continue our anti-fraud efforts. We have zero tolerance for frauds,” the post added. It is an open secret in travel industry that while there’s a long wait for appointment dates for US visas — business & visitor B1/B2 & student — paying an agent magically secures a slot within a month or so.“We tried to get a visa interview date on our own for our child who had to join an American university last fall but nothing was available in the timeframe to do so. We paid an agent Rs 30,000 and got the same in time,” a person said on condition of anonymity. Similarly, the wait for a B1/B2 is over six months but paying Rs 30-35,000 could mean getting one within a month or so.Sources say agents use bots to block appointment dates due to which no near-term availability is visible when applicants want to book one on their own. When the wait for B1/B2 appointments was near the 999-day mark in 2023, the US had to open appointments for Indian applicants at its consulates in Frankfurt and Bangkok, among other places.India had also taken up the issue of long visa wait times with the US 2-3 years ago. The US took a series of steps to cut waiting times. Now, with US cracking down on bots, the situation might improve further.","The US embassy in India is cancelling about 2,000 visa appointments made by bots.

Bangladesh government not acknowledging persecution of minorities: MEA to Parliamentary panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bangladesh-government-not-acknowledging-persecution-of-minorities-mea-to-parliamentary-panel/articleshow/119546230.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has reportedly informed a parliamentary panel that Bangladesh government has refused to recognise the systematic victimisation of minorities and has attempted to minimise the scale of violence against Hindus following Sheikh Hasina's government's departure, according to sources quoted by news agency PTI.During a presentation to the Standing Committee on External Affairs, led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, the ministry reportedly highlighted increasing religious symbolism in public spaces, with extremist groups advocating for an Islamic caliphate filling the political void, sources indicated.Additionally, foreign secretary Vikram Misri provided a briefing on ""Future of India-Bangladesh Relationship"" and matters concerning the Indian diaspora globally. Subsequently, Tharoor informed the press that the discussion primarily centred on Bangladesh relations, describing it as thorough, and noted the committee's adoption of its diaspora report.The ministry revealed that Bangladesh's army chief publicly acknowledged the risks posed by internal conflicts. It noted recurring instances of mob violence, property destruction, and offences against women and minorities.According to the PTI sources, the committee was informed that Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus and associates dismissed reports of minority persecution as media hyperbole, characterising them as ""political killings"" of Awami League members rather than communal violence.The ministry also indicated that working-level engagement with Bangladesh facilitates bilateral cooperation whilst addressing strategic concerns. It emphasised the importance of Bangladesh considering regional security matters whilst pursuing mutual interests.Officials stressed Bangladesh's stability as crucial for regional security, highlighting the significance of maintaining constructive bilateral relations for border safety. They expressed serious concern over the release of violent Islamic extremists previously convicted of serious offences, viewing it as a threat to regional and global security.The Indian administration has repeatedly urged the interim government to prosecute those responsible for minority-targeted violence.This report comes on the day PM Modi conveyed a message to Yunus affirming India's dedication to strengthening ties with its eastern neighbour, acknowledging Bangladesh's independence day. ""This day stands as a testament to our shared history and sacrifices, which have laid the foundation of our bilateral partnership. The spirit of the Liberation War of Bangladesh continues to remain a guiding light for our relationship, which has flourished across multiple domains, bringing tangible benefits to our peoples,"" PM Modi wrote.""We remain committed to advancing this partnership, driven by our common aspirations for peace, stability, and prosperity, and based on mutual sensitivity to each other's interests and concerns,"" he added.Bangladesh's Independence Day, also known as National Day, marks the nation's declaration of sovereignty from Pakistan on this date in 1971.

"Defence ministry inks mega Rs 6,900 crore deal for indigenous heavy-duty artillery guns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/defence-ministry-inks-mega-rs-6900-crore-deal-for-indigenous-heavy-duty-artillery-guns/articleshow/119542878.cms,"NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Wednesday inked the around Rs 6,900 crore contract for production of 307 advanced towed artillery gun systems ( ATAGS ) and 327 high mobility 6x6 gun-towing vehicles with private sector companies Bharat Forge and Tata Advanced Systems , in the first-ever deal for such indigenous heavy-duty howitzers.With the signing of the deal for the 155mm/52-calibre ATAGS designed and developed by DRDO, the total value of capital procurement contracts inked by MoD in the ongoing fiscal stands at Rs 1.4 lakh crore. The PM-led cabinet committee on security had cleared the ATAGS deal on March 19, as was first reported by TOI.Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh felicitated the project director of ATAGS -- which has a strike range of up to 45-km depending on the ammunition -- from DRDO’s Pune-based Armament Research and Development Establishment during the ceremony on Wednesday.“The procurement of this gun system marks a significant milestone in the modernization of the Army’s artillery regiments, enhancing their operational readiness along the borders with China and Pakistan. Renowned for its exceptional lethality, the ATAGS will play a crucial role in bolstering the Army's firepower by enabling precise and long-range strikes,” an official said.Bharat Forge will manufacture 60% of the guns because it had emerged as the L-1 (lowest bidder), while Tata will produce the remaining 40%. “ATAGS will replace outdated 105mm and 130mm guns. Over 65% of its components are sourced domestically, including key subsystems such as the barrel, muzzle brake, breech mechanism, firing and recoil system, and ammunition handling mechanism,” another official said.Officers say ATAGS have “excellent” accuracy, consistency, mobility, reliability and automation, longer maintenance-free reliable operations due to their “all-electric drive technology”, and can fire five-round bursts as compared to three-round bursts by other contemporary foreign guns.The ATAGS, whose development began in 2013, has undergone a series of protracted field trials over the years. Finally, in 2021-22, the winter trials were successfully completed at high-altitude areas in Sikkim, which were followed by summer user-firing tests at the Pokhran field firing ranges.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has again driven home the operational utility of long-range, high-volume firepower. Consequently, the Army is progressively stepping up induction of howitzers, missiles, rocket systems and loiter munitions, as reported by TOI earlier.In Dec, for instance, the defence ministry inked a Rs 7,629 crore contract with L&T in collaboration with South Korean Hanwha Defence for the procurement of another 100 K-9 Vajra-T self-propelled tracked gun systems, which have a strike range of 28-38 km and can be deployed in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China.Then in Feb, the MoD inked contracts worth Rs 10,147 crore for high-explosive pre-fragmented extended rockets (45-km range) and area denial munitions (37-km) for the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems being inducted by the Army. Pinaka, too, is being exported to other countries.India has grappled with recurring scandals in import of artillery guns , from the Swedish Bofors in the mid-1980s to the South African Denel in 2005 and Singapore Technology Kinetics in 2009, repeatedly derailing the Army's modernization drive.","The defence ministry on Wednesday inked the around Rs 6,900 crore contract for production of 307 advanced towed artillery gun systems.

The two exercises will be conducted simultaneously — the census in three phases over a three-and-a-half-year period and the increasing of green cover over four years.The census will help track tree populations area-wise and check illegal felling. The court took this step in view of the fact that Delhi witnesses felling of five trees per hour on an average. A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan allowed FRI to go ahead with the exercises but asked it to try to complete the tasks in a shorter span and also reduce budget.The court also accepted the submission of additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati that the money to undertake census should be released from the CAMPA fund. She assured that all necessary help would be provided to the institute but said the exercise should be concluded in a shorter time.As per FRI, the exercise will be carried out in three phases, with the first phase aiming at standardising the methodology for tree census — it will take 15 months. The second phase is about development of an action plan that will be done in three months, and the final phase is implementation, which will take two years.“FRI proposes an estimated budget of Rs 443 lakh for the execution of phase one and phase two on standardisation of methodology and pilot trial for the development of action plan for implementation in phase three,” the institute said in its affidavit.It said the Tree Authority and the Delhi forest department will undertake the census, and FRI will provide technical support and capacity building to the department’s officials in undertaking the exercise besides monitoring and evaluation. The final report will be submitted to the court by the authority.It said the institute will design and develop a web portal and a mobile app for the census. Regarding enhancing green cover in the national capital territory (NCT), FRI placed before the court a four-year action plan to form a base to launch a massive afforestation drive to increase the forest and tree cover of the area falling within the limits of the govt of the NCT of Delhi.National Forest Policy mandates that one-third of total land area of country should be under forest or tree cover.","The census will help track tree populations area-wise and check illegal felling.

‘Political nonsense’: SC bins PIL on ‘honeytrap’ claims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/political-nonsense-sc-bins-pil-on-honeytrap-claims/articleshow/119565753.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court dismissed Wednesday a PIL seeking probe into alleged honeytrap operations in Karnataka, calling it “political nonsense”. A three-judge bench rejected the petition filed by activist Binay Singh, a Jharkhand resident. Singh had sought a court-monitored investigation or a probe led by a retired SC judge. The top court questioned the relevance of the plea, asking: “You are a resident of Jharkhand. Why are you bothered about what’s happening in that state? They are competent enough to take care of this.” The petitioner’s counsel, Barun Kumar Sinha, argued that the allegations were serious and posed a threat to judicial independence . “We are concerned about the independence of the judiciary,” the counsel said. Sinha argued that media reports on the matter merited a thorough probe. But SC was unconvinced. “Why should they fall into a honeytrap? If someone sets up a honeytrap and you fall into it, you are inviting trouble for yourself,” it observed, adding that the judiciary had concerns more pressing than political disputes. Cooperation minister KN Rajanna had claimed on March 20 that there had been attempts to “honeytrap” him and that at least 48 politicians across parties had fallen prey to similar schemes. “People say that there is a CD (compact disc) and pen drive factory in Karnataka. I have learnt that there are CDs and pen drives of 48 people. This network is spread across India and several Union ministers too were trapped,” Rajanna had said.","The petition was filed by activist Binay Singh, a Jharkhand resident.

However, SC disagreed with the order of National Consumer Disputes Resolution Commission.The court said that the deceased's ""alcoholism was a long- standing condition, which he knowingly suppressed while subscribing to the policy"".

NEW DELHI: Non-allocation of funds to states that have not signed MoUs to implement the PM SHRI scheme is unfair, a parliamentary panel has said, recommending that the education ministry reconsider its policy regarding the release of grants under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan .The committee on education, women, children, youth and sports, chaired by Congress MP Digvijaya Singh, has stressed that no state should be placed at a disadvantage for not implementing NEP or SSA. The non-binding recommendation comes amid the row between Centre and TN over stoppage of Rs 2,152 crore in funds, following the state’s refusal to adopt National Education Policy 2020 and its three-language formula.The panel acknowledged that 33 out of 36 states and UTs have signed MoUs and are implementing the PM SHRI scheme, which aims at creating uniform assessment and curriculum standards at the national level. However, the committee deemed it unfair to penalise the remaining states by halting SSA grants.“The committee takes serious note of the non-release of SSA funds to certain states which have not signed MoUs for implementing the PM SHRI scheme. The total pending funds under this scheme are substantial, with over Rs 1,000 crore owed to West Bengal, Rs 859.63 crore to Kerala and Rs 2,152 crore to Tamil Nadu,” said the panel’s report tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. The panel said states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Bengal, which boast gross enrolment ratios above the national average, are suffering due to the delayed release of SSA funds.“Underfunding and delays have constrained advancements in school infrastructure, teacher training, and student support in these states,” the report said.Tamil Nadu was allocated Rs 3,586 crore for FY 2024-25, with Rs 2,152 crore as the central govt’s share. Because of the TN govt’s refusal to implement NEP, the amount has not been disbursed, severely impacting salaries of teachers, RTE reimbursements and transportation for students in remote areas. The committee recommended immediate release of SSA funds, warning that delays could disrupt school operations and salaries.","Non-allocation of funds to states that have not signed MoUs to implement the PM SHRI scheme is unfair, a parliamentary panel has said.

NEW DELHI: Strongly criticising the controversial order passed by Allahabad high court that grabbing the breasts of a minor girl and snapping the string of her pyjama were not adequate to charge an accused with the offence of rape or attempt to rape, Supreme Court Wednesday said the verdict showed “total” insensitivity, and stayed its operation.“In normal circumstances, we are slow in granting stay at this stage. But since the observations appearing in paragraphs 21, 24 and 26 are totally unknown to the cannons of law and depict total insensitive and inhuman approach, we are inclined to stay the said observations,” a bench of Justices B R Gavai and A G Masih said of the order passed on March 17.New Delhi: Staying the controversial Allahabad high court order that grabbing the breasts of a minor girl and snapping her pyjama string were not enough to charge an accused with rape or attempt to rape, Supreme Court on Wednesday said the judgment was not written in a hurry and showed “application of mind” by the judge.“We have perused the said judgment and order... We are at pains to say that some of the observations made in the impugned order, and particularly in paragraphs 21, 24 and 26, depict a total lack of sensitivity on the part of the author of the judgment,” the Supreme Court bench said. “A perusal of the judgment will reveal that it is also not as if the judgment is dictated at the spur of the moment in the court. The case was reserved on Nov 13 and after almost a period of more than four months, the judge has pronounced the judgment.

Until further orders, there shall be stay to the observations made by the judge in the paragraphs,” the bench of Justices B R Gavai and AG Masih said.The controversial order was passed by a bench of Justice Ram Manohar Narayan Mishra on March 17. He had passed the order while modifying a summoning order by altering the charges against two accused. Initially, the accused were summoned to face trial under Section 376 (rape) and under the Pocso Act. However, the HC directed that the accused be tried under Section 354(B) (assault or use of criminal force with intent to disrobe), read with Pocso Act (aggravated sexual assault).At the outset of the hearing, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the order is highly objectionable and suggested that the issue be brought to the notice of the Allahabad HC chief justice who is the master of roster, hinting that such matters should not be placed before the judge in question.

Uddhav’s political struggles

Why Uddhav’s options are limited

Not all is lost





National role for Uddhav?

The road ahead

Edmund Burke, the father of modern conservatism, once remarked, ""All government—indeed, every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue and every prudent act—is founded on compromise and barter."" Few in contemporary Indian politics have embodied this more than Uddhav Thackeray. To become the chief minister of Maharashtra, he dramatically reshaped his politics, severing ties with the BJP and forging an unlikely alliance with the Congress and NCP. However, with his party, its iconic symbol, and much of its cadre now firmly under Eknath Shinde’s control, many believe the mild-mannered Thackeray scion is running out of options.Stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra, known for his sharp political satire, recently found himself at the center of a political storm over his parody songs targeting Deputy CM Eknath Shinde among others. Without explicitly naming Shinde, Kamra referred to him as a gaddar (traitor) in a parody of the song. Perhaps in a bid to provoke, he uploaded the video on YouTube.The backlash was swift—Shiv Sena cadres ransacked Habitat, the venue where Kamra performed, and promised dire consequences if the comedian did not change his ways. The reaction appeared to have top-level sanction, with Eknath Shinde stating that while satire is understood, ""there must be limits."" CM Devendra Fadnavis also indicated that legal action would be taken against Kamra.Predictably, the Uddhav Thackeray faction defended the comedian, suddenly extolling the virtues of tolerance—despite its own chequered history. MLA Aaditya Thackeray labeled Shinde an ""insecure coward"" for reacting to a song, while Uddhav bluntly stated that ""calling a traitor a traitor is not an attack on anyone.""Uddhav’s anguish is understandable. His decision to align with the Congress and NCP in 2019 marked a seismic ideological shift. Yet, the BJP had the last laugh, engineering a split in the Shiv Sena in 2022 and installing Eknath Shinde as chief minister. While Uddhav’s faction and the MVA alliance stunned the NDA in the Lok Sabha elections, winning 30 of 48 seats, their joy was short-lived as the Mahayuti rebounded spectacularly, securing over 80% of assembly seats.However, it is only now that Shinde seems to have cemented his hold over the Sena rank and file. The Kunal Kamra episode has served almost as a rite of passage, with the Shinde faction embracing the street-power tactics that once defined Balasaheb Thackeray’s Shiv Sena. The party’s willingness to ""teach a lesson"" to a celebrity for crossing a perceived Lakshman Rekha harks back to an earlier era when the Sena dictated ideological discourse through strong-arm techniques.Ironically, the man who now expresses solidarity with Kunal Kamra, even claiming to have the same DNA, had once threatened Shah Rukh Khan for defending Pakistani players’ participation in the IPL. Sanjay Raut had even asked the Bollywood superstar to move to Karachi to play cricket with Pakistanis as Shiv Sainiks violently protested against the actor's My Name is Khan. While Uddhav confidante Sanjay Raut may have turned a new leaf, Sena’s cadres are unlikely to be as flexible.Veteran political journalist Deepak Lokhande offers a scathing analysis of Uddhav’s predicament. He argues that Uddhav is pushed to the corners—BJP has seized the ideological space, while the Shinde faction has the financial muscle. From Ganesh Naik to Narayan Rane, the party’s deep-pocketed donors have defected. Even playing the Marathi Manoos card will yield limited benefits, as Raj Thackeray has already built a brand around it.Contrasting the leadership styles of Uddhav and Shinde, Lokhande notes that the latter is far more generous in funding grassroots workers and excels at networking. He predicts that in the upcoming municipal elections in Mumbai (BMC), Shiv Sena (UBT) may opt to go solo to start from a clean slate. However, given the party’s long dominance in BMC, the average Mumbaikar might be reluctant to give them another chance. Meanwhile, despite sharing power in BMC for years, the BJP has successfully de-hyphenated itself from the old Shiv Sena brand and is now in pole position for a decisive victory.Not everyone agrees with this grim prognosis. According to Adv. Ruben Mascarenhas, Mumbai Working President of the Aam Aadmi Party, ""Uddhav Thackeray has been wronged. The BJP stole his party, his symbol, and his MLAs. His politics is that of decency, and he hasn’t been cowed down by political vendetta. Given the politics of competitive violence followed by Shinde Sena and BJP, it is only a matter of time before the people of Maharashtra realize that the ruling regime needs to be shown the door.""Ruben believes that the Shinde Sena was outmaneuvered by the BJP, which used the Aurangzeb issue to deflect attention from governance failures. He claims that the BJP has been giving Eknath Shinde the cold shoulder, forcing him to pick an easy target like Kunal Kamra. He also alleges that the police remained mute spectators during the vandalism and cites BMC's swift action against Kamra’s venue as an example of the ""misplaced priorities of the incompetent Devendra Fadnavis government.""Mascarenhas further criticizes Fadnavis’s handling of law and order, pointing to the recent Nagpur riots and violence in Mumbai. According to a PTI report citing police sources, Maharashtra has witnessed over 800 communal incidents in just three months of 2025, suggesting a sharp deterioration in law and order in one of India’s most prosperous states.Political commentator and former Congress leader Sanjay Jha offers a different perspective regarding Uddhav's future. He sees Uddhav’s shift toward a ""secular"" image as an opportunity to reinvent himself as a national leader. Jha suggests that Uddhav could reshape Shiv Sena’s ideology to champion an inclusive Hindutva that aligns with India’s secular fabric. This, he argues, could attract a new voter base while retaining old supporters.Jha is also optimistic about Aaditya Thackeray’s future, seeing ideological rebranding as the first step in building a new core for the party. He urges Congress to prove itself as a worthy ally by sending Rahul Gandhi and other leaders to Maharashtra in support of Kamra, reinforcing the MVA’s commitment to taking on the BJP.However, Lokhande remains skeptical, noting that both Rahul and Aaditya suffer from what he calls the ""urbane leader predicament""—a disconnect with rural voters due to a lack of grassroots experience. He also highlights how Rahul Kanal, who led the protest against Kunal Kamra, was once a trusted aide of Aaditya but has now switched sides. Overconfidence after the Lok Sabha elections and Mahayuti’s cash schemes for women ultimately tilted the assembly elections in the BJP’s favor, according to the veteran journalist.For now, the Shinde faction shows no signs of backing down. Thane MP Naresh Mhaske has openly threatened Kamra, stating that the comedian ""will not be allowed to roam freely in Maharashtra and India."" Some Sena leaders have even accused Kamra of being on Uddhav’s payroll. The Kamra issue may soon blow over, but it puts a marker on the type of politics the ruling regime is likely to do in the future.Meanwhile, the Disha Salian death case files have been reopened at the behest of her father. Salian, the former manager of Sushant Singh Rajput, died just six days before the actor’s suicide. The FIR names Aaditya Thackeray among others, adding legal woes to the Thackeray family’s existing political battles.Can the Thackerays weather this storm and position themselves as the dominant force for anti-BJP voters? The jury is out on it.","Uddhav Thackeray, son of Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb, is the chief minister of Maharashtra. His party, its iconic symbol, and much of its cadre now firmly under Eknath Shinde’s control. The Kunal Kamra episode has served almost as a rite of passage, says Deepak Lokhande.

Baseball yields a lot of money and demands a surplus simultaneously. Teams need people with deep pockets to inject cash into the game, which enables their management to invest in elite players and extend ace-class facilities to them. That is why biggies like Steve Cohen become the newsmakers when they decide to invest in a baseball team.Steve Cohen made the headlines when he announced his association with the New York Mets in 2020. Forbes reported that he bought the team for a whopping $2.4 Bn, the highest deal ever made in MLB history for a team’s sale.He brought a handsome amount into the baseball game from his cash cow, Point72 Asset Management Company , a multibillion venture. Let’s explore the net worth of the Mets’ owner in 2025 and the assets and investments contributing to it.According to Forbes, Steve Cohen is the 94th wealthiest person, with a net worth of $21.3 billion. The Bloomberg Billionaire Index reports that his fortune empire has grown by 842M, at a rate of +5.7% in 2024. What he spent on the New York Mets’ payroll and luxury tax in 2024 combines three teams’ total spending in the last two decades.Talking to the New York Post about his expenditure plan in December 2024, Cohen said, “One thing I’ve learned a long time ago, if you want something that’s amazing, it’s going to be uncomfortable.”Steve Cohen ventured into the business space, leveraging his exceptional investment sense. In 1992, he started SAC Capital, one of the biggest hedge fund companies of its time. His confidence in his decision to start this company stems from the fact that he shelled out $25 million from his earnings to bring this venture idea to life.Cohen had to consolidate this venture in 2012 when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pressed insider trading charges against him. The venture was a massive success at the time, with $16 billion worth of assets under management (AUM). Following the charges, Cohen consolidated SAC’s operations and paid $1.2 billion in penalties.Cohen didn’t let the setback take over his acumen and moved the remaining funds (left after paying penalties and charges) to start Point72 Asset Management Company. This venture also swelled to a $35 billion (AUM) hedge fund company in 2018. According to Fintel’s data, Point72's portfolio stands at $45,388,177,650.Another top asset of Steve Cohen is the New York Mets, which he bought in 2020 via the biggest sale deal in MLB history, which equaled $2.4 billion.Steve Cohen bought the New York Mets from the Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz families in 2020 for a whopping $2.4 billion.According to the New York Post, the team had already spent $1.13 billion on payroll and paid $228.7 million in taxes before the much-talked-about $765 million, 15-year contract with Juan Soto happened.Other significant contracts that define the Mets' expenditure scene are Francisco Lindor’s 10-year, $341 million deal and Pete Alonso’s $30 million contract in 2025.Steve Cohen can’t mind shelling out these humongous contracts as these pay him back a startling return. Mentioning Bloomberg’s data, Business Insider reported in 2020 that Cohen initially invested $20 million in 2012. The investment paid 350% returns in 2017, when the valuation of Cohen’s stake in the team became $90 million.According to Forbes' MLB team valuation data, Cohen owns 95% of the Mets, which were valued at $3 billion in March 2024.Steve Cohen spends lavishly on multimillion-dollar luxury mansions and apartments in Manhattan’s West Village. He owns a $35 million mansion, which he bought from actor Glenn Ford for $31 million in 2015. His modern art collection is estimated to have a valuation of $1 billion. His NYC duplex penthouse was listed at $115 million in 2014.In 2024’s Forbes 400 list, he appears at number 39. He was the fifth among the most affluent US Sports team owners in 2024.Also Read: MLB insider reflects on Mets' playoff chances after Steve Cohen spent nearly $1,000,000,000 on contracts","Steve Cohen bought the New York Mets from the Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz families in 2020 for a whopping $2.4 billion.

India vs Pakistan: Canadian traveller compares hospitality



Social media reactions on the India vs. Pakistan hospitality debate



Also Read |

India is renowned for its hospitality, encapsulated in the words ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’ (Guest is God). Yet, not everyone finds this to be true. A new viral video with a Canadian tourist has ignited an interesting controversy about the hospitality of India and Pakistan.Nolan Saumure is not a tourist who travels for fun; he is a vlogger who has traveled to many countries, including India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, America, and many more. His wide travel background grants him an extensive viewpoint on how various cultures go about hospitality, and this probably advised his perception.This viral video highlights the differing perceptions of hospitality in India and Pakistan. While some might agree with Saumure's view of Pakistan's very open and welcoming culture, others will claim that India's tourist industry has commercialized its way of hospitality. In the end, this argument encapsulates how hospitality is affected by such elements as culture, tourism, and individuals' personal experiences and thus is a complex area deserving of further study.During an Instagram interview with Instagram user @officialnamour, Canadian traveler Nolan Saumure was requested to comment on how hospitable Pakistan and India were. His matter-of-fact response, as prompt as his decision, had sparked online discussion. When directly asked which of the two countries has better hospitality, Saumure answered: ""Pakistan, obviously.""Saumure's brief reply paved the way for general discussions and arguments on the various social networking sites, mainly between individuals coming from both the nations and otherwise. When Saumure was asked to expound on his reasoning, he outlined his rationale. Hospitality in India, he said, is very transactional-oriented. He alleged that Indians in general perceive foreign guests more as customers who are likely to bring in money, not as guests to be greeted with hospitality. In contrast, he portrayed Pakistanis as hospitable, inviting guests to share meals and even welcome them to their homes.""People in India treat you like a walking ATM,"" Saumure said. ""In Pakistan, people invite you over, feed you, and even ask you to stay overnight."" His analogy is meant to depict an extreme contrast between how hospitality is thought about and practiced in both nations.The video soon became viral, receiving more than 4.4 million views and evoking a variety of responses from both sides of the argument.Various individuals identified with Saumure's view, with one of the Instagram users, an African in Dubai, stating, ""Pakistanis are friendlier than Indian people. Pakistan treats you as a friend, Indians treat you as a complete stranger."" Another user, an Indian, simply stated: ""I agree.""Some viewers provided explanations for the difference in hospitality between India and Pakistan. One commenter posited that India's tourism sector is much bigger and more commercialized, which could result in a more transactional attitude towards foreign guests. Pakistan, on the other hand, has fewer foreign tourists, so each guest feels like a special guest.In contrast, there were critics of Saumure's viewpoint among certain users. One such comment wondered why Indians expect ""princess treatment"" from foreigners, citing the historical context of colonial exploitation and wealth looted from India over centuries. Saumure shot back at this criticism by explaining that his preference for not being harassed has nothing to do with expecting ""princess treatment,"" but merely a desire to feel welcome and at ease.","A viral video highlights the differing perceptions of hospitality in India and Pakistan. Canadian traveler Nolan Saumure was requested to comment on how hospitable Pakistan and India were. His matter-of-fact response sparked online discussion. The argument encapsulates how hospitality is affected by such elements as culture, tourism, and individuals' personal experiences.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119524289,imgsize-34474,width-400,resizemode-4/119524289.jpg"

'Loot Rs 70 lakh in jewellery from Dwarka gated society': Burglars break into 3 flats in one night,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/loot-rs-70-lakh-in-jewellery-from-dwarka-gated-society-burglars-break-into-3-flats-in-one-night/articleshow/119571479.cms,"NEW DELHI: A series of burglaries in a housing society in Dwarka's Sector 4 has left residents in shock and fear. In a single night, masked men scaled the generator room wall at the rear of Antariksh Apartments and within an hour had broken into three flats in Blocks D and E, looting jewellery and valuables worth Rs 70 lakh.Antariksh Apartments has round-the-clock security, with six to seven guards stationed at entry points and patrolling the premises. Despite these security measures, the burglars managed the theft without being noticed.Cases have been registered at the Dwarka North police station, and investigations are under way.Sanjay Chatterjee, a resident of a sixth-floor Flat in E Block, was in Himachal Pradesh with his wife when the burglary took place. He left Dwarka on Feb 24 after learning that his 82-year-old father was in hospital. His death forced Chatterjee to extend his stay. ""While I was busy with last rites, on March 9, I received a call in the evening from my neighbour informing me that our house lock was broken. Along with mine, two other flats were looted. They informed police,"" said Chatterjee.When he returned to Delhi on March 11, he was devastated by the scene inside his home. ""The front door lock was broken, the almirah locks were smashed and our house had been ransacked,"" said Chatterjee. ""Some of my wife's jewellery pieces were extremely precious, old and irreplaceable. The burglars left nothing behind. It's the last thing anyone wants to deal with while in mourning.""He added, ""Imagine if my wife had been home alone. I'm terrified about her safety. These criminals must be arrested before they harm anyone else.""Another flat on the fifth floor of the same building was also broken into.

""They stole jewellery worth Rs 25 lakh, along with other valuables. How could something like this happen in a gated society?"" she asked.CCTV footage from the complex shows two men scaling the generator room wall and moving around undetected.

What it means for India

Zoom in

India's leading car manufacturers like Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki focus predominantly on domestic sales, which offers some insulation from the direct effects of the tariffs. However, global players with links to India may encounter more complex risks.

focus predominantly on domestic sales, which offers some insulation from the direct effects of the tariffs. However, global players with links to India may encounter more complex risks. Tata Motors’ subsidiary, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), exports luxury vehicles mainly from the UK and Europe to the US. The new tariffs could drive up costs, prompting JLR to reevaluate its pricing models, consider relocating production, or face margin pressure in an already tight luxury segment.

Meanwhile, India’s fast-growing auto parts sector is likely to feel the impact most immediately. Large Indian suppliers such as Bharat Forge and Motherson Sumi may need to rethink their global strategies. Exploring new markets in Europe, Southeast Asia, or Africa could become essential to maintain resilience and enable long-term growth.

Between the lines

The new tariff announcement reflects Trump's broader policy of reciprocal tariffs, especially targeting countries with high import duties on US goods. India’s elevated tariffs—some exceeding 100% on imported vehicles—have been a previous point of contention for Trump.

Should the US expand retaliatory measures beyond automobiles to sectors like pharmaceuticals, agriculture, or technology, the resulting trade friction could intensify. Estimates suggest India could lose up to $7 billion annually if broader tariffs are imposed across multiple sectors.

What they're saying

Industry reactions have been swift and sharply divided over the economic implications of the tariffs.

Jennifer Safavian, CEO of Autos Drive America, warned, ""The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the US.""

Tesla CEO Elon Musk underscored the universal impact on manufacturers, stating, ""It's important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant.""

underscored the universal impact on manufacturers, stating, ""It's important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant."" In contrast, the United Auto Workers (UAW), representing American factory workers, praised Trump's move, highlighting potential job gains domestically. UAW President Shawn Fain said, ""With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue-collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within months.""

The big picture

What's next

A US trade delegation led by assistant trade representative for South and Central Asia Brendan Lynch in in India for a round of discussions from March 25 to 29.

The talks are part of broader efforts to finalize a bilateral trade agreement (BTA). The timing is critical, as the US prepares to impose reciprocal tariffs on countries including India starting April 2.

Indian exporters remain cautious, particularly in sectors like pharmaceuticals and agriculture that may be exposed to further tariff hikes.

The current negotiations aim to improve market access, lower trade barriers, and increase supply chain collaboration between the two nations.

India and the US are targeting completion of the first phase of the BTA by autumn 2025, with a shared goal of expanding bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. India has expressed openness to reducing tariffs on certain US products in return for favorable trade terms.

US President Donald Trump has declared a 25% tariff on imported cars and key auto parts, effective April 3. The policy is framed as a strategy to revive the US automotive manufacturing industry by incentivizing domestic investment from automakers.The tariff encompasses not just fully assembled vehicles but also critical components such as engines, transmissions, powertrain systems, and electrical assemblies. According to the White House, the measure is expected to yield around $100 billion annually, reflecting a notable pivot in US trade policy.India’s direct automobile exports to the US remain relatively small compared to Mexico, Canada, and Japan. However, the secondary effects of the US tariffs may have significant implications for India’s automotive sector. In particular, India's auto components industry—deeply embedded in global supply chains—has emerged as a key supplier to American car manufacturers.According to reports, India exported approximately $1.5 billion in auto parts to the US in 2023. The new tariffs could cause major disruptions, increasing input costs for US-based automakers and thereby reducing demand for Indian parts. Suppliers may face pressure on profit margins and be forced to absorb added costs or redirect exports to other regions.Tata Motors, vulnerable to trade disruptions given its substantial exports of Jaguar Land Rover vehicles to the US, was notably impacted. The shares of Tata Motors were down over 5% on Thursday.Trump’s tariff policy has broad implications for the global automotive landscape. Countries heavily involved in US automotive supply chains—including Canada, Mexico, Germany, Japan, and South Korea—could see their production and trade flows disrupted. The result may be a deceleration in global economic activity.For India, the scenario presents both challenges and openings. While direct exposure to US tariffs is limited, knock-on effects through supply chains and shifting market dynamics are likely. Indian suppliers reliant on the US must adapt quickly, whether by pivoting to other markets or strengthening their domestic footprint.(With inputs from agencies)","US President Donald Trump has declared a 25% tariff on imported cars and key auto parts, effective April 3.

"'Same flavours the Prophet relished': 1,400-year-old recipes make culinary comeback in Hyderabad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/same-flavours-the-prophet-relished-1400-year-old-recipes-make-culinary-comeback-in-hyderabad/articleshow/119570920.cms,"Tharid |

Harees |

Nabeez |

Talbina |

Flavourful biryani and rich Haleem are Hyderabad’s ultimate BFF — everything else is pretty much “baigan ki batan nakko karo (don’t talk dumb)”, the city’s culinary shrug. But the Hyderabadi eating-out scene is rebooting and getting a serious upgrade. A 1,400-yearold gastronomic legacy from the Prophet’s time is shaking things up, attracting both the fasting and the food-curious.As the muezzin’s call to sunset prayer resonates through the old city, lanes near Charminar come alive. Hands reach for dates, water is sipped, and the Iftar meal — a moment of spiritual reflection and indulgence — begins.Hyderabadis are now breaking Ramzan fasts with the same flavours the Prophet relished, embracing dishes that transcend time.Tharid, Talbina , Nabeez, and Harees — mentioned in Hadith literature and Sahih al-Bukhari — were once confined to home kitchens. They were prepared with a quiet reverence, passed down through generations without much fanfare. Now, they are very much in the public domain, making their way to roadside stalls and high-end eateries alike.These foods, rooted in Arabic traditions of the 6th century, predate the Mughal and Nizam influences that shaped Hyderabadi cuisine.But how did these recipes find their way from the pages of Sahih al-Bukhari into the city’s Iftar and Suhoor (also called sehri) menus?Social activist Zakir Hussain has a theory. “Social media played a key role in the commercialisation of these foods. Since they come with a spiritual touch, many want to eat them. Moreover, all the ingredients — barley, dates, honey — are natural and healthy. And above all, there’s the blessing of the Prophet, as these were his favourite foods,” he said.Former software engineer Syed Moazzam sets up a modest counter at Public Gardens before sunrise, serving Talbina to early risers for Suhoor (pre-dawn meal). “My mother prepares the dish,” Moazzam said.Alongside, he offers Nabeez — a simple infusion of dates and water, rich in sugars and nutrients. “No added sugar, no artificial flavours, just the way it was taken centuries ago,” he said.His customers are a mix of fasting Muslims, fitness enthusiasts, curious morning walkers, hypochondriac eaters, and even the Instagram-driven seekers of next big trend. Some seek the nutrient-packed dishes out for their health benefits. Talbina, for example, is said to be good for diabetics.The Prophet’s diet, as documented in Hadith, revolved around barley, wheat, dates, milk, butter, and simple meats like goat or camel. Talbina, a barley-based porridge that was a favourite of Prophet, is served with camel milk, honey, or an assortment of dry fruits.The Prophet recommended Talbina for its healing properties, particularly in relieving sadness and illness.Juice-seller Abdul Qadar has taken things a step further, tweaking recipe to suit Hyderabadi palate. His Talbina comes in three variants — a rich, nut-laden version, a chilled shake, and a warm, comforting drink. “Once people know how good it is for their health, they come back for more,” he said.Long before Michelin stars, YouTubers digging up overlooked culinary gems, and artisanal food trends, there was a cuisine dictated by necessity, simplicity, and spiritual wisdom. Hyderabad has been absorbing all these trends while looking backward at the same time.Harees, a dish often confused with Persian Haleem, has been a Hyderabadi staple for decades. But now, it’s being rediscovered in its original, unembellished form.Dr Haseeb Jafferi, an expert in Hyderabadi and Sufi cuisine, sees this as part of a larger movement. “Revival of ancient foods is a new trend as more people crave healthy recipes in their exploration for something new, and tasty. If there is a spiritual link to the food, it becomes popular,” he said.Ruz Madani, a spiced rice dish from Medina, is another entrant in the city’s food scene. Rice was not a staple during Prophet’s time, but its association with the holy city gives it a spiritual seal of approval. In Hyderabad, a city that has always blended Indian, Persian, Turkish, and Arabian flavours, it feels like a natural fit.What better metaphor for this fusion than the Charminar itself, with its four minarets pointing in all directions, as if reminding that food travels, transforms, and returns with new meaning. Who knew ancient food could be so cool?Definitely not baigan.Made with bread soaked in a meat broth, typically goat or chicken, and seasoned with spices like cinnamon, and cumin. Veggies like carrots, onions, and lentils add depthWheat simmered with lamb or chicken, slow-cooked until it reaches a thick, porridge-like consistency, and ﬂavoured with salt and ghee.
