"Sandwiched between India-Pak, Punjab farmers await promised inconvenience compensation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-2-years-no-relief-for-farmers-in-sandwich-zone/articleshow/110516526.cms,"CHANDIGARH: While farmers in Punjab have been agitating for guaranteed MSP, tillers whose farms are in the ‘sandwich zone’ between the border fence and actual international border with Pakistan have another grouse — they haven’t received their promised annual inconvenience compensation of Rs 10,000 an acre for the last two years.The state and Centre are supposed to share the compensation burden equally, but New Delhi releases fresh payouts only after a utilisation certiﬁcate has been submitted by the state for the earlier released amount. Sukhjinder Singh of Rajamohtam in Ferozepur district has more than 2 acres in the zone beyond the fence. He hasn’t received his compensation for 2022 and 2023. “There are many like me in nearby villages. We’d last got this compensation in 2022, after a four-year gap and following protests,” he said.Sukhjinder’s family harvested wheat a few weeks back on the restricted side; they grow chillies on the other side of the fence. An 11-footwide village strip on the Indian side is the BSF patrolling zone. Crops in the restricted zone can’t be above 4ft high for security reasons. In Hazara Singh Wala village in Mamdot block, former panchayat secretary Sandeep Kumar said farmers “have to stick to wheat, paddy and chilli and bear with a limited produce.” The state and Centre have been sitting on their land-acquisition request for decades. Fazilka and Ferozepur Border Area Sangharsh Committee district president Ramesh Vadhera (67) said: “The land along the zero line in Ferozepur is worth between Rs 10-12 lakh an acre, but for two years, there’s been no compensation for tilling it.”“We had released inconvenience compensation for 2022. Many farmers in Guru Har Sahai tehsil have received it and the process is close to completion in Ferozepur. This district has 3,000 acres beyond the barbed-wire fence. The ofﬁce is yet to receive the compensation money for 2023, so far,” a senior ofﬁcial said on condition of anonymity.",The state and Centre are supposed to share the compensation burden equally.

Pune Porsche crash: 2 doctors arrested for changing blood sample of accused teen sent to police custody till May 30,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-porsche-crash-2-doctors-arrested-for-changing-blood-sample-of-accused-teen/articleshow/110450307.cms,"Govt forms three-member panel after arrest of two doctors of Sassoon Hospital

PUNE: Two doctors from Sassoon general hospital , arrested on Monday for destruction of evidence against the minor accused in Pune Porsche crash that killed two techies, were sent to police custody till May 30 by court.According to the police, the blood samples of the underage driver were discarded in a dustbin and substituted with samples from another individual, which showed no evidence of alcohol consumption. The arrested individuals have been identified as Dr Ajay Taware, the head of the Forensic Medicine department at the state-run hospital, Dr Shrihari Halnor, the chief medical officer, and Atul Ghatkamble, a mortuary staffer working under Dr Taware. The court has remanded them in police custody until May 30.Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar told TOI, ""We have arrested Taware and Halnor for changing the blood samples and manipulating the blood sample reports. We studied the entire procedure at the hospital and realised the manipulation. Our team then decided to arrest the two doctors"".“The minor’s first blood sample was collected at around 11 am on May 19 at Sassoon hospital (eight-and-a-half hours after the accident) and the second was collected at the Aundh-based hospital around 7pm, to rule out the possibility of any manipulation like replacement of blood samples. Both these samples were sent for DNA fingerprinting to FSL. The blood sample which was taken at Sassoon Hospital was thrown in a dustbin of the hospital and the blood sample of another person was taken and sent to the forensic lab. During the investigation, we found Srihari Halnor replaced this on the instructions of the HOD Forensic Medicine Department of Sassoon, Ajay Tawre. The DNA fingerprinting of the minor’s father was done at FSL after his arrest last Tuesday in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar,” he said.The senior police official further said that as an abundant precaution, they had taken one more sample of the juvenile for DNA sampling and it was sent to another hospital.""The report of the other hospital revealed the juvenile's blood report at the Sassoon Hospital was manipulated as the DNA of (blood samples of) both the reports did not match,"" he said.Both the doctors did not have any idea that the police would take one more sample (of the accused juvenile), he said.""A probe is underway on whose blood samples were collected to replace with that of the juvenile's. We have recovered CCTV footages of the Sassoon Hospital and further probe is on,"" Kumar said.He also said that Indian Penal sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and other relevant sections have been added to the case in which the juvenile has been booked.""We have made the juvenile's father co-accused in the present case,"" he said.""The juvenile's father had called the doctor and offered him allurements to replace the blood samples,"" Commissioner Amitesh Kumar added.According to Pune CP, the builder hired a middleman to get in touch with the mortuary staffer and the latter then facilitated the builder’s contact with forensic sciences department head Dr Ajay Taware around 10am on May 19.The accident, which occurred in the early morning of May 19, resulted in the deaths of two IT professionals when their motorcycle was struck by a speeding Porsche Taycan car at Kalyaninagar at 2.30 am, allegedly driven by the minor.The police have also obtained CCTV footage from one of the pubs visited by the boy, where he reportedly paid a bill amounting to Rs 48,000.The minor accused, who was taken to Sasoon Hospital for a medical examination, had his blood sample allegedly switched with another sample during the course of the investigation.According to the police, the teenager was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. It was later discovered that the minor's blood report was swapped with that of another individual who had not consumed alcohol.As the police awaited the blood sample reports, the manipulation came to light. To prevent any further tampering, the police had collected two samples from the boy. According to the Pune police commissioner, second blood sample indicated alcohol consumption by the teen accused.Initially, the Juvenile Justice Board granted bail to the teenager and instructed him to write an essay about road accidents. However, due to public outrage over the lenient treatment and a review application submitted by the police, the teenager was remanded to an observation home until June 5.Earlier, the Crime Branch unit arrested the grandfather of the minor accused on May 25 in connection with the accident. Pune city commissioner said that a separate FIR was filed against the grandfather under IPC sections 365 and 368.The driver, Gangadhar, filed a complaint with the police claiming that he was forcibly taken to the accused grandfather's residence on the night of May 19 while leaving the Yerawada Police Station.The accused grandfather and his father allegedly threatened Gangadhar, snatched his phone and forcibly kept him confined in their bungalow in an attempt to force him to take responsibility for the crime instead of his minor grandson.The Maharashtra government has set up a three-member committee in response to the arrest of two doctors and an employee from Sassoon General Hospital in Pune. The order appointing the committee was issued by Medical Education Commissioner Rajiv Nivatkar on Monday, with Dr Pallavi Sapale, dean of Grant Medical College and J J group of hospitals, serving as the chairperson.The committee also includes Dr Gajanan Chavan, a professor in the forensic medicine department at Grant Medical College, and Dr Sudhir Chowdhary, the Special Duty Officer at Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar Government Medical College and Super Speciality Hospital. The committee has been instructed to visit Pune on Tuesday to conduct their investigation.Pune commissioner has also instructed Dr Vinayak Kale, Dean of Sassoon General Hospital, to fully cooperate with the committee during the probe, as stated in the order.","Dr Ajay Taware, the head of the Forensic Medicine department at the state-run hospital, Dr Shrihari Halnor, the chief medical officer, and Atul Ghatkamble, a mortuary staffer working under Dr Taware have been arrested.

"India, France to begin contract negotiations for 26 Rafale-Marine jets this week",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-france-to-begin-contract-negotiations-for-26-rafale-marine-jets-this-week/articleshow/110507112.cms,"NEW DELHI: India will kick off official contract negotiations with France this week for the mega acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters for over Rs 50,000 crore, with the Navy keen on inducting the supersonic jets for its two aircraft carriers as soon as possible due to the expanding Chinese threat in the Indian Ocean Region.A team of officials from the French government, fighter-manufacturer Dassault and weapon systems integrator Thales, among others, is arriving here on May 30 for the talks with the contract negotiation committee (CNC) constituted by the Indian defence ministry.This comes after the MoD and Navy evaluated the bid or letter of acceptance (LoA) submitted by France in December in response to India’s letter of request (LoR) for the acquisition of 22 single-seat jets and four twin-seat trainers, along with weapons, simulator, spares, crew training and logistics support.“It took time to examine the voluminous LoA with its offer, technical specifications, costs and other details. The CNC is headed by an official from the MoD acquisitions wing and includes representatives from the Navy,” an official said.The aim is to conclude the techno-commercial negotiations and ink the government-to-government deal, after the requisite approval by the PM-led cabinet committee on security, within this financial year.The proposed deals for the 26 Rafale-Ms and three additional Scorpene submarines to be built at Mazagon Docks for around Rs 30,000 crore were granted acceptance of necessity by the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council on July 13 last year, a day before the subsequent Modi-Macron summit in Paris.The Navy only has 40 of the 45 MiG-29K jets, inducted from Russia at a cost of $2 billion from 2009 onwards, to operate from the decks of its two over 40,000-tonne aircraft carriers, the older Russian-origin INS Vikramaditya and the new indigenous INS Vikrant. The MiG-29Ks have also been dogged by poor serviceability and other problems over the years.With the indigenous twin-engine deck-based fighter (TEDBF) likely to take at least a decade to become operational, the Navy had pushed for the 26 Rafale-M jets as an interim measure. The IAF has already inducted 36 Rafales under the Rs 59,000 crore deal inked with France in September 2016.China is now conducting trials of its third aircraft carrier, the over 80,000-tonne Fujian, after earlier inducting the 60,000-tonne Liaoning and the 66,000-tonne Shandong, and building more such warships.The Indian government, in contrast, is yet to even give the preliminary nod for the long-pending case for a third 45,000-tonne aircraft carrier, let alone a more potent 65,000-tonne one, which will take at least a decade to build.The US has 11 `super’ 90,000-100,000-tonne nuclear-powered carriers, each of which can carry 70-80 fighters and aircraft. Significantly, the Fujian -- like the newest American carrier USS Gerald R Ford -- has an electromagnetic catapult system to also launch much heavier aircraft for surveillance, early-warning and electronic warfare.While the 10 US Nimitz-class carriers have steam-powered catapults, INS Vikramaditya and INS Vikrant as well as Liaoning and Shandong have only angled ski-jumps that allow fighters to take off under their own power.","India will kick off official contract negotiations with France this week for the mega acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters for over Rs 50,000 crore.

I was not able to raise money for my dinner, how will I raise money for the Chinese? I was removed from the list and rushed back to India"", he said.This comes days after Aiyar sparked controversy saying that Pakistan is a respected nation and suggested that India should engage in dialogue with them.""They are also a sovereign country (Pakistan). They are a respected nation. You can talk tough with them (Pakistan). But start the dialogue,"" he said.""You are walking with a gun which yielded you nothing. Tensions are escalating.

Peace begins with all of us in our beautiful diversity!""Born in Himachal Pradesh in 1993, Major Sen joined the Indian Army eight years ago. Before her military career, she graduated as a biotech engineer and was studying for her Master's degree at IIT Bombay.She was deployed to MONUSCO in March 2023 as the Engagement Platoon Commander with the Indian Rapid Deployment Battalion. She completed her tenure in April 2024.Major Sen becomes the second Indian peacekeeper to receive this prestigious award. Major Suman Gawani was the first, honoured in 2019 for her service with the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS).Congratulating Major Sen, Guterres said she exemplifies true leadership and serves as an inspiration. ""Her service was a true credit to the United Nations as a whole,"" he noted.He further explained that during an escalating conflict in North Kivu, Major Sen’s troops actively engaged with conflict-affected communities, including women and girls. She earned their trust through humility, compassion, and dedication.Major Sen led mixed-gender engagement patrols and activities in volatile regions. Her efforts were aimed at assisting people, including women and children, who were fleeing the conflict, as mentioned in the statement.Created in 2016, the United Nations 'Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award' acknowledges the dedication of an individual military peacekeeper.

Busy diplomatic schedule awaits new government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/busy-diplomatic-schedule-awaits-new-government/articleshow/110510500.cms,"NEW DELHI: After a lull because of the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, a hectic diplomatic schedule awaits the new government that will be sworn in some time late next week, subsequent to the June 4 poll results. The prime minister will literally hit the ground running, as the leader will travel to Italy for the G7 summit during June 13-15.The ministry of external affairs is preparing for the G7 summit, where the world's most advanced nations will discuss issues related to the global economic situation, international trade, climate and the effects of Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts.Even before that, the external affairs minister will be expected at the BRICS foreign ministers' meeting in Russia on June 11. Russia will host the BRICS summit in October.The Indian PM is expected to host Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina in the last week of June, before participating in the SCO summit in Kazakhstan in July. This is also where the Indian PM will likely come face to face with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time after elections.However, one major event that any Indian PM or EAM will give a miss is the Ukraine peace summit , which Switzerland will host immediately after the G7. Russia's reservations about the summit coupled with Ukraine's insistence on blocking any invite to Moscow will preclude high-level participation by any Indian government. A secretary-level official will most likely represent India. Significantly, US President Joe Biden is yet to confirm his participation in the summit.Diplomacy, in fact, could take centerstage as early as the oath-taking of the PM next month. Like in 2014 and 2019, MEA is working on a guest list for the event, in line with India's strategic and economic interests. If the Modi government indeed returns, as many seem to be suggesting, the list is likely to be expanded to include countries from Africa, as also the Gulf region. The UAE, Saudi Arabia and Oman are among the countries India could consider inviting. The inclusion of African Union in the G20 last year was among the top two achievements of India's presidency of the bloc, along with the Ukraine consensus that facilitated a joint declaration.The list may also include a few countries from India's neighbourhood too. The Modi government invited SAARC and BIMSTEC leaders in 2014 and 2019 respectively.","Diplomacy, in fact, could take centerstage as early as the oath-taking of the PM next month.

The remaining 81 have been ""temporarily closed"" until further safety assurances can be implemented.Rajkot saw the highest number of closures, with eight out of 12 zones sealed.

Authorities are also investigating the presence of any unregistered and potentially illegal entertainment zones operating without licences.Civic authorities across the state are issuing notices to gaming zone operators to implement the required safety measures .In Vadodara, where 16 gaming zones, including 11 indoor ones, have been shut down, civic chief Dilip Kumar Rana said: ""Notices will be issued to these establishments asking them to ensure safety measures. After they comply with the notices, they can be reopened.""The decision to shut down these facilities reflects either an abundance of caution by the govt or a lack of confidence in the current safety standards of gaming zones.Ahmedabad deputy municipal commissioner (urban development) IK Patel said the closures are precautionary.

We are ensuring all major and minor concerns of experts are addressed for maximum safety of citizens,"" Patel explained.The govt is currently working on a new policy for entertainment facilities, which will encompass comprehensive safety guidelines. This new policy is expected to be announced soon, and gaming zones will be allowed to reopen once they comply with the updated regulations.""The home department will notify rules for entertainment zones that include gaming zones, amusement parks,"" an official source said.

Mobius, a renowned investor, shared his insights on the potential returns from the Indian stock market over the next three to five years in an interview with ET Now.When asked about his expectations, Mobius stated, ""Over the longer term, I believe you are talking about 14-15% returns for India."" He explained that as a general rule of thumb, one can double the GDP growth rate of the market to estimate stock market returns. With India's real GDP growth at 7-8%, Mobius projects the stock market to deliver returns of 14-15-16% in the future.Regarding the recent record highs achieved by Indian markets, such as the Sensex surpassing 75,000 points, Mobius was questioned about his earlier prediction of the Sensex hitting the one lakh mark.Also Read | Repeat of 2004 shock defeat for NDA appears unlikely, says Jefferies' Chris Wood; cautions on capital gains tax changes When asked if he expects this milestone to be reached within the next 12 to 18 months, Mobius said, ""I would not say the next 18 months, but as I mentioned when I first made that prediction, within the next few years.""Mobius also noted that the global markets , including the US, have been performing well, and the Indian market has been keeping pace. In some months, India outperforms the US, while in others, the US takes the lead, he said.Mobius is of the view that there is still significant potential for growth in the global market, and the increasing interest in equities worldwide, especially in the US, is benefiting India as well. As investors in the US make substantial profits, they seek to diversify their portfolios globally, and India has become one of the most attractive destinations for investment, he added.Also Read | 'On June 4, markets will...': PM Modi's big prediction for Sensex on Lok Sabha election results day Despite the strong performance of the Indian market, there has been a notable outflow of foreign institutional investors (FIIs), with a year-to-date selloff figure of $3.3 billion.Mobius says that this can be attributed, in part, to hedge fund activity. However, it is essential not to focus too heavily on these short-term movements, he said.“At the end of the day, you are going to be getting a lot of long-term money, not only in the equity market, not only in the fixed income market, but in direct investment in manufacturing and distribution and other areas. India is a huge market and there are lots of opportunities for global investors.They are going to take advantage of that opportunity,” he said.","Mark Mobius, Chairman, Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund believes that Indian markets will deliver 14-15% returns over the longer term.

As part of the agreement, CPC, part of the US-based Columbia Pacific Group, will invest about Rs 65 crore to pick up a 25% stake in the merged entity.The company post merger is valued around Rs 250 crore.The merger combines CPC's experience in senior living with KITES's medical expertise, creating India's first and largest Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC), Dr Ranjan Pai, chairman Manipal Education and Medical Group (MEMG) told TOI.The financial infusion will fuel KITES’s expansion into six cities across southern India, aiming to develop over 1,000 beds in more than 15 facilities, initially, Rajagopal G Co-Founder and CEO, KITES Senior Care said.CPC, part of the US-based Columbia Pacific Group, has a runway to add 1200 residential units to the existing 1750 residential units, thereby resulting in 3000+ units under management in two years.The development aligns with the growth trajectory of the Indian senior care market, targeting a combined market size of $30bn covering senior living and ‘out of hospital’ senior care.""The coming together of these two platforms in the senior care continuum underlines our commitment to enhancing the quality of life for the elderly.

These areas will get water once a day till the supply situation improves.The city, which once set the target of supplying 24x7 water to residents, now faces a severe water crisis.""I know that where water is being supplied twice a day, people will be troubled if it is cut off for once a day, but I appeal to all Delhiites that we should not think only about ourselves. We should think about everyone,"" minister Atishi said.Parts of North and South West Delhi such as the areas of Mehrauli and Chattarpur are also facing water problems this summer.According to govt, since the beginning of May, Haryana has stopped releasingYamuna water to Delhi, which has caused the levelof water to continuously fall at the Wazirabad water treatment plant.""On May 1, the Yamuna's water level was 674.5 feet at Wazirabad.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

The weather is clearer and less windy but that is no guarantee of safety: At least five people have died and three others have gone missing since the beginning of this climbing season, officials said.The popularity of the climb has prompted concerns in recent years that overcrowding, competition and inadequate vetting of rookie climbers are making it even more dangerous.","A video of climbers waiting in long queues for their turn to ascend and descend the world's tallest peak,are going viral on social media.

The individuals and the Thai-based companies were sanctioned for activities related to 911 S5 botnet , a service that compromised computers and resulted in cybercrimes being traced back to victims' computers instead of the perpetrators' devices, the Treasury said.

""These individuals leveraged their malicious botnet technology to compromise personal devices, enabling cybercriminals to fraudulently secure economic assistance intended for those in need and to terrorize our citizens with bomb threats,"" said the Treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Brian Nelson.

Donald Trump's lawyer calls star witness a liar in trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-lawyer-calls-star-witness-a-liar-in-trial/articleshow/110506077.cms,"NEW YORK: Donald Trump 's defence team attacked the hush money case against him Tuesday by calling the star witness a liar, seeking to discredit weeks of testimony that prosecutors say prove the former president interfered in the 2016 election through a scheme to suppress stories seen as harmful to his campaign. The closing arguments , which were expected to last the entire day, gave attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury and to score final points with the panel before it starts deliberating the fate of the first former American president charged with felony crimes.""President Trump is innocent. He did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,"" said defence attorney Todd Blanche, who said the evidence in the case should ""leave you wanting.""In an hourslong address to the jury, Blanche attacked the foundation of the case, which charges Trump with conspiring to conceal hush money payments prosecutors say were made on his behalf during the 2016 presidential campaign to stifle a porn actor's claim that she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.With sweeping denials mirroring his client's ""deny everything"" approach, Blanche countered the prosecution's portrayal of Trump as a detail-oriented manager who paid dutiful attention to the checks he signed; disputed the contention that Trump and the porn actor, Stormy Daniels, had sex; and rejected the idea that the alleged hush money scheme amounted to illegal interference in the election.""Every campaign in this country is a conspiracy to promote a candidate, a group of people who are working together to help somebody win,"" Blanche said.After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with the payments.Because prosecutors have the burden of proof, they will deliver their arguments last.Prosecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys aimed to create doubts about the strength of the evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen.Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and served as the star prosecution witness in the trial.""He's literally like an MVP of liars. He lies constantly,"" Blanche said of Cohen. ""He lied to Congress. He lied to prosecutors. He lied to his family and business associates.""After closing arguments, the judge will instruct the jury on the law governing the case and the factors the panel can take into account during deliberations.Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked.The case centres on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up.When Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels.Trump's lawyers contended throughout the trial that they were legitimate payments for actual legal services. Blanche, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to jurors, pointed to emails and testimony showing that Cohen did indeed work on some legal matters for Trump that year.While Cohen characterised that work as ""very minimal,"" Blanche argued otherwise.The attorney's voice became even more impassioned as he revisited one of the more memorable moments of the trial: when Blanche sought to unravel Cohen's claim that he had spoken to Trump by phone about the Daniels arrangement on October 24, 2016.Cohen said he had contacted Trump's bodyguard as a way of getting a hold of Trump, but Blanche asserted that at the time Cohen was actually dealing with a spate of harassing phone calls and was preoccupied by that problem.""It was a lie,"" Blanche said. ""That was a lie, and he got caught red-handed.""Blanche also sought to distance Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements, saying checks to Cohen were signed as Trump was preoccupied with the presidency in 2017.He pointed to the testimony of a former Trump Organisation controller, who told jurors that he never talked to Trump about how to characterise the payments sent to an accounts payable staffer. Blanche also noted that another Trump aide said Trump would sign checks while meeting with people or while on the phone, not knowing what they were.The nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions. ""Just pay it,"" the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying.Prosecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing paying $150,000 to former Playboy model Karen McDougal to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal too.Defence lawyers called two witnesses neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details.On cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump's company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump.The New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases pending against Trump as he seeks to reclaim the White House from democrat Joe Biden. It's unclear if any of the others will reach trial before November's election.","Closing arguments are expected to last the entire day. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. The case centres on a $130,000 payment made to Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110506219,imgsize-42000,width-400,resizemode-4/110506219.jpg"
"Vivek Ramaswamy urges BuzzFeed to cut jobs, air more conservative voices",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vivek-ramaswamy-urges-buzzfeed-to-cut-jobs-air-more-conservative-voices/articleshow/110503475.cms,"Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is calling for “large-scale” job cuts, three board seats and more conservative voices at BuzzFeed Inc, according to a letter to the company’s board that was reviewed by Bloomberg News.The biotech entrepreneur said in the letter that the New York-based media company needs to refocus its business around online videos such as its Hot Ones celebrity interview show on YouTube.Pointing to examples of inaccurate or unverified reports, Ramaswamy called on BuzzFeed to apologize and tell readers it had “repeatedly lied on issues of national importance,” and said the organization has helped foster a feeling of public distrust in the media by publishing a dossier in 2017 by the former British spy Christopher Steele and reporting that Hunter Biden’s emails were stolen, among other incidents.“You have a historic opportunity to redefine BuzzFeed and set yourself apart from every other major media organization,” he said, adding he wants to see other voices featured, including personalities such as Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson and Aaron Rodgers.In a seven-page letter, Ramaswamy didn’t name the three directors he’s proposing, but said he wanted them to meet with the board in the next few weeks, and asked the company to act on the nominations by July 15.BuzzFeed shares soared last week, after Ramaswamy disclosed a roughly 8% stake in the company, worth upwards of $8 million at market open on Tuesday, and a desire to engage with the board. Shares were up 6.8% to $2.99 at 9:41 a.m. in New York. In the letter, he said he continues to increase his position.It’s uncertain how much success Ramaswamy will have as an activist, given that BuzzFeed’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Jonah Peretti, owns a majority of the Class B supervoting shares.Ramaswamy is now among the largest owners of class A shares. Comcast Corp sold roughly $10 million worth last week, cashing in on the activist-spurred rally.“Based on your letter, you have some fundamental misunderstandings about the drivers of our business, the values of our audience, and the mission of the company,” Peretti wrote in a response to Ramaswamy on Monday. “I’m very skeptical it makes business sense to turn BuzzFeed into a creator platform for inflammatory political pundits. And we’re definitely not going to issue an apology for our Pulitzer Prize-winning journalism. That said, I welcome outside perspectives from shareholders and am open to hearing more from you.”Ramaswamy dropped from the presidential race in January and endorsed Donald Trump . The former president has expressed interest in giving Ramaswamy a cabinet position should he win again.Ramaswamy made his fortune as a hedge fund manager turned pharmaceutical executive. In 2015, he led now-deceased Axovant Sciences through a $360 million public offering, one of the largest pre-revenue biotech IPOs on record. He later founded and took public pharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences Ltd. via SPAC in 2021.In 2022, Ramaswamy co-founded Strive Asset Management, an “anti-woke” fund to compete with ESG investments from companies like BlackRock Inc. Last year, he stepped away from Strive to focus on his campaign and said he isn’t returning.BuzzFeed, famous for its personalized quizzes and lists of “bests,” has struggled since going public in 2021. Last year, the company closed its news division as part of wider layoffs. Earlier this year, it sold media company Complex for $108.6 million and cut 16% of staff to reduce costs.","Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is calling for 'large- scale' job cuts, three board seats and more conservative voices at BuzzFeed Inc.

Pakistan Revives China Belt and Road Initiative Projects to Boost Economy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-revive-china-belt-and-road-initiative-projects/articleshow/110470413.cms,"Pakistan ’s new government is hoping to inject some fresh momentum into projects that fall under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, as it tries to boost the country’s troubled economy.The South Asian nation is looking at joint ventures for renewable energy projects , agriculture collaboration and possibly enticing some Chinese companies to relocate to Pakistan, said Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan’s federal minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, who also co-heads the committee responsible for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , in an interview.“Yeah, I’m very hopeful because I was there in China recently and I had meetings with their senior leadership,” said Iqbal at his office in Islamabad, decorated with a large map showcasing the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. “So I see great interest on the Chinese side to revive the momentum for CPEC and also to take it into the second phase.”Pakistan was seen as a flagship destination for BRI projects , with CPEC — which includes a port in the southern town of Gwadar and new power plants — the crown jewel. The progress on new projects stalled in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and amid Pakistan’s on-going economic difficulties that have required the International Monetary Fund’s intervention.Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was elected to a second successive term in February, has been looking to revive economic cooperation with China for the past two years. Sharif’s older brother, Nawaz, led the country when Pakistan signed on to the BRI in 2013.Projects worth about $25 billion came online in the first phase, including power plants that ended the nation’s chronic power deficit.A Pakistani committee approved a long-delayed railway upgrade project last week — but scaled it down from $10 billion to $6.8 billion.The project will be done in two phases “so there is not a big burden on Pakistan,” said Iqbal. The railway, in its first phase will run from Karachi, the southern coast city, to Multan, a little over halfway to the capital, Islamabad.The Sharif government has also finished some key BRI projects that were pending for years: a water-supply project in Gwadar, dredging work at the port and an electricity transmission line from Iran.“So all these things really help China see that the new government is again serious and it restored their confidence that now Pakistan is, you know, serious about CPEC initiatives ,” said Iqbal.China has also been a key financial lender, alongside the IMF, with its loans helping Pakistan avoid bankruptcy. The country is struggling with low growth and the fastest rising consumer prices in Asia. Islamabad’s difficulties have seen it fall behind on payments related to Chinese-funded power plants.To mark the tenth anniversary of CPEC last year, China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng unveiled five new corridors including one focused on growth to boost economic activity in Pakistan. The others are related to livelihood, innovation, green energy and regional connectivity. Sharif is likely to visit China soon, said Iqbal.One change in the second phase would likely involve Islamabad taking a step back while urging the private sector to forge partnerships with Chinese firms.The other big focus, albeit a long-shot prospect, is to try and attract Chinese firms thinking of relocating from China amid rising labor costs and heightening geopolitical tensions.“That would be a success because at the moment more than 80 million jobs are being relocated from China to other countries because of the high level cost in China,” said Iqbal. “They have gone to Vietnam and you know, Laos and Cambodia. There is now overcrowding there. So they are certainly looking for new places.”","Pakistan is looking at joint ventures for renewable energy projects, agriculture collaboration and possibly enticing some Chinese companies to relocate to Pakistan.

Mangrove Forest: Key tiger habitat swamped by deadly Bangladesh cyclone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/key-tiger-habitat-swamped-by-deadly-bangladesh-cyclone/articleshow/110503550.cms,"'Tigers can climb trees'

DHAKA: Bangladesh forest experts warned Tuesday a key tiger habitat hit by a deadly cyclone had been submerged by seawater deeper and longer than ever before, raising fears for endangered wildlife.Cyclone Remal, which made landfall in low-lying Bangladesh and neighbouring India on Sunday evening, killed at least 38 people in both nations and affected millions more.More than a million people fled inland to concrete storm shelters before the cyclone hit.But it was the vast Sundarbans mangrove forest straddling Bangladesh and India, where the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers meet the sea that took the brunt of the force.The forest, which hosts one of the world's largest populations of Bengal tigers, was swamped, said Mihir Kumar Doe, the head of Bangladesh's southern forest department.""The entire Sundarbans was under water for more than 36 hours during the cyclone,"" Doe told AFP.""All its freshwater ponds, numbering more than 100, were washed away by saline tidal water.""At least 114 Bengal tigers live in Bangladesh's portion of the Sundarbans, according to official figures.Abu Naser Mohsin Hossain, Bangladesh's senior forest official for the Sundarbans, had said he feared for the wildlife if the freshwater lakes were tainted.""We are worried,"" said Hossain. ""These ponds were the source of fresh water for the entire wildlife in the mangroves including the endangered Bengal tigers.""The Sundarbans, the world's biggest mangrove forest, is regularly battered by intense monsoon storms.But Azizur Rahman, director of the state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department, said the cyclone was ""one of longest in the country's history"", blaming climate change for the shift.Doe said his teams had recovered dozens of dead spotted deer, as well as boars, the tigers' main prey.""We are very concerned over the wild animals including tigers,"" Doe said.""The Sundarbans is such a dynamic ecosystem, it is tough to know whether any tigers or wild animals were washed away or died.""Mangroves grow mainly in seawater or brackish water but Doe said the flooding was on a scale he had not witnessed before.""This 36-hour inundation is very unusual,"" he said, noting that it was three times longer than during Cyclone Sidr in 2007.During the latest cyclone, areas nearer the sea were three metres (10 feet) underwater, while areas further upstream were under 1.2-1.5 metres (4-5 feet) of water.""Even during low tide, the water did not recede,"" Doe said. ""This is very unusual.""Tiger expert Monirul Khan, zoology professor at Jahangirnagar University, said he feared smaller animals such as deer would be hardest hit.""I fear for the animals who are less strong such as spotted deer,"" he said.""Spotted deer are helpless to strong tides during cyclones or longer inundation of the forest.

NEW DELHI: Cyclone Remal, the first storm of the year, has begun the landfall process over the coastal regions of West Bengal and Bangladesh. The process is expected to persist for the upcoming four hours. Currently positioned over the North Bay of Bengal, cyclone Remal is projected to traverse northwards, situated approximately 130 km southeast of Sagar Islands in West Bengal, 140 km southwest of Khepupara in Bangladesh , 140 km southeast of Canning in West Bengal, and 160 km southwest of Mongla in Bangladesh.According to the IMD, the cyclone is anticipated to make landfall along the coasts of Bangladesh and adjoining West Bengal by midnight today. During this time, cyclone Remal is expected to bring maximum wind speeds ranging from 110 to 120 kilometres per hour, posing potential risks to the affected areas.India has taken precautionary measures, deploying its disaster relief force in West Bengal. Flights have been suspended at Kolkata, a major metropolitan city in the state. Some parts of West Bengal are already experiencing moderate rainfall.The Indian Navy said that it has ""kept ships, aircraft, divers and medical supplies on standby for deployment if required."" The low-lying coastal regions of Bangladesh and India have been hit by severe storms in recent years, with Cyclone Yaas in 2021 leaving more than 50,000 people homeless and causing at least one fatality.In Bangladesh, the weather office has raised its storm danger signal to the highest level for two ports and nine coastal districts. Warnings are being announced over loudspeakers, and evacuations have begun in coastal areas. State minister for disaster management and relief, Mohibbur Rahman, informed Reuters that ""Bangladesh has set up nearly 8,000 cyclone shelters and mobilised 78,000 volunteers.""Severe cyclonic storm 'Remal' has intensified and the landfall process has begun. It was expected to make landfall between the coasts of Bangladesh and West Bengal by midnight on Sunday, with maximum sustained wind speeds of 110-120 km/h, gusting up to 135 km/h, according to the meteorological department. The cyclone is anticipated to bring extremely heavy rainfall to the coastal districts of West Bengal and heavy to very heavy rain to Kolkata and its surrounding areas.The cyclone is projected to move nearly northwards, intensify further, and cross the coasts between Sagar Island and Khepupara, near southwest Mongla in Bangladesh, by midnight on Sunday. It will do so as a severe cyclonic storm with maximum sustained wind speeds of 110-120 km/h, gusting up to 135 km/h, the weather office reported.In order to prevent destruction, authorities in India and Bangladesh are bracing for the year's first cyclone.Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting on Sunday to assess the readiness and response measures for the impending cyclonic storm Remal. The meeting aimed to ensure that all necessary steps were being taken to minimize the impact of the cyclone and protect the lives and property of those in the affected areas.Expressing concern over Remal, the Bengal governor CV Ananda Bose said that he is vigilantly observing the unfolding situation and maintaining regular communication with experts at both the state and central levels to ensure a well-coordinated response in countering the cyclone's impact. Bose stressed the paramount importance of ensuring the safety of residents residing in the coastal areas of Bengal, strongly advising them to comply with the established standard operating procedures (SOPs) specifically designed for cyclonic events.""Governor Bose is keeping a watch on the situation and is in touch with experts and authorities in the state and the Centre for a coordinated effort to endure the cyclone,"" the West Bengal Raj Bhavan posted on X.The Indian Navy has taken proactive measures to ensure the safety and well-being of the population affected by cyclone Remal.

Moreover, four more FRTs, two each from Visakhapatnam and Chilka, are on standby, ready to be deployed at a moment's notice.The approaching severe cyclone Remal has caused major disruptions to transportation in Kolkata and other regions of South Bengal on Sunday, with the impact likely to persist into Monday. As a safety measure, Kolkata airport has halted flight operations for 21 hours starting Sunday noon.Moreover, the Eastern and South Eastern railways have cancelled numerous trains. From Sunday morning, South Bengal districts experienced sporadic rainfall and strong winds, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of buses, taxis, and three-wheelers operating on the streets of Kolkata and district towns.On Monday, disturbances in road and rail transportation are expected due to the cyclone's landfall, which is predicted to occur by midnight on Sunday.Eastern railway has established helpline numbers at Howrah and Sealdah stations in anticipation of Remal developing into a severe cyclonic storm on Sunday.The railway has taken various precautionary measures to ensure safety and minimize the impact of the cyclone. These include the activation of a disaster management team, round-the-clock monitoring of control rooms by senior officers, regular monitoring of wind speed at multiple locations, continuous monitoring of cyclone-related information, and maintaining close communication with the Meteorological department.The helpline numbers issued at Sealdah are 033-23508794 (DOT) & 033- 23833326 (Auto Phone), while the helpline number issued at Howrah is 033-26413660 (DOT).The meteorological department has cautioned four districts in Odisha about the possibility of heavy rainfall due to the approaching cyclone Remal.

PATUAKHALI: Tens of thousands of Bangladeshis left their coastal villages Sunday for concrete storm shelters further inland as the low-lying nation prepared for the expected landfall of an intense cyclone , officials said.Cyclone Remal is set to hit the southern coast and parts of neighbouring India on Sunday evening, with Bangladesh 's weather department predicting crashing waves and howling gales with gusts of up to 130 kilometres (81 miles) per hour.Cyclones have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades, but the number of superstorms hitting its low-lying, densely populated coast have increased sharply from one a year to as many as three due to the impact of climate change .""The cyclone could unleash a storm surge of up to 12 feet (four metres) above normal astronomical tide, which can be dangerous,"" senior weather official Muhammad Abul Kalam Mallik told AFP.Most of Bangladesh's coastal areas are a metre or two above sea level and high storm surges can devastate villages.Authorities have raised the danger signal to its highest level, warning fishermen against going to the sea and triggering an evacuation order for those in at-risk areas.As people fled, police said that a heavily laden ferry carrying more than 50 passengers double its capacity was swamped by rough waters and sank near Mongla, a port in the expected path of the storm.""At least 13 people were injured and were taken to a hospital,"" local police chief Mushfiqur Rahman Tushar told AFP, adding that other boats plucked the passengers to safety.""Our plan is to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from unsafe and vulnerable homes to the cyclone shelters ,"" the government's disaster management secretary Kamrul Hasan told AFP.The authorities have mobilised tens of thousands of volunteers to alert people to the danger.He said some 4,000 cyclone shelters have been readied along the country's lengthy coast on the Bay of Bengal, with the cyclone expected to hit a 220-kilometre stretch from India's Sagar Island to Khepupara in Bangladesh.The state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department said Cyclone Remal would make landfall Sunday between 6:00 pm and midnight (1200-1800 GMT).In addition to the villagers and fishermen, many of the multi-storey centres have space to shelter their cattle, buffaloes and goats, as well as their pets.""Some 78,000 volunteers have been mobilised to alert coastal people and evacuate the vulnerable people,"" Hasan said.Helal Mahmud Sharif, the chief government administrator of Khulna province, told AFP some 20,000 people had been evacuated to shelters in the most vulnerable coastal regions.Another 15,000 people and about 400 domesticated animals have been evacuated in the coastal Patuakhali and Bhola districts.On the low-lying Bhashan Char island, which is home to 36,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, 57 cyclone centres have been readied, deputy refugee commissioner Mohammad Rafiqul Haque told AFP.The country's three seaports and the airport in the second-largest city Chittagong were closed, officials said.India's Kolkata airport closed from noon Sunday until Monday morning ""predicted heavy winds and heavy to very heavy rainfall"", airport authorities said, while beaches near the area have been ordered shut.While scientists say climate change is fuelling more storms, better forecasting and more effective evacuation planning have dramatically reduced the death toll.In the Great Bhola Cyclone in November 1970 an estimated half a million people died -- mostly drowned by the storm surge.In May last year, Cyclone Mocha became the most powerful storm to hit Bangladesh since Cyclone Sidr in November 2007.Sidr killed more than 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars in damage.Last October, at least two people were killed and nearly 300,000 fled their homes for storm shelters when Cyclone Hamoon hit the country's southeastern coast.","Cyclone Remal is set to hit the southern coast and parts of neighbouring India on Sunday evening. Authorities have raised the danger signal to its highest level, warning fishermen against going to the sea. A heavily laden ferry carrying more than 50 passengers sank near Mongla, a port in the expected path of the storm.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110437868,imgsize-1149945,width-400,resizemode-4/110437868.jpg"

He is a key suspect and wanted. We have sought help from Indian, Nepal and US law enforcement agencies to put him on trial.""""We are working on a system to bring Shahin back...We are in touch with all the agencies concerned including the Interpol to ensure justice to our parliamentarian's family. We have already arrested three persons including a woman. Two of them have criminal backgrounds and we are checking the antecedents of the woman,"" he added.Meanwhile, Akhtaruzzaman's brother Md Shahiduzzaman, mayor of Kotchandpur municipality in Bangladesh's Jhenaidah, also demanded stern action against his brother if found guilty.Speaking to PTI, Shahiduzzaman said, ""We grew up together and it is hard to believe that he is involved in such a heinous crime. If he is at all indulged in the crime, he should be punished.""""I spoke to him two weeks ago over phone and he sounded happy...I believe he is in the US now,"" he added.However, Shahiduzzaman claimed that he had no knowledge of his brother's business dealings or his relationship with the murdered MP.""All I know is that my brother is very rich...But I have no clue about his business,"" he said.Additionally, the West Bengal Police said that it is planning extradite Shahin to India""Bangladesh does not have any extradition treaty with the US government but India has. We are planning to extradite Shahin to India because the crime occurred in our state,"" senior police officer in West Bengal said.Shahin was a close friend and reportedly a business partner of Anar. He is believed to be in New York City, where he holds US citizenship.Azim was last seen on the afternoon of May 13 when he went with friends to a home in Bidhannagar near Kolkata for a medical check-up. According to a family friend in Kolkata's Bidhannagar, the MP mentioned he would be travelling to Delhi, but there was no direct contact with him since May 13. Only mobile messages were exchanged with his family in Dhaka and his friend in Bidhannagar, indicating his intended journey to Delhi.Azim, a three-time parliamentarian from Jhenaidah-4, was the president of Awami League's Kaliganj sub-district unit.According to PTI, West Bengal CID sources said Anar was first strangulated after which his body was chopped into pieces by a Bangladeshi butcher (identified as Jihad Hawladar). Later, Jihad along with two others dumped the pieces of the flesh at different areas in South 24-Parganas district. His body parts are yet to be found.So far, four persons - three from Bangladesh and one from Bongaon in West Bengal - have been arrested in this case.","Bangladesh home minister Asaduzzaman Khan said that his government is actively working with India, Nepal and US on the ongoing probe of the murder of parliamentarian Anwarul Azim Anar.

More than 100 business leaders back UK's opposition Labour Party before vote,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/more-than-100-business-leaders-back-uks-opposition-labour-party-before-vote/articleshow/110489244.cms,"LONDON: More than 100 business leaders have given their support to Britain's opposition Labour Party before a July 4 election, saying the country needs to end the instability and stagnation that has dogged the economy .Rishi Sunak's governing Conservatives have typically been the party of big business but Labour's finance policy chief Rachel Reeves has spent years courting business owners in a bid to show her party can be trusted to run the economy.The letter, signed by current and former chief executives in retail, advertising, travel and finance, said Labour had shown it had changed and should be given a chance to shape the country's future.""We, as leaders and investors in British business, believe that it is time for a change,"" the letter said.""We are in urgent need of a new outlook to break free from the stagnation of the last decade and we hope by taking this public stand we might persuade others of that need too.""Labour will hope the endorsement shows that it is no longer the party of Starmer's predecessor, veteran left-wing lawmaker Jeremy Corbyn, who campaigned at the last election in 2019 to renationalise some key assets and hike taxes on the rich.Leaders who signed the letter include the boss of retailer Iceland, the chairman of JD Sports, the head of the UK arm of ad giant WPP, the former CEO of Aston Martin and the founder of a children's company that once included Sunak's wife Akshata Murty as an investor.Starmer's Labour have held an around 20-point lead in polls for almost a year. It has accused the government of 14 years of economic mismanagement, failing to give business the stability it craves and leaving people worse off.Britain's economic performance since the coronavirus pandemic has been the weakest among the Group of Seven economies with the exception of Germany, weighed down by high levels of debt and stuck in a rut of slow growth.Reeves will say later on Tuesday the endorsement shows that Labour can bring business investment back to Britain. ""Our plans for growth are built on partnership with business,"" she will say.Sunak's Conservatives say they have had to steer the economy through the twin shocks of COVID-19 and the energy spike that followed Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A recent drop in inflation, they say, shows that the economy is back on track.After an underwhelming start to the election campaign, Sunak has proposed tax cuts for millions of pensioners - the section of the electorate that is most likely to vote Conservative.The new proposal will cost 2.4 billion pounds ($3.1 billion)a year by 2029/30 and be funded through government efforts to clamp down on tax avoidance and evasion, the party said.","More than 100 business leaders have given their support to Britain's opposition Labour Party.

How Rishi Sunak’s small circle forged vote plan that shocked cabinet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-rishi-sunaks-small-circle-forged-vote-plan-that-shocked-cabinet/articleshow/110424814.cms,"LONDON: Rishi Sunak gave his most senior ministers little more than an hour’s notice of what he was about to tell the country and had already told King Charles III, that he had decided to call a snap UK general election for July 4.Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt was among those caught unaware. Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who’d had to cancel a visit to Albania just to make the meeting in Downing Street, expressed surprise, but said the decision “seizes the initiative, sets the agenda and forces the choice,” according to people familiar with the conversation.Others were less convinced. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps shared reservations, the people said. Detecting the shock later in a meeting of the full Cabinet, Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho — a Sunak loyalist since their Treasury days — intervened to say the premier wasn’t a politician who follows the consensus, whether on Brexit, pandemic lockdowns or net zero. Communities Secretary Michael Gove praised the move, quoting the Special Air Service motto: “Who dares wins.”Rishi Sunak kept his decision to call an early general election from all but a select few until just before his rain-soaked announcement outside Downing Street.Sunak ultimately headed into a downpour in Downing Street to speak the cameras. But the fact he presented it as a fait accompli signed off by the monarch, which the people said he did to ensure ministers couldn’t make him change his mind, underscores the scale of the gamble he knew he was taking. Little more than 48 hours later, Gove had joined the scores of Tory MPs announcing that they were standing down after the election.Spokespeople for Sunak, Cameron, Shapps, Hunt and Coutinho declined to comment.The announcement was weeks in the making, and piecing together how it came about reveals that it’s not only the Cabinet with reservations. The premier’s closest aides argued opposing sides, and, while people familiar with the matter say everyone is now on the same page, some still don’t want to be seen as responsible for pushing the snap election idea.It’s far from the ideal basis for what will be a bruising six-week campaign against Keir Starmer’s poll-leading opposition Labour Party. He’s already faced criticism for a presidential style that leaves little room for other Tory voices. If he doesn’t deliver on his strategy to narrow the poll gap early in the campaign, the recriminations will likely engulf him alone.Sunak’s gamble on a summer election on Wednesday stunned British politics. Prime ministers don’t go to the polls when they’re tailing by 20 points, as the Tories are, unless forced to. Sunak could have waited until as late as January, but was widely likely expected to call an election in the autumn to allow more time for voters to notice the UK’s gradual economic recovery.Outside of Cabinet, Tory MPs are openly critical. Going to the polls now instead of holding out hope for a Starmer slip-up has, they say, cemented a defeat. A stuttering campaign, including the drenched launch on Wednesday and the awkward clip of Sunak in the Titanic Quarter in Belfast on Friday, have reinforced the sense that it’s all been a bit rushed.“This is surprising given he had the advantage of deciding when to call the election,” said Will Jennings, associate dean at Southampton University. “He is deeply unpopular with the public, and polls suggest considerable public appetite for change. Turning things around would require something truly dramatic.”The timing has had a tangible impact. Sunak’s signature plan to deport asylum-seekers to Rwanda, which the Tories regard as critical to holding off the right-wing Reform UK party, will not begin until after the election. The government also ran out of time to get a landmark smoking ban, predicted to be one of Sunak’s main achievements in office, through Parliament.That’s just the first few days of campaigning. Conflicting briefings by advisers about who was responsible for the snap election idea add to the dangerous backdrop for the weeks ahead.The premier’s inner circle of his 10 or so closest confidants had privately been considering an early election as far back as the turn of the year, people familiar with the matter said. Their “Plan A” had been to use tax breaks, falling inflation and interest rate cuts to hold the vote in the autumn, a strategy devised by the Tory campaign chief Isaac Levido.Yet a “Plan B” was kept on the table: a possible snap election if the right moment presented itself. The idea was discussed seriously in February, though some senior aides were strongly opposed.Around the beginning of April, the thinking began to shift toward a summer vote, people close to Sunak said. That set off weeks of agonizing conversations, with most aides recognizing the choice was far from clearcut. Some vacillated as they weighed the merits of waiting for an improvement against the risk of Tory support tanking further.Sunak himself was the driving force for a snap election, people familiar with the matter said. The premier and his chief of staff, Liam Booth-Smith, had become frustrated that nothing the government did, such as tax cuts at two successive fiscal events, was moving the polls.It was also increasingly clear that more tax cuts, which were part of the plan for an autumn election, were not doable. That reinforced their view that the polls were not going to shift until they called the election, people familiar with their thinking said, at which point they would become less of a referendum on the Tories’ record in office, and more a decision about the future.That’s a line that Sunak started using days before his election announcement.Another key factor in Sunak’s thinking was the expectation that inflation would fall back toward the Bank of England’s 2% target in the summer.By around the end of April, Sunak’s decision was coming into view, the people said. He was backed by Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden. Levido and James Forsyth, Sunak’s close friend and adviser, were eventually convinced.Over the next six weeks, Sunak and his aides will find out if they were right. They are planning imminent manifesto announcements to try to demonstrate, per the Tory election slogan, that Sunak is willing to take “bold action.”Yet some Tories are starting the blame game early, unconvinced that Sunak’s team has hit on a winning formula. Meanwhile close to 80 Conservative MPs have said they’re calling it quits at the election — more than before Labour’s 1997 landslide victory — a number that is expected to keep on rising.","Rishi Sunak kept his decision to call an early general election from all but a select few until just before his rain-soaked announcement outside Downing Street.

Notes Slip Out

Treat For

Divers

On July 2, 1918, towards the end of WW-1, a British ship named ' SS Shirala ' sank in the English Channel. Its 'killer' was the dreaded German submarine UB-57, commanded by Oberleutnant Johannes Lohs who destroyed dozens of enemy ships with a combined capacity of over 1.5 lakh tonnes before he died aged 29.The Shirala accounted for just about 4% of Lohs' kills, but it was destined to make headlines long after death, as it's doing now. Sometime this afternoon, two Rs 10 notes and a Re 1 note salvaged from its wreck will go under the hammer at British auction house Noonans Mayfair. The Rs 10 notes could fetch up to £2,600 (Rs 2.7 lakh) each.The Shirala was a small ship, just 425 feet long and 50 wide. It was launched on Aug 31, 1901, and had gone around the world many times for the British India Steam Navigation Company, carrying everything from biscuits to railway sleepers.But when it set out on its final journey to Bombay, on July 1, 1918, it was also loaded with precious cargo. Some say there were diamonds on board, others mention elephant tusks. It certainly had plenty of marmalade jars - specifically, Dundee marmalade - for the British in India and spares for their vehicles and weapons. Above all, the Shirala was bringing new currency notes . There were unsigned notes of Rs 5 and Rs 10 denominations, besides signed Re 1 notes. The Re 1 note had been introduced very recently, on Nov 30, 1917. Until then, Rs 5 had been the smallest denomination for notes in India. An article in the International Bank Note Society Journal says Re 1 notes used to come pre-signed from Britain, so when the Shirala sank, it became the ""first case of notes lost at sea which were pre-signed before their arrival in India from England"".The bigger notes were sent unsigned from Britain, and would have become legal tender only after receiving the signatures of officials at the Indian Currency Office. As the Shirala sank in shallow water close to the English coast, bits of its cargo started washing up on the shore. Among them were notes of all three denominations.In its Feb 6, 1920 edition, The Pioneer Mail of Allahabad reported that ""Some of the notes were saved and have recently made their appearance at the Currency Office in Rangoon from local banks."" In some cases, notes from the Shirala were presented with forged signatures. ""So far, eight of these notes are in custody of the authorities... All are of Rs 5 denomination,"" the paper said.Some of the Shirala's rupee notes stayed with their finders, which is why, after 106 years, they are up for auction. Meanwhile, the ship's wreck has become an attraction for divers. Historic England, which looks after British heritage sites, says Shirala's holds still contain ""cases of wine; crates of Dundee marmalade; spares for vehicles ...binoculars and telescopes; some ivory..."" But what you might not find now, after a century under water, are its rupee notes.","SS Shirala, a British ship, sank in the English Channel in 1918.

Surveillance and Repression

Impact on daily life

NEW DELHI: The Chinese government's crackdown on the Islamic faith, particularly among the Uyghur Muslim population in Xinjiang, has garnered significant international attention and condemnation due to human rights abuses and allegations of cultural genocide.In a recent investigation, UK's Sky News has shed light on China's increasing control over Islamic practices within the country. The report underscores the mounting restrictions and surveillance faced by Muslims, particularly in regions with significant Islamic populations.One poignant scene described in the report occurs in a cold, dusty part of central China, where a local Muslim leader stands alone in the courtyard of a small mosque. ""Religion is dying,"" he laments, highlighting the severe constraints imposed by the Chinese government on religious activities.The report details how the Chinese authorities have intensified efforts to monitor and restrict Islamic practices, including demolishing mosques, banning religious attire, and censoring Islamic texts. This crackdown is part of a broader campaign to align religious practices with the state's ideology and to curb any potential dissent.The Chinese authorities have taken numerous steps to curb the practice of Islam:Demolition of mosques: Many mosques have been demolished, particularly those that do not conform to the government's architectural standards or those deemed too conspicuous.Banning religious attire: Traditional Islamic attire, such as headscarves and long beards, has been banned in certain areas. This is part of an effort to assimilate Muslims into the broader Han Chinese culture.Censoring Islamic texts: The government has also censored Islamic texts, removing any content that could be perceived as promoting extremism or dissent. This includes altering the Quran and other religious literature to fit the state’s narrative.The report highlights the extensive surveillance network that monitors Muslim communities. High-tech surveillance systems, including facial recognition cameras, are prevalent in areas like Xinjiang, home to a significant Uyghur Muslim population. These systems track individuals' movements and behaviors, ensuring strict compliance with the government's regulations.The restrictions have permeated all aspects of daily life for Muslims in China. Religious education for children has been heavily regulated, with many religious schools being shut down. Additionally, community leaders and imams are required to attend government-run re-education programs to ensure they propagate state-approved messages, the Sky News report said.The international community has responded with concern over China’s treatment of its Muslim population. Human rights organizations have condemned the actions, calling for greater transparency and respect for religious freedoms. The Chinese government, however, maintains that these measures are necessary to combat extremism and ensure national security.","Chinese authorities have intensified efforts to monitor and restrict Islamic practices, including demolishing mosques and banning religious attire.

'Young Seniors' and 'Elderly Youths': All you need to know about new trend in China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/young-seniors-and-elderly-youths-all-you-need-to-know-about-new-trend-in-china/articleshow/110465537.cms,"NEW DELHI: A new trend has emerged in China's online communities where phrases like “young seniors” and “elderly youths” are gaining popularity. This shift in internet slang reflects the evolving demographic and economic landscape of the country.As per a South China Morning Post report, the phrase “young seniors” was highlighted when Ma Jiantang, former party secretary of the Development Research Center of the State Council, suggested at a forum that individuals aged 60 to 70 should be considered “young seniors” due to their good health and continued desire to work. This statement sparked discussions about China's aging population and its implications. ""It reflects China’s lopsided demographic landscape ,"" noted experts, pointing to the country's low birth rate and increasing elderly population as factors straining the pension system.In contrast, the term “elderly youths” refers to young adults, typically aged 35 and above, who face challenges in the job market. During the rapid expansion of the Chinese internet in 2017, many companies laid off employees in this age group, citing a lack of innovative drive and higher salaries as reasons. The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated this trend, leading to even more dismissals and hiring rejections for those over 35. This term has garnered significant attention online, with nearly 80 million views on Sina Weibo, as users express frustration over employment difficulties, the SCMP report said.Another growing trend is the rise of digital nomads, individuals who work remotely and travel freely. The pandemic-induced shift to remote work has accelerated this lifestyle, with an estimated 70 to 100 million digital nomads in China. These individuals, often bloggers, illustrators, programmers, and translators, prefer low-cost travel destinations within China.Additionally, some young people are opting for “partial retirement,” using interest from savings to cover daily expenses. This allows them to live modestly while remaining semi-engaged in the labor market. Even a small amount of interest, such as 30 yuan (US$4), can support this lifestyle.Finally, the concept of “full-time children” has emerged, where jobless young adults live with and are financially supported by their parents. This arrangement is seen as a temporary solution to a tough job market characterized by few opportunities, low wages, and long hours. As of April, the youth unemployment rate for those aged 16 to 24 stood at 14.7 percent, with those aged 25 to 29 at 7.1 percent.These new phrases and trends highlight the creative ways in which Chinese internet users are addressing and satirizing the challenges of modern life, particularly within the context of an evolving job market and demographic shifts.",A new trend has emerged in China's online communities where phrases like ‘young seniors’ and ‘elderly youths’ are gaining popularity.

"Phones, Islamic books, tourism: Taliban on charm offensive to revive Afghan economy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/phones-islamic-books-tourism-taliban-on-charm-offensive-to-revive-afghan-economy/articleshow/110493793.cms,"A tale of unexpected prosperity

Yet, amidst this backdrop of hardship, certain sectors and individuals find ways to not only survive but thrive, highlighting a complex interplay of resilience and disparity.

Yunis Safi, a businessman in Kabul, understands the subtle power of appearances in Afghanistan's social and economic spheres. Running a phone shop in the upscale Shar-e-Naw neighborhood, Safi explains, ""In Afghanistan, your phone is your personality."" His store, guarded and stocked with high-end iPhones, serves as a stark contrast to the economic conditions outside its doors.

What they are saying: Safi's customers include not just affluent Afghans but also members of the Taliban, indicating a nuanced shift in the group's stance towards technology and commerce. ""Of course they need smartphones. They use social media, they like making videos,"" Safi told AP, pointing out the demand for advanced features and security in mobile devices among his clientele.

The bigger picture

Beyond individual success stories like Safi's, the overall economic narrative of Afghanistan is one of a country at a crossroads. The telecommunications sector's growth, highlighted by significant investments in network infrastructure, presents a glimmer of hope. According to the communications ministry, 2 million new SIM cards have been issued in the past two years, and subscriber numbers are growing. The government is investing $100 million in the telecom sector and has fully restored hundreds of towers. Out of the 22.7 million active SIM cards in the country of 41 million people, 10 million are for voice calls, and the rest are for mobile internet. The communications ministry's push to expand digital connectivity across the country suggests a strategic pivot towards modernizing even in times of political and social upheaval, an AP report said.

The Taliban has also entered into preliminary agreements with Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to establish a logistics hub in western Afghanistan, aiming to position the country as a pivotal route for regional exports, including Russian oil to South Asia, according to Afghanistan's commerce minister. Taliban acting commerce minister Nooruddin Azizi, speaking to Reuters after a tripartite meeting in Kabul last week, announced that technical teams would finalize a written plan for the hub within two months, with investment from all three nations expected six months after discussions.

The proposed hub in Herat province is intended to leverage Afghanistan’s geographical advantage as a historical crossroads of the Silk Road, strategically nestled between South and Central Asia and neighboring China and Iran. Azizi emphasized the significance of this initiative, noting, ""Based on our discussions, a logistics centre is going to be established in Herat province, which can connect the north to South Asia.""

From spring offensive to

charm offensive

In Kabul, about 30 men, including a model and a 17-year-old with no prior job experience, form the inaugural class at a Taliban-run institute designed to foster a cadre of tourism and hospitality professionals. This initiative is part of a broader charm offensive by the Taliban to reshape perceptions of Afghanistan, despite stringent educational and societal restrictions on women. Mohammad Saeed, the head of Kabul's Tourism Directorate, notes a modest uptick in foreign visitors, buoyed by a more peaceful environment and improved flight connections with international hubs like Dubai. Despite this progress, the tourism sector grapples with formidable challenges such as onerous visa processes, severed international diplomatic relations, and a lack of robust infrastructure.

Despite this progress, the tourism sector grapples with formidable challenges such as onerous visa processes, severed international diplomatic relations, and a lack of robust infrastructure. Amidst these efforts, Afghanistan is positioning itself as an emerging tourism destination, a vision supported by the Taliban's leadership, as expressed by Saeed. The students at the institute are optimistic about their futures, with aspirations like Ahmed Massoud Talash's aim to enhance his social media presence through scenic Instagram posts, and Samir Ahmadzai's ambition to enter the hospitality business. The curriculum includes traditional Afghan handicrafts and basic anthropology, with an informal focus on understanding cultural interactions with foreign tourists—especially women, given the strict local customs. The reopening of the women’s spa at Kabul’s Serena Hotel exclusively for foreign women after a prolonged shutdown signals a tentative readiness for more international guests. However, the pervasive restrictions on Afghan women and complex global perceptions continue to pose significant hurdles to Afghanistan's tourism ambitions.

Between the lines

The survival and success of businesses like Safi's and the bustling exchange markets provide critical insights into Afghanistan's adaptive economic strategies. These stories of resilience and adaptation are pivotal in understanding how Afghans navigate their new realities under the Taliban's rule, leveraging every available opportunity to forge stability in an unstable environment.

What next: Monitoring how Afghanistan's economy adapts to the current challenges will be crucial. The resilience of sectors like telecommunications and informal finance may dictate the pace and nature of economic recovery or further decline. How the Taliban supports or stifles these growth areas could significantly impact the nation's economic trajectory and its people's everyday lives.

In Afghanistan , the economic landscape has drastically shifted since the Taliban 's takeover in 2021. The nation, once buoyed by international aid and foreign investment, now reels under severe financial distress . The freezing of billions in assets and the cessation of most foreign aid have plunged the country into an economic crisis.Afghanistan's financial woes deepen as foreign support dwindles. The takeover by the Taliban has led to a significant retraction of international financial support, exacerbating an already precarious situation. The economy , heavily reliant on aid, faces a dire future with limited immediate prospects for recovery.On the streets of Kabul, another facet of the economy thrives in the bustling money exchange market. Here, Abdul Rahman Zirak estimates that ""$10 million changes hands daily,"" with remittances from the Afghan diaspora playing a critical role. This sector's vibrancy during economic turmoil underscores the crucial role of informal financial systems in sustaining livelihoods when formal banking sectors collapse.","Afghanistan is positioning itself as an emerging tourism destination.
