Highest FD rates: Fixed deposit (FD) investors have a cause for celebration as they can still secure interest rates of approximately 9% on their deposits at certain small finance banks.

Odisha’s Subhadra Scheme paves the way for women’s empowerment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/odishas-subhadra-scheme-paves-the-way-for-womens-empowerment/articleshow/113409019.cms,"(The author is the Union education minister. Views expressed are personal)

In the intricate tapestry of nation-building, women often serve as the backbone of progress. This profound recognition is embodied in the newly announced ‘Subhadra’ scheme, being launched by PM Narendra Modi on September 17 —the day that marks his birthday. This significant initiative, designed explicitly for the women of Odisha, reflects a broader commitment to empowerment of women, who are undeniably the true architects of the nation’s future.The scheme, named after Devi Subhadra — beloved sister of the presiding deities of Odisha: Lord Jagannath and Lord Balabhadra — captures the essence of Odisha’s rich cultural heritage that venerates feminine strength and guardianship. By honouring this ancestral legacy, the Subhadra initiative aims to elevate women in Odisha, providing them with vital resources to rise and thrive.With an ambitious budget of Rs 55,825 crore allocated for the next five years (2024-2029), the Subhadra scheme promises annual financial assistance of Rs 10,000 for eligible women beneficiaries aged between 21 and 60. This support will be dispersed in two installments of Rs 5,000 each: one coinciding with Raksha Bandhan and the other with International Women’s Day — two dates laden with significance that symbolize protection and celebration of womanhood.Thus, an eligible woman beneficiary will receive Rs 50,000 in five years. It is estimated that more than a crore of eligible women will benefit from Subhadra scheme, thus making it — in coverage terms — the state’s large stever welfare scheme.The Modi government has already put in place a credible ecosystem with seamless integration with — what is known as — the JAM trinity: Jan Dhan account, Aadhaar and mobile number of the beneficiaries. This has resulted in hasslefree direct transfer of financial benefits under various public welfare schemes thus curbing the potential of corrupt practices. Today, nearly one crore women of Odisha have a Jan Dhan bank account; thus, an efficient implementation of Subhadra scheme and Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) to women beneficiaries should not be a challenging feat.Economists do believe that if the government’s per capita expenditure is one rupee, its effect on economy will be nearly five times in form of a ‘multiplier effect’. Thus the annual financial benefit of Rs 10,000 to eligible woman under Subhadra scheme will have multiplier effect of generating Rs 50,000 per woman on the economy. Thus, the total earmarked expenditure of Rs 55,825 crore under the scheme in five years, will accrue the benefits of nearly 2.5 lakh crore to the state’s economy while nudging women towards economic independence and a vastly improved life for the family. Here, the scheme symbolises more than financial assistance; it represents a transformative opportunity for women to assert their rightful roles in society and contribute to the country’s advancement.Considering the plight of women of Odisha and their continued neglect over decades, PM Modi made a solemn pledge to Odisha’s mothers and sisters to work for their uplift and empowerment. Subhadra scheme is an outcome of the solemn promise made to Odisha’s women and it unmistakably echoes a larger women empowerment narrative driven by PM Modi.Subhadra is more than a scheme; it is an expression of Modi government’s philosophy. As the PM himself has said, “Dreams of India will only come true when its daughters can soar as high as its sons.” This belief forms the cornerstone of the reformist agenda of the government that has defined his leadership.Today, women empowerment is at the centre of the government’s policy focus. Women are no longer just passive beneficiaries of welfare schemes but active participants in the nation’s growth story. From Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, which has empowered millions of women to access financial services, to Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which liberated them from the drudgery of smoky kitchens, to MUDRA Yojana, which has supported women in pursuing their entrepreneurial dreams, Centre’s policies have consistently demonstrated an acute awareness of the women’s issues and the need for their financial independence. Not surprisingly, women have responded with overwhelming support giving our government a historic third term in a row.True empowerment comes when women are not just recipients of benefits but leaders in driving change. The shift from ‘women’s develop ment’ to ‘women-led development’ is a testament to this fact. Initiatives like Lakhpati Didi Yojana, which seeks to empower three crore women through self-help groups, providing drones through central financial assistance to 15,000 women SHGs in various states, MUDRA loan enhancement to women entrepreneurs and many other schemes demonstrate a clear and consistent focus on women empowerment. Nari Shakti is no longer a distant ideal; it is the very engine that powers India’s development story. PM Modi spearheaded Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam, 2023, paving the way for women’s political empowerment by way of reserving one-third seats for women in Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies.Today, we honour the remarkable strength and resilience of women as they navi gate unchartered territories, breaking barriers and shattering glass ceilings along the way. Initiatives such as the Subhadra scheme not only redefine the future of Odisha but also pave the way for an India where every woman can dream, thrive, and lead with confidence. As the PM dedicates this transformative initiative to the women of Odisha, we reaffirm our commitment to fostering a society where women stand shoulder to shoulder with men, sharing equal opportunities and responsibilities. Odisha’s Subhadra scheme represents just one pivotal step in an ongoing journey toward women-led development — a journey integral to the vision of both a Viksit Odisha and a Viksit Bharat.","The Subhadra scheme promises annual financial assistance of Rs 10,000 for eligible women beneficiaries aged between 21 and 60.

Justice Bhuyan, who was also critical of Delhi HC for denying bail to Kejriwal, said CBI should dispel the notion of being a "" caged parrot "".""An institution is well served when it is conscious of certain limitations. Some limitations are obvious, some limitations are very fine & subtle. Let these sacred platforms - judiciary, legislature and executive - not be trigger points of political inflammatory debate or narrative that is detrimental to established institutions that serve the nation well in a challenging and daunting environment,"" Dhankhar said.In his separate judgment, Justice Bhuyan had said, ""In a democracy governed by rule of law, perception matters.

BHOPAL: Cheetahs were not part of the Kuno management plan , stated a MP govt audit report, pointing out violation of rules and absence of certain documents related to expenditures on Project Cheetah .Kuno was marked for the relocation of Gir lions and was designated as their secondary habitat, but there was no movement on that front, the report said.Auditors sent a detailed report to state govt, outright rejecting some explanations given by the forest department. Copies of the initial audit findings were obtained through RTI by activist Ajay Dubey who has demanded a probe into the objections raised by financial investigators.According to the approved management plan for Kuno National Park (2020-21 to 2029-30), the sanctuary was designated as a crucial secondary habitat for Asiatic lions - alongside Gir forest in Gujarat - auditors noted, pointing out that no efforts had been made towards reintroduction of lions as of Nov 2023. This lapse raises questions about adherence to the management plan and the overall effectiveness of conservation efforts, they said.The auditors also noted the absence of reports from a three-member expert team appointed by Supreme Court on Jan 28, 2020. These reports were not found in the forest division's records, preventing verification of the facts presented to SC, stated the audit report.The expenditure of over Rs 44.1 crore on Project Cheetah from 2021-22 to 2023-24 did not align with the approved management plan, it said. ""This discrepancy suggests misallocation of funds and raises concerns about the proper use of financial resources,"" added Dubey.The auditors found that the forest division failed to conduct physical verification of store materials for 2021-22 and 2022-23 fiscals, violating Rule 133 of MP Financial Code. The required certification for physical verification was missing, and stock accounts had not been prepared, which is a serious breach of regulations.The audit also identified that geotagged photographs, which are required to document project work, were not maintained. This lack of documentation, combined with the expenditure of Rs 3,64,74,930 on pasture development and weed/latana eradication in 2020-21, 2022-23, and 2023-24, suggests a ""faulty procedure and potential for wastage"".In response, the forest division has pledged to address these issues by preparing the missing stock accounts and ensuring future compliance with documentation requirements. However, the auditors have recommended that the matter be brought to the attention of higher officials for further action.","Auditors sent a detailed report to state govt, outright rejecting some explanations given by the forest department.

Provost of HSNC University Niranjan Hiranandani said with access opening up and connectivity getting better, it is only natural that ""multiple centres"" will be created. ""As Mumbai is the financial capital, there is an IT and data hub, and with a thriving industrial belt between Mumbai and Pune, education will definitely receive a big push.""The Niti Aayog report also pointed to the potential impact of a large educational system on job creation. ""MMR is not included in the current list of the top 10 districts in India in terms of the number of colleges. The top districts, Bengaluru (1,000+ approved colleges), Hyderabad (491 colleges) and Pune (475 colleges) have benefited greatly from being on top of this list and have created a large job ecosystem.""The World Economic Forum estimates that there will be nearly 20 million additional digital jobs required globally by 2030, across fields like information security, content creation, system administrators and telecom.The Niti Aayog report said MMR should target the skilling of at least 10-12L people cumulatively by 2030 in courses like electronics assembly, computer and digital courses, animation and visual graphics, fashion technology, supply chain, caregiving and nursing, and aviation and hospitality services, and ensure that at least 40% of them are women.Dr Balasaheb Pawar, trustee of Shiva Education Trust, which runs close to 50 professional, degree and diploma colleges, said the new mega education cities should focus on offering top-end professional courses that are of extremely high quality.Many echoed his thoughts, saying Navi Mumbai already has a large concentration of colleges offering traditional undergraduate courses like BA, BCom and BSc. The new cities would allow for integrated universities to implement National Education Policy in an unbridled manner, thus allowing students to pick a variety of courses from a large campus, they said.","Niti Aayog has recommended formation of'EduCities', spanning over 100 hectares.

In her plea, she said she had met with an accident two days prior and was unable to walk.A division bench of Justices G S Kulkarni and Somasekhar Sundaresan, in its Sept 12 order, said Lamya Khurshid Siddiqui has an excellent academic record and had scored 98% in the national level entrance test conducted for this course.It would be necessary to recognise the petitioner's merit and not let her opportunity to secure admission suffer for the sheer inability to attend an in-person meeting, the HC observed. The bench took note of the fact that two other students who had informed MU of their inability to attend the session due to medical issues were permitted to send a representative with all necessary documents and they were given provisional admission.Noting that Siddiqui has suffered an apparent injustice solely due to her inability to attend the counselling session, the bench said it was persuaded to grant relief on the basic consideration that the two supernumerary seats would remain unutilised. Then the merit of the petitioner would be a casualty, the HC said. ""Thus, recognising that the right to education being not only a statutory right but also a right that leads to the enjoyment of the right to life under Article 21, without creating any precedent since this is a peculiar set of facts, it would be appropriate to use one of the two unutilized supernumerary seats to accommodate her,"" it said.",Lamya Khurshid Siddiqui has an excellent academic record and had scored 98% in the national level entrance test conducted for this course.

"For disabled aspirants, new clause crushes hopes of nursing career",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-disabled-aspirants-new-clause-crushes-hopes-of-nursing-career/articleshow/113407838.cms,"● Krishna (uses only her first name) retired as deputy nursing superintendent in 2022 after being a nurse for more than 30 years. She lost both her legs in an accident just as she was graduating in nursing but went on to join GTB Hospital in East Delhi in 1989 using a wheelchair to move around.

● Lokesh* whose right leg was affected by polio since childhood was certified as having 65% disability. However, he has been working as an assistant nursing superintendent in AIIMS Bhopal.

● Meeta*, who has 100% hearing loss in one ear, has been working as a nurse since 2011 in a Delhi govt hospital.She says that she has never faced any problem in carrying out her duties because of her disability but was told that since deafness was not a recognised disability in nursing, she could not avail benefits of the quota for people with disabilities.While examples like Krishna, Meeta and Lokesh show that nurses with disabilities can indeed work in hospitals and may, in fact, show more understanding to patients, hurdles to a nursing career have only increased for other disabled aspirants .Recently, a girl with an amputated arm, whose disability level was 51%, was not allowed to join a BSc Nursing course because the Indian Nursing Council (INC) does not let anyone with a disability level above 50% take admission in nursing courses .Ranveer Singh Chauhan, president of the Differently Abled Employees Welfare Association, says there are about 200 nurses with various levels and kinds of disabilities working in several govt hospitals in Delhi. “Among them are some who have been certified as having 70%-80% disability. This cut-off of 50% is ridiculous,” says Chauhan, who works as an assistant nursing superintendent in the Central Jail Hospital, Tihar. He does not know the exact percentage of his disability since there was no such rule to determine the exact percentage before 2016. It was enough that a person’s disability was above 40% to avail of the quota for persons with disability.In 2020, INC revised the BSc (Nursing) curriculum for the first time since Independence. Now, its clause 8 states that only those “with a disability of locomotor to the tune of 40% to 50% of the lower extremity” would be eligible for graduation in nursing. This excludes candidates with other disabilities such as muscular dystrophy, dwarfism, acid attack victims, low vision, hearing impairment, speech disability and intellectual disability. Despite so many senior nurses with varying levels of disabilities working in Delhi, none of them were invited to be part of framing the regulations.Even after Delhi high court directed INC to re-evaluate the criteria, it reiterated that its high-powered committee had considered all issues and upheld the clause, saying that limited functional abilities of nurses would hamper care. “Nursing care activities mandate physical and mental fitness like good vision, hearing and stamina for assisting patients in activities of daily living,” it argued.Krishna pointed out that she and several others were proof that even with substantial disability one could contribute as a nurse. “I liked being posted in the injection room where hundreds of people had to be given injections which I could do sitting down. I was also in charge of the stores and keeping track of medicines and supplies. I drive a scooty and do all the work in my house on my own including sweeping, mopping and cooking. We deserve to be given a chance to work and earn a living and lead independent lives,” she says.The National Organization of Nurses with Disabilities (NOND) of the US wrote to the INC urging the council to “open the educational doors to students with disabilities” pointing out that nurses with disabilities or chronic health conditions “can provide competent, empathetic, direct patient care, or work in other healthcare industry sectors for corporations and nonprofit organisations”. The NOND letter listed several careers other than clinical nursing, such as becoming disabled nurse educators, consulting on health and wellness, private duty, rehabilitation etc.Doctors With Disabilities : Agents of Change, which filed the public interest petition in the Delhi high court, says it places “artificial fetters at the stage of admission itself, reducing the chances of persons with disabilities from being suitably employed.” This, when India faces a significant shortfall of nursing staff. It has 1.96 nurses per 1,000 people against the WHO-recommended ratio of three nurses.Dr Satendra Singh, a disability rights activist and faculty in GTB Hospital Delhi, points out that the disabled find unconventional ways to adapt to. “Why only nurses who are ‘one-legged’ or with ‘both legs disabled’? We need compassionate nurses who understand what it is like to live with chronic illness or disability, not superhuman robots. To clear misconceptions about the capacity of students with disabilities to undergo training in nursing, why doesn’t INC include nurses with disabilities in the committees that frame such regulations?” he says.*Name changed on request","A girl with an amputated arm, whose disability level was 51%, was not allowed to join a BSc Nursing course.

Defends his tenure by highlighting Rs 1,100 crore allocation for Marathwada water grid project.

CHHATRAPATI SAMBHAJINAGAR : Shiv Sena (UBT) chief Uddhav Thackeray referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to the residence of Chief Justice of India, and said he thanks the CJI for not giving a ""next date"" to Ganapati Bappa because Modi was to visit his residence.Thackeray, addressing a public rally at Vaijapur in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar on Sunday, said: ""We all know that the PM visited the CJI's residence, and the latter drew a lot of criticism from across the country over the visit.However, I would like to thank the CJI for not giving a ‘next date' to Ganapati Bappa because PM Modi was coming to his home.""""We are seeking justice from the court not just as Shiv Sena, but through the party, we are seeking to know whether democracy will survive in this country,"" he added.""We have faith in the judiciary, but if justice is not given in time, we have a bigger court of people to go to... and we want justice from people,"" Thackeray said. He also dismissed the ruling Mahayuti alliance's criticism that the MVA govt denied funds to the Marathwada water grid project and insisted that MVA had released Rs1,100 crore for the project.Thackeray's comment came in the context of Sena (UBT)'s petition — against Maharashtra assembly speaker's order declaring the Eknath Shinde-led faction as the ""real Shiv Sena"" and refusing disqualification of Shinde and other MLAs who rebelled against Thackeray — that has been pending before the Supreme Court for two years now. The UBT then lost the party's ‘dhanush-baan' (bow and arrow) symbol to the Shinde faction and got ‘mashaal' (burning torch) symbol.""Last time, we did not get adequate time to campaign with ‘mashaal' symbol. However, this time, we must take this symbol to each home as the traitors will return with ‘Dhanush-Baan' to seek votes during the assembly elections. I have no idea how far it is appropriate now to expect that the court's result will come before the polls,"" Thackeray said.Meanwhile, amid criticism from ruling party politicians that MVA govt kept the ambitious multi-crore water grid project for Marathwada fund-starved, Thackeray claimed govt released Rs 1,100 crore during his tenure as CM.""They (opponents) are shouting that Thackeray govt did nothing. I released Rs 1,100 crore,"" he said.Thackeray, in his address, also criticised state govt on different fronts including the ‘Mukhyamantri Ladki Bahin' scheme that offers a monthly financial aid of Rs 1,500 to the women beneficiaries. ""The sum of Rs 1,500 is a paltry amount and many women have doubts about how to run their homes using this money.

The Dolphins' $7 Billion Dollar Power Play



The New NFL: A Trend of Financial Flexibility



What This Means for the NFL?



The Big Picture: Ross, the Dolphins, and the Future



When it comes to the NFL , the action doesn't just happen on the field – big money plays out behind the scenes, too. And no one's making bigger moves than **Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross**, who is reportedly in talks to sell a **stake in the Dolphins** valued at over a staggering **$7 billion**. That’s right, the Dolphins aren’t just about touchdowns and two-point conversions – they’re about billion-dollar valuations that rival global entertainment giants.Let’s break down what’s really happening here, why this potential deal is shaking up the sports world, and what it could mean for the future of NFL team ownership.Also read - Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa says he's disturbed and emotional over body-camera footage In an industry known for tight control over team ownership, the NFL recently shook things up. A rule change now allows **private equity firms** to own up to **10% of an NFL team**. This was a significant shift, especially for a league that has historically been exclusive in terms of who gets to own a piece of the NFL pie.Enter **Stephen Ross**. The real estate magnate, with a net worth north of $10 billion, is exploring this new rule by **talking to private equity firms** like **Arctos Partners** about selling a stake in the Dolphins. For those unfamiliar,Arctos Partners is a heavyweight in sports investment, already owning parts of teams in the NBA, MLB, and NHL. If Ross goes ahead with this sale, it would be one of the first deals of its kind under the NFL's new ownership guidelines.The reported **$7 billion valuation** of the Dolphins might leave some scratching their heads – why is the team worth so much? To put things in perspective, the Dolphins were valued at around $4.6 billion by Forbes in 2023, meaning this potential sale is set at a figure significantly above that. So why the surge?The NFL is a goldmine. Teams are raking in massive profits from TV deals, stadium naming rights, merchandise, and streaming platforms. The Dolphins, in particular, have seen an uptick in value thanks to a series of smart investments, including the renovation of **Hard Rock Stadium** and strong performance on the field. And let’s not forget Miami’s status as a global city, with an influx of fans from around the world, solidifying the Dolphins as a prime asset.For Ross, selling a minority stake makes a lot of sense. He retains control of the team while freeing up billions in liquidity, which he can use to fuel other business ventures. It’s a savvy financial move that speaks to the broader trend of NFL owners embracing new ways to fund their operations without relinquishing control.With private equity allowed into the game, owners can now sell parts of their team to sophisticated investors, diversify their portfolio, and continue cashing in on the NFL's exponential growth. The **$7 billion** valuation is not just a testament to the Dolphins’ growth but to the overall financial clout of the NFL.Ross's potential deal could be the start of a new era for the league. While private equity firms have long been involved in the world of sports, their recent entry into the NFL marks a shift that could reshape how teams are financed and operated.Gone are the days when owning an NFL team meant holding onto it for generations without outside financial help. Now, the most financially savvy owners can partner with investment firms to unlock even more value from their franchises. If Ross pulls off this deal, you can bet other owners will follow suit, turning to private equity firms to raise capital while still keeping a hand on the wheel.Stephen Ross isn’t just any NFL owner – he’s one of the most forward-thinking businessmen in the league. From bringing **Formula 1 to Miami** to investing in the **Hudson Yards mega-development** in New York, Ross has never been afraid to take risks. His potential sale of a stake in the Dolphins could open the door to an entirely new financial structure in the NFL.While this may seem like just another business move, it’s a clear signal of the increasing financial sophistication of NFL owners. And with the Dolphins now valued at over **$7 billion**, it's a reminder that football is no longer just about what happens on the field – it's a global business juggernaut.Ross’s move is not only a strategic play but a wake-up call for the league.

"NDMA: Govt launches programme to tackle glacial lake outburst flood threat in Himalayas, all 190 high-risk lakes to be monitored",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-launches-programme-to-tackle-glacial-lake-outburst-flood-threat-in-himalayas-all-190-high-risk-lakes-to-be-monitored/articleshow/113401592.cms,"TOI

NEW DELHI: The glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in Sikkim , which occurred in Oct 2023 and claimed 14 lives, has highlighted the vulnerability of the entire Himalayan region to such catastrophic events. This tragedy prompted the Centre to launch a comprehensive national GLOF risk mitigation programme, targeting 190 high-risk glacial lakes across four states and two Union Territories.The Kedarnath disaster of 2013 had brought some awareness to the dangers posed by GLOFs, but the recent disasters call for greater preparedness.The programme, led by the National Disaster Management Authority ( NDMA ), aims to conduct detailed technical hazard assessments of all high-risk glacial lakes and install automated weather and water level monitoring stations (AWWS) and early warning systems (EWS) at these lakes and in downstream areas.A GLOF is a type of flood that occurs when water dammed by a glacier or moraine is suddenly released. Such outbursts have the potential to release millions of cubic metres of water in a short period, causing catastrophic flooding in downstream areas with human settlements and critical infrastructure. Climate change has given rise to the formation of numerous such lakes.“GLOF risk reduction is a very challenging, long-term task. With altered frequency, duration and intensity (FDI) of heat and precipitation, GLOFs could soon be India’s most challenging natural hazard,” Safi Ahsan Rizvi, NDMA advisor (mitigation), toldServing IPS officer, Rizvi, underlined the NDMA’s coordinating mechanism, CoDRR (committee on disaster risk reduction), to bring all states and central scientific institutions on a single platform to implement the ambitious programme, amplifying the “whole of govt” approach.The Rs 150 crore programme, approved in July, is part of the overall Rs 12,554 crore that has been approved by the Centre for urban flood management, firefighting services and otherdisaster mitigation efforts for states/UTs.Though there are 7,500 glacial lakes in the Himalayan region, covering Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, NDMA has identified 190 of them as ‘high-risk’. The highest 48 of them are located in Himachal Pradesh, followed by 40 in Sikkim, 35 in Ladakh, 28 in Arunachal Pradesh, 26 in J&K and 13 in Uttarakhand.As part of the programme, all central and state agencies, including scientific institutions, Indian Army and ITBP, have been conducting expeditions to the high-risk lakes, assessing structural stability and potential breach points of glacial lakes.Meanwhile, the ministry of electronics & IT has launched a grand challenge to encourage the development of innovative and sustainable indigenous solutions for GLOF, leveraging advanced technologies including AI, drone tech and satellite IoT for glacial lake survey, predictive analytics and lake volume calculator.“The idea is to come out with solutions that may more effectively monitor, analyse, predict and mitigate the risks associated with GLOFs,” said an official.","GLOF is a type of flood that occurs when water dammed by a glacier or moraine is suddenly released.

Sebi U-turn: Pulls note blaming 'external elements' for staff stir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-u-turn-pulls-note-blaming-external-elements-for-staff-stir/articleshow/113409194.cms,"Sebi: Staff for resolving issues amicably via internal channels

MUMBAI: Bowing to pressure from agitating employees, markets regulator Sebi on Monday did an about turn, withdrawing its Sept 4 press release in which, among other things, it had blamed ""external elements"" for a spate of agitations by a part of its employees and argued that entry level salaries at the regulatory body, estimated at Rs 34 lakh on a cost to company basis, was comparable with the corporate sector.On Sept 5, several Sebi employees had taken the unprecedented step of holding a demonstration at the watchdog's headquarters demanding withdrawal of the press release, arguing that the contents had several incorrect pieces of information.Prior to Sebi's Sept 4 release, about 500 employees had written to finance ministry on how chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch had brought in a ""toxic"" management culture in the organisation.In their letter to govt, Sebi employees had said that one of their main grievances was about the leadership ""calling names"" and ""shouting"" at them. ""Unprofessional language is casually used by people at the highest level,"" officers were quoted in the report.Sebi's clarification of Sept 4, however, was silent on this issue, which was at the core of their grievance. The Sebi statement had claimed that an anonymous email had been sent and officers and associations condemned the communication to govt.In its statement on Monday, Sebi said that it had ""constructive discussions with representatives of all grades of officers,"" and after that Sebi and its employees have reaffirmed that such issues were ""strictly internal"" and ""will be managed in accordance with the organisation's high standards of governance"" and in a time-bound manner.""Accordingly, the press release (of Sept 4) stands withdrawn. Employees have strongly condemned the unauthorised release of internal communication and have confirmed that all concerns shall be addressed amicably through established internal channels,"" the regulator said.The release added that the regulator believed that its employees had played a critical role over the past 36 years in shaping the Indian securities market into one of the most dynamic and well-regulated markets globally.The development comes amid repeated attacks on Sebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband, Dhaval, with Congress accusing them of conflict of interest - charges that they have denied. The Sebi statement questioning the motive of the ""leak"" of information regarding working conditions, including salaries and fixing of key result areas (KRAs), came during these allegations and opened another front for the regulatory brass."," markets regulator Sebi on Monday withdrew its Sept 4 press release.

This financial backing is expected to play a crucial role in finalizing Glasgow's offer to save the multi-sport event.""Glasgow, which hosted the games in 2014, is now close to confirming a scaled down event featuring fewer sports,"" the BBC reported, as quoted by PTI.""The Scottish government is on the verge of agreeing a deal for Glasgow to host the Commonwealth Games in 2026.""The Scottish and United Kingdom governments had declined to allocate public funds for the rescue bid, which was primarily financed by a substantial contribution of 100 million pounds (approximately USD 130 million) from the CGF.Despite this, UK government Health Secretary Neil Gray cautioned that the upcoming 2026 Commonwealth Games would differ from Glasgow's previous experience as the host city.""Reputationally, my worry and the government's worry has always been that there is going to be a comparison with the incredibly successful 2014 games, which by any stretch of the imagination both in terms of the performances, the spectacle that it was and the legacy, were going to be hard to match,"" Gray said in the BBC report.""But I'm hopeful that if we are able to recognise that if we are to go ahead, this is a different games, this is a smaller event.""Fewer sports across fewer sites but with good collaboration we could see something coming forward that is still positive for Glasgow and for Scotland.""He said discussions were ongoing to make sure ""there is no financial risks to the government.""Last week, the UK government assured Scotland's government that no public funds would be needed to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games.Reports suggest that if Glasgow hosts the Games, it will feature between 10 and 13 sports, compared to the 20 sports included in the 2022 Birmingham edition. Existing facilities will be utilized, with Australia's financial contribution expected to help cover additional policing and security expenses.Following Victoria's withdrawal from hosting the 2026 CWG , several cities in Australia and worldwide declined to take on the event before Glasgow's offer emerged.Commending Australia's investment, CGF President Chris Jenkins expressed full support for Scotland's innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable concept for the Games.""... unreservedly believes that Scotland and the CGS team, with its significant experience in, and successful global reputation for organising major sports events, is more than able to deliver a world-class event in such a short period of time,"" Jenkins said in a CGF statement.""On the basis that the Games are fully-funded and responsibly budgeted, with further support now pledged from international partners, we look forward to working with the Scottish Government to fully realise the benefits of a new, innovative Games in one of the Commonwealth's most valued and experienced sporting cities.""He said the past blueprint for multi-sports events will have to change in order to become more sustainable for the future.""In utilising existing sporting, transport and accommodation infrastructure ... forward-thinking, sustainable, and attractive proposition is something we are hugely passionate about as it will allow more countries to host these Games in the future. We believe our new Games model will lead the way for others to follow.""The model for these Games is different but innovative ...

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.
