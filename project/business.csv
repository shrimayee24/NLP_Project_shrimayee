NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , aged 92, passed away late on Thursday evening after prolonged illness.Manmohan Singh is widely regarded as the architect of the economic reforms introduced during PV Narasimha Rao's tenure, which contributed to India's economic growth . Beyond economics, Singh had a deep interest in ' shayari ' (Urdu poetry), often using it during parliamentary debates and press briefings to respond to political opponents.One of his most famous poetic statements was: "".""From 2009 to 2014, during the 15th Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, then Leader of the Opposition, engaged in several poetic exchanges with the former prime minister. One notable instance occurred in March 2011, during a heated discussion on a Wikileaks cable that alleged Congress had bribed MPs during the 2008 trust vote. Sushma Swaraj recited Shahab Jafari's lines:"" (Don’t change the topic, just tell why the caravan was looted, we have nothing to say about the robbers, but this is a question on your leadership).Manmohan Singh responded with Allama Iqbal’s couplet:"" (I know I am not worth your attention, but look at my longing).Another poetic exchange occurred in 2013 during the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address. The former PM remarked with Mirza Ghalib’s words:"" (We expect loyalty from those who don’t know what loyalty is).In response, Sushma Swaraj recited two couplets. The first, by Bashir Badr:"" (There must be a reason for betraying love).Her second response was:"" (You don’t remember loyalty and we don’t remember disloyalty, life and death have two rhythms, you don’t remember one, we don’t remember the other).After Sushma Swaraj’s passing in August 2019, Manmohan Singh described her as a great parliamentarian and a talented Union minister.It is also worth noting the former PM's reply to the no-confidence motion against his government in 2008. Singh said almost prophetically, ""The greatness of democracy is that we are all birds of passage! We are here today, gone tomorrow! But in the brief time that the people of India entrust us with this responsibility, it is our duty to be honest and sincere in the discharge of these responsibilities.""","Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dies aged 92 after prolonged illness.

Watch: When Manmohan Singh attended Rajya Sabha in a wheelchair drawing praise from PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/watch-when-manmohan-singh-attended-rajya-sabha-in-a-wheelchair-drawing-praise-from-pm-modi/articleshow/116697496.cms,"LIVE I 'Manmohan Singh Came In Wheelchair...': When Modi Heaped Praise On Former PM

NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , then 91, made an appearance in the Rajya Sabha in a wheelchair. It was August 7, 2023, and the Upper House was deliberating on the contentious Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2023. Despite his frail health, Singh displayed his steadfast dedication to the democratic process.The bill at hand sought to enhance the central government’s authority over the affairs of Delhi’s administration, including framing rules regarding the functions, terms, and service conditions of officers and employees.Recognising the significance of the vote, the Congress party issued a stern three-line whip, urging its MPs to be present in full force. It called on its members to “remain present in the House from 11:00 am onwards till adjournment” and “support the party stand.”The dedication of the former Prime Minister did not go unnoticed.Days later, during the farewell session for retiring Rajya Sabha members, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded Singh’s contribution and unwavering sense of duty. Recalling the moment, PM Modi said, “I remember in the other House, during the voting, it was known that the treasury bench would win, but Dr Manmohan Singh came in his wheelchair and cast his vote. This is an example of a member being alert to his duties.”Singh breathed his last at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on the night of December 26, at the age of 92 leaving behind a legacy that reshaped modern India.As finance minister in the 1990s, Singh’s visionary policies unshackled India from the licence raj, steering the country away from economic collapse. His tenure as Prime Minister from 2004 to 2014 witnessed the implementation of transformative initiatives such as the Right to Information (RTI), the Right to Education (RTE), and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA).Manmohan Singh’s political career spanned over three decades, exclusively as a Rajya Sabha member. First elected in 1991, he served as leader of the opposition from 1998 to 2004 before ascending to the nation’s highest executive office. Known for his erudition, humility, and ability to forge consensus, Singh’s contributions extended beyond Indian borders, earning him respect in global financial and economic spheres.","Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made an appearance in the Rajya Sabha in a wheelchair.

Manmohan Singh: Man who liberated India's dreams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manmohan-singh-man-who-liberated-indias-dreams/articleshow/116696590.cms,"Singh got CWC to twice endorse

nuclear deal

NEW DELHI: It was likely his darkest hour as PM - the shine of popular approbation, a key factor in Congress-led alliance's 2009 election win, had worn off, to be replaced by ominous clouds with nary a silver lining in sight. But Singh, then at the helm of UPA-2's scandals-hit govt, where ministerial bickerings were routine, had a different take. ""History will be more kind to me,"" he said.He was right. And anyone, no matter their politics, would have agreed with Dr Singh's self-assessment as news broke that he breathed his last in AIIMS on Thursday, on a cold, foggy Delhi evening.No Indian PM could match him in nonchalance when facing a blizzard of bad news. Recall those days - Commonwealth scam, 2G scam, coal scam, Manmohan's big mantris behaving as if they didn't have a boss, Rahul Gandhi tearing up a bill okayed by Singh govt that opened a backdoor for convicted netas to come back to electoral politics.What informed the serene Sikh's cool self-confidence in the face of excoriating banner headlines on corruption and dysfunction? One, Singh was, in public life, unflappable. Two, he knew, even if his critics forgot in the heat of news, his legacy as the man who changed India's economic destiny was unchallengeable.The journey to his taking charge of India's economy showed another key trait in him. He was a determined pragmatist who smartly read the tea leaves of both politics and governance. When Indian Socialism was all the rage, he was an excellent technocrat serving the license-permit raj, When that very economic regime nearly brought India to ruin, and Narasimha Rao picked him - after IG Patel had turned down Rao's offer to be FM - to save the economy by changing India's economic DNA, Singh, with equal felicity, became the Sardar of Reforms. Communists and protection-loving corporate chiefs dissed Singh. It didn't affect him one bit. The 1991 rewriting of industrial policy and the budget that followed are milestones in India's evolution. If India is today reckoned globally as a serious economic player, if it's pegged as a future economic heavyweight, if its markets and middle class are in MNCs' and fund managers' radars, it all goes back to those key calls taken by a quiet man.Dr Singh's story is all the more riveting because not just his ascension to FM, but even to the country's top job were, as his former press adviser Sanjaya Baru had described, accidental.He wouldn't have been FM had Patel taken the job. He wouldn't have been PM had Sonia Gandhi not decided to rule herself out of the job after Congress+ beat BJP+ in a dramatic upset in 2004.The thing is he took to both jobs as if he were made for them. On May 19, 2004 evening, standing on the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan with Singh at her side, Sonia announced him as PM by saying, ""the country will be safe in Dr Manmohan Singh 's hands"".Her praise can be parsed in two ways. Safe for Gandhis because he would be loyal to the family, and safe for India because Singh's competence and professional creds were never in doubt. Plus, there were the political returns for Congress in picking a Singh PM - 1984's wounds and memories were still raw. Singh, despite his reforms record, was often thought as a political novice, especially against wily Congress netas who made a career out of Machiavellian durbar politics. Critics were wrong again. The 2008 nuclear deal with US, shepherded by him against not just BJP and CPM charges of selling the country down but also against disquiet inside Congress, was a masterclass in wiliness.Singh got CWC to twice endorse the nuclear deal, shrugged off Left walking out of UPA-1, and won a LS vote of confidence. 'Singh is King', headlines said.Singh is wise, was the verdict of many world leaders, notably Republican George Bush and his successor Democrat Barack Obama. Obama was particularly impressed. When G20 was born as the financial crisis upended a decade-long bull run everywhere, and various heads of govt spoke, Obama singled out Singh: ""When Dr Singh speaks, the world listens"", the then US president said. But as happens in rough electoral politics, even the wisest leaders are not always listened to. Coming into 2009 LS polls, the economy just about emerging from the taper tantrum and his political and economic stewardship under the scanner, Congress took a drubbing against Modi-led BJP. Singh, both before and after results, spoke of the dangers of 'majoritarianism'. A Partition refugee and a minority in Hindu-majority India, he probably had an acute personal attachment to secular politics. But it went beyond that. He was a political liberal by conviction. Singh's comments on Modi could be seen as typical loser's gripe. But there was more to it. He believed India couldn't afford majoritarian politics .","Singh got CWC to twice endorse the nuclear deal, shrugged off Left walking out of UPA-1, and won a LS vote of confidence.

Not surprisingly, the schemes' credit was also taken by Gandhi and her team. The flagship schemes were backed by legislation, with RTI and NREGA being the first ones to be enacted in 2005.Singh's first term also saw the introduction of OBC quotas in education, a move pushed by then HRD minister Arjun Singh, which was resisted by several of his cabinet colleagues before they fell in line. The quota announcement, which set off protests, was followed by govt announcing an expansion in the number of seats in educational institutions.

Licence Raj

It was June 1991. Manmohan Singh had just returned to Delhi, after attending a conference in the Netherlands, and had gone to bed. Late that night, Singh's son-in-law, Vijay Tankha, took a phone call. The voice on the other end was that of PC Alexander, a confidante of PV Narasimha Rao . Alexander urged Vijay to wake up his father-in-law.Singh and Alexander met a few hours later, and the official told Singh about Rao's plan to appoint him FM. Singh, then UGC chairman, and who had never been in politics, didn't take Alexander seriously.But Rao was serious. On June 21, Singh was in his UGC office. He was told to go home, get dressed and attend the swearing-in function. ""Everybody was surprised to see me as a member of the new team lined up to take the oath of office. My portfolio was allotted later, but I was told straight away by Narasimha Rao ji that I was going to be finance minister,"" Singh is quoted as saying in 'Strictly Personal, Manmohan & Gursharan', a book by his daughter Daman Singh.That appointment changed the course of India's economy. From an insular, control-heavy, low-growth economy it became what's today the world's fastest growing major economy.Along with Rao, Singh was the architect of 1991 reforms, weathering attacks from inside and outside Congress. The economy was in tatters, forex reserves had dropped to Rs 2,500 crore, barely sufficient to cover 2 weeks of imports, global banks were refusing to offer loans, forex outflows were large, inflation was soaring.But Singh knew the problems beforehand, and also the solutions, which he outlined in his budget speech a month later. The ball was set rolling within days of moving into North Block. He worked closely with then RBI deputy governor C Rangarajan to devalue the rupee and removed export controls in partnership with P Chidambaram, then the commerce minister.July 24, the day Singh presented his first budget, saw the Indian economy saying good riddance to the licence-permit raj. Hours before the budget, the Rao govt tabled the new industrial policy in Parliament, working on a paper that Singh remembered having seen during his brief stint as economic adviser to Chandra Sekhar, who led a fragile coalition in 1990-91.Based on the document prepared by economic adviser Rakesh Mohan, industrial delicensing was undertaken in all but 18 sectors, and foreign direct investment was allowed in 34 industries. Besides, public sector monopoly in several sectors came to an end and disinvestment of govt shareholding in state-run companies was permitted.His budget freed up fund-raising by Indian companies by setting up Sebi and also announced a new committee under RBI governor M Narasimhan to work out the new architecture for the financial sector, which was implemented by the Rao govt and its successors. The budget focused on fiscal consolidation, by cutting down on wasteful spending.Singh had also drawn attention to the precarious price situation in his 1991 budget speech.""The price situation, which is of immediate concern to the vast mass of our people, poses a serious problem as inflation has reached a double digit level. During the fiscal year ending 31st March 1991 the wholesale price index registered an increase of 12.1%, while the consumer price index registered an increase of 13.6%. The major worrisome feature of the inflation in 1990-91 was that it was concentrated in essential commodities,"" Singh had said.Those reforms had put the economy back on track and triggered optimism globally. The ""Bombay Club"", a group of corporate chiefs who wanted protection from foreign competition, was not happy. But they got it wrong.","Manmohan Singh was the architect of 1991 reforms, weathering attacks from inside and outside Congress.

NEW DELHI: Former Prime Minister and Congress stalwart Dr. Manmohan Singh passed away on Thursday at the age of 92. Singh breathed his last at AIIMS Delhi, where he was admitted on Thursday evening.Singh was sworn in as Prime Minister on May 22 after the 2004 general elections and took the oath of office for a second term on May 22, 2009.He was born on September 26, 1932, in a village in the Punjab province of undivided India. He completed his matriculation examinations from the Punjab University in 1948.The Union government declared a seven day-day national mourning of former prime minister .In his long political career, Singh was a member of the Rajya Sabha since 1991, where he was Leader of the Opposition between 1998 and 2004. He retired from the Rajya Sabha in April 2024.Singh represented India at many international conferences and in several international organizations. He led Indian Delegations to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Cyprus (1993) and to the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna in 1993.One of the key decisions Manmohan Singh took as PM included the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) (2005), a flagship program that guaranteed 100 days of wage employment per year to rural households.His government also launched the Right to Information Act in 2005 to strengthen transparency and accountability in governance by granting citizens the right to access information held by public authorities. In 2013, his government launched the National Food Security Act to ensure subsidized food grains to approximately two-thirds of India’s population.Singh's academic career took him from Punjab to the University of Cambridge, UK, where he earned a First Class Honours degree in Economics in 1957. Later, he followed this with a D. Phil in Economics from Nuffield College at Oxford University in 1962.His book, ""India's Export Trends and Prospects for Self-Sustained Growth"" [Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1964] was an early critique of India’s inward-oriented trade policy.Dr. Singh’s academic credentials were burnished by his years on the faculty of Punjab University and the prestigious Delhi School of Economics.In 1971, Singh joined the government of India as an economic advisor in the commerce ministry. This was soon followed by his appointment as Chief Economic Advisor in the ministry of finance in 1972.Among the many governmental positions that Dr. Singh occupied were secretary in the ministry of finance, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), advisor of the Prime Minister; and chairman of the University Grants Commission.He had a brief stint at the UNCTAD Secretariat as well, during these years. This presaged a subsequent appointment as Secretary General of the South Commission in Geneva between 1987 and 1990.In what became the turning point in the economic history of independent India, Singh spent five years between 1991 and 1996 as India's finance minister under the Narasimha Rao government. His role in ushering in a comprehensive policy of economic reforms is now recognised worldwide. In the popular view of those years in India, that period is inextricably associated with the persona of Singh.Among the many awards and honours conferred upon Singh in his public career, the most prominent are India's second highest civilian honour, the Padma Vibhushan in 1987.","Singh was born on September 26, 1932, in a village in the Punjab province of undivided India.

The expenditure was Rs 20,288 (equivalent to Rs 3.6 crore today). The 1894 event saw about 10 lakh participants from a population of 23 crore, with an expenditure of Rs 69,427 (approximately Rs 10.5 crore in current value).The 1906 Kumbh attracted about 25 lakh people, with an expenditure of Rs 90,000 (at present valued at Rs 13.5 crore) when the population was 24 crore.

When he enquired about publicity costs, Malaviya replied, just two paise. He explained by showing the 'Panchang', saying the almanac comes for two paisa,"" said Tiwari. Malaviya clarified the almanac informed devotees festival dates. According to Tiwari, Malaviya told the Viceroy, ""This is not a crowd.

The traffickers had left the family in the middle of a snowstorm at -37 degrees Celsius.Three years later, a money laundering probe by the ED against the agents involved in the Patel family case has found an international syndicate of human traffickers that includes at least 260 colleges in Canada that issued student visas to ""illegal migrants"" to take the Canadian route to the US.Those who found the student visa route more convenient, compared to the 'donkey route', paid around Rs 50-60 lakh each to the agents to arrange their student visa and travel to Canada before being ""pushed"" into the US.

All potential illegal migrants are then prepared with required documentation for a student visa.During the searches, ED seized Rs 19 lakh in bank accounts of the accused besides seizure of documents and digital devices.

'I feel I have done reasonably well': Top quotes of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-feel-i-have-done-reasonably-well-top-quotes-of-former-prime-minister-manmohan-singh/articleshow/116690190.cms,"Here's are some top quotes of India’s fourteenth Prime Minister:

""I would be the last person to say there is no scope of doing more"" Singh said at a press conference at the National Media Centre, New Delhi on January 3, 2014.

""I have never felt like resigning at any time. I have enjoyed doing my work. I have tried to do my work with all honesty, with all sense of integrity, without regard, or fear or favour,"" Singh said at a press conference on January 3, 2014.

""I do not believe that I have been a weak Prime Minister. That is for historians to judge. The BJP and its associates may say whatever they like. But if by “strong Prime Minister”, you mean that you preside over a mass massacre of innocent citizens on the streets of Ahmedabad, that is the measure of strength, I do not believe that sort of strength this country needs, least of all, in its Prime Minister,"" he had said at the same press conference when he was asked ""The BJP and Mr Modi’s charge against you is that you have been a weak PM. Does the party have a role,"" he said in a conference.

""It is for you to judge. As far as I am concerned, I feel I have done reasonably well. The growth process that we sustained in the last ten years despite the global financial crisis, despite the Euro-zone crisis, and considering also what is happening in other emerging countries like Brazil, like South Africa, like Indonesia, I don’t think ours is a story which can be described as non-successful or eventful,"" said Singh when he was asked to rate his tenure on a scale of ten at a press conference on Jan 3, 2014.

""Let me say at the outset that I do believe we are set for better times. The cycle of global economic growth is turning for the better,"" he had said during opening remarks at a press conference.

""Well, if I can succeed in normalising relations between India and Pakistan as they should prevail between two normal states, I will consider my job well done,"" he said while he was returning from a two-nation tour of China and Kazkhstan in 2011.

""I would be the first person to admit that we could have done more. We should not be satisfied with what we have achieved. There is always room for improvement and for better outcomes. But I do believe that the record of our first year is a record of reasonable achievement,"" he said.

""I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the Opposition parties in Parliament,"" he said in a press conference.

""India is a hospitable environment for FDI and will continue to do so. We will continue to improve our practices wherever they are needed,"" he said in a press conference in Jan 2014.

""It is often said that time is a great healer. But unfortunately, in the case of demonetisation, the scars and wounds of demonetisation are only getting more visible with time,"" he said on demonetisation in 2018.

“More than any other period of human history, the need for unity of thought and action today is the most urgent,” he said during an event by Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID) in 2019.

""When the world is breaking up into fragments, and fragments clash with fragments, surrendering all sense and purpose of living for the larger humanity, it is the humanity which seeks transcendence from narrow limits and boundaries,"" he said during an event by Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID) in 2019.

His studies led him to the University of Cambridge, UK, where he obtained a First Class Honours in Economics in 1957. He subsequently earned his D Phil in Economics from Oxford University's Nuffield College in 1962. His publication, ""India's Export Trends and Prospects for Self-Sustained Growth"" [Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1964] provided an early analysis of India's inward-focused trade policies.His government service began in 1971 as economic advisor in the commerce ministry, followed by his appointment as chief economic advisor in the finance ministry in 1972. His distinguished career included positions as finance ministry secretary, planning commission deputy chairman, Reserve Bank of India governor, Prime Minister's advisor, and University Grants Commission chairman.A significant period in independent India's economic history occurred during 1991-1996 when Dr Singh served as finance minister. His contribution to implementing comprehensive economic reforms received global recognition.In his political journey, Dr Singh has represented India's Upper House of Parliament (the Rajya Sabha) since 1991, serving as leader of the opposition from 1998 to 2004.

He has been a model to each and every economist working with Indian govt and he was always available to us all to offer his sagacious advice and guidance. He gave special emphasis on maintaining high moral and personal integrity.On a personal level, he gave a great deal of love and affection to my wife Lata and our daughter Sujata whenever we called on him whether at 7 RCR or his residence at Motilal Nehru Marg .Today, we feel orphaned. For us, there will be never anyone like him again. I join all in praying for eternal peace to the departed soul.I recall when I called him after being appointed 13th Finance Commission chairman. He said Finance Commission should be mindful of handling India's emerging ecological challenges as states have to face consequences of environmental degradation.I also met him as LoP, when I was working with Jaswant Singh in defence ministry.

He was convinced that our indirect tax regime is anti-exports and this bias will be cured by GST-like policies.Dr Singh was finance minister when I was petroleum secretary and Captain Satish Sharma was the minister and it was Manmohan Singh who gave full sport for liberalising the petroleum sector.

"Manmohan Singh: Gentle, but ready to take risks on vital national issues",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/manmohan-singh-gentle-but-ready-to-take-risks-on-vital-national-issues/articleshow/116696462.cms,"The last time I met Dr Manmohan Singh at his residence some days ago, he was frail but as always, his gracious self, thanking me for keeping him briefed on what was happening around the world. He was a good listener, raising sharp questions and offering well-considered comments. Since the end of his 10-year tenure as PM in 2014, I used to call on him at regular intervals and engaged him in lively conversations on the latest developments across the world. Even as he grew weak and beset with ailments, his mind was alert and nimble. It was as if my role as foreign secretary, and later as his special envoy in the PMO, had continued without interruption. He would always offer his own perspectives and share unexpected reminiscences about his encounters with the various movers and shakers in the world. He had a mischievous sense of humour accompanied by a gentle twinkle of the eyes. I will miss these memorable moments.Dr Singh was an under-rated PM, whose gentle manners and old-world courtesy obscured a keen intellect, strategic wisdom and a willingness to take risks if a matter of vital national interest was involved. This was evident when he pioneered the path-breaking economic reforms in 1990 as finance minister under PM Narasimha Rao. I was joint secretary in the PMO then, looking after external affairs and had a ring-side view of the pulls and pressures he was subjected to in pushing through the new economic policies. Much later in one of our conversations, he said that those days he carried a letter of resignation in his pocket since he never knew if and when a reversal may come. The same willingness to take a risk and be willing to sacrifice office was evident in the tenacity with which he pursued the India-US nuclear deal between 2005-08 even when his own party was ready to call it quits.As PM, Dr Singh deliberately sought opinions from a wide range of sources. He would emphasise the need to build a consensus around policies but would pick and choose what was important enough to take a stand on and where it would be best to let sleeping dogs lie. In retrospect, I think the choices he made were sound and judicious even though I may have found it frustrating at times. After the Mumbai attack in 2008, there was pressure on him to approve swift retaliation against Pakistan. He did consider it, but after meeting with chiefs of Armed forces, he decided against it and I think in retrospect rightly so.There would be occasions when he wouldn't follow my advice and I would be expected to deliver on whatever policy had been adopted. But never once did I feel that I would in any way suffer if I expressed a viewpoint that I knew he disagreed with. Once on a climate change-related issue I was inclined to take a strong position while he felt that India should be seen as ""part of the solution rather than as part of the problem."" I was somewhat obstinate in holding the view that it was the advanced countries that refused to be part of the solution and not India. Later, I felt that I had perhaps been out of line in expressing my disagreement. The next day, I apologised for my behaviour and said it was wrong of me to insist on a contrary position. Dr Singh smiled and reassured me, saying that if I started playing his own words back to him, there would not be much value in having me as an adviser. He was self-assured enough to handle opinions divergent to his own with grace and equanimity.During my eight years of serving under him, I was witness to the respect with which he was held by his foreign counterparts. His assessment of global economy was always sought at bilateral and multilateral summits. I can say from personal experience that President George Bush had developed a relationship of trust and affection with Dr Singh. At critical moments in the negotiation of Indo-US nuclear deal, it was Dr Singh's personal intervention with President Bush that helped clear the logjam. India gained international stature during his term as PM and his own reputation as a statesman and a wise-thinker was part of it.He said that history would judge him kindly. I think India was fortunate to have his gentle but firm hand at the wheel when it needed it most. Power exercised with empathy and a touch of grace achieves much more than a display of muscularity does. He did India proud.(Author is ex-foreign secretary and ex-special envoy of PM Manmohan Singh for Nuclear Affairs and Climate Change)","Dr Singh was an under-rated PM, whose gentle manners and old-world courtesy obscured a keen intellect, strategic wisdom and a willingness to take risks.

PM asks officials to find ways apartment dwellers in cities can get benefit of rooftop solar scheme,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/help-urban-flat-owners-avail-solar-scheme/articleshow/116694662.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pointing out that urban middle class families living in apartments are not getting the benefits of Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojna , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday asked officials to find ways out so that they can avail the scheme and cut down their electricity bills.The PM was chairing the web-based PRAGATI meeting with all secretaries in the central govt and chief secretaries from states. At present, people living in apartments can’t avail the scheme under which Centre provides subsidy of up to 40% of the cost of installing solar panels on rooftop as each individual beneficiary needs around 300 sq ft contiguous roof for generation of 300 units per month.Sources said Modi told officials that there is a need to find a solution to this problem for achieving saturation of the ambitious scheme. They added that when officials suggested that the builders may get land for installation of the solar system, the PM said this was not practical in urban areas.In an official release, the PMO said that Modi directed officials to enhance the capacity of installations of rooftops in the states and UTs by developing a quality vendor ecosystem. “He directed reducing the time required in the process, starting from demand generation to operationalisation of rooftop solar. He further directed states to adopt a saturation approach for villages, towns and cities in a phased manner,” the release said.PM also reviewed six Metro rail and two road connectivity and thermal power projects having a combined cost of more than Rs 1 lakh crore. Flagging concern over the delay in execution of projects, PM said these reflect how these lack proper planning, an official said.Officials said the PM raised concern over slow progress of Metro rail projects while pointing out that the authorities are well aware about the ground realities across urban areas when they plan and prepare projects. He advised officials to conduct ‘experience sharing’ workshops for cities where projects are under implementation or are in the pipeline, to capture the best practices and learnings.Reviewing the public grievances related to the banking and insurance sector, Modi asked the officials to focus on the quality of disposal of grievances. The financial services department said that 98% of the grievances had been resolved.",The PM was chairing the web-based PRAGATI meeting with all secretaries in the central govt and chief secretaries from states.

Travis Kelce Spends Thousands Of Dollars To Ensure His $6 Million Mansion Is Safe For Taylor Swift



Taylor Swift Is Very Concerned About Her Public Appearances And Safety



Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs, will be entering the playoffs next month but now Travis has gifted something special to his girlfriend, the global pop star, Taylor Swift on Christmas. As per Daily Mail, a source close to the couple has revealed that Travis has spent a lot of money on securing his house in Kansas City so that Taylor feels safe living in it. As per the source, Travis has now created a safety room which also features a man cave underground.This move of Travis comes shortly after his $6 million mansion in the Kansas City was burglarised and valuables worth $100,000 were stolen from his house. The source also revealed that Travis has gone the extra mile and hired security to look after his house throughout the day and night, especially when he is away playing for his team, the Kansas City Chiefs.But this is not all; as per the same source, Travis has made sure that all exit and entry points of this $6 million mansion of his, is secured by a highly innovative security system. The source said the reason for such safety measures is because the burglary became a “wakeup call” for both Taylor and Travis. As per the source, Taylor and Travis will now go the extra mile to protect themselves.As per sources, Travis is doing this, especially for Taylor so that she does not feel unsafe while living at his $6 million mansion of Travis’. A few weeks ago, as per reports, Taylor was actually planning to temporarily move into this mansion of Travis because she wanted to be closer to Travis while he prepares himself both mentally and physically for the play-off. As Taylor has now wrapped up her legendary Eras Tour and has not spoken about any new project, she wants to dedicate this time to Travis so that he feels comfortable and prepared as his team enters into the playoffs next month.As per Daily Mail, the source said, “As the holidays approach, Travis has gone all out to make sure that the security system and security personnel at his home is invincible. The best gift he could get both of them is safety and assurance that they will always have a good night’s sleep.""Taylor has also been pretty paranoid about her safety this season of NFL. She has only been spotted attending matches and cheering Travis when a match is held in the Kansas City Chiefs’ home stadium, the Arrowhead Stadium. She skips away games and was not seen yesterday as the Kansas City Chiefs played against the Pittsburgh Steelers. The reason for this is she feels safe at the Arrowhead Stadium since her personal security staff have done a thorough checking of this stadium.It looks like things are getting pretty serious between Tavis and Taylor as Travis continues to prove what a thoughtful boyfriend he is.Also Read: Travis Kelce opened up about his journey from struggling for “recognition” in 2020 and now he is breaking records and earning $34 million","Travis Kelce's $6 million mansion in the Kansas City was burglarised and valuables worth $100,000 were stolen from his house.

debate and Krishnan’s immigration stance

Role of AI and global talent in US leadership

The appointment of Sriram Krishnan as Senior White House Policy Advisor on Artificial Intelligence has ignited a fierce debate that pits Silicon Valley ’s tech titans against the populist MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement. At the heart of this clash is a growing tension over the future of US immigration policy and the role that foreign talent, particularly from countries like India, should play in shaping America’s technological landscape.David Sacks, a prominent Silicon Valley entrepreneur and ally of Krishnan, has once again stepped forward to defend his friend amid increasing criticism. In response to a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), which asked, ""Did any of yall vote for this Indian to run America?"" Sacks responded by emphasizing Krishnan’s qualifications and US citizenship.A community note on the post had already clarified that Krishnan, a US citizen, was selected by President-elect Donald Trump to advise on AI policy, but Sacks took the opportunity to rebut further: ""Sriram has been a US citizen for a decade. He’s not 'running America.' He’s advising on A.I. policy. He will have no influence over US immigration policy. These attacks have become crude, and not in the holiday spirit. I’m signing off now. Have a merry Christmas.""Sacks’ defense follows a string of attacks from far-right critics, including conservative commentator Laura Loomer. She has been vocal in her disapproval of Krishnan’s appointment, accusing him of betraying the “America First” agenda by advocating for immigration reforms that she claims would undermine American workers. Loomer’s criticisms focus on Krishnan’s support for removing country-specific caps on green cards, which she argues would prioritize foreign workers over American talent.However, Sacks and others have pushed back against these accusations, clarifying Krishnan’s stance on immigration. In a series of posts, Sacks explained that Krishnan’s position on green card reform is focused on removing country-specific caps, which currently create long wait times for applicants from countries like India, while applicants from other nations face little delay. ""Sriram didn’t say he wants to remove all caps on green cards. He said he wants to remove country caps on green cards,"" Sacks explained. ""Right now, every country in the world gets allocated the same number of green cards, no matter how many qualified applicants it has.""Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna also weighed in on the controversy, highlighting that Krishnan’s rise to a senior policy role in the US government reflects the values of American exceptionalism, not a threat to it. Khanna posted on X: ""You fools criticizing @sriramk as Indian born criticize Musk as South African born or Jensen as Taiwanese born. It is GREAT that talent around the world wants to come here, not to China, and that Sriram can rise to the highest levels. It’s called American exceptionalism.""Khanna’s remarks underscore a key point in the ongoing debate: the notion that the US benefits from attracting global talent, especially in the rapidly evolving fields of technology and AI, which require highly skilled workers.A major point of contention in this debate is the H-1B visa program, which allows US companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers, particularly in the fields of technology and engineering. Critics of the program, like Loomer, argue that it is often abused by companies seeking to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. On the other hand, supporters like Sriram Krishnan argue that such programs are essential for maintaining the US’s competitive edge in global tech.Krishnan has long advocated for reforms to the green card system, emphasizing a merit-based approach that prioritizes highly skilled workers rather than basing allocation on country quotas. Under the current system, applicants from high-demand countries, like India, can face decades-long waiting periods for green cards, while applicants from other nations face little to no delay. By removing country caps, Krishnan believes the US can create a more efficient system that better meets the needs of the country’s technology sector.As Senior Policy Advisor for AI, Krishnan’s focus will be on shaping US strategy in the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence. While his views on immigration are closely tied to this issue, the broader conversation about America’s future in technology cannot be separated from these debates. Figures like Sacks, Krishnan, and Ro Khanna argue that attracting and retaining top talent from around the world is critical for ensuring the US remains a global leader in AI and other high-tech sectors.The controversy, however, reflects a larger divide within the MAGA movement itself. On one side are the “tech titans” of Silicon Valley, who champion a more open, merit-based immigration system that encourages global competition and innovation. On the other side are the “MAGA farmers,” who believe that such policies undermine American workers and prioritize foreign interests over domestic prosperity.",Sriram Krishnan is a Senior White House Policy Advisor on Artificial Intelligence.

Adam Schefter Claps Back at Mike Florio Over Pete Carroll Coaching Speculation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/adam-schefter-claps-back-at-mike-florio-over-pete-carroll-coaching-speculation/articleshow/116692578.cms,"Carroll led the Seahawks to the franchise's lone Super Bowl title in 2012 (Image Source: Getty)

Can Pete Carroll Become The New Bears Head Coach? NFL Pundits Engage In Drama Over Speculation



GET UP | Adam Schefter LATEST on Pete Carroll Wants to Return to NFL, Eyes Bears HC Job

It’s no secret that the Chicago Bears, the New York Jets, and the New Orleans Saints are in the market for a head coach. Recently, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that former Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll has expressed interest in the Chicago Bears' head coach job, which will be available this coming offseason following Matt Eberflus's exit.However, NFL pundit Mike Florio was quick to call out Schefter for carrying out the announcement and implied that Schefter was doing PR work for the former Seattle Seahawks head coach. The drama continued as Schefter slammed Florio’s remarks and also questioned his sources.“Three teams — the Bears, Jets and Saints — are in the market for a head coach who can help reset their culture,” Schefter wrote. “Few coaches have been more effective than Carroll at doing just that.”Chicago has typically gone for defensive head coaches, but the team has struggled with developing quarterbacks. Carroll, however, managed to help QBs like Mark Sanchez and Carson Palmer and he has also worked with Russell Wilson and Geno Smith. The 73-year-old has led the Seahawks to the franchise's only Super Bowl title in 2012, so there’s no doubt he could be a great fir for Bears.Schefter further wrote, “In recent weeks, Carroll has begun discussing a return in the NFL and now is interested in doing it. He has not yet spoken with any teams yet, per sources, but he would welcome that chance. Although Carroll is 73, everybody who knows him knows that he has more energy than most.”ProFootballTalk’s Mike Florio, however, called out Schefter for sharing Carroll’s keenness to join the sidelines with the public. “Adam Schefter of ESPN.com reports that Carroll wants back in,” Florio wrote.“Which means, frankly, that Carroll’s agent has specifically told this to Schefter in the hopes that Schefter would broadcast it to the world, in the hopes of generating public opinion. Then, Carroll’s agent will owe Schefter big time. And that’s how the sausage gets made.”Florio continued, “It’s hard to fault Carroll’s agent for trying to use the media to get the word out about Carroll,” he said. “That’s the agent’s job. It’s not the media’s job, however, to engage in quid pro quo P.R. for coaching candidates.”The ProFootballTalk’s social media page appeared to shade Schefter. “Pete Carroll wants another NFL head coaching job, and his agent is wisely pulling the strings of a prominent media member to fuel the effort,” the X page of the platform wrote, clearly referring to Schefter’s report.Schefter took to social media to respond to Florio’s jabs. “Everything you say here is 100 percent wrong,” the ESPN news breaker wrote on X. “Keep up the guess work and Merry Christmas.”The Bears are set to host Carroll's former Seahawks team Thursday night in Chicago. As per reports, Carroll has begun discussing a return to the NFL, although he has not spoken with any teams yet.""I get asked a lot, so I'm pretty familiar with answering that I could coach tomorrow,"" Carroll said on 93.9 KJR last August. ""I'm physically in the best shape I've been in a long time. I'm ready to be ready to do all the activities that I'm doing and feeling really good about it. I could, but I'm not desiring it at this point.""Also Read : Patrick Mahomes’s Strong Reaction As WR Xavier Worthy Gets Flagged For Disorderly Conduct",ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that former Seattle Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll has expressed interest in the Chicago Bears' head coach job.

KOLKATA: A change in the heart of the City of Joy? Well, it has already started.The Esplanade area is undergoing significant transformation to accommodate the Purple Line's Joka-Esplanade Metro terminal station. Approximately 250-metre of Dufferin Road will be blocked, and an alternative stretch will be carved out of the long-distance bus stand in the same complex next to Rani Rashmoni Avenue.The existing bus stand will be dismantled, and hawkers will be relocated, transforming Kolkata's bustling commercial district, which dates back to the British era, into a more organised space in next three to four years.The makeover has already started.A part of the area, known to most by the other moniker - Dharmatala - already looks different because of the sprawling East-West Metro station opposite the LIC Building.One can barely trace the historic tram tracks that once characterised the area. The street cars no longer roll out. The East-West Metro (Green Line) has an interchange with the North-South (Blue) Line beneath J L Nehru Road at Esplanade.Further modifications are on the cards to ensure that the Purple Line travels underground from Kidderpore and terminates at Esplanade, emerging as the third Metro line to complete the much-awaited Metro hub.The B C Roy Market, next to one of the entrances of the North-South Line's Esplanade station, will soon be demolished.In the next eight months, Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL) will build a temporary market at the Kolkata Mounted Police grounds. RVNL is implementing the 14km Joka-Esplanade corridor, currently operating 8km from Joka to Majerhat, with 3km of the 5km underground section traversing the Maidan.The Army is the custodian of the Maidan, considered the city's lungs, spanning across the racecourse and the Esplanade.The market, also known as Bidhan market, has been considered by city planners and the state urban development department the biggest eyesore of the city's heart. It will be permanently reconstructed above the Purple Line's Esplanade station in three years and will return in a modern avatar.""The diaphragm or D-wall (underground boundary wall) of the 300m x 40m Esplanade station box starts from the Mounted Police paddock (already shifted near Shahid Minar) and ends at L20 bus (soon to be moved out to Curzon Park), via Dufferin Road,"" a railways official said.""A 250-metre stretch of Dufferin Road from Dorina Crossing, parallel to the existing B C Roy Market, will be required for the station construction,"" he said.Several sections of Esplanade have already been barricaded, including Mahohar Das Tarag, where the Purple Line's crossover will be constructed. The mammoth reservoir has been drained, and excavation has begun. The water body will be restored with enhanced features post-construction.RVNL officials and those from the state agencies are currently concentrating on the acquisition of Dufferin Road, L20 bus stand and the parking area for private long-distance buses. An inspection by all stakeholders was conducted recently.""Dufferin Road will be diverted through the location where the long-distance buses are now parked. While the L20 bus stand's relocation site has been identified as it belongs to the state transport department, there are no plans of allotting a space to private buses. Anyway, there are high court and apex court orders to shift all buses from the surface of Esplanade. RITES is preparing a detailed project report for the proposed Esplanade transport hub, which will incorporate the three Metro stations and underground parking lots for around 150 buses, plus a shopping plaza,"" a state government official said.B C Roy Market falls in the centre of the station box. One end of the box is at the Mounted Police paddock and the other at the pavement next to Dorina Crossing.""The crossing will be shifted a few metres away, beyond the boundary of the L20 bus stand. When the new Dufferin Road is built, cars and buses will be diverted through it to ensure smooth traffic flow up to Mayo Road,"" another official said.The historic Kidderpore Club, established in 1917 and currently squeezed between the market and entrance to the North-South Metro station, will relocate to a steel container on the Maidan near Park Street. It will join other Maidan clubs displaced by the Purple Line's underground station construction.""Shifting of the Kidderpore Club will begin shortly, following which the existing structure will be dismantled,"" the official added.","The Esplanade area is undergoing significant transformation to accommodate the Purple Line's Joka-Esplanade Metro terminal station.

Sam Konstas on Kohli altercation: 'I was doing my gloves, he accidentally bumped me'

Earlier this week, when news emerged that Virat Kohli and his family would shift to the United Kingdom, apart from the usual trolling endemic to social media in India, there was also a strange surge of support for the decision on social media.Most of it centered on how India was probably getting unsuitable to live in and those who could afford it should think about making the move. It was a marked departure from the backlash that actor Aamir Khan received a decade ago when he spoke on the growing sense of fear in the country which had even made his wife ask if they should think of moving out of India.The acceptance of Kohli's announcement, prompted by reasons different than those of the actor's, was an allusion to how things were in the country now and how those who could, were opting out.Then, as the Boxing Day Test dawned, Kohli, on his last tour to Australia by most estimates, went, and in a 60-degree veer off his path - as confirmed by well-informed sources - did that to the 19-year-old, floppy-bodied Aussie debutant, Sam Konstas .Hot-headed is a term associated with the young; but when it stays on, it can become tiresome. At the MCG, Konstas, on his own journey of blossoming in Test whites, casually telling off Kohli with a half-smile that only the young can manage in the face of the gravest of provocations, cruelly revealed how misguided the mid-pitch run-in was.Kohli's baiting, his response when Konstas addressed the indiscretion, beamed live to an early morning India, was awakening to most of us back home. So much like when someone jumps the queue in a government office, drives in the middle of the road while checking messages on his phone, or barges his SUV in at the toll gate line and dares you to do anything about it with an insolence that can be numbing. We've all been there, see it happen to us with sickening, everyday regularity.But is it Kohli alone? Because ,it gets amplified when Kohli does it, it is possible that it is symptomatic of a larger malaise afflicting us as a people, where delivery agents and Uber drivers quietly lament to whoever will listen of encountering a paying people that is shedding its skin and sense of empathy and compassion, of an institutional violence that shows the lower classes its place.Of how Indians regularly brawl on international flights with an entitlement and sense of privilege that is frightening, or basically how we take pride in our Indian-ness by being boorish and unapologetic about it. And that it wasn't like this not so long ago. There was an emotional wisdom that is rapidly eroding. Is it somewhat unfortunate that once the flag-bearer of a talented, brash India, Kohli ends up becoming emblematic of this latest Indian stereotype too? It stands out when the captain is a benign, easy-going character and the star performer is a gentle, diffident beast from a bygone India.Twelve years ago, on his first tour Down Under, Kohli had flipped the bird to a section of the Sydney crowd that was heckling him. It immediately made news, and in a twisted sense, endeared him to the Australians, cricket's original bullies. Kohli was 23 then, and clearly India's great batting and leadership hope and here was a young, confident Indian not afraid to give it back.Back then, this column defended Kohli's actions as a fitting riposte to this heckling, when his over-the-top, expletive-filled maiden Test century celebration in the Adelaide Test, shocked the purists. Under 'Kohli f*****g does it,' one tried to understand 'What made the Delhi boy so angry?'""Virat Kohli, 23, was all good batting and bad language. It made for both comforting and unsettling viewing,"" we said, the talking point being his 'rage' at reaching triple figures. While Sunil Gavaskar called it ""school kid"" temperament, ""others,"" the story read, ""would be probably confused - whether to let their kids watch a rare flowering or reach for the child lock on the TV?""Much water has flown since 2012. It is also time long enough to understand that youthful anger is not the same as wearisome bullying. Those supporting Kohli's decision to leave India, now in the evening of a storied career, would have found this one hard to defend because it is more of the same. The rest, in true patriot fashion, would be busy slagging off Ricky Ponting for calling out Kohli. Nothing much seems changed, yet a lot is not the same anymore.","Virat Kohli and his family will move to the United Kingdom. Kohli is known for being hot-headed, but when it stays on, it can become tiresome. It is possible that it is symptomatic of a larger malaise afflicting us as a people.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116698728,imgsize-29192,width-400,resizemode-4/116698728.jpg"

A mystery seller is asking $200 million for an empty waterfront lot next door to the properties Jeff Bezos bought in South Florida.The roughly 1.84 acre lot (0.74 hectare) is located at Indian Creek, a man-made barrier island that’s been dubbed “Billionaire Bunker.” Ilya Reznik , who’s brokering the transaction, declined to identify the seller but said they are “willing to negotiate” on price. “I’ve already had a couple of showings and obviously the buyer is going to be a billionaire,” Reznik said.Even if the land ultimately fails to sell for $200 million, Reznik believes it will still set a record for the region. That’s in part because of the Amazon.com Inc. founder, who’s bought three properties in Indian Creek since 2023, including two next door to the lot that’s now for sale. On his third purchase earlier this year, Bezos paid roughly $87 million.“I think $200 million is a big number but I’m confident that in the end the buyer will pay a little extra because Bezos is a neighbor,” Reznik said. “Those prices just didn’t exist before he came to Indian Creek.”The empty land was purchased for $27.5 million in 2018 by SMM Sunny Holding LLC , a Delaware company, records show. Reznik said the current owner drew pre-designs for a 25,000 square-feet (2,322.6 square meters) estate on the property that will be available to the buyer.The listing was first reported by the New York Post.","A mystery seller is asking $200 million for an empty waterfront lot next door to the properties Jeff Bezos bought in South Florida.
