Explained: Why India-EU 'Mother Of All Deals' Matters As Trade Talks Enter Final High Stakes Phase

NEW DELHI: In a move that may help India's high-emission industries navigate the EU's carbon border tax regime by adopting clean manufacturing processes in due course, Niti Aayog, the govt think tank, has come up with comprehensive roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium and cement sectors. This will also contribute to the country achieving its long-term net-zero emission (carbon neutrality) goal for 2070.The EU's carbon border tax -- Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) -- is a tool to put a price on high-emission goods such as cement, aluminium, iron & steel and fertilisers that enter the 27 EU nations.If India does not take steps to decarbonise these sectors, they will continue to attract tariff burden in the form of carbon border tax, impacting the country’s exports.The decarbonisation roadmaps for cement and aluminium, released by Niti Aayog last Wednesday, will also serve as reference manuals for India to decarbonise other sectors, in sync with the country's climate action commitments under the Paris Agreement.The Aayog’s report shows that cement manufacturing, a significant source of carbon emissions, contributed roughly 2.4 GtCO2e of emissions worldwide in 2023.India’s production of cement resulted in roughly 246 MtCO2e of emissions, which was around 6% of national GHG emissions.Under the decarbonisation strategy, as suggested by the roadmap, the cement sector will reduce its carbon intensity from 0.63 tCO₂e per tonne of cement to approximately 0.09-0.13tCO₂e per tonne by 2070.To enable deep decarbonisation in this sector, the roadmap proposes to prioritise the use of refuse-derived fuels, clinker substitution, scale-up of Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and effective implementation of carbon credit trading scheme.Similarly, the decarbonisation roadmap for aluminium sector identifies a three-phase solution: transition to renewable energy-round the clock (RE-RTC), enhanced grid connectivity in the short term and adoption of nuclear power in the medium term, and long-term integration of CCUS.The report reveals that production of aluminium accounted for about 2.8% of India's total GHG emissions in 2023.",Niti Aayog has come up with comprehensive roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium and cement sectors. This will also contribute to the country achieving its long-term net-zero emission (carbon neutrality) goal for 2070. The EU's carbon border tax -- Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) -- is a tool to put a price on high-emission goods.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127596505,imgsize-26782,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo-3.jpg"

Trump hikes tariffs on South Korea to 25%; cites legislative delay in enacting 'historic' trade deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-hikes-tariffs-on-south-korea-to-25-cites-legislative-delay-in-enacting-historic-trade-deal/articleshow/127581374.cms,"Image: IANS, AP

'Europe Will Retaliate': America's European Allies FIRE BACK At Trump Over Greenland Tariff Attack

US president Donald Trump announced on Monday that he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent, accusing the ally’s legislature of failing to uphold its trade agreement with the United States.Trump added that South Korea’s legislature has not approved the trade deal he and President Lee Je Myung agreed to on July 30, 2025, and reaffirmed during his visit on October 29, 2025, questioning why it has not been ratified.""Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos, Lumber, Pharma, and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS, from 15% to 25%."" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.""Our Trade Deals are very important to America. In each of these Deals, we have acted swiftly to reduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to. We, of course, expect our Trading Partners to do the same,"" Trump added.South Korea has been moving to implement a deal announced with Washington in November aimed at reducing US tariffs on its exports. More recently, Seoul has been in talks with US officials to clarify its investigation into US-based e-commerce company Coupang (CPNG.N), which was launched following a major data leak, as cited by Reuters.South Korea is a key trading partner for the United States, consistently ranking among the top 10 sources of US imports. American companies and consumers import nearly $150 billion worth of goods from South Korea each year.In July, Trump announced a trade deal with South Korea’s president, but progress stalled for months amid disagreement over an investment pledge sought by the United States. The two leaders later finalized the agreement in October during Trump’s trip to Asia, including a commitment to invest $350 billion in the United States.In November, the White House and the South Korean government released a ""fact sheet"" outlining the deal, which was intended to move the agreement forward, as cited by NBC News.The agreement included reduced tariffs for both countries, capping US import duties at 15 per cent. This marked a rollback from the 25 per cent tariff rate announced earlier in 2025 on South Korea’s ""Liberation Day"" in April, a move that had unsettled markets.Trump’s latest tariff announcement follows at least three previous threats that were never carried out. These included a proposed 10 per cent tariff on Canada after Ontario ran an anti-tariff World Series ad, threatened tariffs on European countries over Greenland, and a 100 per cent tariff on Canada that was announced last week.","US president Donald Trump announced on Monday that he is raising tariffs on South Korean imports of autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25 per cent.

Old Vs New Income Tax Regime: How Much More Tax Are You Saving Over Years?

These charts by EY have been prepared on the following assumptions:

Section 80C deduction (maximum Rs 1.5 lakh) considered under the old tax regime. Other deductions/ exemptions such as medical insurance, home loan interest, house rent allowance are not considered. Standard deduction of Rs 50000 under the old regime and standard deduction as notified from time to time (Nil, Rs 50,000, Rs 75,000) under new regime is considered.

Each year the Budget speech is eagerly watched and listened to by the common man and middle class taxpayers, seeking answer to a simple query: will my tax burden reduce this year? Even finance ministers presenting the Budget are aware of the populist impact of their speech, in case tax relief measures are announced.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on February 1. Will tax slab and tax rate changes be introduced? Sitharaman, who will present her ninth budget, is also the FM who introduced the new income tax regime back in 2020.The choice between the old and the new income tax regime is an important one and every year, taxpayers carefully calculate the tax liability under each before deciding on which one to opt for.Over the years, the new income tax regime has seen several changes, and the tax liability under it has progressively come down at various salary levels, and it has become increasingly more attractive compared to the old regime.In her Budget speech in 2020, FM Nirmala Sitharaman explained the rationale for the introduction of a new income tax regime: the need for simpler compliance.“...The Income Tax Act is riddled with various exemptions and deductions which make compliance by the taxpayer and administration of the Income Tax Act by the tax authorities a burdensome process. It is almost impossible for a taxpayer to comply with the Income-tax law without taking help from professionals,” she said.Hence, a new and simplified income tax regime was introduced to provide “significant relief” to individual taxpayers. The idea was for a tax regime that offers reduced rates for taxpayers who forgo certain deductions and exemptions.The biggest takeaway was that the 30% tax slab under the new regime kicked in at an income above Rs 15 lakh compared to Rs 10 lakh under the old tax regime.At that time individuals under both regimes earning income up to Rs 5 lakh did not have to pay tax with the benefit of Section 87A.FM Sitharaman explained the gains: In the new tax regime, substantial tax benefit will accrue to a taxpayer depending upon exemptions and deductions claimed by him. For example, a person earning Rs 15 lakh in a year and not availing any deductions etc. will pay only Rs 1,95,000 as compared to Rs 2,73,000 in the old regime. Thus his tax burden shall be reduced by 78,000 in the new regime. He would still be the gainer in the new regime even if he was taking deduction of Rs 1.5 Lakh under various sections of Chapter- VI-A of the Income Tax Act under the old regime.Over the years, the government has introduced substantial changes under the new income tax regime - introduction of standard deduction benefits, higher standard deduction limit of Rs 75,000, evolving tax slabs and tax rates.In the Union Budget 2023, tax slabs under the new regime were further tweaked to:Importantly the following big changes were introduced:In the interim budget of 2024, the standard deduction under the new regime was raised to Rs 75,000.Last year, FM Sitharaman’s Budget brought sweeping changes in the new income tax regime, making it even more attractive for taxpayers. With higher rebate, tax outgo on income up to Rs 12 lakh was reduced to ZERO!Explaining the journey, Sitharaman said, “Right after 2014, the ‘Nil tax’ slab was raised to Rs 2.5 lakh, which was further raised to Rs 5 lakh in 2019 and to Rs 7 lakh in 2023. This is reflective of our government's trust on the middle-class tax payers. I am now happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable up to income of Rs 12 lakh (i.e. average income of Rs 1 lakh per month other than special rate income such as capital gains) under the new regime. This limit will be Rs 12.75 lakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of Rs 75,000.”Income tax slabs under the new regime saw big changes, with the 30% tax slab now kicking in for incomes above Rs 24 lakh, as against Rs 15 lakh earlier.One noteworthy point is that in all these years since the introduction of the new income tax regime, the old tax regime with higher deductions and exemptions but also higher tax rates continues to function, though without any changes. The intent of the government is clear: with the new tax regime made the default regime, and all changes and benefits of lower taxes, taxpayers are being urged to shift to it.But, how much is the tax benefit under the new tax regime compared to the old regime? The tax outgo has changed in the last 5 years, and at various income levels, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down substantially compared to the old tax regime.For a better understanding, we take a look at how tax outgo has changed over the last five years at various income levels of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 20 lakh, and Rs 40 lakh.If for an income level of Rs 10 lakh, you had to pay Rs 75,400 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 78,000 in FY21 to Rs 54,600 in FY24, Rs 44,200 in FY25 to NIL in FY26! It continues to be Rs 75,400 under the old regime.Similarly, if for an income level of Rs 20 lakh, you had to pay Rs 366,600 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 351,000 in FY21 to Rs 296,400 in FY24, Rs 278,200 in FY25 to Rs 192,400 in FY26! So in FY26, if you opt for the new regime, instead of the old, your tax savings would be Rs 174,200!The impact is also visible at higher income levels. If for an income level of Rs 40 lakh, you had to pay Rs 990,600 in FY21 under the old tax regime, the tax outgo under the new regime has come down from Rs 975,000 in FY21 to Rs 920,400 in FY24, Rs 902,200 in FY25 to Rs 787,800 in FY26! So in FY26, if you opt for the new regime, instead of the old, your tax savings would be Rs 202,800!The above charts are broadly indicative, and the tax outgo will depend on your income level, the amount of deductions and exemptions you claim. For an income of over Rs 12 lakh, and above a certain amount of deductions and exemptions, the old regime may be more suitable at various salary levels.Hence, while the above examples offer a clear picture on how the tax benefits have increased over years under the new regime, it is important to calculate the total amount of deductions and exemptions you avail for a better understanding.As an example, at the current tax slabs in the old and new regime, if you have a gross income of more than Rs 24.75 lakh, then the old regime makes sense only if your total deductions and exemptions are over Rs 8 lakh.This level of deductions and exemptions is for the 30% tax slab. It will vary for incomes below Rs 24 lakh.Amarpal Chadha, Tax Partner at EY India tells TOI, “Over the past few years, the new tax regime has clearly boosted the take‑home pay of most salaried taxpayers due to the rising basic exemption limits and reduced slab rates. In FY 2020-21, for an income of Rs 10 lakh, the tax liability under the new tax regime was slightly higher compared to the old tax regime. However, over the subsequent five years (FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26), the reforms have reversed this picture, resulting in savings of Rs 75,400 in FY 2025-26 under the new tax regime as compared to the old tax regime. ”""For an income of Rs 20 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, the savings in FY 2025-26 are approximately Rs 1.74 lakh and Rs 2.02 lakh respectively as compared to the old tax regime. Now, if we compare savings under the new tax regime over the six-year period (FY 2020-21 to FY 2025-26), savings have risen significantly — around Rs 78,000 at an income of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 1.58 lakh at Rs 20 lakh and Rs 1.87 lakh at Rs 40 lakh. With substantial taxpayers going ahead with the default/new tax regime, further slab adjustments in Budget 2026 could accelerate this trend,” he adds.While a certain percentage of taxpayers continue to benefit from the old tax regime, for example those who claim high levels of House Rent Allowance, or those who have a home loan, over 70% of tax returns filed for AY 2024-25 were under the new regime. Tax experts expect more taxpayers to switch to the new income tax regime in the ongoing financial year, with the Rs 12 lakh zero tax level prompting many to shift.However, experts note that the government may look to introduce some popular deductions and exemptions such as Section 80C and home loan interest benefits to incentivise savings and housing.","Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget on February 1. She is also the FM who introduced the new income tax regime back in 2020. Over the years, the tax liability under it has progressively come down at various salary levels.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127475885,imgsize-113754,width-400,resizemode-4/old-vs-new-income-tax-regime.jpg"

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026

No hope of US visa situation improving: Immigration experts



NEW DELHI: No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year and new interview dates are being deferred to 2027, creating major disruptions for Indian professionals working in the US. Visa offices in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad & Kolkata no longer have regular interview slots available.Immigration experts said there is no hope of the situation getting better. The US state department website simply shows 'not available' as the waiting period for next available appointment for interview required for petition-based (H, L, O, P, Q) visas in many places across the world, including Kolkata and Delhi.Those who had their interview dates in Jan & Feb also received emails for their respective consulates that their dates have been moved to April-May 2027.The pile-up is happening with the Trump administration reworking the H1-B programme. On Dec 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had published new rules for FY 2027.The annual cap of 85,000 visas remains unchanged, including 20,000 reserved for applicants with US postgraduate degrees.Apart from this, there have been overall changes in the Trump’s ever-tightening visa policies. US has introduced mandatory social media screening for visa applicants. The added scrutiny increased processing time per applicant and reduced the number of interviews consulates can conduct each day. The US no longer allows visa stamping in third countries, barring a few exceptions. That means the entire demand has to be met by consulates in India for Indians and has added to delays.Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said she did not hear about any new visa interview slots opening for India in the last 50 days. Neumann said H-1Bs who are in the US should not even try to get an appointment for visa stamping in India.“They are not in any hurry to give you a visa. They are trying to deny visas whenever they can. It is a completely different world from what we saw during the Biden administration. This administration does not want to give you visa,” Neumann said.Amid the delay in stamping, US State Department is also revoking visas prudentially, and H-4 visa holders are also getting their visas revoked because of their H-1B spouses.","No new H-1B stamping dates seem to be available this calendar year.

Muslim-led startups filling gaps in India’s economy



NEW DELHI: On most evenings in New York, or Delhi-NCR, Ruha Shadab sits across a laptop screen, explaining professional etiquette to a roomful of Muslim women. Some wear hijabs. Some don’t. What unites them is not appearance. They are learning how to enter professional spaces that were never designed with them in mind. The session is about LinkedIn summaries, interview posture and how to talk about ambition. Many are the first in their families preparing for formal work.Far away in Jharkhand’s Garhwa, Nadim Iqbal Khan scans stock-market data on his phone. He’s checking which listed companies pass a religious test: No alcohol. No gambling. Limited debt. No interest-heavy income (Riba). Mohd Sufyan’s AzanGuru in Delhi beams Quran tutors into iPads — a technology-led learning app for modern learners.And in Mumbai, Nidah Merchant devises “modest” outfits, empowering women to enter public pools or gyms without constant self-surveillance, even as Mohammad Saif Nadeem in Pune manages Qurbani bookings over WhatsApp.None describe what they are building as “political” or as “resistance”.They’re solving ordinary problems — how to work, invest, dress, marry and practise faith in an urban, app-mediated life.Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through “lack” — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes. That’s slowly changing. According to Periodic Labour Force Survey, India’s female labour force participation stood at about 31.7% in 2023–24. For Muslim women, it was around 21%, up from about 15% in 2021–22, according to ministry of minority affairs. These numbers shape decisions.When Ruha Shadab returned to India after studying abroad, she often found herself the only Muslim woman in professional rooms. Being Muslim in Saudi Arabia was not a distinguishing feature. Here, it shaped first impressions. The contrast stayed with her. “I realised quickly that I was being read before I was being heard,” she told TOI. She said she sometimes detected a hiring bias.In 2019, while studying at Harvard University, Shadab founded Led By, to help Muslim women transition from education to employment. The programme focuses on women aged 18–30, college students or graduates from lower middle-income households. About 1,200 women have completed Led By’s programmes and over 50,000 have been supported. Many are first-generation professionals. Economic participation also depends on money. For decades, many Indian Muslims kept their distance from stock markets. Interest-based income raised religious doubts. Trading felt uncomfortably close to speculation. Nadim Iqbal Khan, 29, said, “People don’t call me asking how to get rich. They call asking if something is halal.” The questions are about permissibility, not profits.Since Covid-19, volume of queries has multiplied. He explains investing as “shared ownership” in a business, where both profit and loss are borne, making the income permissible within Islamic frameworks. And follows Sharia-compliant screening frameworks used globally. Roughly half of India’s listed companies qualify, he says. Indices such as the Nifty Shariah and BSE Shariah already track them. “Muslims have stayed behind financially because of lack of guidance. That gap can be fixed.”If money has moved into markets, marriage has moved into apps. As families became more nuclear, traditional “rishta networks” thinned. In 2019, Delhi-based entrepreneur Hammad Rahman launched NikahForever, a Muslim matrimony platform designed for marriage, not dating. Users wanted cultural familiarity, privacy and clear intent. Families wanted safeguards. NikahForever built its platform around these expectations. Today, it has over 2 million registered users in India and away.Clothing carries similar negotiations. For Mumbai’s Nidah Merchant, modest fashion was never a statement. It was logistical. Gym wear. Swim wear. Travel clothes. Constant adjustment. When modest fashion gained visibility on social media, Merchant realised this struggle was widely shared. The need, she says, was functional, not ideological. She launched Némah, a modest activewear and swimwear brand for women in 2020 to design clothes suited to Indian conditions.Education completes the picture. During the pandemic, Quran learning moved online but remained fragmented. AzanGuru, founded by Muhammad Sufyan Saif and Mohammed Imran in 2022, sought to digitise Quran learning. The platform has crossed 5 lakh downloads.Taken together, these ventures form an economy shaped less by ideology than by need, filling gaps where the mainstream falls short.","Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through ‘lack’ — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes.

It will propel trade and investment between both sides,"" Agrawal said on Monday on the agreement that has been under negotiation for more than 18 years, but got a lease of life in 2024. US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs are seen to have pushed both sides to engage more aggressively to finalise the agreement, factoring in each other's concerns in sectors such as agriculture and dairy.The agreement may, however, take a few months to be ratified and is likely to be implemented in early 2027, officials said. Over the next two weeks, the two sides will put together a cleaner text of the agreement, which will be legally vetted over the next 5-6 months before it is signed. The agreement will then have to be ratified by the European Parliament, but officials explained that it will not have to be approved by each member-state of the 27-nation bloc since it does not contain ""mixed competence"".India is expected to get zero-duty access to several key product segments such as textiles, leather and marine products, in return for concessions in sectors such as automobiles and wines and spirits.In a TV interview, European commissioner for trade and economic security MaroS Šefcovic said the aim was to see full or partial tariff reduction on 97-99% of goods, while factoring in sensitivity in sectors such as agriculture and dairy. He said the trading bloc was looking for a ""combination"" of lower tariffs on a specified number of vehicles along with phased reduction. He said India was a smaller market compared to EU, but growing rapidly, and auto was an important sector for both sides. He said it is a sector that is complementary given that India makes small cars, while European automakers focused on larger and technologically more advanced vehicles. ""We are looking at the way which would help us find solutions, create new supply chains and make an even better business case for European car makers, while opening new possibilities for cooperation,"" Šefcovic said.He underlined the broader strategic intent of the FTA in building resilient supply chains, reducing risky dependencies and creating jobs in India and EU.","India and the European Union have concluded negotiations for a free trade agreement.

Beyond the rulebook

When the University Grants Commission ( UGC ), the statutory body under the Union education ministry that regulates universities and colleges, notified its Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026, it introduced a new set of rules that will apply across campuses nationwide.The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff.On paper, the objective sounds straightforward. It seeks to ensure that no student, teacher, or staff member is denied dignity or opportunity in higher education because of identity.In practice, however, the new regulations reach deep into the everyday functioning of campuses, shaping everything from admissions and hostels to classrooms, committees, and corridors.The 2026 framework replaces the UGC’s earlier equity rules and shifts the burden of compliance squarely onto institutions and their leadership.Heads of universities and colleges are no longer just administrators; they are now the first line of accountability in preventing and responding to discrimination. New structures, new reporting mechanisms, and strict timelines are written into the rulebook, backed by the threat of serious penalties for non-compliance.Yet, as has often been the case with regulations aimed at correcting long-standing social inequities, the real questions lie beneath the stated intent.How wide is the definition of discrimination? How much discretion do institutional committees enjoy? What happens when complaints are contested, or when the process itself causes harm? And how prepared are campuses to balance speed, sensitivity, and fairness? And is it discriminatory against the non-reserved General Class students?The objective clause sets the tone for the entire framework. It seeks to eradicate discrimination only on specified grounds like religion, race, caste, gender, place of birth, and disability.The word “only” is significant, as it confines the scope of the regulations to discrimination based on specified identity grounds, excluding general grievances or academic disputes.At the same time, the regulations explicitly prioritise certain groups, including:This prioritisation reflects a remedial approach, focusing on historically disadvantaged communities, while formally keeping the protection available to all stakeholders.The definitions section is one of the most consequential parts of the regulations.“Discrimination” is defined broadly to include not only explicit acts but also implicit, indirect, or structural forms of unfair treatment.It extends to actions that have the effect of impairing equality or violating human dignity, even if discriminatory intent is not overt.“Caste-based discrimination” is defined as discrimination against members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.Importantly, the regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.“Equity” is defined as providing a level playing field for all stakeholders with respect to rights and opportunities.Together, these definitions significantly expand the interpretive space available to committees tasked with examining complaints. At the same time, the breadth of these definitions leaves substantial discretion with institutional committees.Terms such as implicit or indirect discrimination, structural unfairness, and impairment of dignity are not further qualified in the regulations, offering limited guidance on thresholds of proof or standards of assessment.This ambiguity may allow flexibility in addressing complex forms of disadvantage, but it also opens the door to uneven interpretation across institutions, particularly in contested cases where intent is disputed or where academic or administrative decisions intersect with allegations of discrimination.Every higher education institution (HEI) is required to establish an Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC). The Centre is tasked with a wide range of functions, including policy implementation, counselling, outreach, awareness-building, and grievance handling.Smaller colleges that lack sufficient faculty strength are allowed to rely on the EOC of their affiliating university, ensuring that the requirement applies uniformly across institutions.The EOC is also expected to coordinate with civil society organisations, local administration, police authorities, and legal services bodies. This expansive mandate reflects an attempt to situate campus equity within a broader social and legal ecosystem.Each Equal Opportunity Centre (EOC) must have an Equity Committee, constituted by the head of the institution. Its composition is carefully structured to include:The regulations mandate representation of women, SCs, STs, OBCs, and persons with disabilities within the committee. The committee is required to meet at least twice a year and to review action taken on complaints.The committee’s core role is to inquire into allegations of discrimination and submit a report with findings and recommendations.Beyond formal committees, the regulations introduce two novel mechanisms: Equity Squads and Equity Ambassadors.Equity Squads are smaller, mobile bodies tasked with maintaining vigilance and visiting “vulnerable spots” on campus. Equity Ambassadors are designated individuals in departments, hostels, libraries, and other units who act as nodal points for reporting violations.These mechanisms signal a shift towards continuous monitoring, rather than complaint-driven intervention alone. While intended as preventive measures, they also raise questions about overreach, informal surveillance, and the potential chilling effect on campus interactions.Every HEI must operate a round-the-clock Equity Helpline. Any stakeholder in distress due to discrimination can access it, and confidentiality of the complainant’s identity must be maintained if requested.Where a prima facie case under penal law is disclosed, the information is to be forwarded to the police. This provision effectively links campus grievance mechanisms with the criminal justice system, raising the stakes for both complainants and the accused.The procedure for handling discrimination complaints is tightly time-bound.An aggrieved person can report an incident through an online portal, email, written complaint, or the helpline. Upon receipt, the Equity Committee must meet within 24 hours to decide on the next steps.The committee has 15 working days to submit its report, after which the head of the institution has seven working days to initiate action. In cases involving the head of the institution, the coordinator of the EOC chairs the inquiry.While the timelines aim to ensure prompt action, they also raise concerns about whether complex allegations can be examined thoroughly within such compressed periods.Any person aggrieved by the Equity Committee’s report can appeal to the Ombudsperson within 30 days. The Ombudsperson may appoint an amicus curiae and is expected to dispose of appeals within another 30 days.This appellate mechanism provides an external check on institutional processes. However, it primarily addresses procedural correctness, rather than offering substantive relief for non-tangible harms such as reputational damage or mental distress.The regulations empower the UGC to monitor compliance through inspections, information requests, and national-level committees. Non-compliant institutions face serious consequences, including:These penalties indicate that equity compliance is not optional, but a condition for institutional legitimacy.Despite the breadth of the framework, the regulations are silent on several issues that are likely to shape their reception and operation on campuses. While they lay out detailed mechanisms for receiving and processing complaints, they do not spell out comparable safeguards for non-reserved individuals who may be accused of discrimination, particularly in cases where allegations are contested or later found to be unsubstantiated.There is no explicit provision dealing with malicious or knowingly false complaints, nor is there any guidance on how institutions should distinguish between bona fide grievances and those driven by personal disputes, academic disagreements, or animosity unrelated to identity-based discrimination. The absence of such clarity places a significant burden on institutional committees to exercise judgment, increasing the risk of inconsistent outcomes across campuses.The regulations also do not acknowledge the mental and reputational impact that the complaint process itself can have on the accused. There are no provisions for interim confidentiality for respondents, counselling support during the inquiry, or mechanisms to repair reputational harm if allegations are ultimately not upheld. In tightly knit academic environments, even the initiation of an inquiry can have lasting professional and psychological consequences, irrespective of the final outcome.Another area of concern relates to timelines. While the emphasis on speed is intended to ensure prompt redressal for complainants, the compressed schedule may limit the ability of committees to examine complex factual disputes, especially those involving academic judgment or administrative discretion. In such cases, the pressure to meet deadlines could inadvertently prioritise procedural closure over substantive fairness.The linkage of campus mechanisms with law enforcement, particularly through the equity helpline, further raises the stakes. While intended to ensure swift action in serious cases, this provision may deter open academic engagement or encourage defensive decision-making by administrators wary of escalation beyond the institution.Historically, similar regulatory frameworks in higher education and other sectors have tended to correct outcomes through appellate or judicial review, while leaving the harms caused during the process largely unaddressed. Appeals may overturn findings or set aside penalties, but they rarely compensate for stress, stigma, or disruption suffered in the interim. In the absence of explicit procedural safeguards, this gap is likely to remain.Taken together, these omissions do not negate the objectives of the regulations, but they point to areas where further clarification or supplementary guidelines may be required. How these concerns are handled, whether through institutional practice, regulatory advisories, or future amendments, will play a key role in determining whether the framework strengthens trust on campuses or becomes a source of sustained friction.Vice-chancellors also said the new framework marks a shift from advisory guidelines to enforceable obligations.The question arises because the regulations draw explicit distinctions by prioritising protections for historically disadvantaged groups, while applying a common framework to all stakeholders.Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, but past judicial practice has allowed differential treatment where it is linked to a legitimate objective and applied through non-arbitrary procedures. In that sense, the regulations are framed as remedial rather than exclusionary, focusing on identity-based disadvantage in higher education.However, concerns stem less from the stated objective and more from the structure of implementation. The wide discretion granted to institutional committees, combined with broadly worded definitions of discrimination and the absence of explicit safeguards for those accused, particularly from the unreserved General Class, has led some to question whether outcomes could vary unevenly across campuses. Critics argue that unequal application, rather than unequal text, could create situations where similarly placed individuals are treated differently in practice.The 2026 equity regulations introduce a far-reaching framework for addressing discrimination and inclusion in higher education, expanding the role of institutional mechanisms and regulatory oversight. They formalise a set of duties, procedures, and enforcement tools that universities and colleges will be required to follow.However, the way the framework functions in practice will depend on how institutions interpret and apply its provisions. The manner in which discretion is exercised, timelines are enforced, and contested complaints are handled will shape whether the regulations operate as intended or generate friction within campuses.","Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations, 2026. The regulations govern how colleges and universities must prevent, identify, and respond to discrimination involving students, teachers, and staff. The regulation does not create separate categories of discrimination for different groups but subsumes them within a common framework.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127388943,imgsize-100582,width-400,resizemode-4/ugc.jpg"
Decline of Himalayan rivers could trigger nuclear war: UK report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/decline-of-himalayan-rivers-could-trigger-nuclear-war-uk-report/articleshow/127567910.cms,"ANI file photo

LONDON: The decline of rainforests and glacier-fed rivers could lead to global competition for food and water as early as the 2030s, UK intelligence chiefs have warned, adding that the decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan, potentially leading to nuclear war The British govt report warns that ecosystem degradation is occurring across all regions and “every critical ecosystem is on a pathway to collapse”.There is a realistic possibility that some ecosystems (SE Asia coral reefs, boreal forests and the Himalayas) will start to collapse from 2030, and others (rainforests and mangroves) start to collapse from 2050, it states.“Severe degradation or collapse would drive displacement of millions, change global weather patterns, increase global food and water scarcity, and drive geopolitical competition for remaining resources,” the 14-page report said.The impacts will range from crop failures, intensified natural disasters and infectious disease outbreaks to conflict within and between states. Migration and organised crime will rise and terrorist groups will exploit political instability, it said.The report, titled “Global Biodiversity Loss, Ecosystem Collapse and National Security”, was published by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).But TOI understands it was actually put together by the Joint Intelligence Committee, which coordinates MI5 and MI6. The report assesses how biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse impact UK national security and warns that the UK’s food security will be under threat as Britain imports 40% of its food and is not self-sufficient in fertilisers. “Both existing (plant pre-breeding, regenerative agriculture) and emerging technologies (AI, lab grown protein, insect protein) offer potential solutions,” it states.According to the UK Times newspaper, the report was due to be published last autumn but “was blocked by No. 10 for being too negative”. An “abridged version” has been published following a freedom of information request. The Times claims to have seen the “full internal version”, which states that the degradation of rainforests in the Congo and the drying up of rivers fed by the Himalayas could drive people to flee to Europe, leading to “more polarised and populist politics in the UK” and putting “additional pressure on already strained national infrastructure”.The internal version also warns of the risk of nuclear war from the decline of Himalayan rivers.“Critical ecosystems that support major global food production areas and impact global climate, water and weather cycles are the most important for UK national security. The Amazon and Congo rainforests, boreal forests, the Himalayas and Southeast Asia’s coral reefs and mangroves are particularly significant for the UK,” it states.The report notes that Britain’s large South Asian diaspora could make the UK an attractive destination for people from the region.“Countries best placed to adapt are those that invest in ecosystem protection and restoration, and resilient and efficient food systems. Restoration of some ecosystems (tropical forests) is more feasible than others (coral reefs, Himalayas),” it states.A Defra spokesperson said: “Nature underpins our security, prosperity, and resilience and understanding the threats we face from biodiversity loss is crucial to meeting them head on.”"," decline of Himalayan rivers will “almost certainly escalate tensions” between China, India and Pakistan.

Watch: Padma Shri 2026 Awardees Beam With Joy as Lifelong Work Gets Honoured

NEW DELHI: Prominent agriculture scientist Ashok Kumar Singh who developed over 25 rice varieties and former vice-chancellor of the Bihar-based Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Gopal Ji Trivedi, are among nine persons associated with farm and allied sector selected for this year's Padma Shri award.Trivedi helped farmers cultivate makhana (fox nuts) in a big way, and popularise this nutrient-dense, low-calorie, and gluten-free snack among health conscious Indians.Besides Singh, former director of the ICAR Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), there are four other scientists and four farmers in the list of awardees who not only helped farm growth through their research and innovative farm practices but also contributed towards improving livelihood of farmers in different parts of the country.Rice varieties including different Pusa Basmati and non-Basmati varieties, developed by Singh and other ICAR-IARI scientists, have significantly increased rice output over the years and helped India earn roughly around Rs 50,000 crore annually from Basmati rice export.On the other hand, the country's first genome-edited rice varieties - 'DRR Dhan 100 (Kamala)' and 'Pusa DST Rice 1' - which Singh co-developed with other scientists of the ICAR's institutes will not only enhance output but also save water and reduce greenhouse gas emission during cultivation.Besides helping farmers cultivate Makhana, the agriculture scientist Trivedi also popularised adoption of canopy management in Litchi orchards to improve yield and promoted winter maize cultivation in Bihar.Other scientists who have been selected for Padma Shri are P L Gautam, former chairperson of the National Biodiversity Authority and the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers' Rights Authority; K Ramasamy, former vice chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University; and N Punniamoorthy, former dean at Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University.Four farmers who have been selected for the Padma Shri for their outstanding contributions to agriculture and animal husbandry include Raghupat Singh (posthumous), a progressive farmer from Moradabad district, who conserved more than 55 rare and nearly extinct vegetable varieties and developed around 100 new varieties; Jogesh Deuri of Assam who promoted Muga silk and helped it gain wider national and international recognition; Shrirang Devaba Lad of Maharashtra who developed the ""Dada Lad technique"" for cotton cultivation to increase yield; and Telangana's Rama Reddy Mamidi (posthumous) who strengthened cooperative models in animal husbandry and dairy development.","Nine persons associated with farm and allied sector selected for this year's Padma Shri award.

"Purdue campus talks gather pace; UK, Canadian univs signal interest",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/purdue-campus-talks-gather-pace-uk-canadian-univs-signal-interest/articleshow/127581101.cms,"Image: purdue.edu

NEW DELHI: Talks with US-based Purdue University for setting up a campus in India have reached an advanced stage, govt sources said, even as interest from British and Canadian universities gathers pace under India's liberalised foreign education regime. Officials said that colleges under the University of London and several Canadian universities have also conveyed keenness, with preliminary discussions underway.The momentum follows policy changes that have opened India's higher education sector to foreign universities. The National Education Policy, 2020 first articulated the case for allowing top global institutions to operate locally, and this was operationalised in 2023 through UGC regulations. The rules allow eligible foreign universities to establish independent campuses, design curricula and set admission norms, marking a decisive shift from earlier partnership-only models.There are foreign universities already running physical campuses in India - Australia's Deakin University and University of Wollongong at Gujarat's GIFT City, and the UK's University of Southampton in Gurgaon. These campuses offer programmes in high-demand areas such as STEM and management, and have demonstrated that overseas institutions can operate within India's regulatory ecosystem.University of Liverpool, University of York and University of Aberdeen, among others are working towards similar operations.Against this backdrop, Purdue University's proposed India campus is being seen as a major credibility boost for the foreign university policy. Sources said discussions have reached an advanced stage, with talks focused on academic offerings, regulatory compliance and operational frameworks. Govt officials indicated that the plan is for Purdue to offer its flagship engineering and technology programmes in India, allowing students to earn a Purdue degree without having to study overseas.","Talks with US-based Purdue University for setting up a campus in India have reached an advanced stage, govt sources said.

.

NEW DELHI: Highway construction agencies, including NHAI, are in a bind over the recent trend of road contractors quoting low bids of up to 48% less than the estimated project cost, largely due to aggressive bidding, which usually has a direct bearing on the quality of work.In a recent case, the road transport ministry cancelled a tender for a project in Manipur as the contractor with the lowest bid quoted 47% less than the cost the ministry had estimated. The contractor challenged the bid cancellation in Gauhati high court, and the court ordered an interim stay. ""This case is a classic example of how highway agencies are caught in the middle. Highway contractors are getting projects quoting low bids arguing they have quoted price after carrying out detailed assessment,"" said an official.Data since April 2023 showed that because of less number of projects being offered, there is fierce competition among bidders. For each tender, the number of bidders is in the range of seven to 19.Officials and industry insiders said that while there has been a huge increase in the number of highway contractors in the past 7-8 years, with govt rolling out a large number of projects and also bringing down the qualification criteria, there has been a significant fall in the number of works being bid.""This has resulted in players quoting low bids to ensure that their manpower and machinery do not lie idle, which causes further financial stress. This trend will hurt the sector and quality of work as well since we can't reject a lowest cost or L1 bid in construction works,"" said another official.The details of some of the low quoted bids since 2023-24 showed that a project in Madhya Pradesh - four-laning of Rahatgarh to Berkhedi - was bid out at Rs 324 crore, which was 48.4% less than NHAI's bid cost of Rs 627 crore. In the case of another project in Maharashtra - augmentation of existing stretch in urban areas of Pune on the Pune-Satara section - was bid out at Rs 321 crore, around 46% less than the project cost estimated by the highway authority.Similarly, the work for four-laning from Dareota to Kalar Bala in Himachal Pradesh was tendered at Rs 435 crore against NHAI's project cost of Rs 734 crore this year, which was around 41% less.","Highway construction agencies, including NHAI, are in a bind over the recent trend of road contractors quoting low bids.

NEW DELHI: Congress Monday raised questions about the intent of Modi govt to hold a caste enumeration in Census 2027 as it had announced earlier, pointing out that the question about the caste of the head of a household in the ""houselisting"" phase does not offer ""OBC"" as an option. Govt last week published the gazette notification for ""houselisting"" which is to start in April, and released a list of 33 questions to be asked to households being surveyed.Congress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh demanded that Modi govt immediately hold talks with political parties, states and civil society organisations before finalising the details of the caste enumeration exercise.Ramesh argued that ""question 12"" for ""houselisting"" asks whether the head of a household belongs to SCs, STs, or 'other' categories, but does not explicitly ask about OBC and general categories.""Since caste enumeration is to be part of Census 2027, 'question 12' as formulated does raise serious questions on Modi govt's true intentions and on its commitment to a comprehensive, fair, nation-wide caste census,"" he said.Ramesh reminded that PM Modi had rejected the demand of caste census raised by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi, even dubbing it ""urban Naxal mindset"". But, he said, Modi govt did a 'U-turn' on April 30 last year, and announced that caste enumeration would be included in Census 2027, adding that PM was ""forced to capitulate"".""Congress calls upon Modi govt to immediately initiate a dialogue with political parties, state govts, and civil society organisations before finalising details of the caste enumeration exercise,"" Ramesh said, adding that such consultations were an integral part of the caste survey that was carried out by the Telangana govt in 2025.","The question about the caste of the head of a household in the ""houselisting"" phase does not offer ""OBC"" as an option.

Republic Day Visual That Dominated Kartavya Path: PM Modi’s Striking Multi-Coloured Safa

Chief Minister Rekha Gupta on Monday laid the foundation stone for development works in the national capital's slum areas under the Jhuggi Basti Sampark Abhiyan Toli scheme.The inauguration took place at the Chief Minister's Public Service Centre on the occasion of India's 77th Republic Day.During the inauguration, she noted that this was the first time a budget of ₹700 crore had been specifically allocated for slum dwellers. She asserted that these residents can now live peacefully and reaffirmed the government's commitment to providing them with a dignified, high-quality life.""It was for the first time that a budget of Rs 700 crore was provided for slum dwellers. We decided to provide for all the facilities such as parks, safety, roads, sanitation, and drinking water. The government took these works into its hands, and we inaugurated this. The previous governments spread fear that the BJP would stop free electricity and water, but these slum dwellers can now live peacefully. We are committed to providing them a good and quality life,"" Gupta told reporters here.Earlier, on the eve of Republic Day, the Delhi Chief Minister announced that within the next three years, 100 per cent of Delhi's public transport buses will be converted into an emission-free electric fleet.Addressing the gathering, CM Rekha Gupta said, ""The Delhi government has doubled its capital expenditure. Rs 30 thousand crore will now be spent on capital expenditure in Delhi.

During the annual budget appraisal, the Public Investment Board (PIB) headed by the expenditure secretary has also recommended the roll out of Integrated Station Facility Manager (ISFM) to generate maximum revenue.TOI has learnt that railway board CEO and chairman Satish Kumar informed the inter-ministerial panel that the national transporter, to begin with, will engage ISFM at two stations -- Gomtinagar and Chandigarh -- and subsequently Safdarjung and Bijwasan in Delhi and Rani Kamlapati stations will also get them. The ISFM agency will be responsible for all housekeeping activities as well as operation and maintenance of the station assets and will earn revenue by monetising or sub-leasing commercial space in the station. Such contracts will be for nine years and can be extended by another three years.As per the minutes of the meeting, the panel has recommended railways to levy “reasonable” user charge for redeveloped railway stations and to also ensure that the revenue from stations after redevelopment is adequate to fund the operation and maintenance expenses of stations.The panel has also recommended railways to take up decongestion of areas outside stations to unlock potential of real estate in and around stations and improve service quality.

Agriculture scientists and innovative farmers get Padma Shri boost for their pioneering efforts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/agriculture-scientists-and-innovative-farmers-get-padma-shri-boost-for-their-pioneering-efforts/articleshow/127558359.cms,"Representative image (Photo credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: Prominent agriculture scientist Ashok Kumar Singh, who developed over 25 rice varieties, especially Basmati, and co-developed India’s first genome-edited rice, and former Vice-Chancellor of the Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Pusa in Bihar, Gopal Ji Trivedi, were among nine persons associated with the farm and allied sector selected for this year’s Padma Shri award.Besides Singh, former director of the ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), there were four other scientists and four farmers in the list of awardees from the sector who helped farm growth through their research and innovative farm practices and contributed towards improving the livelihood of farmers in different parts of the country.Rice varieties, including different Pusa Basmati and non-Basmati varieties, developed by Singh and other ICAR-IARI scientists, significantly increased rice output over the years and helped India earn roughly around Rs 50,000 crore annually from Basmati rice export.The country’s first genome-edited rice varieties, ‘DRR Dhan 100 (Kamala)’ and ‘Pusa DST Rice 1’, which Singh co-developed with other scientists of the ICAR’s institutes, were expected to enhance output, save water and reduce greenhouse gas emission during cultivation. It was estimated that cultivation of these varieties, released last year, in about 5 million hectares of the recommended area would produce 4.5 million tons of additional paddy, save a total of 7,500 million cubic metres of irrigation water, particularly by using the shorter duration maturity variety of ‘DRR Dhan 100 Kamala’, and reduce methane emissions by 20%.Trivedi helped farmers cultivate Makhana (fox nuts) in a big way and popularise the nutrient-dense, low-calorie and gluten-free snack among health conscious Indians. Besides helping farmers cultivate Makhana, Trivedi also popularised adoption of canopy management in Litchi orchards to improve yield and promoted winter maize cultivation in Bihar.Other agriculture scientists selected for Padma Shri were Prem Lal Gautam, former chairperson of the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) and the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Authority (PPVFRA); K Ramasamy, former Vice Chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU); and N Punniamoorthy, former dean at Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (TANVASU).Ramasamy championed natural farming and significantly contributed in National Policy Planning of Agriculture Biotechnology, Ferti-irrigation and Biogas Development. Gautam established India’s first plant germplasm registration system and helped in operationalising India’s National Gene Bank.Punniamurthy, a veterinarian, pioneered antibiotic-free herbal and traditional protocols and developed herbal formulations for Mastitis, FMD and parasitic infection. He helped reduce antibiotic residues in milk and treated over 8 lakh cows.Four farmers selected for the Padma Shri for contributions to agriculture and animal husbandry included Raghupat Singh (Posthumous), a progressive farmer from Bilari in Moradabad district, who conserved more than 55 rare and nearly extinct vegetable varieties and developed around 100 new varieties; Jogesh Deuri of Assam, who promoted Muga silk and helped it gain wider national and international recognition; Shrirang Devaba Lad of Maharashtra, who developed the “Dada Lad technique” for cotton cultivation to increase yield; and Rama Reddy Mamidi of Telangana (Posthumous), who strengthened cooperative models in animal husbandry and dairy development.","Nine persons associated with the farm and allied sector selected for this year’s Padma Shri award.

"One vote, unequal weight: Kothnur has just 10.9k elections, RR Nagar nearly 50k",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-vote-unequal-weight-kothnur-has-just-10-9k-elections-rr-nagar-nearly-50k/articleshow/127545125.cms,"-

BENGALURU: The city’s new municipal structure under the Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA) exposes a fundamental challenge to democratic representation: massive disparities in voter counts across wards. With more than 88.9 lakh electors distributed across 369 wards in five corporations as per the draft rolls, Bengaluru’s electoral map reveals not just administrative divisions, but deep inequities in political voice.The numbers tell a story. Kothanur (Ward 16) in East Corporation represents just 10,926 voters, while RR Nagar (Ward 23) in West Corporation speaks for 49,530—a 4.5-fold difference. This means a voter in East's smallest ward theoretically wields four times the electoral influence of someone in West’s largest.Such imbalances could fundamentally undermine the principle of “one person, one vote”. Also, if past voter turnout data is a barometer, then back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that a candidate with as few as a 1,000 votes could become a corporator in Kothanur.Among the corporations, North emerges as the most internally unequal, with four wards exceeding 40,000 electors while some hover around 17,000.This sprawl reflects Bengaluru's explosive, unplanned growth along its northern periphery, areas that have absorbed migration and development without corresponding administrative restructuring.South Corporation tells a similar tale, housing both tiny wards of 14,000 and megawards approaching 50,000, suggesting frozen boundaries that haven't kept pace with demographic shifts.Central and East corporations show tighter clustering, but this consistency comes at a cost. Central’s concentration in the 20,000-30,000 range (73% of its wards) suggests older, stabilised neighborhoods, while East’s even split between smaller and mid-sized wards points to a corporation still finding its demographic balance.West Corporation, with 112 wards—the most of any corporation—paradoxically contains some of the city’s largest wards despite having the most opportunities for equitable division. Overall, of the 369 wards across the five corporations, there are 234 with 20,000-30,000 electors, 88 with 10,000-20,000 electors, 39 with 30,000-40,000 electors and eight that have more than 40,000 but under 50,000 electors.“As per the guidelines for delimitation, we could only go by the population figure and not that of the total electorate. That was the statute. Therefore, we have gone with the population figure available as per the 2011 census,” GBA chief commissioner M Maheshwar Rao, told TOI.Notwithstanding why the delimitation has created wards with such massive disparity, the disparities will have real consequences. Councillors representing nearly 50,000 voters face impossible service demands compared to those with 15,000 constituents.Budget allocations, infrastructure priorities, and political attention inevitably skew toward larger wards. As Bengaluru confronts its infrastructure crisis, this electoral imbalance means unequal access to civic solutions—entrenching disadvantage in a city already struggling with spatial inequality.","Bengaluru’s electoral map reveals deep inequities in political voice. Kothanur (Ward 16) in East Corporation represents just 10,926 voters.

(Kuldip Kumar is Partner, Mainstay Tax Advisors LLP)

As the Union Budget approaches, expectations of major tax giveaways appear muted. However, this Budget may assume significance not for dramatic announcements, but for how the Government balances growth, fiscal discipline, and reform amid a challenging economic environment.The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment. Factors such as a weakening rupee, pressure on exports, the absence of a comprehensive US trade agreement, geopolitical tensions, and continued foreign institutional investor outflows are likely to influence policy decisions. Measures announced in this year’s Budget are therefore expected to align closely with the Government’s broader economic and reform framework.Accordingly, incentivising businesses particularly export-oriented sectors and accelerating employment generation are likely to receive focused attention in this Budget.Last year’s Budget delivered meaningful tax relief through revisions in personal income-tax slabs and enhancement of the Section 87A rebate, leaving limited headroom for further concessions.These changes were introduced under the new tax regime, while the old tax regime was left unchanged.This approach was intended to encourage taxpayers still following the old regime to transition to the simpler new tax system.For FY 2023–24, nearly 72% of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime, and this proportion is expected to increase further in the current year.Does this mean the old tax regime could be phased out entirely? Perhaps not immediately, especially since the new tax regime has also been incorporated into the Income Tax Act, 2025.However, given the continued instances of misuse and claims of incorrect deductions under the old regime, it would not be surprising if the Government eventually considers doing away with it altogether.In the 2024 Budget, the Government made significant changes to the capital gains tax regime, including revisions to holding periods and tax rates, with the objective of simplification. While some asset classes benefited, tax rates on listed securities both short-term and long-term and the Securities Transaction Tax (STT), were increased.Given the growing participation of retail investors in Indian capital markets, there is a case for reviewing these measures. While challenging from a revenue perspective, the Government could consider moderating capital gains tax rates on listed securities or enhancing the basic exemption limit for long-term capital gains, currently set at ₹1.25 lakh. Further, permitting set-off of long-term capital losses against short-term capital gains in Budget 2026 would improve tax equity and align treatment of capital assets.Fiscal Discipline Remains an Important ConsiderationThe Government is expected to adhere firmly to its fiscal consolidation path, leaving limited scope for aggressive fiscal expansion. That said, carefully calibrated policy measures particularly those aimed at stimulating consumption and job creation could strengthen growth momentum and improve tax buoyancy. As with most fiscal initiatives, the benefits of such measures are likely to become visible only after a time lag.Tax simplification remains an ongoing journey. While significant progress has been achieved through digitisation and pre-filled data, several pain points persist:Clubbing provisions continue to complicate joint ownership of assets between spouses, despite the sound financial logic behind such arrangements. Introducing an option for joint tax filing, as practiced in countries like the United States, could significantly ease compliance.Notional taxation on vacant properties is often perceived as inequitable and warrants reconsideration.TDS and TCS mechanisms, though effective for tracking transactions, frequently result in excessive deductions and cash-flow strain for taxpayers, especially where final tax liability is substantially lower.Pre-filled tax returns could be further expanded, particularly for salaried taxpayers without business income, reducing manual intervention and errors.Despite the delegation of appellate powers to Joint Commissioners, a substantial backlog of tax appeals continues to persist. Introducing clearly defined timelines and enhancing accountability would help restore taxpayer confidence.Similarly, the practice of adjusting refunds against disputed demands often for several years requires urgent reform.Refunds granted in favour of taxpayers should be released automatically, without the need for repeated follow-ups or grievances.Trust as the Cornerstone of ComplianceRecent initiatives where tax authorities proactively alert taxpayers to potential mismatches mark a positive shift towards a trust-based compliance framework. The Government has already introduced the Taxpayers’ Charter; effective enforcement of its principles on the ground would benefit both sides in improving compliance for the Government while offering peace of mind to the taxpayers.While Budget 2026 may not be about headline-grabbing tax cuts, it is likely to outline how the Government intends to navigate uncertainty, sustain growth, reinforce fiscal discipline, and deepen structural reforms.In that sense, this Budget may prove to be less about immediate relief and more about building long-term economic resilience.","The Honourable Finance Minister faces a complex macroeconomic environment.

Planning a bank visit? You might want to reschedule, as banks are set for a four-day holiday, beginning from January 23 till January 26. Keeping track of bank holidays is crucial for customers to plan their finances in advance and avoid last-minute inconvenience.It is important to note that banks in India follow a combination of national and state-specific holidays, which means branch closures may vary from one state to another. Here's a list of when and where will banks remain closed for rest of January:Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed as it is the fourth Saturday of the month. According to RBI, banks remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month.Banks will remain sut nationwide, as it is a Sunday.Banks across the country will remain closed, to mark Republic Day While bank branches will not be operational on these days, customers will still be able to access a range of digital banking services.Online banking platforms, ATMs, mobile banking applications and UPI services will continue to function, allowing users to carry out fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical visit to a bank branch, including large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available during the holidays. Account holders are therefore advised to complete such tasks in advance and rely on digital options when branches are shut.","Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

Why destination churn did not broaden India’s sending map

where

which country

whether overseas education is feasible at all

What the persistence tells us and why it should worry policymakers

Global exposure becomes regionally inherited, reinforcing state-level inequality. If the same states keep sending and other states remain structurally under-represented, global exposure becomes something you inherit by postcode. It is passed down through local ecosystems, not distributed through merit alone.





Internationalisation remains a privilege layered atop already-advantaged ecosystems. India often treats “going abroad” as an individual success story. But at scale, it mirrors internal inequality. The students who access international degrees also access stronger networks, higher-return jobs, and global labour markets. When this is regionally skewed, the inequality becomes state-level and generational.

The larger irony

India is often described as the world’s largest source of international students, but that headline hides an uncomfortable truth: India does not send students abroad evenly. A small cluster of states has dominated outbound mobility for years, while vast parts of the country barely appear in the global classroom. State-wise data from a NITI Aayog assessment of higher-education internationalisation makes this skew impossible to ignore. Between 2016 and 2020 — including a pandemic year — the same names recur at the top, in largely the same order. Mobility fluctuates, volumes dip and recover, but the geography barely changes. That stability is the story.Across three benchmark years, Andhra Pradesh consistently leads India in sending students overseas. Punjab and Maharashtra form a second tier that rotates positions but never exits the top three. Gujarat rises steadily, while Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka remain permanent fixtures.This is not a diffusion pattern. It is concentration. Even in 2020 — when global travel collapsed — the hierarchy held. Andhra Pradesh remained first. Punjab overtook Maharashtra. Uttar Pradesh, despite its scale, slid further down the list.The pandemic interrupted mobility, but it did not rearrange it.If outbound education were simply about demographics, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan would dominate the list. They do not. That gap reveals a crucial point: lnternational mobility is less about aspiration than infrastructure. States that send the most students abroad tend to share four characteristics:Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu aggressively expanded engineering and professional education in the 1990s and early 2000s. That early pipeline matters. Students trained in these ecosystems are structurally aligned with global demand for STEM graduates.These states host dense networks of private colleges, test-prep centres, counsellors and overseas admissions intermediaries. This lowers information barriers and normalises overseas study as a default progression, not an exception.Studying abroad remains a high-cost bet. What distinguishes high-sending states is not simply higher incomes, but the social acceptance of education debt and the availability of formal credit. In places where education loans are treated as “investment” rather than ‘reckless liability’, outbound numbers rise. This is why Punjab, despite its size, repeatedly punches above its weight.Diaspora is a pipeline that renews itself. Regions with earlier waves of migration carry a “memory” that reduces uncertainty. Seniors mentor juniors. Families know which colleges are safe bets. Failure feels survivable because someone you know has failed and still landed on their feet. Policy brochures cannot compete with that.Between 2016 and 2020, the geography of where Indian students went changed markedly, even as who sent them remained largely the same.In 2016, the United States was the top destination for Indian students, with Canada and Australia following, and the UK further down the list. By 2020, that hierarchy had shifted: Canada moved into the top slot, edging past the US, while the UK climbed and Germany began to register as a meaningful alternative. Australia remained a major destination, but the overall pecking order became more fluid.In other words, destinations proved responsive to policy signals: Post-study work routes, visa timelines, cost pressures, and perceived settlement pathways. Students and families adjusted. The flow bent towards whichever country offered the clearest mix of study, work and long-term prospects at that moment.But here is the part that often gets missed. Despite this churn in destinations, the Indian states supplying those students barely changed and the numbers show it.States with established outbound ecosystems were able to pivot smoothly as global doors opened and closed. When Canada expanded post-study work options, these states channelled students there. When the UK revived its work route, the same regions adjusted again. Even Germany’s gradual rise was largely absorbed through students already embedded in technical and professional pipelines.Global policy changes reshuffledstudents went — not who was able to go.For states outside this corridor, the challenge was not choosing the “right” destination. It was clearing the far more basic hurdles of information access, credit availability, course alignment and risk tolerance. By the time awareness filtered through, the window often narrowed again.That is why sudden global openings rarely democratise international education. They reward readiness, not raw aspiration.For students in high-sending states, the question has long been. For students elsewhere, it remainsThe most striking insight in the data is not who leads, but who never enters the picture.Large eastern and central states are almost absent from India’s outbound story. This is not because students there lack ambition, but because global pathways are unevenly distributed within India itself. That unevenness has two long-term consequences:India is currently courting foreign universities, talking about global campuses, and branding itself as an international education hub. Yet its own outbound flows reveal a narrower reality: only parts of India are globally mobile.Until international exposure stops being geographically inherited and students from non-coastal, non-metro, non-migration-heavy states can access the same pathways India’s global education narrative will remain selective rather than systemic. The question, then, is not why Indian students go abroad, it is why so many Indian states still cannot.","India is often described as the world’s largest source of international education.

‘Spent $3.25 million hiring H-1B workers’: Texas university draws backlash over foreign hiring and claims of ‘importing labour’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/spent-3-25-million-hiring-h-1b-workers-texas-university-draws-backlash-over-foreign-hiring-and-claims-of-importing-labour/articleshow/127509480.cms,"Texas A&M sponsored 659 H-1B workers since 2020

Comparison with UT Dallas adds fuel to the debate

H-1B Visa Shake-Up Fuels Anti-Indian Campaigns as Donald Trump's Policy Reshapes US Hiring

Supporters say H-1B hiring supports research and innovation





Texas A&M University is facing backlash after fresh claims that the public university spent around $3.25 million on H-1B visa fees and related immigration costs between 2020 and late November 2025, sponsoring hundreds of foreign workers for a wide range of roles. The figures have sparked criticism online, with some questioning whether the institution is relying too heavily on overseas recruitment at a time when graduate job opportunities, particularly in tech, remain under pressure. Supporters, however, say H-1B hiring is often used by major universities to fill specialised roles, keep research moving, and prevent staffing disruptions across teaching and technical operations.According to The Dallas Express, which cited USCIS records, Texas A&M had 659 H-1B beneficiaries approved from 2020 through September 2025, the most recent period referenced in the data.The story also pointed to the wider Texas A&M System, claiming approvals across affiliated entities exceeded 1,400. The spending total was reported as $3,252,339.17, covering visa-related costs across different stages of the process, including processing and sponsorship fees.The controversy is not just about money, but also about the types of jobs linked to the filings. The records cited included instructional roles as well as non-teaching positions such as Graphic Designer II, Communications Manager, and software application developer.Some job postings referenced standard qualification requirements, including a bachelor’s degree and several years of experience. Supporters argue that in large university systems, many of these roles support ongoing programmes, labs, and campus operations, where stability and specific technical experience can matter as much as academic credentials.The spending has also been contrasted with hiring at the University of Texas at Dallas, which was cited as spending about $1.1 million to sponsor roughly 300 H-1B workers over a similar period.Critics have taken this as evidence that Texas A&M is relying more heavily on foreign hiring, while others note that differences in size, staffing needs, and institutional structure can significantly shape both the number of visas and the overall cost.The debate has intensified amid wider concerns about the job market for young tech workers. A 2025 estimate from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York cited in the coverage reported 6.1% unemployment and 16.5% underemployment among computer science graduates.Even so, higher education advocates argue that H-1B hiring does not always clash with graduate hiring, particularly when roles require specialised experience or when staffing supports research and teaching systems that benefit students.While the backlash has been loud, supporters of the programme argue it remains a key hiring pathway for universities, especially for roles that sustain research output, strengthen academic programmes, and maintain competitiveness for funding and talent.The American Association of University Professors has defended H-1B as an important route for attracting skilled professionals into the US workforce, particularly in areas where institutions struggle to fill roles quickly through domestic hiring alone.The Dallas Express report said the records were released after delays and referenced a pending complaint with the Texas Attorney General. For now, the story has become another flashpoint in the broader debate over immigration hiring, graduate employment pressures, and transparency at publicly funded institutions.","Texas A&M spent $3.25 million on H-1B visa fees and related immigration costs between 2020 and late November 2025.

Big shift for a protected auto market

Trade boost amid global tariff pressures

‘Mother of all deals’ nearing conclusion

India is planning a major reduction in import tariffs on cars from the European Union, cutting duties to 40 per cent from levels as high as 110 per cent, in what would be the country’s biggest opening yet of its closely guarded automobile market.The move comes as New Delhi and Brussels close in on a long-awaited free trade agreement (FTA), which could be announced as early as Tuesday.According to sources briefed on the talks, the Modi government has agreed to immediately lower import taxes on a limited number of cars from the 27-nation EU with an import price above 15,000 euros, news agency Reuters reported.Over time, these duties could be reduced further to 10 per cent, significantly easing access to the Indian market for European automakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.India currently levies import duties of 70 per cent to 110 per cent on foreign cars, a policy often criticised by global auto executives, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Under the proposal, New Delhi has offered to slash duties to 40 per cent immediately for around 200,000 combustion-engine cars annually, as per Reuters, marking its most aggressive move yet to open up the sector.Battery electric vehicles will be excluded from duty cuts for the first five years to protect domestic players such as Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, after which similar reductions could apply.Lower tariffs would benefit European manufacturers, whose share of India’s 4.4-million-unit annual car market remains under 4 per cent.With the market expected to grow to six million units by 2030, the proposed cuts could allow automakers to test demand with imported models before committing to deeper local manufacturing investments.The broader FTA is expected to significantly expand bilateral trade and help Indian exporters offset the impact of steep US tariffs.The EU is already India’s largest trading partner in goods, with bilateral trade valued at $136.53 billion in 2024–25, while services trade stood at over $83 billion.The deal is also seen as a strategic step to diversify supply chains and reduce dependence on China amid shifting global trade dynamics.India and the EU are expected to announce the conclusion of negotiations for the FTA this week, a pact that commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal has dubbed the “mother of all deals”.Talks for the agreement began in 2007 and are now nearing the finish line after nearly 18 years. The announcement is expected during the India-EU Summit on January 27, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi set to hold talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa.","India is planning a major reduction in import tariffs on cars from the European Union, cutting duties to 40 per cent from levels as high as 110 per cent.

Airlines slash schedules



Flight cancelled? Here’s what to do



Can you switch airlines?



Are you entitled to a refund?



A massive winter storm disrupted air travel across the United States on Sunday, triggering widespread flight cancellations and delays at some of the country’s busiest airports and setting up what airlines warned would be a brutal travel day.The National Weather Service said late Saturday that widespread snow, sleet and freezing rain threatened nearly 180 million people more than half the US population across a vast stretch from the southern Rocky Mountains to New England.After sweeping through the southern US, forecasters said the storm was expected to intensify over the Northeast, dumping 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 centimetres) of snow from Washington through New York and Boston.The severe weather led to massive disruptions across the aviation network.More than 14,000 flights have been cancelled across the US since Saturday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware, with nearly 10,000 cancellations scheduled for Sunday alone, the Associated Press reported.Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport warned travellers on its website of widespread cancellations, noting that nearly all departing flights, 420 flights, or 99% were cancelled for the day.Major airport hubs including Dallas-Fort Worth, Charlotte, Philadelphia and Atlanta, home to the nation’s busiest airport, were hit, along with New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport.American Airlines cancelled over 1,400 flights on Sunday, about 45% of its scheduled operations, FlightAware data showed.Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines each reported more than 1,200 cancellations, while United Airlines cancelled over 860 flights. JetBlue scrapped more than 570 flights, accounting for roughly 71% of its schedule for the day.If you are already at the airport, airlines advise getting in line to speak with a customer service representative. If you are still at home or at a hotel, passengers should call or go online to contact the airline’s reservations staff. Travellers are also advised to research alternate flights while waiting to speak to an agent.Most airlines will rebook passengers on a later flight at no extra charge, subject to seat availability.Passengers can seek to be booked on another airline, but carriers are not required to place travellers on a competing airline’s flight. Some airlines, including major carriers, may offer rebooking on partner airlines, though availability is not guaranteed, the Associated Press reported.If a flight is cancelled and a passenger chooses not to travel or finds another way to reach their destination, the airline is legally required to issue a refund, even for non-refundable tickets. The rule applies regardless of the reason for the cancellation.","More than 14,000 flights have been cancelled across the US since Saturday, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware.

Rupee sinks to 92 against US dollar: What's impacted as India's currency keeps sliding — explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rupee-sinks-to-92-against-us-dollar-whats-impacted-as-indias-currency-keeps-sliding-explained/articleshow/127468610.cms,"Representative AI image

Imports hit



Overseas education and trips abroad turn costlier



Silver lining



Exporters see mixed impact



What experts say?



The rupee's slide to a historic low of 92 against the US dollar on January 23 is beginning to pinch wallets, making everything from crude oil, electronics to overseas education and foreign travel more expensive, while offering some relief to exporters.The local currency slid to an all-time low of 92 per dollar during the day before recovering marginally to settle at 91.88 (provisional).The fall was driven by sustained selling by foreign funds, weak domestic equity markets and a risk-off sentiment in global markets.The previous record low closing level was recorded on January 21, when the rupee plunged 68 paise to settle at 91.65, PTI reported.So far this month, the rupee has depreciated by 202 paise, or over 2%. In 2025, it had fallen nearly 5% amid persistent foreign fund outflows and dollar strength.A weaker rupee directly impacts imports, as buyers need to pay more rupees for the same quantity of goods priced in dollars.India is about 85% dependent on imported crude oil for fuels such as petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel.India’s import basket includes crude oil, coal, plastics, chemicals, electronic goods, vegetable oil, fertilisers, machinery, gold, pearls, precious and semi-precious stones, and iron and steel.With the rupee weakening, not only oil but also electronic items such as mobile phone components, certain cars and household appliances are likely to become more expensive.A depreciating rupee makes foreign education more expensive, as students have to pay more rupees for every dollar charged by overseas institutions.Similarly, foreign travel costs rise, since travellers must spend more rupees to purchase dollars for expenses abroad.However, for non-resident Indians (NRIs), a weaker rupee is beneficial, as remittances sent in foreign currency translate into higher rupee value back home.Exporters are likely to benefit from the rupee’s fall as they earn more rupees per dollar. However, exporters who rely heavily on imported inputs may see their gains reduced due to higher input costs.In theory, sectors with low import dependence, such as textiles, stand to gain the most, while high import-dependent sectors like electronics may benefit the least.According to the latest data, India’s imports rose 8.7% to $63.55 billion in December 2025. The trade deficit stood at $25.04 billion, compared with $24.53 billion in November 2025 and $22 billion in December 2024.Crude oil imports, largely priced in dollars, increased by about 6% to $14.4 billion in December 2025. Silver imports surged by nearly 80% to $758 million, while gold imports declined 12% to $4.13 billion.Think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said India needs to strike a careful balance between growth and inflation control, while rethinking its rupee management and trade strategies to achieve long-term economic stability.The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) noted that while a weaker rupee improves the global price competitiveness of Indian goods.However, sectors with high import dependence such as gems and jewellery and electronics may see the currency advantage partly offset by higher input costs.","The local currency slid to an all-time low of 92 per dollar during the day before recovering marginally to settle at 91.88 (provisional) The fall was driven by sustained selling by foreign funds, weak domestic equity markets and a risk-off sentiment in global markets. India is about 85% dependent on imported crude oil for fuels such as petrol, diesel and aviation turbine fuel.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127472580,imgsize-44866,width-400,resizemode-4/127472580.jpg"

Carry-forward of losses and depreciation: Extend benefits during mergers and acquisitions to all companies, including services firms.

SEZ Reinvestment Reserve: Allow use for leased tech assets, cloud infrastructure, software subscriptions, interiors, facilities, and training expenses.

Pre-deposit for tax appeals: Reduce the requirement from 20% to 10% of disputed tax demand, in line with GST rules, to ease working capital strain.

Refund adjustments: Prevent tax refunds from being offset against demands that have already been stayed.

Ahead of the Union Budget 2026, the IT industry association Nasscom has urged the government to address pressing tax concerns for startups and technology firms. As reported by PTI, the Nasscom wishlist for Budget 2026 includes extending the Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) tax deferment to more startups, clarifying rules around the tax treatment of foreign cloud providers using Indian data centers.As per the report, Nasscom has asked for ESOP tax deferment to be extended to all DPIIT-recognised startups and it should not be limited to just the ones certified by the Inter-Ministerial Board. Presently, fewer than 4,000 startups qualify for 2020 ESOP deferment window, out of the 1.59 lakh recognised by DPIIT. “ESOPs enable startups to attract high-quality talent. Extending deferment will make the regime meaningful and help them compete with larger businesses,” Nasscom said in its pre-Budget memorandum.Along with this, the association also wants ESOP costs to be deductible under section 37 of the Income Tax Act, making equity-based compensation more viable for young companies.Cloud Tax clarityThe report further states that Nasscom has also asked for explicit clarification on hosting or co-location services from Indian data centre operators and does not create a permanent establishment for foreign cloud providers. The group argues that arm’s-length payments to Indian operators fully cover India-based functions, and foreign providers neither control premises nor conduct business locally.This clarification, Nasscom said, is crucial to avoid unintended tax liabilities that could discourage global cloud providers from expanding operations in India.Other key recommendations",The IT industry association Nasscom has urged the government to address pressing tax concerns for startups and technology firms.

His visit offered millions of young followers a rare look at how meat can be grown from cells without slaughter. The moment gave alternative protein a cultural boost, helping shift perception from niche food tech to something familiar and accessible.

MrBeast samples cultivated chicken at California food tech facility

$1 vs $1,000,000,000 Futuristic Tech!





When the world’s most influential YouTuber steps into a food lab, the impact stretches far beyond the tasting table. This week, a quiet visit to a California facility created loud ripples across the alternative protein world. Millions of young viewers who shape online culture watched something unfamiliar become approachable in real time.What made the moment stand out was not hype or spectacle. It was normalisation. Seeing a creator known for viral challenges and generosity calmly learn how meat can be grown from cells reframed a long-running debate. Cultivated meat was no longer presented as a futuristic theory. It looked edible, curious, and surprisingly ordinary.MrBeast, whose audience spans Gen Z and Gen Alpha, visited the EPIC facility operated by Upside Foods. During the visit, he watched cultivated chicken being produced and tasted the final product on camera. For an industry often boxed into climate reports and regulatory headlines, the cultural exposure mattered.Upside Foods founder Uma Valeti captured the philosophy behind the visit in a simple line that quickly resonated online. “What if we can have the best of both worlds… LOVE chicken and LOVE chickens!”Cultivated meat has spent years fighting labels like artificial or lab-made.Those narratives thrive on distance and misunderstanding. A creator-led moment does the opposite. It invites audiences inside the process without lectures or fear-based messaging. Viewers see curiosity instead of caution.For Upside Foods, the timing is critical. The company has faced the same pressures hitting the wider sector. High costs, political resistance, and investor anxiety have slowed momentum. At the same time, it remains the first cultivated meat company to receive US regulatory approval and one of the most closely watched players in the field.Industry voices have already described the visit as a cultural turning point. Not because it solves scaling or policy hurdles, but because it shifts perception. If even a small fraction of MrBeast’s audience begins to see cultivated meat as normal food rather than experimental science, the ripple effect reaches restaurants, retailers, and regulators.In food innovation, technology builds products. Culture builds demand. This moment sat squarely at that intersection.","MrBeast visited Upside Foods’ California facility and tasted cell-based chicken.

Blue Davos 2026: What it means and why 2026 is being called the ‘Year of Water’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/blue-davos-2026-what-it-means-and-why-2026-is-being-called-the-year-of-water/articleshow/126787725.cms,"AI-generated

What is Blue Davos and why water dominates the Davos 2026 agenda

Extreme water events are becoming more common

Long term data show rising pressure on freshwater

Flood exposure is growing alongside scarcity

Oceans are warming faster than expected

Economic stakes are drawing new attention

New approaches are beginning to surface





A theme known as ""Blue Davos"" is beginning to emerge at the World Economic Forum 's annual meeting, signifying that water-related issues are no longer marginalised in international discourse. The connections between rivers, oceans, glaciers, and groundwater as a one stressed system are receiving more attention. The food supply, commercial routes, public health, and economic stability are all under pressure, frequently simultaneously. In 2026, the UAE will host just the third UN Water Conference in nearly 50 years, raising hopes that long-standing issues may finally find political attention and financial support. The tone is more about acknowledging boundaries that are become increasingly difficult to ignore than it is about declaring crises.At Davos, water is no longer framed as a narrow development issue or a footnote to climate policy. Under the Blue Davos label, it is being treated as a core condition for economic resilience and political stability. Briefings point to disruptions across the water cycle that are appearing more often and lasting longer. Flooding, drought and pollution are touching supply chains, energy systems and cities in uneven ways.Bringing oceans and freshwater into the same discussion reflects a broader scientific view that changes in one part of the system tend to echo elsewhere, sometimes far from where they begin.Recent events have made the pattern harder to ignore. In late 2024, rivers in parts of the Amazon basin dropped to unusually low levels, while Spain dealt with its most serious flooding in decades. Similar contrasts appeared in other regions, occasionally within the same country. Water arrives suddenly and destructively in some places, while it retreats for months in others. Researchers often describe this less as a series of isolated shocks and more as a hydrological cycle that is drifting out of balance, shaped by accumulated stress rather than a single breaking point.Longer records reinforce that impression. Since 1900, the share of global land affected by dry conditions has more than doubled, according to OECD data. This expansion strains drinking water supplies and agriculture at the same time. Large lakes offer another signal. Around half of the world’s biggest lakes no longer recover easily after periods of stress. River basins show similar instability, swinging between unusually high and low flows instead of staying within familiar seasonal ranges.Flood risk has increased alongside water shortage. World Bank estimates suggest roughly 1.8 billion people face exposure to significant flooding during a one-in-100-year event, most of them in low and middle-income countries. Even shallow flooding can interrupt housing, transportation, and daily work. These impacts are often felt most severely in areas where sanitation and access to safe drinking water are already unreliable. What emerges is not a single global picture but a patchwork shaped by income, geography and infrastructure.The ocean side of the cycle is shifting as well. Ocean warming has accelerated sharply since the 1980s, bringing effects that include ice loss, rising seas and acidification. Glaciers are losing hundreds of gigatonnes of ice each year. These changes influence weather patterns and coastal economies, sometimes far inland. The scale of these links helps explain why Blue Davos treats marine and freshwater issues as parts of the same problem rather than separate tracks.Water also carries economic weight that is becoming harder to overlook. Estimates place the annual value of water ecosystems at around 58 trillion dollars. Investment, however, has not kept pace. Only a small share of global water funding comes from private sources, leaving gaps in infrastructure and resilience. Projections suggest that close to a third of global GDP could be exposed to high water stress by mid century. These figures are nudging the conversation toward risk and long term stability rather than short term fixes.Some responses are beginning to appear. Water-focused microfinance schemes have helped millions gain access to safe taps and sanitation. Industry groups are testing cooperation at the river basin level, while ocean-related innovation is attracting more investors than in the past. Funding linked to the blue economy has grown quickly over the last decade, driven partly by recognition that degradation carries financial risk. These efforts do not resolve the wider imbalance. They sit alongside uncertainty and long timelines, as attention slowly builds toward 2026.","Water is no longer framed as a narrow development issue or a footnote to climate policy.

BENGALURU: Eight people from Karnataka figure in the Padma award list announced Sunday - a list that spans classical scholarship, grassroots social work, laboratory science, medicine, education, and industry. The one Padma Bhushan and seven Padma Shri awards recognise careers built quietly over decades, rooted in institutions, neighbourhoods and traditions.A Sanskrit scholar, polyglot and among the country's foremost exponents of Avadhana - an ancient Indian literary and cognitive performance art - R Ganesh, 63, has spent decades sustaining a discipline that tests memory, concentration and poetic imagination at once. In Avadhana, multiple scholars pose questions simultaneously, to which the Avadhani responds by composing poetry extempore, while strictly adhering to rules of metre, language and theme.Born in 1962 in Kolar, Ganesh's academic journey spans diverse disciplines. He holds a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering, a master's degree in metallurgy from the Indian Institute of Science, a master's degree in Sanskrit, and a doctor of literature in Kannada from Hampi University, where his research focused on avadhana theory and practice.Fluent in Kannada, Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil and Prakrit, Ganesh has performed over 1,300 Avadhanas, including the demanding Shatavadhana with a hundred participants.A prolific author and speaker, he continues to interpret classical literary traditions for contemporary audiences.At 71, Shubha V Iyengar's Padma Shri honours a career that mirrors India's post-independence scientific journey. A former scientist at CSIR-National Aerospace Laboratories, she joined NAL in 1974 after securing first rank in both her BSc (honours) in physics and MSc degrees from Central College.""My interest in science came from my father. He believed women should pursue higher studies and wanted me to complete my PhD. I lost him while I was an MSc student, but I carried his wish forward,"" she told TOI. The youngest of nine siblings - several of whom have passed away - Shubha says her family remains her backbone.Her career includes several landmark contributions, most notably Drishti, a system now deployed at Indian airports, and by the Indian Air Force, significantly strengthening aviation safety and operations. Calling the award recognition ""for everything put together - science, engineering and service to the nation"", Iyengar continues to stay professionally active after retirement.Fondly known as 'Amma', SG Susheelamma, 86, founded Sumangali Seva Ashrama in 1975 to support destitute women, orphaned children and economically weaker communities. Located in Cholanayakanahalli near Hebbal, the ashrama today houses about 110 residents, including 70 children and 40 elderly people.Over five decades, Susheelamma estimates her work has touched more than 30 lakh lives through initiatives in housing for slum dwellers, education, healthcare and employment. The ashrama runs adult literacy programmes, vocational training for women and regular health camps. She also founded the Basavananda Higher Primary School, which provides free education to around 250 students.Currently working on the holistic development of tribal communities in Magadi and Bandipur, she has launched initiatives to provide autorickshaws and training to tribal women to help them earn a livelihood. The Padma Shri, she says, has only strengthened her resolve to continue.Vempati is a technocrat and strategic advisor with two decades of experience across technology, media and public policy. He advises organisations and govt institutions, and is involved in shaping India's AI ecosystem.A co-founder of the DeepTech for Bharat Foundation, he leads the AI4India initiative and serves on the board of IIT Bombay-incubated BharatGen Technology Foundation, focused on India's sovereign AI capabilities.

BENGALURU: The Congress govt has decided to grant Rs 255 crore worth of land in Bengaluru to 22 Dalit and OBC mutts, overruling red flags raised by key departments on giving away gomala land and parcels that are within the city corporation limits.Documents reviewed by TOI show that the departments of finance, and law and parliamentary affairs advised against the decision as it might attract legal scrutiny since gomala land could not be alienated or granted to private organisations.However, senior ministers said such opinions are ""nothing new"" and are almost similar for all land-grant requests. The govt made the decision last week.In early 2025, seers from Dalit and Backward Classes had sought land and assistance from the govt to run their philanthropic institutions in Bengaluru. As part of the appeal, the president and general secretary of the Backward Dalit Mathadeeshwarara Okkuta, Bengaluru, had sought land for 22 of their mutts in Ravuttanahalli, Dasanapura of Bangalore North district.Some 34 acres and 9 guntas on Survey No. 57 and another parcel of 18 acres and 5 guntas on Survey No. 58 were given to these institutions. Each mutt was proposed to get between 20 guntas and four acres, depending on the size of the mutt, its followers and extend of social work.""Supreme Court has directed chief secretaries of all the states and Union territories to preserve poramboku/gomala/kharabu/waterbodies for public use as per cases of Jagpal Singh and others vs State of Punjab report in 2011 and Joginder and others vs State of Haryana special leave petition and Hinch Lal Tiwari vs Kamal Devi and others on July 25 2001,"" reads a note by the state govt departments. It further says land proposed to be given falls within 18km from erstwhile BBMP headquarters.As per Karnataka Land Grant Rules-1969, govt land within the city limits shall not be granted to any individual or private institutions and shall be reserved for public purpose. “Therefore, there is no provision for granting the land,” concluded the departments.According to the finance department, the land value, as per guidance value, was Rs 1 crore an acre, while the same land, if converted but undeveloped, was worth Rs 1.8 crore. If developed, the land would be worth Rs 4.8 crore an acre. Revenue officials claimed some of these mutts who have been granted land were of recent origin and had no track record to substantiate their philanthropic work.",The Congress govt has decided to grant Rs 255 crore worth of land in Bengaluru to 22 Dalit and OBC mutts.

America's push for rare earths

The US government is set to acquire a 10% stake in Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth, as part of Trump administration's $1.6 billion investment. The package is aimed towards supporting the firm to develop a local mine and magnet production facility, according to two sources familiar with the deal.In addition to this government-backed investment, USA Rare Earth is also securing a separate $1 billion private funding round, which, along with the public announcement, is expected on Monday, Reuters reported. The company will also host a morning conference call with investors to discuss the terms.Rare earth minerals, a group of 17 elements critical for electronics and military equipment, are largely processed by China. The output from United States, however, remains limited, prompting Washington to make efforts to expand domestic production.Under the investment terms, the US government will receive 16.1 million shares in USA Rare Earth, along with warrants for an additional 17.6 million shares. Both are priced at $17.17 per share, close to the company’s trading level earlier this month.For fundraising support, USA Rare Earth has enlisted Cantor Fitzgerald, chaired by Brandon Lutnick, the son of US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick, a source was quoted as saying by Reuters.At present, USA Rare Earth is developing a mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas, in collaboration with Texas Mineral Resources, expected to begin operations by 2028. Its magnet manufacturing facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma, is scheduled to start later this year.This latest investment follows previous equity stakes taken by the Trump administration in MP Materials , Lithium Americas , and Trilogy Metals. A senior Trump official told Reuters last month that more “historic deals” with the US mining sector are planned to increase production of lithium, rare earths, and other critical minerals vital to national defence, artificial intelligence, and related industries.","The US government is set to acquire a 10% stake in Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth, as part of Trump administration's $1.6 billion investment.

NEW DELHI: Received an SMS informing you of a pending traffic challan with a link to pay online? Check it before you click. Cybercriminals are increasingly using fake challan alerts to defraud people. Recently, an elderly resident in east Delhi was defrauded of Rs 2.5 lakh after he clicked on such a fraudulent link to pay a small fine of Rs 500.The victim, a 65-year-old from Laxmi Nagar, told police that his wife had received a message on Jan 13 from an unknown mobile number containing a link for paying a vehicle challan. Believing it to be genuine, she forwarded it to her husband.When he tried to pay using his credit card, the transaction initially appeared to go through normally. But within minutes, another Rs 2,49,246.61 was billed on his card, including SAR 10,350 in Saudi riyals, suggesting international routing. A case has been registered by the cyber police of East district for cheating and personation.Police warn that such frauds are on the rise, exploiting people's fear of fines and legal action. With WhatsApp-based challan alerts now active, scammers send messages on SMS, WhatsApp, even through PDFs.Some claim to be from the transport ministry or pose as transport officials. These messages often pressure recipients to ""process"" the payment immediately via a link that mimics official portals.Such links, QR codes or payment requests from unknown numbers or unverified WhatsApp accounts are a major warning sign as are urgent messages warning of fines, licence suspension or legal action, officers caution. Fraudsters may also ask for payment through third-party apps, agents or unfamiliar websites. They often omit critical details such as notice number, vehicle number and offence location. The messages may try to collect sensitive information through links instead of redirecting to the official Parivahan portal. Once clicked, these links lead to fake gateways designed to steal banking credentials and withdraw funds without authorisation.To protect yourself, pay challans only through official channels. Always verify website URLs before entering any details and check challans using your vehicle or licence number. Authorities also emphasise the importance of the ""golden hour"", the first 60 minutes after a fraud, during which swift reporting can increase the chances of blocking or recovering stolen money.Victims should immediately call the National Cyber Crime helpline 1930, lodge a complaint on cybercrime.gov.in and inform their bank or card issuer to block the account and initiate a chargeback.","Police warn that such frauds are on the rise, exploiting people's fear of fines and legal action.
