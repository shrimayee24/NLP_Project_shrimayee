Sonam Wangchuk's Wife Blasts Modi Govt & CRPF Over 6Th Schedule, Dismisses FCRA, Pak Link Charges

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: Jailed activist Sonam Wangchuk was taken to AIIMS Jodhpur for a medical examination on Saturday after the Supreme Court sought his medical report by February 2.The 59-year-old former educationist was examined for about 90 minutes before being escorted back to prison. He has reportedly been suffering from stomach-related ailments and had also visited the hospital on Friday for medical tests.Wangchuk has been raising concerns about his deteriorating health in jail for some time. Taking note of his worsening condition, the Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Jodhpur jail administration to arrange a medical examination by a specialist.The top court is hearing a writ petition filed by his wife, Geetanjali Angmo, challenging his detention under the stringent National Security Act.Wangchuk has been lodged in Rajasthan's Jodhpur Central Jail since September 27 last year, three days after a protest demanding statehood for his native Ladakh turned violent in Leh, the Union territory's capital.During Thursday’s hearing, a bench comprising Justices Arvind Kumar and PB Varale instructed jail authorities to ensure that Wangchuk is examined by a specialist doctor—a gastroenterologist—at a government hospital.Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, appearing for the Rajasthan government, informed the bench that jail doctors had examined Wangchuk 21 times over the past four months, with the most recent check-up conducted on January 26.However, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing Wangchuk, objected to the submission, stating that his client was suffering from persistent stomach pain, allegedly caused by the quality of water provided in jail.Accepting the argument, the court observed that medical treatment by a specialist must be provided in accordance with the patient’s needs.",Sonam Wangchuk was taken to AIIMS Jodhpur for a medical examination on Saturday.

Air India Grounds Dreamliner After Pilot Flags Fuel Control Switch Issue in London-Bengaluru Flight

What happened at Heathrow?

UK incident challenges claim AI fuel switch movement was manual: Expert

MUMBAI: In a development with direct implications for the investigation into the June 12 fatal Air India Boeing 787 Ahmedabad crash, another Air India Dreamliner saw a fuel control switch move from “run” to “cut-off” after a crew member pressed it to check whether it was locked.The switch moved without the required lift action, suggesting the safeguard meant to prevent fuel supply cut off and inadvertent engine shutdown did not function as designed, sources said. The London incident challenges the controversial narrative that the Ahmedabad crash resulted from a deliberate pilot act, pointing instead to a possible and critical technical flaw in the aircraft’s fuel switch design.The incident occurred on Feb 1 at London Heathrow during engine start of B787 (VT-ANX) operating the 9.05pm Air India flight AI-132 to Bengaluru. The fuel control switches on the 787 require a two-step action: they must be lifted before they can be moved between “run” and “cut-off”. The safety feature is intended to prevent inadvertent fuel shutdown.“The pilot lightly pushed the left fuel control switch to check if its lock feature was working and found it was not because the switch moved though it was not lifted first,” the source said. It again failed to lock the second time.But the third time the switch stayed locked and did not move without lifting. The aircraft departed at 9.40pm for Bengaluru, where it is currently grounded.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), in its preliminary report released last July, said that both fuel control switches on the ill-fated aircraft had moved from “run” to “cut off” seconds after takeoff. The report said one pilot asked the other why did he cut off the fuel, to which the other responded that he did not do so.India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), in its preliminary report, added that no technical or design flaw was found with the aircraft so far, implying pilot action. Therafter, the DGCA mandated an inspection of the fuel switch locking system. Air India later announced that it completed these inspections and found no faults. But the London incident brings back to fore the unresolved question around switch design, its locking integrity and the possibility of inadvertent activation, said sources.A senior commander said: “The London incident directly challenges the assumption that fuel switch movement in the Air India crash was manual. Until now, the cut-off transition was treated as near-conclusive evidence of pilot action. The London event shows that uncommanded switch behaviour, through mechanical detent failure, signal corruption or other causes, is a credible failure mode. That places the DGCA’s earlier claim of fleet clearance under sharp scrutiny, as a defect appearing months later suggests inspections may have been visual, non-diagnostic, or incomplete. For the AAIB, the implication is clear: fuel cutoff can no longer be equated with intent, the investigation must widen to fleet-level and component analysis, and attribution of deliberate pilot action without fully eliminating system anomalies is no longer defensible.”Air safety expert Capt Amit Singh said: “The London incident is particularly concerning because in 2018 the US aviation regulator cautioned that fuel control switches on Boeing 787s could malfunction and lead to inadvertent engine shutdown. Occurring after Air India said its fleet’s fuel control switches have been checked, and amid the ongoing June 12 B787 crash investigation, it raises serious questions about inspection adequacy and demands the highest level of regulatory scrutiny. ”Air India, in a statement, said: “We are aware that one of our pilots has reported a possible defect on the fuel control switch of a Boeing 787-8 aircraft. After receiving this initial information, we have grounded the said aircraft and are involving the OEM to get the pilot’s concerns checked on a priority basis. The matter has been communicated to the aviation regulator, DGCA. Air India had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the DGCA, and had found no issues. ” Boeing said: “We are in contact with Air India and are supporting their review of this matter”.",Incident occurred on Feb 1 at London Heathrow during engine start of B787 (VT- ANX) operating the 9.05pm Air India flight AI-132 to Bengaluru.

'India Showed...': Ex-Army Chief Naravane's Remarks On Galwan Clash Resurface After Lok Sabha Row

NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi's insistence on reading purported extracts from the yet-to-be published book of former Army General Manoj Mukund Naravane has shone the spotlight on the rules and regulations that restrict senior military officials from revealing classified information or crucial leadership decisions even after retirement.Senior military officials, particularly those dealing with classified information, are subject to regulations under the Official Secrets Act that restrict the publication of books or information even after retirement to prevent such classified material from becoming public.While a general one-year “cooling-off” period exists for taking up commercial or private employment, regulations for publishing secret content require prior govt clearance.""Four Stars of Destiny"", a memoir of Naravane, who was Army chief from Dec 31, 2019, to April 30, 2022, remains unpublished due to pending clearance from the defence ministry regarding sensitive details on the 2020 LAC standoff and Agnipath scheme.The book was slated to hit the stands in Jan 2024, but the Army and the defence ministry asked the publisher not to go ahead until they had reviewed its contents.There has been no official word from the publisher, author, or even the ministry on the status of the book.If the said rules and regulations are violated, govt can take legal action and such violations can also lead to the withholding of part or all of the pension of the military official concerned, as per CCS (Pension) Rules. There are chances that if the memoir is published, it could “flare up” the LAC situation with China.In May-June 2020, Indian and Chinese troops engaged in violent face-offs along the LAC in eastern Ladakh and Sikkim, most notably during the June 15, 2020, clash in Galwan Valley that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers. There were casualties on the Chinese side as well. This marked the deadliest confrontation in decades, leading to major troop escalations.Under the then General Naravane’s command, India and China held a series of ground-level talks that led to “disengagement” in a phased manner from the stand-off areas. As of today, the situation along LAC is characterised by a “thaw” following a series of disengagement agreements, yet high-level military forward deployment from both sides persists.",Rahul Gandhi's insistence on reading purported extracts from the yet-to-be published book of former Army General Manoj Mukund Naravane has shone spotlight on rules and regulations.

Ajit Pawar’s Sudden Air Crash Death Sparks Massive Shockwave Across Bollywood and Politics

Parliament panel on Ajit Pawar's death

MUMBAI: India’s charter aviation sector has grown steadily, filling a crucial gap left by airlines by connecting smaller towns & airports. But industry insiders say safety compliance across non-scheduled operators is uneven and often weaker than airline standards. Implementation of pilots' flight duty time limits, maintenance standards & weather-related decision-making vary widely between operatorsCharter flying offers speed, flexibility and access to places far beyond an airline’s scheduled network, making it the fastest way to reach remote destinations. But this convenience, which is the very core that defines charter operations, also exposes a fundamental difference in how safety is prioritised. Unlike in airline operations, decisions on whether to operate or land are often taken closer to the cockpit, where passenger urgency and convenience can weigh heavily, sometimes pushing safety to the second place.“Non-scheduled flights carry high-net-worth passengers with a fixed objective, an event, a meeting, a function. That creates immense pressure on pilots to land at the intended destination at all costs, even when diversion would be the safer option,” said Capt Manoj Hathi, former senior flight operations inspector at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).Capt R K Bali of the Business Aircraft Operators Association said India’s non-scheduled aircraft operators have a fleet of about 300 aircraft. “The need of the hour is a pre-flight open, clear communication between pilot and the passenger. The pilot should carry out an objective assessment of the risk involved for a given flight and brief the passenger especially when flying into a small uncontrolled airport with no landing aids in marginal weather conditions. The pilot should be under no duress from anyone to make the landing, because ultimately the buck stops at the pilot”.But that is often not the case. A senior pilot spoke about the pressure the crew comes under. “When a politician travels by road, traffic is stopped, junctions sealed and inconvenience is imposed on everyone else in the name of the VIP safety. When the same politician travels by air, the inconvenience quietly shifts to rest solely on the pilot. A chartered aircraft is expected to get in and get out, often to small airfields and on tight timelines because a meeting, a rally or a public appearance cannot be missed. ”Then there are other aspects that influence the safety standards in charter aircraft operations. Unlike scheduled airlines, where pilot flight duty time limitations are tightly monitored and crew can be replaced at short notice, charter operations operate with limited manpower. “There is an expectation that you should be able to fly whenever you want. Passengers are frequently late, and replacement crew are rarely available except at the main base,” said Capt Hathi. Irregular schedules also impact pilot proficiency. Charter pilots often lack the consistency that airline crew benefit from, affecting skill retention and operational discipline. The sector also struggles to retain experienced flight crew. “Many first officers and captains see charter flying as a steppingstone to airlines. Attrition is high. Many captains are older, retired from airlines, or were not selected elsewhere,” said an operator.Capt Hathi said, “Training infrastructure is another weak point. Most non-scheduled operators do not have dedicated training departments comparable to airlines, largely due to cost constraints. Refresher training and procedural updates are often left to self-study. The problem is compounded when operators maintain multiple aircraft types within small fleets, making standardisation of procedures difficult. ”Short-notice flights such as medical evacuations or emergency travel add another layer of complexity. “There is often insufficient time for proper briefing or preparation,” said a source. Compounding this, pilots in charter operations are responsible for tasks that airlines distribute across multiple departments. Flight preparation, loading calculations, technical documentation and coordination are often handled solely by pilots, meaning their effective duty begins hours before the recorded reporting time. These factors create a system where compliance depends heavily on individual operators and pilots rather than institutional safeguards as is the case with airlines.","Safety compliance across non-scheduled operators is uneven and often weaker than airline standards.

How much do genes decide

NEW DELHI: You can eat right, exercise daily and avoid every bad habit — but your genes may still have a major say on how long you live. A major new study suggests that nearly half of human lifespan is determined by genetics, challenging the belief that lifestyle and environment shape longevity the most.Published in Science, the research shows that once deaths caused by accidents, infections and other external factors are excluded, about 55% of the human lifespan is heritable, meaning that more than half of the observed variation in longevity across a population is attributable to genetics. That is a much greater proportion than the previous estimates of 10-25%, according to the research, published on Jan 29.The findings are based on an analysis of more than a century of lifespan data from large Scandinavian twin cohorts in Denmark and Sweden. Researchers studied identical and non-identical twins raised together and apart, as well as siblings of US centenarians. Most participants were born between 1870 and 1935, a period marked by high mortality from infectious diseases and accidents.By separating such “extrinsic” deaths from those linked to biological ageing, the study found the true influence of genetics on longevity had been masked. Once these external causes were accounted for, lifespan similarities between identical twins became far stronger.It also helps explain why genetic influence on lifespan appears clearer today. As deaths from infections, violence and accidents have declined over time, role of genes in determining longevity has become more visible.Indian experts say the findings carry important public health implications. Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis C-DOC, said genetics plays a major role in biological ageing but warned that Indian conditions could blunt this advantage. “About half of human lifespan is genetically determined once external causes are excluded, but poor nutrition, air pollution, and rising diabetes and obesity can override genetic advantages and accelerate biological ageing,” he said.Dr Ambrish Mithal, group chairman, Endocrinology and Diabetes, Max Healthcare, said longevity reflects a balance between inheritance and environment. “Genetics provides a broad upper limit for lifespan, while epigenetics and lifestyle determine how close one comes to that limit,” he said, explaining that environmental factors can switch genes on or off without altering DNA itself. Scientists caution the findings do not mean that lifespan is fixed at birth. Nearly half of lifespan variation is still shaped by lifestyle, healthcare access and living conditions. However, the study suggests that genes set the biological ceiling — and the environment determines whether people reach it. Researchers say the findings could reshape debates on ageing and longevity, while reinforcing the urgency of tackling risks that shorten the biological lifespan.","Major new study suggests that nearly half of human lifespan is determined by genetics.

INDORE: What a mother hears, the child remembers — or so the epics say. Abhimanyu learned how to breach a battle formation before he was born. Madhya Pradesh is turning that belief into policy with Garbh Sanskar rooms planned across govt hospitals to “educate the mind of the fetus”.These dedicated spaces are meant to guide expectant parents through prenatal care rooted in traditional Indian practices, from positive thinking and lifestyle discipline to diet and emotional well-being. The idea: shape the mind of the unborn.CM Mohan Yadav announced the initiative Sunday in Indore, placing it under the Ayushman Bharat scheme and linking it to the Union ministry of Ayush.The programme promises “structured prenatal guidance aimed at holistic foetal development”, blending Ayurveda with modern medicine. Speaking at the Divya Santan Prakalp (Divine Child Project) event, Yadav framed Garbh Sanskar as a long-term investment. “This is about nurturing a physically, mentally and ethically strong future generation,” he said. “It combines scientific understanding with India’s traditional knowledge systems. ”Future govt hospital designs will mandatorily include Garbh Sanskar rooms, he said, signalling a shift in how public healthcare approaches pregnancy.Yadav said allopathy practitioners are increasingly recognising the value of comprehensive prenatal care, while the state continues to promote normal deliveries and strengthen maternal and child health infrastructure. To underline the belief behind the project, the CM reached into the epics. Abhimanyu and Ashtavakra symbolise how learning and values can be absorbed in the womb, he said. The pandemic showed the power of integrated healthcare, where Ayurveda and allopathy worked side by side, he added.He also pointed to the scientific relevance of rural lifestyles, indigenous diets and traditional Indian kitchens.Officials said the programme will counsel couples on nutrition, mental health, emotional bonding and prenatal practices, positioning pregnancy as both a medical and cultural journey. There is, however, an unspoken caveat embedded in the very story driving the idea: mothers must stay awake for the full session. Abhimanyu learned how to enter the deadly Chakravyuha while still unborn — but not how to exit. His mother Subhadra fell asleep midway through the lesson. The result was fatal.",Madhya Pradesh is turning that belief into policy with Garbh Sanskar rooms planned across govt hospitals.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday recorded its agreement with a petitioner that mere self-declaration of caste identity by an individual during the proposed caste enumeration in 2027 could not help in accurate determination of SC, ST and OBC population.Appearing for social activist Akash Goel, advocate Mukta Gupta told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi that the directorate of census operations, which has commenced preparatory work for Census 2027, has not disclosed “any predetermined criteria or standardised methodology” for recording caste identity of people belonging to SC, ST and OBC categories during census.Since caste-enumeration would play a big role in devising and implementation of social welfare measures, reservations in govt employment and admissions to educational institutions, and delimitation of parliamentary and assembly constituencies, it should be scientifically foolproof in gathering data, the PIL petitioner said.The CJI-led bench said, “In principle we agree with you. But it is the job of the experts, and it is for them to devise the mode and the way caste enumeration is to be carried out.”Though SC did not entertain the plea, it asked Gupta to give the petition in form of representation to directorate of census operations for necessary action. In its order, the bench said, “We have no reasons to doubt that the respondent authorities, with the aid and assistance of domain experts, must have evolved a robust mechanism in order to rule out any mistake (in caste enumeration) as apprehended by the petitioner.“The petitioner has flagged relevant issues through earlier representation. We dispose of the writ petition with a direction to the respondent authorities to consider the suggestions/issues raised by the petitioner,” the court said.","Supreme Court on Monday recorded its agreement with a petitioner that mere self- declaration of caste identity by an individual during the proposed caste enumeration in 2027 could not help in accurate determination of SC, ST and OBC population.

Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta on Monday announced that the Delhi government is expecting to commission a new 105 million gallon per day (MGD) water treatment plant at Chandrawal in 2026.The pending project, aimed at strengthening the capital's water supply system, was originally approved in 2012 but faced years of delays, officials said.Charging a review meeting of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) in preparation for the upcoming summer season, Gupta stated that the new plant is expected to significantly enhance both the quality and reliability of drinking water in the city.""Once commissioned, the Chandrawal water treatment plant is expected to significantly improve the quality and reliability of drinking water supply in the city,"" Gupta said.The project will cover an area of approximately 92 square kilometres, accounting for around 6.2 per cent of Delhi's total geographical area, and is expected to benefit nearly 11 per cent of the city's population, she added further.The chief minister further informed that, constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 599 crore, the project was stalled due to repeated tender cancellations and non-compliance with guidelines of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) during the previous government's tenure.""These delays led to a cost escalation of nearly Rs 400 crore,"" she added.As part of the project, the government is also replacing water supply and distribution pipelines for Rs 1,331 crore.""Of the three distribution projects -- West Chandrawal, East Chandrawal and Central Chandrawal -- two have already been awarded,"" Gupta said further.The pipeline replacement work will span nine Assembly constituencies, covering areas such as Karol Bagh, Civil Lines, Kamla Nagar, Patel Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Naraina, New Rajendra Nagar and surrounding localities.The project also includes strengthening underground reservoirs, installation of water meters, measures to prevent contamination and the establishment of grievance redressal centres.According to the chief minister, the government aims to reduce non-revenue water losses from the current 30-45 per cent to below 15 per cent within three years. Maintenance of the newly laid pipelines will be carried out under a separate 12-year agreement.","The pending project, aimed at strengthening the capital's water supply system, was originally approved in 2012 but faced years of delays.

NEW DELHI: The CBI , in coordination with the FBI and law-enforcement agencies from the UK, Kuwait, Ireland, and Singapore, launched a multinational crackdown called “Operation CyStrike” to target transnational cyber-enabled financial crime networks operating from India and the five other participating countries, an official release said on Monday.As part of the operation, the CBI conducted searches at 35 locations on January 30 across New Delhi and Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Telangana, and West Bengal. The agency ""dismantled"" cyber-enabled financial crime networks run by accused individuals who used pseudonymous online identities to defraud victims in the six countries.During the search operations, the CBI busted and dismantled a cyber-enabled financial crime network operated from New Delhi that targeted victims in the United States. Electronic devices, including laptops, mobile phones, and computer hard disks containing incriminating digital evidence, were recovered and seized from the accused. The key operative, Pfokrehrii Peter, was arrested on the spot, the release noted.The agency also uncovered another cyber-enabled financial crime network operating from New Delhi, Ghaziabad, and Karnataka under the pretext of offering Kuwaiti e-visas and appointment letters for jobs with leading companies in Kuwait to Indian nationals in exchange for money.Searches led to the seizure of electronic devices containing fake Kuwaiti e-visas and appointment offers, while cash amounting to Rs 60 lakh was recovered from one of the accused, according to the release.In addition, the CBI dismantled mule bank accounts used to channel proceeds of crime from foreign victims to the accused.Operation CyStrike, led by the CBI, involved close coordination with Interpol as well as law-enforcement agencies from participating countries.","The CBI conducted searches at 35 locations on January 30 across New Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Telangana, and West Bengal.

KNMA’s global moment: Louvre Abu Dhabi’s Manuel Rabaté to lead Kiran Nadar museum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/knmas-global-moment-louvre-abu-dhabis-manuel-rabat-to-lead-kiran-nadar-museum/articleshow/127856045.cms,"Manuel Rabaté.

NEW DELHI: When Kiran Nadar first opened a private museum for modern and contemporary art in 2010—housed in a mall much to the surprise of the art world—her vision was clear: to make art accessible to the public and to give India a world-class museum. Now, 15 years later, that ambition is becoming reality with the appointment of Manuel Rabaté, director of Louvre Abu Dhabi, as chief executive officer and director of the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA).Rabaté’s appointment comes as KNMA prepares for its most consequential leap yet: a sprawling new campus that will put the capital on the global museum map.A veteran museum leader with more than 25 years of international experience, Rabaté shaped Louvre Abu Dhabi into the Arab world’s first universal museum, welcoming more than six million visitors since opening in 2017. Under his leadership, the museum gained global recognition for its ambitious exhibitions, international loans, and strong focus on education and capacity-building.In an earlier interview to TOI, Kiran Nadar, founder and chairperson of KNMA, had spoken of her desire to give Delhi an institution that would endure beyond her lifetime and transform the city through a cultural landmark like the Guggenheim Bilbao.“Very few architectural initiatives have been taken post-Independence,” she had said. “Delhi needs a masterpiece of architecture.”That vision grew organically from a personal journey as a collector. What began with a single painting—Rameshwar Broota’s Runners—soon expanded into one of India’s most significant collections of modern and contemporary art. Today, KNMA houses thousands of works, from contemporary stars such as Bharti Kher and Nalini Malani to modern masters including M F Husain, Tyeb Mehta and S H Raza.As Nadar, who used to be a competitive bridge player, has often acknowledged, the museum was born out of both necessity and conviction. “When the walls started filling up, I had two options: either stop buying or do something meaningful with the collection,” she had said. “Indians don’t visit museums, but I strongly feel they should be getting acquainted with the art coming out of their country.”Speaking on Rabaté’s appointment, Nadar said, “Manuel Rabaté is one of the international art world’s most experienced and respected leaders, with a ten-year record of exceptional success heading the Louvre Abu Dhabi. As we prepare to inaugurate the new, greatly expanded Kiran Nadar Museum of Art—which, at over one million square feet, will be the largest museum and cultural center in South Asia—we welcome Manuel Rabaté as a CEO and director with the vision and skills to achieve our highest aspirations. ”Since its founding, KNMA has steadily expanded both its collection and its scope—from landmark exhibitions of Indian modernists to contemporary practices, cross-cultural dialogues, and, more recently, a dedicated performing arts programme commissioning original and interdisciplinary works. Education has remained central to its mission, with more than a million students engaged through sustained school and community outreach.Rabaté’s appointment signals a new phase in this journey: the transition from a founder-led institution to globally benchmarked museum leadership. “KNMA is defining what a 21st-century museum can be—one that champions artists, inspires learners, and engages communities through innovative exhibitions and education programmes,” Rabaté said, calling the move both an honour and an opportunity.He will assume the role in early spring 2026 and will continue as director of Louvre Abu Dhabi until then. At KNMA, he will work closely with the senior leadership team to steer the institution’s next phase of growth.","Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA) is set to become the world's largest modern art museum. The new director is Manuel Rabaté, former director of the Louvre in Abu Dhabi. KNMA will be the largest museum in South Asia, with over one million square feet.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127856469,imgsize-252981,width-400,resizemode-4/feb-02-3.jpg"

NEW DELHI/JALANDHAR: In a goodwill gesture to followers of Guru Ravidas, whose Dalit followers are a sizeable presence in Punjab, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday said his govt was continuously making efforts to promote the saint’s ideals and work in accordance with them.Modi addressed the followers at Dera Sachkhand Ballan soon after naming Adampur airport after the social reformer on his birth anniversary, lauding his message of equality. “I am confident that we will continue to strengthen the roots of our society with these efforts,” he said in a message of unity to the poet-saint’s followers. His inclusion of Ravidas in the saffron tent of its lodestars, where Lord Ram sits alongside revered saints, is being seen as his effort to deepen BJP’s connect and broaden its cultural appeal.His gesture of helping the spiritual head of Dera Sachkhand Ballan, the biggest dera of Ravidassia community, climb down the stairs from the dais and help him walk along by holding his hand touched a chord among followers as well. “Hum hain na! Kam padenge kya? (I am there. Will it not be enough),” he told someone who offered to lend a land, drawing admiration.In his speech, he spoke of Ravidas’s promotion of equality among people to emphasise it was an inspiration behind his govt’s effort to build a country where everybody got respect and opportunity.Ravidas’s birth anniversary is now commemorated at a national level and many states too have recognised it, he told the gathering, drawing attention to his govt’s work to build memorials to the saint, including at his birthplace in Varanasi, Modi’s parliamentary constituency.Modi’s outreach to the Ravidassia community, who are in large numbers in Punjab while the saint enjoys following among other Dalit and disadvantaged communities in the state and outside as well, is being seen as part of his continuing efforts to deepen BJP’s bond with SCs. Dalits make up 32% of voters in Punjab, more than any other state, and are especially influential with 42% share in Doaba, the region where the dera is situated.Dera’s spiritual head Niranjan Dass was recently awarded with Padma Shri Modi said 600 years ago, Ravidas spoke for equality and helped grow a new consciousness in society, which acknowledged its weaknesses and worked to remove them, an apparent reference to social discrimination against lower castes. Modi added his govt named the airport in Ayodhya after saint Valmiki, another spiritual figure worshipped by sections of Dalits.In his speech, Modi cited the budget’s focus on sports, textile industry and MSME sectors and said Punjab will specially benefit from them due to its strong association with these fields. India’s trade deals, especially with the European Union representing 27 countries, would open up new avenues for sports goods, textiles and processed foods from the state, Modi said.",Modi addressed the followers at Dera Sachkhand Ballan soon after naming Adampur airport after the social reformer on his birth anniversary.

A Chance to Build a Future-Ready Indirect Tax System

(Jayashree Parthasarathy is Tax Partner, EY India. With contributions from Ketan Lohia, Director-tax, EY India)

India’s growth aspirations demand a tax environment that is simpler, more predictable and aligned with modern business realities. While GST and Customs digitalisation have undeniably transformed the landscape, companies continue to face operational bottlenecks that slow down activity, tie up working capital and drive up compliance costs. These factors directly affect the country’s ease of doing business.In this backdrop, the 56th GST Council meeting marked significant progress by tackling several long-standing pain points. Union Budget 2026 now has an opportunity to build on this momentum and deliver a tax ecosystem that is faster, more consistent and easier for businesses to navigate.A key long pending ask and expectation from the upcoming Budget is a more flexible and business-friendly input tax credit (ITC) system. Companies have long argued that credits representing taxes genuinely paid and used in business operations should be freely available or refunded.Two specific asks remain critical:Allowing smoother credit flow across GST registrations would also unlock meaningful liquidity for enterprises.The recent GST Council decision to treat intermediary services as exports (therefore removing the GST levy) is a welcome step and industry now awaits its formal implementation as a part of the budget process.Businesses are also expecting similar clarity for R&D and testing services, which currently attract 18% GST because place-of-performance rules prevent them from being classified as exports. A consistent and globally aligned export definition would boost India’s competitiveness in high-value service segments.Compliance complexity remains a major concern with an expectation that multiplicity of proceedings would be addressed. A single, centralised audit and faceless assessment system, similar to the efficient model used under the erstwhile service tax regime, would give pan India businesses one point of engagement, reduce repetitive scrutiny and minimise conflicting interpretations across States.Large taxpayers would particularly benefit from a centralized single point of contact approach by way of:A uniform, risk-based audit framework would further enhance consistency and limit unnecessary scrutiny. Equally important is a more calibrated enforcement approach; one that acts firmly against evasion but avoids punitive measures such as asset attachments or frequent detention of goods in cases involving interpretational differences or procedural lapses. A clearer differentiation between wilful violations and good-faith positions will go a long way in restoring business confidence.For India’s smallest enterprises, current GST registration thresholds (₹20 lakh for services and ₹40 lakh for goods) no longer reflect today’s cost structures. Near-decade-high inflation has pushed many micro-businesses into the GST net perhaps far earlier than intended. Raising the threshold to reflect current realities would preserve working capital and support MSME viability.On the Customs side, businesses continue to face prolonged timelines in dispute resolution, with legacy cases stretching for years and delaying investment decisions. A time-bound settlement mechanism, similar to earlier dispute-resolution schemes, would help clear the backlog and allow both industry and the department to focus on priority matters.Businesses are also seeking greater certainty through longer-validity advance rulings and simpler renewals, so long-term projects are not disrupted by tax disputes merely on account of lapse of time.Operational friction also remains a day-to-day challenge at the border. Even after goods are cleared, companies often face manual processes to pay differential duties or correct documents for host of reasons including price variation, corrections. Allowing digital payments and online amendments, and ensuring such payments qualify for GST credit, would reduce compliance effort and minimise cash-flow disruptions.Cross-border businesses are also looking for clearer, time-bound guidelines around Special Valuation Branch (SVB) proceedings. While scrutiny of related-party pricing is necessary, inconsistent practices often create uncertainty for global supply chains. Predictable timelines and uniform standards are essential if India is to position itself as a reliable global hub.Special Economic Zone (SEZ) units seeking to sell into the domestic market face a structural disadvantage, as duties are levied without fully recognising that these units often use domestic inputs. Aligning duty calculations to reflect only the imported content, and/ or extending select benefits available under free trade agreements, would improve capacity utilisation and offer SEZs a more level playing field vis-à-vis foreign suppliers.Budget 2026 offers an opportunity not just for incremental fixes but for meaningful reform that strengthens India’s indirect tax architecture. The foundation laid by GST and recent digitalisation efforts is robust. What businesses now need is a system that is simpler, more consistent and aligned with the needs of a rapidly expanding economy.If India gets this right, indirect tax reform can become a catalyst not only for smoother compliance, but for accelerating the country’s growth trajectory.","India’s growth aspirations demand a tax environment that is simpler, more predictable and aligned with modern business realities.

Khaby Lame and Rich Sparkle Holdings deal centers on ownership, AI plans, and long-term growth







Khaby Lame is best known for staying silent online. But this time, his business move is making a lot of noise. On January 11, 2026, Hong Kong–based Rich Sparkle Holdings announced a major business deal connected to Khaby Lame’s brand. The deal is being valued at about $975 million, which quickly led to big headlines and even bigger rumors. Some people claimed Khaby had become a billionaire overnight. Others said he had retired at just 25. Social media ran fast with the story, but not all of it was true.What actually happened is more layered and much more interesting. The deal is not cash, and Khaby did not walk away with nearly a billion dollars in hand. Instead, this agreement is about ownership, long-term plans, and a new way to turn internet fame into a global business.His estimated net worth is around $20–25 million, based on brand deals, content earnings, and business ownership, not the nearly $1 billion stock deal value.Rich Sparkle Holdings announced that it had acquired Step Distinctive Limited, a company linked to Khaby Lame’s business operations. According to the company’s official statement, the transaction was an all-stock deal valued at around $975 million.Because this was an all-stock agreement, Khaby did not receive cash. Instead, he became a major shareholder in Rich Sparkle Holdings. His wealth from this deal depends on how the company performs over time, not on money paid upfront.A key part of the partnership is the plan to create an AI-powered digital twin of Khaby Lame. This digital version would be allowed to use his face, voice, and on-screen style to make content in many languages and stream across different regions.The company says this approach helps move away from short brand deals and instead builds a system that can run at all hours, across many markets. Rich Sparkle Holdings named the United States, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia as early focus regions, with different pricing models for each area.In its public release, Rich Sparkle Holdings said it believes the model could generate over $4 billion in annual revenue, though those numbers depend on execution and audience response.After the announcement, Rich Sparkle Holdings’ stock jumped sharply. Shares rose from around $20 to over $80 in a short time, based on market trading data from the same day.Despite online rumors, there has been no official statement from Khaby Lame confirming retirement. There is also no confirmation that he is now a billionaire in liquid wealth.For now, the deal signals one thing clearly: Khaby is shifting from creator to long-term business owner, with his future tied to how well this company delivers on its plans.","Khaby Lame and Rich Sparkle Holdings deal centers on ownership, AI plans, and long-term growth.

CZI’s focus on Biohub

Gates Foundation to cut up to 500 jobs by 2030

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) – the philanthropy organisation founded by Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Prisicila Chan has cut roughly 8% of its workforce, reports Fortune. The job cut, impacting around 70 employees, comes as the company plans to expand its biomedical and science focus through Biohub. The move “underscores how big donors are racing to back science-heavy, tech-centric projects such as peers like the Gates Foundation,” the report said. For those unaware, Gates Foundation was founded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his ex-wife Melinda French Gates. The foundation, which plans to shut down in 2045, has announced to donate a whopping $9 billion in 2026 alone “primarily focused on health care and disease research.”CZI aims to concentrate its resources on Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes that aims to “cure or prevent all disease. As explained in the Fortune report, the job cuts come as CZI is stepping “a little further back from its original focus areas of education, criminal justice reform, housing, and community development” and “now needs employees with expertise in their new coverage areas”.The laid off employees will get 60-days notice period along with a severance package with 16 weeks of base pay, health insurance, and a $10,000 stipend.Biohub is a nonprofit biomedical research organization founded by Chan and Zuckerberg to help scientists cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. Established in 2016 Biohub is a key part of CZI and has an operating budget of about $1 billion per year. Since its inception, the couple has donated $4 billion to basic science research, and aims to double it in the next decade.Speaking during an event at the Biohub Imaging Institute in Redwood City in November last year, Zuckerberg said “I feel like the science work that we’ve done, the Biohub model in particular, has been the most impactful thing that we have done”. “So we want to really double down on that. Biohub is going to be the main focus of our philanthropy going forward,” quoted an Associated Press report then.In a November 2025 blog post, the couple wrote “We will continue our other philanthropic efforts as well, but the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will serve as infrastructure and support for our initiatives. There will be many challenges, but we believe that achieving some of humanity’s long-term dreams will also come within reach.”In a related news, Bill Gates has started putting in place the first major steps toward closing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s most-influential philanthropic organisation. The foundation’s board has approved a cap on operating costs, limiting them to $1.25 billion a year, or about 14% of its budget. To meet that limit, the organisation will reduce its workforce by 500, including by leaving some positions unfilled.","The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) has cut roughly 8% of its workforce.

We need to come together and develop a serious plan... We need to make sure there is enough money in the budget to tackle this problem.""Sharing the post, the Congress leader wrote, ""Over the last few days, I've read thousands of messages from Indians about what pollution is doing to their lives. What stood out was fear - fear for children, for parents, for tomorrow - felt by families in cities across India. Pollution is no longer just an environmental issue; it is a national health emergency. Parliament must discuss it. The government must act. And this Budget must put real resources behind real solutions. Indians are not asking for reports or rhetoric. They are asking for clean air.""The Budget session will span 30 sittings over 65 days, concluding on April 2.

BENGALURU: The suicide of Confident Group chairman CJ Roy during an income tax search operation at his Bengaluru office has snowballed into a political and administrative issue, with Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking the Centre's intervention to uncover the truth behind the incident.The issue of Roy's death also reverberated in Lok Sabha Monday with Ernakulam MP Hibi Eden seeking a debate on the incident and circumstances surrounding it.Highlighting media reports, Vijayan Monday wrote to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, demanding a judicial inquiry.Describing the incident as a blot on the country's tax administration, the CM said it had shocked the business community and civil society in Kerala, where the Confident Group has significant business interests. ""The circumstances under which Roy died during a search operation raise serious questions about the manner in which it was conducted,"" Vijayan said in his letter, stressing that officials are required to exercise extreme caution while initiating, conducting and concluding such intrusive actions.Referring to media reports, the CM flagged glaring lapses during the search. ""It is quite surprising that the person in whose premises the I-T department was conducting a search-and-seizure operation could gain access to a loaded firearm and shoot himself,"" Vijayan said.He pointed out that during such operations, the premises is expected to remain under the control of tax officials and ensuring safety is a minimum responsibility of the department.The Kerala CM drew attention to allegations raised by Roy's brother, CJ Babu, who claimed harassment by I-T officials. Quoting Babu's statements to the media, Vijayan said while the department will have its own version, the entire episode warranted a credible examination of the legal and administrative procedures followed during searches. ""The truth has to come out through an impartial and credible inquiry,"" he said.Arguing that a judicial probe will be the most appropriate course, Vijayan urged the Centre to constitute a commission of inquiry headed by a senior judge even as Karnataka police continue their investigation into the incident.","Confident Group chairman CJ Roy committed suicide during an income tax search operation at his Bengaluru office.

BENGALURU: A notice issued by Koira gram panchayat (GP) in Devanahalli taluk seeking Rs 12.7 lakh in pending property tax from Taiwanese electronics major Foxconn, prompted swift intervention from govt amid concerns that it could ruin investment climate in the state.The GP, in its notice dated Jan 7, also asked the company to submit documents related to the construction of its manufacturing unit spread across two villages — Doddagollahalli and Aruvanahalli — covering 5.3lakh sq metres. The notice said official records still showed the land as vacant and reflected no construction activity in the area.The notice states: ""However, it has been found that construction of buildings have already happened and the unit has started functioning. As such is the case, we seek you to submit the documents, including building plan approval, for verification of the property within seven days of receiving this notice (sic).""As soon as the notice came to light, both industries department and rural development and panchayat raj departments stepped in to ""douse the fire"". Last week, Karnataka Industries Area Development Board (KIADB) is said to have issued an order to the GP stating Foxconn falls under a special investment region (SIR) and is answerable only to it on property and land-related matters, including property tax payments.As per SIR provisions, 70% of taxes collected are to be used to develop the surrounding area, while the remaining 30% will be transferred to the jurisdictional GP.Late Monday, KIADB asked Foxconn to deposit property tax for 2025-2026 and arrears, if any, for 2024-2025 via its new web portal.

India plans underground rail in strategic ‘chicken’s neck’ corridor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/india-plans-underground-rail-in-strategic-chickens-neck-corridor/articleshow/127869068.cms,"BJP-Cong Parliament Showdown, Sheikh Hasina Convicted Again, CBI Operation CyStrike And More





GUWAHATI: India will soon lay underground railway tracks along the Siliguri corridor in West Bengal, a narrow strip of land that connects India’s northeast with the rest of the country, Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced on Monday.Known as the “chicken’s neck,” the corridor is barely 20 km–25 km wide at its narrowest point and is considered one of India’s most vulnerable strategic zones. The corridor is flanked by Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh, with China looming beyond.The move comes as Bangladesh’s interim leadership under Muhammad Yunus, along with several nationalist organizations, has openly spoken of “choking the chicken’s neck” to cut off India’s Northeast. Some voices have gone further, framing the region as part of a vision of “Greater Bangladesh.” Dhaka’s outreach to China near the Teesta River project has only deepened Indian concerns, with analysts warning that the rhetoric is not mere provocation but part of a geopolitical play.Vaishnaw, speaking via video conference on the union budget allocation for the railway ministry, with reporters here said, “There is special planning for the 40-km strategic corridor connecting the North East with the rest of the country.The planning is on to lay underground railway tracks and make the existing tracks four-line.”Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) General Manager Chetan Kumar Shrivastava added that the underground stretch will run between Tin Mile Haat and Rangapani stations in West Bengal. “This underground stretch is important from a security point of view,” he said.For India, the corridor has long been seen as its Achilles’ heel. During the 2017 Doklam standoff, military planners openly talked about the vulnerability of the Siliguri stretch. Any disruption here could isolate the Northeast, severing vital supply lines and troop movement. Bangladesh’s recent statements have revived those fears, underscoring the need for hardened infrastructure.By burying tracks underground and expanding capacity, New Delhi aims to ensure uninterrupted connectivity even in times of crisis. The plan is not just about railways—it is about signalling resolve. India is determined that its northeastern lifeline will not be jeopardized by external threats or internal vulnerabilities.Bangladesh’s rhetoric, meanwhile, has stirred debate in Dhaka itself. While nationalist groups push the “Greater Bangladesh” narrative, others warn that such posturing risks destabilizing ties with India, its largest neighbor and trading partner. Yet the symbolism of the chicken’s neck remains potent: a reminder that geography can be weaponized in South Asia’s fragile security landscape.",India will soon lay underground railway tracks along the Siliguri corridor in West Bengal.

KOLKATA: Bengali- and Assamese-style chicken curry became available on the Kamakhya-Howrah Vande Bharat sleeper from Sunday, days after a ""veg-only"" menu whipped up a political row.The ""non-veg"" menu, however, was limited to chicken only. In the vegetarian menu, paneer masala would replace the chicken. The full spread includes jeera corn pulao, tehtar paratha, a mixed arhar–moong dal, Assamese-style beans and rosogolla for dessert.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced the introduction of non-vegetarian food on the iconic train on Sunday. The railways launched the fare soon after.Uday Shankar Jha, principal chief commercial manager, Eastern Railway, told TOI: ""Non-vegetarian fare was available on the Kamakhya-Howrah Vande Bharat since Sunday.""IRCTC, in an order dated Jan 31, said: ""Based on passenger feedback received in train 27575-76 dated Jan 29, 2026, it was decided that, for the non-vegetarian option, only a chicken dish (50-60 gms boneless and 70 gms gravy) shall be served in place of a vegetarian dish under sleeper VB with effect from 1.2.2026 from both ends, Kamakhya and Howrah.The rest of the menu remains the same as vegetarian. The revision was finalised to ensure uniformity in meal service, better passenger convenience and streamlined operational implementation across the route. ""The IRCTC order added: ""In view of the above, it is requested that the same may kindly be apprised to the Railway Board for necessary updating in the ticket booking/meal preference option in the reservation system, so that passengers are clearly provided with the correct option at the time of booking tickets.""The train, flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Jan 17, commenced its regular run from Kamakhya station in Guwahati on Jan 22 and from Howrah the next day. However, a section of passengers raised the issue of ""only vegetarian"" food being served on board the 6-day-a-week overnight train.Trinamool also raised the issue and accused BJP of ""policing plates"". While TMC and other opposition parties in Bengal continued to step up the heat on the govt for ""trying to control food habits"", Bengal BJP stayed away from the controversy, claiming that Railways decides the menu on the train. Junior Union minister Sukanta Majumdar, however, spoke to Vaishnaw last week to start non-vegetarian food, keeping in mind the food habits of the people in Bengal.Earlier, the railways had promised that the food served to passengers on board the Vande sleeper will have the flavour of Assamese cuisine for the train departing from Kamakhya and the local cuisine of Bengal for the train departing from Howrah. The local cuisines of both Bengal and Assam have a heavy imprint of non-vegetarian dishes, including both fish and meat preferences.","Bengali- and Assamese-style chicken curry became available on the Kamakhya- Howrah Vande Bharat sleeper from Sunday.

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat police probe into the recently busted inter-state child trafficking racket revealed that skin colour was a key determinant in deciding the child's ‘market value', followed closely by gender. Infants with a fair complexion fetched a higher price of Rs 6-7 lakh, while a dark-skinned child sold for Rs 2-3 lakh.The inter-state child-selling racket between Gujarat and Telangana was recently busted by the Ahmedabad crime branch and Gujarat Anti-terrorism Squad (ATS).Sources in the crime branch confirmed that fair-complexioned children were priced up to Rs 7 lakh each, while those with darker complexions fetched Rs 2-3 lakh each. Sources said there was a greater premium on the male child—girl children were sold for Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh each, while boy children were offered for Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh each. The racket came to light after a police operation on Jan 29 led to the rescue of a newborn who was transported from Himmatnagar towards Hyderabad.Acting on specific intelligence, a crime branch team intercepted a car near Ahmedabad airport. A newborn was found in the vehicle, following which 4 persons were arrested.The accused were identified as Vandana Panchal (34), Sumit Yadav (27), and Maulik Dave (32) of Ahmedabad, and Roshan Agrawal (42) of Hyderabad.Police said the accused were part of a larger network that sourced infants from vulnerable families in Gujarat and supplied them to buyers in Telangana.The newborn was placed under medical care, as efforts to trace her biological parents continued. Police identified the area from where the infant was allegedly bought but so far found no leads on her parents' identity.During interrogation, the accused told investigators that the newborn was purchased near Himmatnagar for Rs 3.6 lakh and was meant to be ""resold"" in Hyderabad to an agent identified only as Nagraj.Cash, mobile phones, and the vehicle of the accused were seized. Digital data is being analysed to trace contacts and payments.Amid the widened probe, police determined that at least 10 children from Banaskantha and Vav-Tharad districts were allegedly sold to childless couples in Hyderabad. Investigators said the gang primarily targeted tribal pockets of north Gujarat, where poverty and the lack of support made families easy targets.A senior crime branch officer told TOI, ""These accused persons identified childless couples with the help of their acquaintances in IVF centres in Hyderabad."" The officer said, ""After identifying a couple willing to pay for a baby, the accused hunted for a child—mostly fair-skinned and good-looking, as stipulated by societal norms.""Police said many of the trafficked children were born out of wedlock. ""The parents of such babies wanted to get rid of them,"" the officer said. In a few cases, parents died and relatives sold the children to the accused.Officers said the investigation is now focused on the money trail and the role of IVF centre contacts and agents operating across state lines.Cases were registered under the BNS and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.",The inter-state child-selling racket between Gujarat and Telangana was recently busted by the Ahmedabad crime branch.

India-US Trade Deal: Critical Questions Unanswered

India-US trade deal: Even as US President Donald Trump has announced an immediate reduction in tariff rate on India to 18%, think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) has struck a cautious note on what the deal could mean for India.In a note post post Trump and PM Narendra Modi’s posts on social media platforms, Ajay Srivastava, founder of GTRI said: Caution, not celebration, is warranted.Trump’s Truth Social post on the trade deal made several claims; India will stop buying Russian oil, India will step up purchase of US oil, India may buy oil from Venezuela, India has agreed to reduce tariff on US products to 0%, India has agreed to spend $500 billion on US energy, technology etc. None of these claims has been officially confirmed by India.Also Read | Lower than Pakistan, China: In trade deal with US, India secures a favourable tariff rate GTRI says that several important questions related to the India-US trade deal remain unanswered. ”Trump says US tariffs will fall from 25% to 18%. However, since the post also refers to India stopping Russian oil purchases—linked earlier to punitive tariffs—it is unclear whether the cut is actually from 50% to 18%, or whether Trump misstated the starting tariff level,” says GTRI.Reports quote White House officials saying that the 25% tariff linked to Russian crude will also be removed.The US has already agreed to reciprocal tariff rates of 10% for the UK, 15% for the EU and Japan, 19% for Indonesia and Malaysia, and 20% for Bangladesh and Vietnam under trade agreements concluded between May and October 2025, GTRI notes.Additionally, even after the India-US deal, certain levies will remain unchanged. Section 232 duties of 50% on steel, aluminium, copper and similar products will continue, as will a 25% tariff on select auto components. At the same time, zero-duty treatment will remain in place for pharmaceuticals, aircraft and aircraft parts, as well as some mechanical and electronic items.Trump has claimed that India will eliminate both tariff and non-tariff barriers on American products, but his remarks do not clarify the scope of goods covered by this pledge.“India has previously resisted opening sensitive sectors such as food grains, genetically modified products, and other regulated imports,” says GTRI.Trump has also claimed that India will purchase more than $500 billion worth of US goods. Currently, India’s yearly imports of merchandise and energy from the US are below $50 billion.Also Read | India-US trade deal announced by US President Donald Trump; check details “Reaching $500 billion would likely require more than 20 years, suggesting the figure refers to a long-term aspiration rather than a near-term commitment,” GTRI adds.According to Ajay Srivastava, India should resist the temptation to celebrate President Trump’s trade announcement prematurely.“The headline figure of $500 billion in US purchases also lacks credibility without a timeframe. India’s current annual imports from the US are under $50 billion, suggesting this is, at best, a long-term aspiration rather than a binding obligation,” he says.“Trade deals are serious business. Until there is a joint statement, negotiated text, and clarity on enforceability, this should be treated as a political signal—not a concluded trade deal. Caution, not celebration, is warranted,” he concludes.",US President Donald Trump has announced an immediate reduction in tariff rate on India to 18%.

NEW DELHI: The Buddh International Circuit (BIC) in Greater Noida could again host Formula One races, with the global motorsport event possibly returning to India after it was last held in 2013. The govt has encouraged the track owners to hand over the facility to a sports management company for a certain number of years to host the India round of the championships.It’s been learnt that sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya met officials from the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) last week and told them to carry out efforts to get the Grand Prix back to India. The plan to revive F1 races are part of the govt’s efforts to bring global sports championships to India ahead of the 2030 Commonwealth Games, which the country will be hosting in Ahmedabad, and to strengthen its bid for the 2036 Olympics.YEIDA presently owns and maintains the Rs 2,000 cr F1 racing facility at BIC after its original owners, Jaypee Group, declared themselves bankrupt in June 2024. “The minister went to see the F1 track recently and held discussions with the promoters about when the latest race can be held.He told the track owners to hand over the facility to a sports management company for 2-3 years, which will work on the sport’s comeback to India. There had been tax issues in the past which stopped hosting F1 races, but they will be resolved soon,” a ministry source said.The F1 Indian Grand Prix was held for three seasons, from 2011 to 2013, before it was discontinued due to tax disputes and a lack of govt recognition as a sport. The Uttar Pradesh state govt classified the event as “entertainment”, leading to tax burdens, import duties on F1 cars and financial unviability on team owners.In 2023, the BIC played host to the inaugural MotoGP Bharat event from Sept 22-24, but the races were subsequently discontinued.","The Buddh International Circuit (BIC) in Greater Noida could again host Formula One races.

""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)





NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Successful bidders have 10 working days after the auction closes to complete payment, in cash for amounts up to Dh50,000 or by manager’s cheque or credit card for larger sums.Dubai’s vehicle number plates are more than just identifiers. They have become symbols of status, individuality and even investment potential. Unique or easily memorable combinations, especially those with fewer digits, often command strong interest and high bids from collectors, car enthusiasts and business owners alike. Last year’s auctions illustrate just how lucrative and competitive these events can be: distinctive numbers have historically sold for millions of dirhams, with some rare plates like AA17 fetching over Dh8 million and total auction revenues reaching into the tens of millions.These auctions not only give buyers the chance to stand out on the roads but also reflect an evolving luxury culture where plates are viewed as status symbols, similar to personalised accessories or exclusive registrations seen in other global cities.

For instance, a previous auction saw the plate AA17 sell for Dh8.02 million, contributing to total auction revenues of over Dh69 million. Other combinations also commanded high bids, showing that the market for distinctive plates can be robust, especially when collectors target rare sequences.These historical successes set the stage for high expectations in the 2026 auction.

"‘Hired green card, US citizen drivers’: Sikh truck company owner after losing employees as California revoked thousands of licences",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hired-green-card-us-citizen-drivers-sikh-truck-company-owner-after-losing-employees-as-california-revoked-thousands-of-licences/articleshow/127869696.cms,"



When California cancelled thousands of commercial trucking licences a few months ago, Sikh owner Bikramjeet Singh Gill watched his Stockton truck yard fall silent.Trucks that once rolled out each morning now sit idle, unused and unpaid.Gill runs Gillson Trucking Inc. and said around 35 of his immigrant drivers were told lastyear that the California Department of Motor Vehicles was cancelling their commercial driver’s licences. They were gone overnight.“We have lost nearly $2 million in the last four months while paying $200,000 monthly to the bank and insurers for 35 parked trucks. The banks don’t wait,” Gill was quoted as saying to CalMatters.The cancellations followed a September audit by the Trump administration, which cracked down on over 17,000 California commercial licences held by immigrants. The audit found that some licences had expiration dates that extended beyond drivers’ legal authorisation to live and work in US. California later notified those drivers that their licences would be revoked.New federal rules introduced last year could eventually take away licences from up to 61,000 immigrant truck drivers across the country.The impact has fallen heavily on California’s Sikh community. Industry groups estimate about 35 per cent of the state’s commercial drivers are Sikh, many of them based in the Central Valley. Truck driving has long provided stable income for Sikh immigrants who often took loans and had to pay debt to settle in US.The Sikh Coalition has filed a lawsuit challenging California’s decision to cancel non-domicile commercial licences. The group says the move unfairly targets immigrant drivers.“When someone loses their CDL, they lose their livelihood,” said Munmeeth Kaur, the Sikh Coalition’s legal director.The Trump administration has defended the crackdown and has threatened to withhold transportation funding from California over 'delays' in cancelling licences.US transportation secretary Sean Duffy earlier this month said: “It’s a day for Gavin Newsom and California. Our demands were simple: follow the rules, revoke the unlawfully-issued licenses to dangerous foreign drivers, and fix the system so this never happens again.""Gill said in October, nearly 100 trucks sat parked at his depot.“It totally devastated us,” he said.He added: “Slowly, some drivers returned to work because they also have mortgages and financial obligations. We have hired green card or U.S. citizen drivers.”Gill said companies followed state rules when hiring. “Acording to the law, if someone has work authorization and valid licenses then we can hire him.

Pakistan and Bangladesh on Thursday resumed direct air connectivity after a 14-year suspension, marking a move towards improving bilateral ties as Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated its inaugural Dhaka–Karachi flight.The flight, BG341, landed at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport at 11.03 pm after departing Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 8.15 pm, according to flight tracking data cited by Dawn. The aircraft received a traditional water cannon salute on arrival, the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said in a statement .Speaking to reporters at the airport, Sindh governor Kamran Tessori said cooperation between the two countries would extend beyond aviation to other sectors.Earlier in the day, Pakistan’s high commission in Dhaka said the “fully packed” inaugural flight was seen off by Bangladesh’s civil aviation and tourism adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, Pakistan high commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider, and other officials .Addressing the ceremony in Dhaka, Sheikh Bashiruddin said the Dhaka–Karachi route aimed at “enhancing connectivity, promoting tourism and strengthening people-to-people links”.He added, “Bangladesh Airlines will gradually increase flight frequency and reduce airfares to make travel more affordable for the people” .Pakistan’s high commissioner referred to discussions between Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus and prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on restoring air links.“In view of the vision of the leadership and aspirations of the people of our two countries… both sides agreed to take immediate measures for the resumption of direct flights,” he said, referring to talks held during deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar’s visit to Dhaka in August last year .Direct flights between the two countries had been suspended since 2012, forcing travellers to rely on connecting routes via Gulf hubs such as Dubai and Doha. The two nations, once part of a single country before the 1971 war, are geographically separated by about 1,500 km of Indian territory .Biman Bangladesh Airlines said the twice-weekly flights would “play a significant role in promoting trade and commerce, expanding educational exchanges, and fostering cultural ties between the two countries” .Mohammad Shahid, one of the 150 passengers on the inaugural Karachi-bound flight, said the resumption would make travel easier. “We had been waiting for such an opportunity because we travel continuously,” he told AFP. “There are so many people waiting in Pakistan to come here, and some waiting here to go there” .Bilateral ties have shown signs of improvement since the change of government in Bangladesh in 2024, even as Dhaka’s relations with India have cooled. Cargo shipping between Karachi and Chittagong resumed in November 2024, alongside increased trade, cultural exchanges and medical travel, AFP reported .","Pakistan and Bangladesh resume direct air connectivity after a 14-year suspension.
