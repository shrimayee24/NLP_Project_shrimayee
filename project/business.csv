NEW DELHI: India faces an uphill task to save Bhoj wetland in Bhopal from being delisted from a global list of ‘wetlands of international importance’.The country will have to take a plea of “urgent national interests” in its response to the Ramsar Convention secretariat that sought clarification from it on the matter. India’s claim will then be scrutinised with a reality check on the ground by the Secretariat that designated the Bhoj wetland as a Ramsar site in August, 2002.last week reported that Bhoj wetland faces the risk of being delisted from the prestigious global list due to possible damage to its ecological character . Concerned citizens reported the matter to the Ramsar Convention secretariat, flagging how the proposed road project cutting through the catchment area will threaten not only the wetland but also the wildlife and other water bodies.The Switzerland-based secretariat in response to a question toldthis week that it’s still waiting for a response from the Indian govt on this matter.“Based on a third party report, the secretariat has informed the National Focal Point a concern for possible change in the ecological character of Bhoj wetland and we are waiting for a response from the Govt of India on this matter in accordance with Article 2.5 and Article 3.2 of the Convention,” said Beom-Sik Yoo, senior advisor (Asia/Oceania), secretariat of the Convention on Wetlands, in his email response.Bhoj Wetland, consists of two man-made reservoirs (Upper and Lower Lakes), is one of the 82 such sites in India designated as Ramsar sites for conservation and management of wetlands under globally accepted framework. The Union environment ministry is the national focal point on the issue in India.Under provisions of the Ramsar Convention, the country will have to convince the secretariat as to why its proposed project is needed in “urgent national interests” (Article 2.5) and how it won’t change the ecological character of the Bhoj wetland (Article 3.2).Experts at the secretariat will examine India’s clarification and send its report to a standing committee. Delisting will happen only if India fails to convince the Committee based on the ground report. It is learnt that the issue may also impact Bhopal’s proposed nomination for ‘Wetland City Accreditation’ under the Ramsar Convention.","Bhoj wetland faces the risk of being delisted from the prestigious global list due to possible damage to its ecological character.

The crew told flyers the aircraft had suffered a technical snag.Comments have been sought from IndiGo and are awaited.The flight, 6E 1406, was to take off from the UAE at 12.20 am. A passenger who was on this flight said: “We took off with a delay of 40 minutes with 129 passengers and six crew members. Even at take off time, the aircraft was vibrating a lot. Some passengers seated in the emergency exit row heard noise as if a door was getting open and shut. For the next one hour, the seat belt sign was not switched off and everyone remained seated. Subsequently, the pilot announced there’s some technical problem and that we were diverting to Muscat .”Once the aircraft landed safely in Muscat, passengers say they remained on board for an hour with technical teams trying to rectify the snag. “Some passengers now started asking for refreshments. The air hostess (the lead one) pointed out there were limited food items on the aircraft as IndiGo is not a full service airline (that has meals & beverages for all). She requested to save the limited meals for the old and very young passengers apart from those with medical conditions just in case the waiting inside the aircraft was going to be a long one. Some food items were given to other passengers,” said some on board the aircraft, while praising the lead cabin attendant for the way she handled the situation.Later passengers were asked to alight from the plane. “We did not have an Oman visa and were waiting inside the terminal when the crew of our flight came. They told us the aircraft had suffered a hydraulic snag and that’s why they decided to divert to Oman,” some passengers, who did not wish to be named, said.In about 2.5 hours, IndiGo managed to take the non-Oman visa holders to a transit hotel at the airport. “Now we are waiting to be flown to Delhi,” said a passenger at 3.30 pm Monday (India time).","The flight, 6E 1406, was to take off from the UAE at 12.20 am.

'Confident that Bihar would get a special package'

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday stated that Bihar's demand for ""special category status"" is not made out as it has been considered and rejected in the past. This comes a day after all parties of the state, including two allies of the BJP - Nitish Kumar 's Janata Dal (United) and Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party, renewed their demand for special category status to the state in the all-party meeting ahead of Monsoon Session of Parliament.""The request of Bihar for Special Category Status was considered by an inter-ministerial group (IMG) which submitted its Report on March 30, 2012. The IMG came to the finding that based on existing NDC criteria, the case for Special Category Status for Bihar is not made out,"" minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said in a written reply to a question from Ramprit Mandal , JD(U) MP from Bihar's Jhanjharpur.""Special category status for plan assistance was granted in the past by the National Development Council (NDC) to states based on some features necessitating special consideration.

It was hoped that Nitish Kumar's old demand would be met by the BJP-led government. With the special status demand central to state's politics, the Centre's reply will put the chief minister on the defensive vis-a-vis the opposition in the state.RJD chief Lalu Prasad was quick to attack Nitish Kumar and demanded the chief minister's resignation. RJD called it blatant dishonesty with people of Bihar and said it will fight for special status for the state. ""When this government was formed with the support of 2 AB (Andhra Pradesh and Bihar), we thought that Bihar's demand would be fulfilled.

Disabled candidate not given any service despite clearing UPSC 4 times,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/disabled-candidate-not-given-any-service-despite-clearing-upsc-4-times/articleshow/111895006.cms,"NEW DELHI:

'Cerebral palsy allowed for IAS, why not muscular dystrophy?

In the midst of the row over trainee IAS officer Puja Khedkar allegedly misusing the disability quota, a case has surfaced of a candidate with muscular dystrophy being denied any service despite having cleared the civil services four times.Kartik Kansal, who studied mechanical engineering in IIT Roorkee, is currently a scientist in Isro, a post for which he was selected through all-India central recruitment.Kartik, who has been using a wheelchair since the age of 14, was selected for the civil services four times - in 2019 (rank 813), 2021 (271), 2022 (784) and 2023 (829).In 2021, when he was ranked 271, even without a disability quota he ought to have got the IAS, since that year those ranked 272 and 273 got IAS. However, in 2021, muscular dystrophy was not included in the list of conditions in functional classification eligible for IAS.Muscular dystrophy was included in the list for Indian Revenue Service (income Tax) Group A and Indian Revenue Service (Customs and Excise), which were his second and third choices.In 2019, when Kartik Kansal got 813 rank, he could easily have been allotted a service as there were 15 vacancies for locomotor disability and only 14 were filled. In 2021, there were seven vacancies in the locomotor disability category and only four were filled. He ranked number one in the category.The medical board in AIIMS certified that he had muscular weakness and both his arms and legs were affected by muscular dystrophy. Inexplicably, for IAS, persons with both arms and legs affected are eligible but persons with muscular dystrophy are not. The board noted that he ""can do manipulation with fingers with difficulty and can do mobility with motorised wheelchair"". It also certified that he could see, hear speak, communicate, read and write though he could not stand, walk, pull, push, lift, crouch, bend, kneel, jump or climb. Though his original disability certificate put his level of disability at 60%, the AIIMS medical board deemed it 90%.A retired IAS officer, Sanjeev Gupta, took up Kartik's cause and tweeted in his support pointing out that it was a travesty of justice that Kartik who wrote the civil services without even using a scribe except for help in going to the toilet, and who met all the physical requirements for the job of IAS and IRS was not given any service.When he sought the reason for rejection through the central portal for grievance redressal, he got a reply stating: ""PWBD candidates are allocated service as per the functional classification and physical requirements prescribed by different cadre controlling authorities. There were no matching services at your turn as per your rank.""""Why should functional classifications and physical requirements for similar nature of work vary across services? If cerebral palsy is allowed for IAS, why not muscular dystrophy? Thankfully, since 2024 everything has been merged into one. There will be no such errors now. As per the new merged criteria too, Kartik is eligible to get IAS and true justice will be done by giving him IAS if there is a carry forward vacancy from previous years. This will partly undo the injustice meted out to him till now,"" said Gupta.""By joining the civil services, I wanted to prove that even people like me can do it. But I cannot comment further on the issue since it is sub judice,"" said Kartik, whose case pertaining to this issue is pending in Central Administrative Tribunal.","Kartik Kansal has been using a wheelchair since the age of 14. He was selected for the civil services four times - in 2019 (rank 813), 2021 (271), 2022 (784) and 2023 (829) In 2021, when he was ranked 271, even without a disability quota he ought to have got the IAS.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111895386,imgsize-1111128,width-400,resizemode-4/111895386.jpg"

Making one single roll of toilet paper uses 1.5 pounds of wood, 37 gallons of water and 1.3 kwh of electricity,"" the survey quotes a report.It suggests that advanced countries learn from some of the poor and developing nations in Asia where they have adopted a more nature friendly lifestyle when it comes to maintaining basic hygiene.""Many Asian countries provide valuable lessons around these, yet their non-capitalist strategies often remain excluded from mainstream discussions because behavioural and lifestyle change seems to be more difficult than climate change ,"" the published report said.It also points out how the developed world is reluctant to focus on the impact of their 'consumption-oriented lifestyle'.

Government rules out Bihar special status sought by JD(U),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-rules-out-bihar-special-status-sought-by-jdu/articleshow/111937711.cms,"NEW DELHI: BJP-led central govt has ruled out special category status for Bihar , turning down the demand of ally JD(U), a decision which will have implications for a similar demand from another ally, TDP , for Andhra Pradesh.The stand was conveyed by junior finance minister Pankaj Chaudhary in a written reply to JD(U) MP Rampreet Mandal. Calling ""special category"" a Planning Commission term, Shambhavi Choudhary of LJP said states have benefited from special packages instead.Centre has ruled out special category status for Bihar, turning down the demand of BJP’s ally JDU, , a decision which will also have implications for a similar insistence by another coalition partner, TDP, for Andhra Pradesh.Though the decision is significant because of the cruciality of Lok Sabha numbers of TDP and JDU for Modi govt, it is a reiteration of Centre’s known stance, was expected, and is unlikely to cause political risks; at least not in the near run.Centre’s stand, conveyed by junior finance minister Pankaj Chaudhary in a written reply to JDU member Rampreet Mandal, is based on recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission, which had cited the increase in devolution of central funds to states — from 32% to 42% — to call for doing away with the scheme for special category status, a measure devised to support backward states with incentives like tax concessions to industries willing to make investments in their jurisdictions.Both TDP and JDU appear to have factored this in their political calculus. During his interactions with BJP, Andhra CM and TDP chief, N Chandra Babu Naidu has appeared to be more focused on central assistance for projects such as development of Amaravati as the new capital to substitute for Hyderabad and Polavaram dam project. At the all-party meeting on Sunday, TDP representative Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu did not raise the issue, much to the apparent annoyance of Congress, which has appeared to be egging on the party not to lower the ante on the issue.The same meeting saw JDU working president and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Jha reiterating Bihar CM Nitish Kumar’s demand for special category, while also showing empathy for Centre’s stand and indicating his party could settle down for central assistance for fighting floods.Predictably, Lalu Prasad’s RJD seized upon Centre’s stand to taunt JDU. “Nitish Kumar has assured special status for Bihar. Since Centre has refused, he should resign immediately,” said Lalu.However, Union minister Giriraj Singh retaliated by pointing out that Lalu kept mum when UPA denied special category status to Bihar. “When RJD is raising this issue, it makes me laugh. When Lalu bhaiya used to be called a ‘kingmaker’ and he was playing in the lap of Congress, he could have got the special category status to Bihar,” Singh said.In a written reply, Pankaj Chaudhary said special category status was granted in the past by NDC to some states which were characterised by a number of features necessitating special consideration which included — hilly and difficult terrain, low population density or sizeable share of tribal population, strategic location along borders with neighbouring countries, economic and infrastructural backwardness and non-viable nature of state finances.The decision was taken based on a consideration of all the factors listed above and the peculiar situation of a state, the minister said.LJP (RV) MP Shambhavi Choudhary said, “Special status was a term that existed until the Planning Commission. After formation of Niti Aayog, nobody was provided anything under special category status but states have definitely received special package that would speed up development...”","BJP-led central govt has ruled out special category status for Bihar.

"Survey upbeat on economy, backs more freedom for business",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/survey-upbeat-on-economy-backs-more-freedom-for-business/articleshow/111937652.cms,"Also See:

NEW DELHI: Five years ago, when Nirmala Sitharaman took over as finance minister, she appeared uncertain amid criticism of waning growth, resulting in a series of post-Budget announcements, including a massive cut in corporate tax. As she presents a record seventh straight budget, the Modi’s govt’s economic report card presented an economy which is on a strong footing – projecting a 6.5-7% growth this year – with robust public finances, riding on high tax collections and improved quality of spending.The contrast could not have been sharper and has been laid out vividly in the Economic Survey 2023-24 tabled in Parliament on Monday.The Survey, meant to be a comprehensive official account of the financial year gone by, did flag the challenges confronting the economy – from the geopolitical situation, resulting in greater protectionism, to climate change and the impact of artificial intelligence, and its possible impact on jobs – but sounded more comfortable with the inflation trajectory, stating that India had handled the price situation better than peers and the short-term outlook was benign.The Survey stood out from its predecessors in its candid acknowledgement of several bumps that the govt needs to navigate to ensure sustained growth over a quarter century. It highlighted how compliance burden and approvals were hobbling economic activity and underlined the need for “letting go as part of good governance”.“The Indian state can free up its capacity and enhance its capability to focus on areas where it has to by letting go of its grip in areas where it does not have to.“The Economic Survey highlights the prevailing strengths of our economy and also showcases the outcomes of the various reforms our govt has brought. It also identifies areas for further growth and progress as we move towards building a Viksit Bharat,” said PM Modi on microblogging site X.Of course, employment has been identified as a challenge, with the document underlining the need to create 78.5 lakh non-farm jobs annually until 2030, while suggesting that the Centre alone cannot deal with the issue. “It is worth reiterating that job creation happens mainly in the private sector. Second, many (not all) of the issues that influence economic growth, job creation and productivity and the actions to be taken therein are in the domain of the state govts.”Chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran, also waded into the debate on inequality by citing data to argue that as India’s GDP expanded 12 times since 1993, per capita income also increased seven-fold between FY1990 and FY2024: a pointed rebuttal to Thomas Piketty and his acolytes. Nageswaran is confident about the trend continuing as he projected a healthy growth rate up to 2047.However, he also signalled his sensitivity to the rich-poor gap, flagging the role of tax policies as a possible solution, and AI as a disruptor which could add to the challenge. “Tax policies on the treatment of capital and labour incomes will likely play a more important role in the coming years, especially since the deployment of technology like AI may have a more deleterious impact on employment and income.”“The licensing, inspection and compliance requirements that all levels of the government continue to impose on businesses is an onerous burden. Relative to history, the burden has lightened. Relative to where it ought to be, it is still a lot heavier. The burden is felt more acutely by those least equipped to bear it – small and medium enterprises. It holds them back, leashes their aspirations, and, in the process, holds the country back,” Nageswaran said in the preface of the sedate economic analysis. The compliance burden on SMEs is seen to be particularly heavy.Apart from jobs, inequality and deregulation, the nine-point policy thrust for the short- and medium-term – some of which may be addressed by Sitharaman in the budget on Tuesday – included a focus on skilling as just around half the youth is deemed employable.It also called for tapping the full potential of the farm sector by targeting higher yields and land consolidation, crop diversification and better price discovery.Besides, it sought to draw attention to the policy on China, where govt has imposed restrictions, arguing that boosting FDI from the neighboring nation with which India is engaged in a border dispute, could help bridge the mounting trade deficit and also integrate domestic companies into the global value chain. The observation came in the backdrop of slowing FDI inflows.On the critical issue of energy transition, the Survey recommended an India-specific approach and also cautioned about protectionism in climate change policies in the developed world.“Over the last 10 years, the visionary policies of Modi Ji have placed Bharat at the pinnacle of economic growth. The survey documents Bharat’s rise to the pedestal of the fastest-growing major economy while prominently outlining its future trajectory to emerge as a developed nation,” home minister Amit Shah tweeted.",The Economic Survey 2023-24 was tabled in Parliament on Monday. The document underlined the need to create 78.5 lakh non-farm jobs annually until 2030.

The Ratna Bhandar, closed for 46 years, was reopened by the Odisha government on July 14 for restoration and inventory.“We found some ancient idols in Ratna Bhandar on July 14.We have now come across a few swords and javelins near a wooden chest within the inner chamber. The weapons were very heavy and had turned black,” said one of the 11 committee members who entered the treasury.Ratna Bhandar supervisory committee chairman Biswanath Rath told journalists that they have “carefully sealed and preserved the battle items in the temporary strongroom.”Rath, a retired Orissa High Court judge, did not divulge details about the weapons, their numbers, or the era to which they belonged.The discovery of the weapons sheds light on the 12th-century CE shrine’s connection to the kings who ruled the region, offering a glimpse into the treasures they accumulated over centuries.Anantavarman Chodaganga Dev of the Eastern Ganga dynasty built the Puri temple in the 1190s, according to sources in the Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA). The 214-foot-tall temple is spread over 10.7 acres with 95 subsidiary shrines on its premises.“Jagannath Temple had been invaded and plundered 18 times. For the invaders, the temple was a lucrative source of wealth. To protect the temple, the then kings may have kept the ancient weapons in the Ratna Bhandar,” said Shyama Mahapatra, a temple servitor.According to Jagannath researcher Bhaskar Mishra, “King Kapilendra Deb in 1460 had emerged victorious over another ruler and used 16 elephants to transport a substantial amount of gold to Puri Jagannath Temple.”Historians and heritage researchers have demanded a proper study of the recovered war weapons. They said the government should enlist eminent archaeologists to study the period during which the weapons were in use.“These are very rare materials bearing historical significance . The weapons should be properly preserved and displayed in a museum,” said Sajiv Mishra, a historian.","The Ratna Bhandar, closed for 46 years, was reopened by the Odisha government on July 14 for restoration and inventory.

Income Tax Expectations Budget 2024: The Narendra Modi government has been pushing for the adoption of the new income tax regime that offers concessional income tax rates, but with negligible exemptions. The new income tax regime was first introduced in 2020 and in the 2023 Budget further tweaks were made to popularise it amongst the common man and middle class salaried taxpayers.Further, the new income tax regime was made the default regime, signalling the government's intent to push for it as the main tax regime.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the first Budget 2024 of the Modi 3.0 government on July 23, 2024. Expectations are high that more changes may be brought in the new income tax regime - possibly raising the basic exemption limit, hiking standard deduction, or/and rationalising the income tax slabs and tax rates further.Also Check | Budget 2024 Live Updates So what can salaried taxpayers expect from Budget 2024 for the new income tax regime? Times of India Online did an exclusive survey of top personal tax experts. Here’s what they had to say:Tax experts are divided on the ideal tax income tax slabs and income tax rates under the new tax regime. However, most agree that the 30% tax slab above an income of Rs 15 lakh is still steep and needs to be implemented at incomes of at least above Rs 20 lakh.Aarti Raote, Partner, Deloitte India says that the government may not look at rejigging the tax rates up to 25% slab under the new tax regime. Rather, the government may look to increase the threshold of Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh for the 30% tax rate under the new tax regime.“In addition, the basic exemption limit of Rs 3 lakh can be moved to Rs 5 lakh. Additionally, increasing the standard deduction to Rs 1 lakh from existing levels of Rs 50,000 would provide further relief and encourage compliance,” she tells TOI.Chander Talreja, Partner, Vialto Partners tells TOI, “This year, the government may provide relief to middle income level individuals by tweaking the slab rates further and introducing additional slabs for income ranging between Rs 15 lakh and Rs 20 lakh.” Chander recommends the following income tax slabs and rates for salaried taxpayers under the new income tax regime:Preeti Sharma, Partner, Tax & Regulatory Services, BDO India LLP says that the applicable tax rate of 30% on the income of Rs 15 lakh is a very steep increase from 5% at the income level of Rs 3 lakh. “The applicable tax rate on income of Rs 15 lakh should be reduced to 22-25% and another slab may be introduced raising the tax rate to maximum 30% for income level of Rs 25 lakh and above,” Preeti tells TOI.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Raise basic exemption limit, standard deduction and NPS benefits for taxpayers “This reduction in tax will leave the government with some loss in the collection of direct tax revenue, at the same time leaving the individuals with more disposable income in their hands. This would also lead to more spending in the economy which will bring more indirect tax collection for the government,” she adds.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India is of the view that the basic exemption should be raised to Rs 5 lakh. She also advocates reducing the income tax rates in order to provide more disposable income in the hands of taxpayers.Kuldip Kumar, Partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors says that the number of slabs should be brought down under the new regime. “Currently there are 7 tax slabs under the new regime. These need to be rationalized to 3 or 4 at the most. The government has all the data on income brackets and the respective number of taxpayers falling therein and taxes paid. Changes should be made in such a way that tax burden reduces on the lower and middle income group tax payers,” he tells TOI.There were significant changes introduced in personal tax for individuals opting for new personal tax regime in the Budget 2023 like surcharge rate was brought down from 37% to 25% for individuals having taxable income more than Rs 5 crores, raising of the basic exemption limit by Rs 50,000, 100% tax rebate on income up to Rs 7 lakh. Accordingly, the government provided benefits for low-income level as well as high income level individuals.Currently, the income tax rates and slabs for the new income tax regime are:The eligibility limit for rebate is Rs 7 lakh, which means a tax rebate of up to Rs 25,000.

Indian-American billionaire venture capitalist Vinod Khosla , and Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Monday engaged in a heated exchange on X following Joe Biden 's withdrawal from the US presidential race and his endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's new nominee.Khosla called for an ""open convention"" to select a more moderate Democratic candidate, suggesting Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Governor Josh Shapiro as potential alternatives.He said that this would provide a unique opportunity for a balanced approach between MAGA extremists and DEI extremism.""Time to have an open convention and get a more moderate candidate who can easily beat @realDonaldTrump. @GovWhitmer and @GovernorShapiro would be a great thing for America not held hostage between MAGA extremists and DEI extremism. Unique opportunity for a better moderate path. Every socially liberal, climate and fiscal voter should want it to balance our approach,"" he said in a post on X.In response, Musk urged Khosla to support for former US president Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance.""Come on, Vinod. Trump/Vance LFG!!,"" Musk posted on X.Khosla, however, questioned Musk's stance, and said it was hard for him to support someone with ""no values, lies, cheats and demeans women"".""Hard for me to support someone with no values, lies, cheats, rapes, demeans women, hates immigrants like me. He may cut my taxes or reduce some regulation but that is no reason to accept depravity in his personal values. Do you want President who will set back climate by a decade in his first year? Do you want his example for your kids as values?"" Khosla said.Musk defended Trump, urging Khosla to meet with him and gain a better understanding of his character. The billionaire CEO acknowledged that Trump is not without flaws but emphasized the need for a meritocratic administration that promotes individual freedoms.""How many times have you read something in the media where you know the real story, but what they printed was diabolically false? Well, it’s way worse in politics, which is a blood sport. I’m not suggesting that Trump is without flaws, however we need an administration that is more likely to be meritocratic and promote individual freedoms over the heavy hand of government,"" Musk said.Khosla countered by highlighting Trump's stance on climate change, his ""drill baby drill"" approach, and the potential abandonment of NATO and American leadership.""Agree on not trusting media. Agree on meritocratic and promote individual freedoms. But abandon climate and ""drill baby drill? Be MAGA and abandon NATO and American leadership and moral authority? I was a socially liberal registered fiscal Republican till climate made me switch to Independent. Fist used ""techno optimist"" to describe myself on Twitter but have to add now ""with care and caring"" to bring along people left behind by the tech driven acceleration and growth we love,"" Khosla replied.The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Musk plans to contribute $45 million per month to a new super political-action committee supporting Trump's presidential campaign.Meanwhile, all five Indian-American lawmakers in the House of Representatives have praised Biden's decision to withdraw from the presidential race. Three of them – Ro Khanna, Shri Thanedar, and Pramila Jayapal – have already endorsed Harris as the likely Democratic presidential nominee.
