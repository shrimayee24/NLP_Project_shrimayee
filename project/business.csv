Cabinet panel nod to extension of officials recruited laterally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cabinet-panel-nod-to-extension-of-officials-recruited-laterally/articleshow/116416861.cms,"NEW DELHI: Four months after UPSC, on the request of ministry of personnel, cancelled its advertisement for lateral entry to 45 govt posts, the appointment committee of the Cabinet has approved a 1-2 year extension in the three-year tenure of 17 laterally-recruited officers currently on deputation or contract.The officers concerned -- at the level of joint secretary, director or deputy secretary -- will be required to sign a fresh contract of lateral recruitment, for the period of their extended appointment. The terms and conditions will remain the same as for their initial appointment for three years.The UPSC advertisement dated 17.08.2024 for lateral recruitments was cancelled barely three days after it was issued, following questions over the lack of reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other backward classes (OBCs) in these jobs. “Reservation of SC, ST, and OBC classes is being openly snatched away by recruiting through lateral entry on important posts in various ministries of the central government,” Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi had then alleged in a post on X.UPSC on August 20 rescinded the advertisement for 45 lateral-entry posts, hours after minister of state for personnel Jitendra Singh wrote to its chairman, saying that the aspect of reservation in lateral recruitment ""needs to be reviewed and reformed in the context of the Hon'ble Prime Minister's focus on ensuring social justice"".Pending the promised reform, however, DoPT in an order issued on Tuesday, put out a list of 17 lateral-entry officers whose three-year term, expiring either later this year on in early 2025, will stand extended to late 2026 end or early 2027.The 17 beneficiary officers, serving across a dozen govt departments/ministries, include three joint secretaries, 12 director-level officers and two deputy secretaries.In his letter requesting UPSC to cancel the advertisement on 45 lateral entry posts in August, junior minister for personnel Jitendra Singh had underlined that the lateral entry principle was endorsed by the administrative reforms commission and also recommended by the Sixth Pay Commission. He also reminded the Congress that it had been taking in lateral entrants when it was in office, though mostly on ad-hoc basis and without following the process of reservations.Singh said PM Modi firmly believes that the lateral entry process must be aligned with the principles of social justice and equity. ""It is important that the constitutional mandate towards social justice is upheld so that deserving candidates from marginalised communities get their rightful representation in the govt services,"" he had underlined.Over 60 senior posts in Govt of India have been filled by the Modi govt through lateral appointments so far.","The appointment committee of the Cabinet has approved a 1-2 year extension in the three-year tenure of 17 laterally-recruited officers.

Supreme Court cuts death to 25-year jail in case of sodomy-murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-cuts-death-to-25-year-jail-in-case-of-sodomy-murder/articleshow/116416828.cms,"NEW DELHI: SC on Tuesday termed the kidnapping, brutal sodomising and murder of a four-year-old child by a 24-year-old man as ""diabolic"", but commuted his death sentence to 25 years' imprisonment considering his poor background, good conduct in jail, ties with sexagenarian mother who looks after his minor daughter and hoping he is reformable.A temple priest's child in Piludara village in Bharuch district of Gujarat was lured with the offer of an ice-cream on April 13, 2016, by Sambhubhai R Padhiyar, who savagely sodomised the child and then strangled him to death. The trial court convicted him for kidnapping under Section 364 of IPC, sodomy under Section 377 of IPC, murder and various sections of Pocso Act and sentenced him to capital punishment. Gujarat HC confirmed the conviction and sentence.On appeal, the a bench of Justices B R Gavai, Arvind Kumar and K V Viswanathan examined various incriminating evidence and said, ""Without doubt, the crime committed by Padhiyar was diabolic in character. He enticed the innocent child by tempting him with ice-cream and brutally sodomised and murdered the four-year old. He also mercilessly strangulated the child. The postmortem report clearly indicated that death was due to asphyxia by throttling.""Justice Viswanathan then listed the mitigating circumstances - Padhiyar hails from a low socio-economic household; diagnosed with moderate intensity psychotic features and intellectual disability; he had in his early childhood contacted tuberculosis meningitis; maintains family ties with his 64-year-old mother who takes care of his 10 year old daughter; wife has deserted him; his behaviour in jail completely normal and showed good conduct; and feels remorse.Applying principles of what should be just sentence, the bench said, ""We hold that a sentence of imprisonment for a period of 25 years without remission would be 'a just dessert'.""","Sambhubhai R Padhiyar, 24, lured the child with the offer of ice-cream.

He said Kumbh has historically served as a centre for the exchange of ideas, a confluence of scholars, and a unifying force for Sanatani powers, playing a pivotal role in shaping the country's condition and direction alongside its religious authority.He also emphasised that Kumbh has been organised even during challenging eras, including the Mughal and British rule and under govts indifferent to Sanatan values.However, the 2019 Kumbh was a turning point, as it showcased the true and eternal essence of Sanatan to the world for the first time. Maha Kumbh 2025 would surpass past achievements and set new benchmarks of success.Praising India's balanced ""India First"" foreign policy in crises like the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Palestine conflict, he said this approach solidified India's position as a global power and a beacon of Sanatan and humanity.","Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Swami Avdheshanand Giri praised the preparations for Maha Kumbh under CM's leadership.

NAMAKKAL: Oman on Tuesday stopped issuing new import permits for Indian table eggs , hitting the poultry industry in Namakkal in Tamil Nadu. The new restriction assumes significance in the wake of Qatar imposing weight restrictions on Indian eggs recently.KRN Rajeshkumar , DMK MP, raised the issue in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. He urged the Centre to discuss with Oman and Qatar officials to resume egg imports from India. ""I have requested meetings with the ambassadors of Oman and Qatar in India to discuss the challenges faced by poultry farmers and egg exporters,"" he told TOI.PV Senthil, an egg exporter from Namakkal and general secretary of Livestock and Agri-Farmers Trade Association (LIFT), said a large shipment of Indian eggs, worth at least Rs 15 crore, is currently stranded due to these restrictions. Importers in Oman are struggling to clear the Indian egg containers at Sohar port in Oman, and those still in transit.According to exporters in Namakkal, the egg export business has significantly declined due to the actions of Oman and Qatar, the two key importing nations.Namakkal egg exporters have been facing tough times since June when Oman stopped giving import permits for Indian table eggs. After several meetings at the consulate level, Oman resumed imports in Sept, but only with limited permits. On Tuesday, Oman again decided to stop issuing new import permits for Indian eggs.Data from National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC) indicates that 11.4 crore eggs were exported to various countries, including Oman, Qatar, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Muscat, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka at the start of the year, with Oman accounting for 50% of those exports.

NEW DELHI: The Modi government on Tuesday took a big step forward to implement its dream of ""one nation, one election"" by successfully introducing two bills that lay down the mechanism to hold simultaneous elections in the country.The Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha by law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal after a nearly 90-minute heated debate with the opposition terming the move ""anti-constitutional.""The bills were introduced after division of votes - 269 members in favour and 198 against - numbers that were good enough to get the bills introduced in Lok Sabha but not enough to get them passed, which requires two-thirds majority of the members present and voting.Congress member Manickam Tagore was quick to point out that the government did not have a two-thirds majority among the 461 members who took part in the voting today. In Lok Sabha, 269 members voted in favour of the bill against the two-thirds-mark of 307.Another Congress member Shashi Tharoor said the voting at the introduction stage of two bills on simultaneous elections in the Lok Sabha showed the BJP did not have the two-third majority required to pass a constitutional amendment.""We (the Congress) are not the only ones that have opposed this bill. The vast majority of the opposition parties have opposed this bill and the grounds are very many, it is a violation of the federal structure of the Constitution. Why should a state government fall if the central government falls?"" he told reporters in Parliament premises.The National Democratic Alliance - which includes the BJP and its allies have 293 MPs in its camp. The Congress-led INDIA bloc has 234. If all the members in Lok Sabha are present and voting, a constitutional amendment bill will need 362 votes to succeed.Not just the Congress, but several other parties including the DMK, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, NCP-SP, Shiv Sena-UBT, AIMIM among others opposed the bills calling it an assault on the basic structure of the Constitution.YSRCP, which has four members in Lok Sabha, is the only non-NDA party to have declared support for the bill. BJD, another fence sitter, is yet to spell out its stand. BJD failed to open its account in Lok Sabha in elections this year, but has seven members in Rajya Sabha.Little wonder, the government made it clear at the outset that it will refer the bills to Joint Parliamentary Committee for wider consultations.Home minister Amit Shah told Lok Sabha that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said during a meeting of the Union Cabinet that the bill should be referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee for wider deliberations at every level.Shah said the proposed bills did not attack the ""basic structure doctrine of the Constitution, as claimed by the opposition"".BJP allies TDP and Shiv Sena declared ""unwavering support"" for the legislation. But the government will need a lot more support and the BJP floor managers face a difficult road ahead if they want the bills to be passed.The only way perhaps they can reach the magical number of two-thirds majority is by weaning away some parties from the INDIA blocWith nearly 20 BJP MPs not present for the voting today, the party is likely to issue notices to MPs who were absent during the division of votes, according to sources. The BJP had issued a three-line whip for the presence of its MPs stating that some important legislative agenda is on the agenda.","The bills were introduced after division of votes - 269 members in favour and 198 against.

NEW DELHI: A five-judge Supreme Court collegium led by CJI Sanjiv Khanna on Tuesday ticked off Allahabad high court's Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav for his controversial speech at a VHP event and counselled him to maintain dignity of the constitutional post he holds and exercise caution while delivering public speeches.The collegium, also comprising four other senior judges - Justices B R Gavai, Surya Kant, Hrishikesh Roy and A S Oka - had on Dec 10 taken note of newspaper reports of Justice Yadav's Dec 8 speech and sought ""details and particulars"" of the speech from the HC for examining the issue, which created a stir among activist lawyers and politicians.Pursuant to the summons, Justice Yadav appeared before the five-judge collegium in Supreme Court on Tuesday and offered to explain the purport, meaning and context of his speech while maintaining that the media selectively quoted from his speech to create an unnecessary controversy.The collegium, however, was unconvinced with his explanations and ticked him off for the casual manner in which he made certain statements in the speech. The CJI-led collegium told him that conduct, demeanour and speech of a HC or SC judge, being a constitutional post holder, is constantly under scrutiny & hence expected to maintain dignity of the high office.Moreover, the senior-most judges of the apex court told Justice Yadav that every statement made by a high court judge or a Supreme Court judge, either in the courtroom or outside at a public event, must not only be in sync with the dignity of the office but also not cause damage to the people's faith in judiciary.Justice Yadav, appointed an additional judge on Dec 12, 2019 of Allahabad HC and made permanent on March 26, 2021, is scheduled to retire on April 15, 2026. His speech at a VHP event on Dec 8 had reportedly supported UCC and allegedly made remarks targeting the Muslim community.While SC, through numerous judgments over the last four decades, has repeatedly underlined the need to bring about Uniform Civil Code (UCC), Justice Yadav's comments against the Muslim community riled several lawyers and politicians.Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan-led NGO 'Committee for Judicial Accountability and Reforms' demanded the apex court to conduct an in-house inquiry against the judge.

NEW DELHI: National Test Agency will conduct only competitive entrance tests for admission into educational institutions from next year and won’t hold any recruitment exams, Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Tuesday. He also said that education and health ministries are deliberating on whether to conduct the medical entrance exam NEET-UG in pen-and-paper mode or online mode.“We are in talks with the health ministry whether NEET should be conducted in pen-and-paper mode or online. Whatever option will be considered best suited for conducting the exam, NTA is ready to undertake the exercise being a ‘service provider’ and our aim is to ensure zero-error,” Pradhan said. The detailed modalities for NEET-UG is likely to be announced in 2-3 weeks.The minister clarified that CUET-UG will continue to be held once a year. While sharing recommendations of committee headed by former ISRO chairman K Radhakrishnan for the “smooth and fair” conduct of exams and strengthening of NTA, Pradhan said NTA will adopt recommendations “in letter and spirit” whether it’s about ensuring “secured storage” of question papers and utilising govt educational institutions & infrastructure where sanctity can be ensured while conducting exams.“NTA will be limited to conducting only entrance exams for higher education and not conduct any recruitment exams from next year,” he said, adding the idea is to conduct “error-free exams” and fix “accountability”.Mentioning the details of the panel’s recommendations and govt’s action, Pradhan also said that the NTA will be restructured next year and new posts are being created, and has also decided, the Radhakrishnan-led panel, whose report was made public on Tuesday, has observed that the NTA had “outstretched” itself to accommodate diverse requests from test indenting agencies for handling end-to-end operations of tests.“The NTA should primarily conduct entrance examinations. Enhancing its scope for other examinations may be considered after the capacity of the NTA is augmented,” the panel had recommended. The panel was set up after the NEET-UG exam paper leak in June.Pradhan said the NTA will set up a robust Grievance Reporting and Redressal Cell to address concerns of students. He added that steps will be taken to address the Supreme Court’s concern on student wellness and exam de-stressing.",National Test Agency will conduct only competitive entrance tests for admission into educational institutions from next year.

NHAI invites bids for barrier-less tolling at Gharonda plaza on Delhi-Chandigarh NH,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nhai-invites-bids-for-barrier-less-tolling-at-gharonda-plaza-on-delhi-chandigarh-nh/articleshow/116416730.cms,"NEW DELHI: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has invited bids for barrier-less tolling at the Gharonda plaza on the Delhi-Chandigarh highway in the National Capital Region. This is the second such tender that the authority has floated to bring more highway stretches under the “Free Flow Tolling” system.Under this system, there will be no physical toll plaza or barrier, thereby eliminating the need for vehicles to slow down to pay user fee. Officials said advanced FASTag readers , which can read the smart tags fixed on vehicles moving at even 100 kmph, and high-power cameras to read the registration number will be fixed on overhead gantries across lanes for deducting toll amount automatically.Earlier, the NHAI had floated a tender for a similar system at the Delhi-Gurgaon border for the newly built Dwarka Expressway , and the process to select a player is underway. This system will eliminate the need for vehicles to slow down to pay toll.As per the bid document, banks and financial institutions can submit their bids. The bank that offers maximum revenue share will get the tolling rights. There will be no need for a separate toll collector or operator.Officials said the highways authority has invited bids only for one toll plaza on the Delhi-Chandigarh highways, as this is the only public funded one, which means toll collected at Gharonda plaza goes to the NHAI. “So, even if there is any loss of toll revenue during the few months because of non-compliant commuters, the NHAI will bear it. If we go for this barrier-less tolling at plazas that are under private players, they may raise claims of revenue loss. Nevertheless, this new tolling system will be expanded across NH stretches in the country,” said an official.",The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has invited bids for barrier- less tolling at the Gharonda plaza on the Delhi-Chandigarh highway.

Currently, the scheme is meant for only landholder farmers irrespective of the size of their landholdings.It also recommended that a National Commission for Minimum Living Wages for farm labourers be established at the earliest to provide them their long due rights.Observing that the implementation of MSP remains a focal point in the dialogue surrounding agricultural reform and farmers welfare , the report said, ""Since the Committee believe that implementing a robust and legally binding MSP in the country could play a crucial role in reducing farmer suicides in India by providing financial stability, protecting against market volatility and alleviating debt burdens, they recommended implementation of the same.""The committee also urged the govt to enhance allocation to agriculture especially to improve productivity. It noted that though the data showed that the department of agriculture and farmers welfare got higher allocations in absolute amount from 2021-22 to 2024-25, its percentage share in the total central plan outlay witnessed decline from 3.53% in 2020-21 to 2.54% in 2024-25.Besides making these recommendations, the panel urged govt to explore possibility of providing compulsory Universal Crop Insurance to small farmers with land holding of up to two hectares on the lines of the central govt's health insurance scheme, being provided to all citizens.",A parliamentary panel on Tuesday recommended legal guarantee to procurement of crops at minimum support price (MSP) The panel also suggested introduction of a scheme to waive debt of farmers and farm labourers.

""A scam that not just led to a colossal loss of Rs 1.76 lakh crore to the exchequer, but also gave government-corporate collaboration its worst name, a.k.a crony capitalism,"" he said on X. The telecom minister said spectrum in the UPA era was allocated via the opaque FCFS (first come, first served) policy, resulting in scams and losses.""The Modi government prioritises transparency and public interest - mobile telephony spectrum is now auctioned,"" Scindia said.Scindia was responding to Ramesh's post on X that linked the process of in-principle approval by govt to that of administrative spectrum allocation process during the previous UPA govt. Ramesh said the NDA govt has stated on record that ""spectrum assigned administratively are also chargeable and hence contribute to revenue"", a position he says is contrary to what the PM has been proclaiming for many years. ""Recall that the BJP reaped huge political dividends from the media frenzy generated by its proxies in the government over the UPA's allocation of 2G spectrum by administrative processes rather than auctions. Fraudulent revenue loss projections and an overactive judiciary ended up doing huge damage to the investment environment in telecoms,"" he said.Ramesh said at the end of an exhaustive trial, the CBI court acquitted all the accused, stating in strongest terms the entire affair was built on ""public perception created by rumour, gossip and speculation"".

Govt claims synchronised poll plan has widespread public & political support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-claims-synchronised-poll-plan-has-widespread-public-political-support/articleshow/116415569.cms,"Despite e-voting option, a few take ballot route

NEW DELHI: Ahead of govt tabling the 'one nation, one election' bills in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, the law ministry said the idea of simultaneous polls proposed aligning the election cycles of Lok Sabha and state assemblies, but voting could continue to be held in multiple phases, not necessarily on the same day across the country.""Voters to cast their ballots for both tiers of govt (Parliament and assemblies) on the same day in their constituencies, though voting could still occur in phases across the country,"" the ministry said in an explainer.For the first 15 years, from 1951-52 to 1967, simultaneous elections were held for Lok Sabha and assemblies, it said and added that this cycle of synchronised elections was disrupted in 1968 and 1969 due to the premature dissolution of some state assemblies. Some states such as Tripura and Nagaland that were formed later were not aligned with the Lok Sabha polls.The first to be dissolved under Article 356 was the Left govt in Kerala in 1959. Non-Congress govts in Punjab, Haryana, UP and Bihar were similarly dissolved, and President's Rule imposed in 1968.BJP has accused Congress of misusing Article 356 at least 50 times to dissolve elected govts in states.""The fourth Lok Sabha was also dissolved prematurely in 1970, with fresh elections held in 1971. Unlike the first, second, and third Lok Sabhas, which completed their full five-year terms, the fifth Lok Sabha's term was extended until 1977 under Article 352 because of the declaration of the Emergency,"" it said.Since then, only a few Lok Sabha terms have lasted the full five years, such as the eighth, 10th, 14th and 15th. Others, including the sixth, seventh, ninth, 11th, 12th and 13th, were dissolved early.Thrice, Lok Sabha was dissolved prematurely within one and half years: the ninth Lok Sabha was dissolved within one year and three months on March 13, 1991; again the 11th Lok Sabha was dissolved within one year and six months on Dec 4 1997; the 12th Lok Sabha had the shortest period of one year and a month and was dissolved on April 26, 1999. The next Lok Sabha was also dissolved prematurely on Feb 6, 2004, eight months ahead of schedule.By proposing to align these elections, the high-level committee on simultaneous elections led by former president Ram Nath Kovind has led the groundwork for a transformative shift in India's electoral process, the ministry said.""The proposed phased approach to implementing simultaneous elections, along with constitutional amendments, could pave the way for a more efficient and stable electoral environment in India,"" it said. The govt claims that the proposed simultaneous elections have widespread public and political support as it streamlines the country's democratic processes and bolsters the efficiency of governance.The Kovind panel received over 21,500 responses, with 80% in favour of simultaneous elections. People from most states and UTs supported synchronisation of elections, including those from opposition-governed states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and West Bengal.Of the 47 political parties which sent their responses, 32 supported simultaneous polls while 15 raised their concerns about potential anti-democratic effects and marginalisation of regional parties.The voting process for introduction of the Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill and the Union Territories Amendment Bill, 2024 wasn’t all smooth sailing. Though the new Lok Sabha has provision for electronic voting, some members insisted on exercising their franchise through ballot paper. Those in favour of the bill had to press the green button on the automatic vote recording system installed on each seat, those against had to press the red button and members wanting to abstain from voting had the choice to press the yellow button. 369 MPs cast votes through the machine and remaining 92 were cast through slips. However, due to the confusion, voting had to be carried out twice and even then, some of the MPs chose to opt for voting through the ballot papers. Total 269 members voted in favour of the Bills while 198 others opposed it and, thus, the bills were accepted for introduction in the lower House.","Voters to cast their ballots for both tiers of govt (Parliament and assemblies) on the same day in their constituencies.

It issued notices to Krishna, the Music Academy, and others on a plea filed by MS Subbulakshmi’s grandson, who challenged the use of the legendary singer’s name for the award, claiming it violated her will.The apex court on Sunday had declined to immediately intervene, stating that an appeal against the Madras high court’s order allowing the award could only be heard on Monday. Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna remarked, “The appeal will be heard on Monday, and the award could be taken back if the court ultimately finds any merit in the case.”Earlier, the Music Academy was granted relief when a division bench of the Madras high court stayed a single judge’s order restraining the academy from using Subbulakshmi’s name for the award. The bench of Justices S S Sundar and P Dhanabal observed, “From the plain reading of the contents of the Will, the testatrix did not want anybody to form or create or make any trust, foundation, or memorial of any kind including erecting of any statue or bust in her name or in her memory.”However, the bench rejected the interpretation that Subbulakshmi intended to forbid the conferment of awards in her name, stating, “Had it been the intention of the testatrix that no award shall be conferred on anyone in her name, that could have been expressed in simple language. An interpretation contrary to the plain language of the instrument is not permissible in law.”The court noted that during her lifetime, Subbulakshmi had acknowledged several works and awards instituted in her name, and such practices were not in dispute. It also highlighted that the plaintiff, her grandson, had not included other organisations that had instituted similar awards in her name, adding, “This court is unable to reject the contention or stand taken by appellants that the suit and the interlocutory application is not for a bona fide cause, but with an oblique motive against Krishna.”After the Madras high court on Friday allowed the Music Academy to proceed with the award, senior advocate N Venkataraman urgently mentioned the matter in the Supreme Court.

I want to say this to the administration. We do not have proper facilities for live shows here. It is a big revenue source. A lot of people work (on these events) and get employment due to it. So, please pay heed to it.""The statement was received by a fawning audience in the packed space with thunderous applause. Dosanjh also made it a point to say that it is not he who calls children to his recitals, but ""parents bring them"".Following Telangana's move some time ago, Chandigarh Commission for Protection of Child Rights had issued an advisory regarding ""maintaining noise level, not inviting kids to stage, and not singing songs promoting drugs, alcohol and violence"" during the performance.In a video that has now been shared widely on the social media, the singer, who has starred in films like ‘Chamkila’ and ‘Udta Punjab’, can be heard asking: “Will you stop me like this?”Dosanjh’s much-in-demand Dil-Luminati India tour , which kicked off in Delhi on Oct 26 and has drawn massive crowds in every city it has premiered, has had it rough with the administrations in various states across country. It has been fraught with challenges for the entertainer.Ahead of his concert in Hyderabad on Nov 15, Telangana govt issued a notice to Dosanjh asking him to “refrain from performing songs that promote alcohol, drugs, or violence”. It came after a professor from Chandigarh, Panditrao Dharennavar, filed a representation to authorities to not allow Dosanjh “sing such songs”. Accordingly, the singer at that time changed the lyrics of some of his songs, but criticised Telangana govt for restrictions imposed on him.His next in Ahmedabad saw him issue a challenge of his own. “If alcohol consumption is banned nationwide, I will no longer sing songs that mention it,” he had said.It was worse in Indore. Bajrang Dal and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) workers held a protest near the venue hours before the concert began. In response, Dosanjh dedicated his concert in the city to poet Rahat Indori, a resident of Indore who had died in 2020, and recited his lines: “If they oppose, let them; life is not at stake. This is just smoke, not the sky. Everybody’s blood (sacrifice) is mixed in this land’s soil, Hindustan is not anyone’s property.”","Singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh says he won't perform in India until infrastructure for it is improved.

NEW DELHI: The Allahabad high court on Monday granted anticipatory bail to Sushil Singhania, the uncle of Nikita Singhania, in the suicide case of Artificial Intelligence engineer Atul Subhash. Justice Ashutosh Srivastava passed the order while hearing the bail application filed on behalf of Atul's wife, Nikita Singhania, and her in-laws.According to a Bengaluru Police official, Nikita Singhania was arrested in Gurugram, Haryana, while her mother, Nisha Singhania, and brother, Anurag Singhania, were arrested in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, for allegedly abetting Atul Subhash’s suicide. They were taken into custody on Saturday, brought to Bengaluru, and sent to judicial custody for 14 days after being presented in a local court.In the high court, senior counsel Manish Tiwary argued that while Nikita, Nisha, and Anurag had already been arrested, the anticipatory bail application was being pressed solely on behalf of Sushil Singhania.It was argued that the arrests were based on a suicide note and a video that had circulated online. The counsel submitted that Sushil Singhania, aged 69, suffers from chronic medical issues, is incapacitated, and could not have abetted the suicide.The counsel further argued that there is a difference between harassment and abetment, claiming that even if the suicide note is considered, the allegations suggest harassment rather than abetment. It was also submitted that Section 108, 3(5) of the BNS might not apply to the case.After hearing the arguments, the court ruled, “Considering the above, the court is of the opinion that applicant Sushil Singhania is entitled to get the privilege of pre-arrest (Transit) Anticipatory.”The court directed that if the applicant is arrested in connection with the case, he should be released on anticipatory bail until the police file a report under Section 173(2) of the CrPC. The applicant was asked to furnish a personal bond of ₹50,000 and two sureties of the same amount to the satisfaction of the magistrate or concerned court.The court also imposed conditions: the applicant must be available for police interrogation as required, must not influence witnesses, and cannot leave India without prior court permission.

Fans have eagerly awaited his comeback since he broke his leg in his fight against Dustin Poirier in 2021.This prospective bout would mark McGregor's return after two successive losses to Poirier in 2021. He was scheduled to fight Michael Chandler at UFC 303 in June but withdrew due to injury.McGregor is currently dealing with legal issues, having been found liable for assault in a civil rape case, which resulted in an order to pay over $262,000 in damages. These legal matters have significantly impacted his public image and career trajectory.McGregor's UFC return remains uncertain, with UFC CEO Dana White hinting at a possible comeback in 2025.For Logan Paul, this fight would be the biggest of his career. Having successfully transitioned into boxing and WWE, Paul has previously fought Floyd Mayweather and defeated Dillon Danis in 2023.Paul’s experience in crossover boxing makes him a significant opponent for McGregor. The bout is expected to attract substantial interest from both boxing and MMA fans.McGregor's previous boxing match against Floyd Mayweather was a globally publicised event. His potential fight with Paul is expected to generate a similar level of attention.The combat sports community is now waiting to see whether India will host this high-profile boxing exhibition.

Infomercial? Bully Ray Thinks So



Saturday Night’s Main Event Left a Sour Taste in the Fans’ Mouths

Is There Any Truth to Bully Ray’s Criticism of Saturday Night’s Main Event?

ALSO READ:

WWE Hall of Famer Bully Ray recently went on record to call Saturday Night’s Main Event 2024, a ‘giant infomercial.’ Ray explained that more than 50% of the show was just promos, ads, and packages. To him, it felt like the wrestling took a backseat to everything else that WWE wanted to achieve through this event.Let’s take a look at what else Ray said on the topic during his conversation on Busted Open Radio.“In my eyes, I felt it was like an infomercial. As I watched Saturday Night’s Main Event, I noticed a lot of different aspects of just what was going on in the ring with the wrestling … 54 percent of the show was packages, promos, ads, and all that stuff. They gave the fan just enough. They gave the live audience enough. They gave you at home enough if you were sitting home with your kids—it was a good, friendly show. Here’s who we are, this is what we do, this is the product that we offer, here’s our characters ” (via Busted Open Radio Leading up to the event, WWE legend, Jesse Ventura promised that Saturday Night’s Main Event would bring back the retro feel of the original show. WWE made a solid attempt to do so by reintroducing the Winged Eagle title belt. However, they ultimately fell short of the mark and couldn’t figure out how to balance the retro and future elements of the show.The classic red, blue, and white ropes were a welcome addition, but the lack of a Titantron showed a lack of effort. Also worth noting is the fact that the show lacked promos. In the past, Saturday Night’s Main Event used to start with promos. This was an excellent way to introduce newcomers to the storylines and wrestlers involved.This year, WWE decided to put the promos on YouTube instead of the actual show. This posed problems for new viewers who couldn’t keep up with what was happening.While Bully Ray is entitled to his own opinion, Saturday Night’s Main Event was not lacking in quality. Even if the show played like an infomercial at times, WWE did an excellent job with the actual wrestling and generated a lot of buzz with its storyline developments.We also have to take into consideration that Saturday Night’s Main Event returned after 16 years. Due to this, WWE had no roadmap for approaching SNME in 2024. Now that they’ve tested the waters, we can expect the company to put on an even better show in 2025. If there’s one thing we can be assured of, it is that WWE is not afraid of going to great lengths to evolve and improve its product.With the lukewarm reception that Saturday Night’s Main Event has received, we can expect WWE to work hard at making the next one a night to remember. What are your thoughts on SNME 2024 ?

Travis Kelce Hired A Private Chef And A Private Bartender For Taylor Swift’s Birthday Rather Than Going Outside



Travis Kelce Has Gifted Taylor Swift A Rolex, Van Cleef And Alhambra’s Jewellery



Taylor Swift celebrated her 35th birthday recently on 13th December and as per a report by Page Six, not only did Travis Kelce get her gifts worth $175,000 but also hired a private chef and a private bartender so that Taylor Swift has a memorable birthday. Travis and Taylor decided the best way to spend the global popstar’s girlfriend would be to spend it away from all the media and fans, just between the two and in between tasty dishes and mocktails prepared by the private staff Travis hired, especially for Taylor’s birthday.Travis’ gesture of hiring a private chef to cook Taylor’s favourite dishes and a private bartender to probably make delicious mocktails for them might have been motivated by Taylor giving up on alcohol when she was prepping for her legendary Eras Tour, which has become one of the most popular concerts in recent time, as revealed by Taylor in an interview with TIME magazine last year.But it was not just a private chef and a private bartender who were hired to make Taylor feel special and one in a million; as per Page Six, Travis got her jewellery from luxury brands which was engraved only for Taylor. Travis has proved time and again that he is an extremely thoughtful boyfriend and proved it again on her birthday by making sure she followed her ritual of not drinking, which probably could have been a major motivator behind why Travis decided to surprise Taylor with her gifts and a private chef along with a bartender at an intimate setting rather than at a privately booked club.As per various reports, Travis has reportedly sent her a bouquet of roses from the luxurious The Million Roses, along with a Rolex, jewellery from Van Cleef, Alhambra to name a few. All of these gifts were sent to Taylor prior to the celebration so that she can enjoy her birthday celebration with her boyfriend, the NFL star, Travis.Travis did his best to make Taylor’s 35th birthday extremely special. According to a source, Taylor had reportedly kept his plans for Taylor’s birthday a secret and only let few close friends and family know about it since he did not want Taylor to know anything about the day and the gifts he had planned for her.Both Taylor and Travis had a spectacular yet both on their professional and personal ends. Taylor became a billionaire this year, became the number 1 artist on Spotify Wrapped, ended her legendary Eras Tour which has reportedly generated a revenue of $2.2 billion and is the second most attended concert in the world and also has broken her own record of winning maximum nominations recently at the 2024 Billboards Music Awards.Also Read: Taylor Swift relocates to Travis Kelce’s home to stay close and cheer him on as the Chiefs head into the playoffs Travis, similarly was always on the news for his relationship with Taylor Swift, his team, the Kansas City Chiefs has again entered into the playoffs and aiming for the next Super Bowl after winning the 2024 Super Bowl.

Even Bill Gates will go bankrupt: Elon Musk



A deepfake video of Elon Musk endorsing a fake $20 million crypto giveaway is going viral, causing widespread confusion and concern. Sharing the video on X (formerly Twitter), DogeDesigner posted: “BREAKING: A deepfake of Elon Musk promoting a $20 million crypto giveaway is going viral.” The post further warned: “Elon Musk and his companies are NOT running any crypto giveaways. Don’t fall for scams! Stay safe.”In the video, Elon Musk can be seen saying “Here’s a surprise for everyone. I’ll be doing a $20 million crypto giveaway at Elon4u.com for one week starting on December 13.” He further adds “ If I am serious? Yes, go to Elon4u.com. It’s just a few quick steps that shouldn’t take longer than three minutes”.The Tesla CEO wrote on X that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates might go bankrupt if Tesla becomes “the world’s most valuable company by far,” reigniting the feud over Gates’ short position against the electric vehicle giant. At present, Tesla’s market capitalization sits at $1.251 trillion, trailing far behind Apple Inc. – the world’s largest company, which leads at $3.729 trillion. For Tesla to claim the top spot, it would need to grow by nearly 200%.In the post on X, Musk wrote “If Tesla does become the world’s most valuable company by far, that short position will bankrupt even Bill Gates”. Short position here refers to a stock market strategy where an investor borrows shares of a stock they do not own, sells them on the open market, and aims to buy them back later at a lower price.

MUMBAI: The winter season's pleasant chill was accompanied by concerning levels of air pollution in Mumbai. The atmospheric conditions, particularly the reduced wind speed characteristic of winter, created a perfect environment for pollutants to remain suspended in the air. The cooler air masses effectively trapped warmer air from the sea, leading to minimal air circulation and pollutant dispersal.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) monitoring network revealed troubling air quality readings across Mumbai's metropolitan region. The situation was particularly concerning as the city's overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reached 188, placing it firmly in the unsatisfactory category.The most affected areas showing very poor air quality were Byculla and Colaba, with AQI readings exceeding 300. Following closely behind, several suburbs registered poor air quality readings between 200-300, including Chembur, Mazgaon, Sewri, Shivaji Nagar Mankhurd, and Siddharth Nagar Worli. These areas became hotspots of concern for local environmental authorities.The pollution levels were also notably high in other parts of the city, with six additional suburbs recording AQI readings in the higher range of the unsatisfactory category (151-200). These included the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), Borivali, Terminal 2 airport area, Kherwadi, Malad West, and Vasai West.Health experts advised residents, particularly those with respiratory conditions, elderly individuals, and young children, to take necessary precautions. These included limiting outdoor activities during peak pollution hours, wearing appropriate masks when venturing outside, and ensuring proper ventilation indoors.Local authorities monitored the situation closely and implemented various measures to control pollution levels. These included regular water sprinkling on construction sites, strict enforcement of dust control measures, and increased monitoring of industrial emissions.The current weather pattern suggested that these conditions might persist until there was a significant change in wind patterns or temperature. Meteorologists closely tracked these parameters to predict potential improvements in air quality. Until then, residents were advised to stay updated with daily air quality forecasts and follow prescribed guidelines for their safety and well-being.The situation highlighted the growing need for long-term solutions to address air pollution in urban areas, particularly during winter months when natural weather conditions exacerbate the problem. Municipal authorities were considering additional measures to improve air quality, including enhanced green coverage and stricter emission controls.","Mumbai's overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reached 188, placing it firmly in the unsatisfactory category.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
'They charge a lot': Donald Trump threatens reciprocal tariffs against India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-charge-a-lot-donald-trump-threatens-reciprocal-tariffs-against-india/articleshow/116417313.cms,"President-elect Donald Trump reaffirmed his commitment to imposing reciprocal taxes on India, citing high tariffs on American goods. He emphasized that if India imposes tariffs, the US will respond in kind. While trade tensions are anticipated, India could potentially benefit from trade diversions caused by Trump's tariff policies targeting other nations.

US president-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday reiterated his intentions to impose reciprocal taxes on India. Trump, who had once described India as ""tariff king"" accused New Delhi of charging ""high tariffs"" on American made products.""Reciprocal. If they tax us, we tax them the same amount. They tax us. We tax them. And they tax us. Almost in all cases, they're taxing us, and we haven't been taxing them,"" the president-elect said at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago.""The word reciprocal is important because if somebody charges us - India, we don't have to talk about our own - if India charges us 100 per cent, do we charge them nothing for the same? You know, they send in a bicycle and we send them a bicycle. They charge us 100 and 200. India charges a lot. Brazil charges a lot. If they want to charge us, that's fine, but we're going to charge them the same thing,"" he added.Earlier, the US president-elect had also warned Canada, of 25% tariffs on his first day of administration if they fail to stop flow of drugs and illegal immigrants into US.Donald Trump, who once described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as ""a friend of mine"" and visited India during his first term. At a rally before his re-election, Trump remarked, “India is a very big charger. We have a great relationship with India. But they probably charge as much.”""India is a very big charger. We have a great relationship with India. I did. And especially the leader, Modi. He's a great leader. Great man. Really is a great man. He's brought it together. He's done a great job. But they probably charge as much,"" Trump had said.During his first term, Trump imposed higher tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium, prompting retaliatory Indian duties on American products like almonds and apples. Experts believe that similar trade tensions could arise if Trump targets India again.Ajay Srivastava from the Global Trade Research Initiative had told TOI that sectors such as automobiles, textiles, and pharmaceuticals could face higher tariffs under Trump’s “reciprocal trade” policy.However, there may be a silver lining. As Trump focuses primarily on China, India could benefit by filling gaps in sectors like textiles and manufacturing, provided it scales production.India could benefit from significant export opportunities due to potential trade disruptions caused by US Trump’s proposed tariff policies, according to a Shriram Mutual Fund analysis. Trump's planned tariffs on major trading partners like China, Mexico, and Canada may redirect trade flows, creating opportunities for India.The report noted that Trump’s tariff plans, including 10% additional tariffs on China and 25% on Canada and Mexico, could disrupt existing trade patterns, potentially allowing Indian exporters to gain access to these markets.(With inputs from agency)","US president-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday reiterated his intentions to impose reciprocal taxes on India.

How Dominique Pelicot organised the mass rape of his wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/how-dominique-pelicot-organised-the-mass-rape-of-his-wife/articleshow/116415051.cms,"Courtroom sketch of Dominique Pelicot (Picture credit: Reuters)

Arranging the assault:



In a chilling case that sent shockwaves not just in France but also all around the world, a 72 year old man, Dominique Pelicot , was convicted for using an online dating platform to solicit and conduct the repeated rape of his wife, Gisele.Pelicot orchestrated all the plans, through which Gisele was raped by 70 men over 200 times.He admitted to recruiting men online to sexual abuse his wife, who was raped at their home during the decade-long period that the abuse occurred in the small village of Mazan. The app allowed him to access a large number of men from many walks of life, including firefighters, journalists, and nurses.Pelicot first drugged Gisele, leaving her unconscious, and invited the men-these were often groups of several men-into their home.According to her police reports quoted by new agency CNN, he actively communicated with these men through the Internet, first in chat rooms and subsequently by way of explicit forums like Coco.fr .Pelicot would first meet the men online in chatrooms and then shift the conversations to Skype, where he would show them his unconscious wife and share her explicit images and videos.Through these online exchanges, Pelicot created a network of men who were encouraged to take part in the ongoing abuse.Despite Gisele’s complete lack of awareness of her husband’s actions, the physical and emotional toll upon her was immense. She often sought medical help, complaining of memory loss and pelvic pain which indicated the prolonged abuse.It was only when Pelicot was arrested in 2020 for a separate offence, filming upskirts of women in a supermarket, that the full extent of his crimes came to light.The discovery of Pelicot’s disturbing online activities has opened a much larger conversation about digital spaces that enable and encourage sexual violence.While the website Coco.fr has been shut down, the case serves as a sober remainder of the disturbing reality that continues to thrive on similar platforms, fostering misogynistic and violent discourse.Gisele’s decision to waive her anonymity and testify publicly against the men who participated in her abuse has made this trial a landmark case in France. With the verdict expected on December 19, the trial has sparked widespread debate about the need for stronger regulations on digital platforms and more stringent laws around consent.Dominique Pelicot, along with several co-defendent, has pleaded guilty to the charges of rape, while others argue that they did not view the abuse as a crime, claiming that a husband’s consent was enough. Pelicot himself has expressed no remorse, stating that the responsibility for the crimes lies with all of the men involved.","Dominique Pelicot, 72, was convicted for using an online dating platform to solicit and conduct the repeated rape of his wife, Gisele.

Some even called the accused shooter, Luigi Mangione, a hero and offered to help with his legal fees.Manhattan psychologist Dr. Chloe Carmichael said,“There’s a level of grandiosity in his decision that his own opinions would merit his complete disregard for some of the most basic laws of our society.”New York psychotherapist Alyson Cohen compared Mangione to serial killers like Ted Bundy and Charles Cohen and said “Antisocial personality disorder is when people lack the ability to have empathy and compassion for other humans.” He also explained that a cold-blooded killer’s actions emerge from a complete lack of emotional consideration.”Experts noted that Mangione’s social media posts, along with a brief manifesto found on him after his arrest, revealed a disjointed ideology that mixed criticism of capitalism with rants against wokeness.Luigi Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in connection with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Authorities believe the killing was fueled by Mangione's deep frustration with the insurance industry. The attack occurred while Thompson was walking to a conference in Manhattan.Upon his arrest, Mangione was found with several fake IDs, a US passport, and writings about the insurance industry, including a manifesto that expressed admiration for Michael Moore’s critical views on healthcare.","US radio host Charlamagne tha God expressed frustration over people celebrating UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s cold-blooded murder and hailing Luigi Mangione, the man accused of executing the planned killing.
