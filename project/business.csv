Bihar Assembly Polls: EC Announces Two-Phase Voting, Unveils 17 New Measures For Transparent Voting

NEW DELHI: As Bihar gears up for assembly elections across 243 seats, political strategist-turned-leader Prashant Kishor has confirmed that he will contest the polls, with his political startup Jan Suraaj set to unveil its list of candidates on October 9 -- a list he says will be “full of surprises.”The announcement followed Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar’s declaration of the Bihar election schedule, which will be conducted in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results to be announced on November 14. Bihar, with 243 constituencies, has the fourth-largest assembly in India.Speaking to reporters, Kishor said, ""The party will declare its list of candidates for the coming assembly polls on October 9 and it will be full of surprises. My name will also be there in the list.""The former poll strategist declined to reveal the constituency he will contest from, saying, ""You will come to know on October 9.""When asked about Jan Suraaj’s prospects, Kishor asserted that his party would attract a significant voter base that does not align with either of the major alliances. ""In the last polls, the two alliances bagged votes of 72 per cent of voters only. I must clarify that we will get votes of the remaining 28 per cent of the voters.Besides, people say that Jan Suraaj Party will get 10 per cent votes each of both alliances. That means we are expected to get 48 per cent votes of the total electorate in the coming polls,"" he said.He added that many believe Jan Suraaj will cut into the vote shares of both the NDA and the INDIA bloc.Kishor also took aim at Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, saying, ""I am saying it with full confidence that this will be the last election of Nitish Kumar. He will not celebrate the next 'Makar Sankranti' (in January 2026) at 1 Anne Marg, the official residence of the Bihar chief minister in the state capital.""He said this election would mark ""a new chapter"" in Bihar politics as people vote for ""the bright future of their children, against migration and unemployment.""The upcoming contest is set to be triangular -- the NDA alliance of BJP, JD(U), Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), Hindustan Awami Morcha, and Rashtriya Lok Shakti Party facing off against the INDIA bloc of RJD, Congress, CPI(ML), CPI, CPM, and Vikasheel Insaan Party, with Jan Suraaj emerging as a new challenger expected to disrupt traditional vote banks.","Prashant Kishor's political startup Jan Suraaj set to unveil its list of candidates on October 9.

AHMEDABAD: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return Rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets lying with banks, RBI , insurance firms, mutual funds, provident fund accounts and other institutions to their rightful owners.The three-month programme also seeks to raise awareness.

""Decades have passed when people voiced the need to return unclaimed monies from banks, RBI, or the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF). This is their money.""She said such funds often arise due to missing documentation, forgotten policies or lack of awareness. ""It is like a ripe fruit hanging within reach but not falling into the hands of those to whom it belongs,"" she remarked.The campaign rests on three pillars - Awareness, Access and Action. Awareness means informing people about unclaimed money; Access through RBI's UDGAM portal; and Action, where officials act on even small clues to help claimants.","Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman Saturday launched a nationwide campaign to return Rs 1.84 lakh crore of unclaimed financial assets.

An Indian student recently received a visa rejection letter from the US that said they were not convinced that he had sufficient ties to India that would compel him to return to India after his time in the United States. In an interview with the Washington Post, Kaushik Raj revealed that he made it clear during the application process that he was born and brought up in India and that his entire family lives in India. Kaushik Raj told Post that he feels the rejection came after the US officials went through his social media profiles, which is now a mandatory process for a visa.Kaushik Raj said he was not active on social media and did not post anything on controversial issues, but he spent four years working as a journalist and posted links of his stories.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index surged more than 4% on Monday, hitting record highs after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) elected Sanae Takaichi, an ultra-conservative and close ally of late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, as its new leader, paving the way for her to become Japan’s first female prime minister.The broader Topix index also advanced 2.3%, buoyed by investor optimism that Takaichi will continue Abe’s pro-market and stimulus-heavy economic policies.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index edged 0.1% lower to 27,119.36, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was largely unchanged at 8,984.70.Markets in mainland China, Taiwan, and South Korea remained shut for holidays, AP reported.The yen weakened against the US dollar, falling to 149.79 per dollar from 149.33 a day earlier, amid expectations that Takaichi could introduce higher public spending measures, potentially adding to inflationary pressures. The euro dipped slightly to $1.1720.Takaichi, 64, is seen as a protégé of Shinzo Abe and has long admired former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Known for her hawkish views, she has vowed to strengthen Japan’s defence, boost industrial competitiveness, and implement measures to address demographic challenges such as the country’s ageing population and rising debt burden.""The Nikkei was on course to reach as high as 48,000 by year-end, but because Takaichi was chosen as the LDP leader, it shot up toward that level already,"" Hitoshi Asaoka, the chief strategist at Asset Management One told Reuters.""The market welcomes her spending policy, but whether she can achieve that goal is not certain, as the LDP is still a minority party.

Poll Do you think the safety measures on flights are adequate? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet, to Birmingham on Saturday. The aircraft landed safely and has been grounded for checks. The RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12.While the Boeing 787 was released for service by Sunday evening (India time), the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) says “requires detailed investigation” which has been assigned to a senior air safety official. At the time of filing this story, Air India was evaluating whether to operate the about 12-year-old VT-ANO back to India as a scheduled or a ferry (without passengers) flight.RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12. Hence its deployment created a flutter on Saturday when the deployment happened on yet another AI B787-8 Dreamliner.In a statement, Air India said: “The operating crew of flight AI117 from Amritsar to Birmingham on Oct 4, 2025, detected deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) of the aircraft during its final approach.All electrical and hydraulic parameters were found normal, and the aircraft performed a safe landing at Birmingham. The aircraft has been grounded for further checks and consequently, AI114 from Birmingham to Delhi has been cancelled and alternative arrangements are being made to accommodate the guests. At Air India, the safety of passengers and crew remains top priority.”AI 117 had taken off from Amritsar at 12.52 pm on Oct 4. “During landing at 400 feet, RAT unlock message came and RAT got deployed. Pilots did not report any related abnormality. The aircraft landed safely (at Birmingham 7.07 pm, all local timings),” said a senior official, adding, “Boeing has issued a ‘fleet team digest’ containing brief of previous such cases.”According to aviation website Skybrary: “RAT is a small turbine that is installed in an aircraft and used as an alternate or emergency hydraulic or electrical power source. (It) generates power from the airstream based on the speed of the aircraft and is connected to an electrical generator or to a hydraulic pump.”“In general, modern aircraft only utilise RAT in emergency: either in the event of loss of hydraulic systems or following the loss of primary electrical generation. In these cases the RAT will power vital systems such as flight controls or flight-critical instrumentation, navigation and communication equipment. Some RATs produce only hydraulic power which in turn is used to power an electrical generator,” Skybrary adds.","The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet.

Bihar Assembly Polls: EC Announces Two-Phase Voting, Unveils 17 New Measures For Transparent Voting

NEW DELHI: In the high-stakes showdown for Bihar assembly polls, NDA, helmed by BJP and CM Nitish Kumar's JDU , is expecting a resounding endorsement of its ""double engine"" governance, claiming to have lifted the state from 'Jungle Raj' quagmire to the cusp of 'Viksit Bihar'.Home minister Amit Shah said on Monday that NDA government has pulled Bihar out of 'Jungle Raj' and given it a new direction of development and good governance, and expressed confidence that the state's people will once again choose politics of development in the coming polls.BJP president JP Nadda and JDU executive president Sanjay Jha sounded equally confident as they asserted that the polls are for continuing the state's development, ridding it of infiltrators, and stopping return of 'misgovernance'.Matrize opinion poll has projected a landslide victory for NDA with the alliance's vote share expected at 49%, translating into 150-160 seats in the 243-member assembly. 'Mahagathbandhan' (RJD-Congress-Left combine) is expected to garner 36%, accounting for 70-85 seats, it said. The projections, though always taken with a pinch of salt, will further boost the mood in NDA camp.Governing coalition views the election calendar as a canvas to paint its narrative of progress with steady focus on welfarism, even as it braces for opposition INDIA bloc's ""caste-driven"" counteroffensive.PM Modi's popularity, coupled with announcements of social empowerment schemes & development projects, complements Nitish's 'Sushasan Babu' image. The 9-term CM is seen to have retained his grip over extremely backward classes (EBCs), bolstered by an attempted 27% EBC reservation hike and local body quotas for women.Central to NDA's strategy, however, is to capitalise on the image of Modi also as a move to combat possibility of fatigue among voters after two decades of Nitish's incumbency. Besides, Shah's tactical acumen is seen as a decisive factor as he has played a crucial role in consolidating the alliance & equation among partners with a reasonable seat-sharing formula, likely to be announced soon.Yet NDA's journey isn't without potholes. Internal performance audits have indicated anti-incumbency for several sitting MLAs, prompting ticket denials to inject fresh blood, resulting in rebellions. Nitish's health is another factor that ignites hope in opposition camp even as NDA parties have played it down.","Matrize opinion poll has projected a landslide victory for NDA with the alliance's vote share expected at 49%.

NEW DELHI: For the first time in over a decade, the Centre has revised the price list for nearly 2,000 tests and procedures for CGHS beneficiaries with the increase in some cases adding up to seven times the current level.The move is expected to help over 40 lakh CGHS beneficiaries who often faced difficulties in getting treatment at some of the top hospitals due to the low rates.While in most cases the increase in rates are nominal, there are also examples of significant increases. For example, the rate of complicated extraction of a tooth under local anaesthesia has been revised from Rs 115 to Rs 800 for NABH-accredited health facilities.Similarly, the rate of MRI mammography (test to find out breast cancer), stood at Rs 2,550 for non-NABH accredited hospitals, which has now been raised 67% to Rs 4,250. In the case of NABH-accredited and super-speciality hospitals it has been increased by around 60% to Rs 5,000 for NABH-accredited and super-specialty hospitals as per the revised rate list.The rate of exploratory laparotomy — an abdominal surgery — has been revised to Rs 27,500 from Rs 25,000 for NABH accredited hospitals.The new CGHS rates will be effective Oct 13, according to a govt order. It said CGHS has adopted the structure of differential rates based on accreditation status, hospital type, city classification and ward entitlement. Under this, the non-NABH and non-NABL healthcare facilities will get 15% lower rates than NABH/NABL accredited healthcare organisations (HCOs). (NABL – National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration of Laboratories).Also, rates for super-speciality hospitals shall be 15% higher than those applicable to NABH-accredited hospitals for the corresponding super-specialities within the same city category, govt order stated. The order added the rates for healthcare facilities located in Tier II cities and Tier III cities rates shall be 10% and 20% respectively lower than those located in Tier I cities.",The move is expected to help over 40 lakh CGHS beneficiaries who often faced difficulties in getting treatment at some of the top hospitals.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan

NEW DELHI: The Army used artificial intelligence (AI) tools in a big way during Operation Sindoor against Pakistan to generate a common operational picture, intelligence analysis, threat assessment, and predictive modelling and weather forecasting for long-range strikes.“AI was extensively used for multi-sensor data fusion and multi-source data fusion in real time during Operation Sindoor…Overall, 23 apps with specific tasks were used to deal with data and inputs,” director general EME (Electronics and Mechanical Engineers) Lt-General Rajiv Kumar Sahni said on Monday.Asked about China’s huge strides in AI-driven warfare as well as active support to Pakistan during the May 7-10 cross-border hostilities, which included “live” satellite inputs on Indian military deployments, he said the Indian Army was plugged into the “IndiaAI mission” under a “whole of nation approach” as well as collaborating with industry and academia in a big way in the arena.While perceptions about China's AI capabilities exist, the Indian Army is also well-prepared and focused on national security, developing indigenous AI technologies and solutions for use in operations, logistics, autonomous weapon systems and the like, Lt-Gen Sahni added.The senior officer, who was the DG Information Systems during Operation Sindoor, said the ongoing integration of AI into the core functions of the 11.5-lakh strong Army, as part of the overall transformation drive, will bring greater speed, precision and lethality to combat operations.The key AI-driven applications used during Operation Sindoor included the electronic intelligence collation and analysis system (ECAS), a home-grown software upgraded in real time to identify and prioritise critical threats, which helped “achieve strategic dominance”, he said.Then, there was the “Trinetra” system, integrated with “Project Sanjay”, which provided a common operational picture for better coordination, situational awareness, and decision superiority. “AI was also leveraged big time for predictive modelling and weather forecasting tools, which enabled precise planning and targeting for artillery units and long-range vectors. These innovations significantly enhanced the Army’s operational preparedness and response,” he said.Having set up the AI Research and Incubation Centre in Bengaluru in Dec last year, the force is also developing an indigenous “unified AI platform” that will integrate operational, intelligence, logistics, and training applications on a single secure framework. “This will replace fragmented systems and enable validated AI deployment within 24 hours, significantly enhancing operational readiness,” an officer said.The Army is also establishing dedicated AI cells, creating secure cloud-based and edge-computing environments for battlefield applications, and developing AI-enabled autonomous systems such as drones and unmanned vehicles. “We are prioritising AI in domains where it reduces risk to personnel, improves decision-making, and strengthens resilience,” the officer said.","The Indian Army used artificial intelligence (AI) tools in a big way during Operation Sindoor against Pakistan.

Kumar, however, said the names deleted from the Bihar rolls - 65 lakh at the draft roll publication stage, and 3.7 lakh more at the final roll publication stage - were found ""ineligible"" on account of reasons like death, having permanently shifted, remaining untraced during enumeration, for being non-citizens, or having been enrolled at multiple places.""All these lists have been shared, at the level of the assembly constituency, the district level, and state level, and have been shared with the statistics,"" the CEC said. ""That is why, all these different lists that you are talking about are not at the level of EC, but at the level of the ERO, district election officer (DEO) and chief electoral officer (CEO),"" he added.EC had given a break-up of the electors covered in different categories at the time of publication of draft roll, but did not have any separate category for those deleted on account of being non-citizens. Of the 65 lakh deletions, 22 lakh were on account of being deceased, 7 lakh due to being enrolled at multiple places, and 36 lakh on account of having permanently shifted or not being found. Though the last category of 36 lakh voters is inclusive of foreign illegal immigrants, possibly covered under the category ""not found"" or ""untraced"", their exact number was not disclosed. In earlier press notes, EC had put the number of ""untraced/not found"" voters at 1 lakh, when the overall figure of dead, permanently shifted, enrolled at multiple places and untraced/not found was around 60 lakh.A further 3.7 lakh voters were removed at the time of final publication of roll, but no breakup has been provided yet on why they were deleted.","Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar did not elaborate on the figure, saying the relevant data field was not available with EC.

‘U.S. Tariffs Unfair, Actively Working To Resolve Trade Issues’: EAM Jaishankar





US President Donald Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported into the United States, effective November 1, 2025.“Beginning November 1st, 2025, all Medium and Heavy Duty Trucks coming into the United States from other Countries will be Tariffed at the Rate of 25%. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.Trump had earlier indicated that new duties on heavy truck imports would take effect on October 1, but the timeline was pushed back. The new announcement marks the latest step in his broader tariff agenda aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing.As per Bloomberg, the 25% duties are part of Trump’s expanding trade measures designed to “protect domestic industries.” The decision follows a probe launched in April by the US commerce department under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows the government to impose import taxes on goods considered vital to national security.The investigation focused on medium- and heavy-duty trucks weighing over 10,000 pounds and their components, noting that a “small number” of foreign suppliers dominate the market due to “predatory trade practices.”Last month, Trump introduced a series of tariff announcements — including 100% on pharmaceutical products, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 30% on upholstered furniture — set to begin in October.At the time, he said the 25% tariff on heavy trucks would safeguard major American truck manufacturers such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner and Mack Trucks.“In order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition, I will be imposing a 25% Tariff,” Trump wrote then, describing the move as essential to keeping the nation’s truckers “financially healthy and strong” for “national security purposes”.Trump has defended his protectionist measures as a strategy to promote domestic production, despite criticism that higher import duties could increase costs for consumers and businesses.",US President Donald Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on all medium and heavy-duty trucks imported into the United States.

Finland is ranked as the world's happiest country in the World Happiness Report, and continues to attract global talent with its high quality of life, robust social welfare system, and stunning natural landscapes. For Indian citizens, obtaining permanent residency (PR) in this Nordic nation represents a gateway to indefinite living and working rights, family reunification, and finally, citizenship. Recent immigration updates in 2025 have refined pathways for non-EU skilled workers, making Finland an appealing destination amid labour shortages in sectors like IT, healthcare, and engineering.Permanent residency in Finland allows non-EU citizens, including Indians, to live and work in the country indefinitely while enjoying access to essential public services such as healthcare and education. It also enables unrestricted travel within the Schengen Area. Unlike temporary residence permits, permanent residency does not expire, though the residence card must be renewed every five years within the specified timeframe. It is important to note that permanent residency differs from citizenship — obtaining Finnish citizenship requires meeting additional criteria, such as demonstrating language proficiency and maintaining a longer period of continuous residence, typically eight years.Recent 2025 changes focus on work visas and family reunification rather than PR directly. For instance, family sponsors now face a two-year residency requirement, and spouses must be at least 21 years old. Work permits have been streamlined for specialists, with fast-track processing for high-salary roles (minimum EUR 1,600 monthly gross, or about INR 1.65 lakh).Residency duration: You must have lived in Finland continuously for four years on a Type A (continuous) residence permit. This period starts from your entry date or the permit's issuance. Living with Type B (temporary) permits, which is given for short-term work, doesn't count in this case. Additionally, you need to have physically resided in Finland for at least two of those four years. In case of holidays or work abroad, these must be properly documented.Valid grounds for current permit: The basis for your temporary permit, like employment, family ties, must still hold, for you to apply for a PR. Permanent Residence isn't available for students or job seekers. Before applying for a PR, one must transition to a work or family-based Type A permit first.Income and professional requirements: While not explicitly required for PR, securing the initial Type A permit often demands financial stability. For work-based entry, a minimum annual income of EUR 40,000 (INR 41.3 lakh) is required, or a recognised master's/postgraduate degree plus two years of relevant experience. A C1-level Finnish/Swedish proficiency plus three years of employment as alternatives is also helpful here.Other essentials: A clean criminal record (police clearance from India), valid health insurance, and proof of accommodation are mandatory. No outstanding debts or reliance on social welfare is allowed. Criminal history can be problematic when it comes to approval.Indians typically start with a temporary residence permit application from India, then apply for PR after four years while in Finland. Processing can take a long time so be flexible with your plans.Secure a job offer, university admission, or family tie. Apply online via Enter Finland or at VFS Global centres in India. Submit biometrics and documents like passport, job contract, salary proof, apostilled certificates, and police clearance.Live in Finland on your Type A permit, extending as required.Gather passport, photos, proof of residence, income/salary slips, educational certificates, trip logs (absences), and family details if applicable.Apply in Finland before your current permit expires. Use Enter Finland with Finnish ID for faster processing.Prove identity at a Migri service point Check status via Migri's Processing Time Checker. If approved, collect your biometric PR card.Rejections (e.g., due to incomplete docs) can be appealed within 30 days for a fee of approximately EUR 260. .For unemployed permit holders, a three-month grace period applies to find new work.Here are some benefits and considerations for Indians: Indians have the perks of indefinite stay, family sponsorship, Schengen travel, free education/healthcare, and a path to citizenship after eight years (with language tests). However there are some challenges that come with this. Some of the challenges are cold climate, language barriers (Finnish/Swedish), high living costs overall.","Permanent residency in Finland allows non-EU citizens, including Indians, to live and work in the country indefinitely.

What is a Humanitarian and Compassionate Application for Canada PR ?







Canadians are outraged over a viral video of an Indian influencer suggesting people to get their babies born in Canada so that they can get Canadian PR on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Speaking in Hindi, the influencer said this could be the last option when all other routes to get permanent residency in Canada. He advised that this is ot a fool-proof route and rejections can happen and so one should take this route only after proper planning and legal consultation.""This should be your last option,"" the man said, asking his viewers to comment 'baby' to get more information.While the date of the video is not clear, it has now surfaced -- riding on the anti-India wave across US-Canada -- irking Canadians about the detailed scheming going on to get permanent residency in Canada.""The parasite class is now promoting to have a baby in Canada as a way to get Permanent Residence. Liberal's BillC3 will turn this into chain mass citizenship handouts. We need every loophole closed and mass deportation immediately,"" one wrote.One blamed the liberal government for allowing such loopholes and said that the liberal government is the real parasite. Many exclaimed how this route can be advertised like this.The Humanitarian and Compassionate (H&C) grounds application is a special pathway that allows a person already living in Canada without permanent status to apply for PR based on exceptional personal circumstances. It is not a standard immigration stream, but a discretionary decision made by IRCC (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada). People who are already in Canada and do not qualify for other PR programs can apply for this, showing that leaving Canada would cause hardship for the family -- the case becomes strengthened if there is a Canadian citizen child.Parents of Canada-born children do not become Canadian citizens automatically, though the baby automatically becomes a Canadian citizen. To get Canadian PR, parents have to qualify through Express Entry (for skilled workers), Provincial Nominee Programs, family sponsorship, study or work permits.",An Indian influencer suggests people to get their babies born in Canada so that they can get Canadian PR on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH





The Hindu American Foundation Monday said they do not work as the spokesperson of any Indian government or any political party, reacting to MP Shashi Tharoor's allegation that the Indian-American community remained largely silent or absent as the US and India are caught in a quandary over several conflicting issues like tariffs and H-1B visas.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor recently met a delegation of Indian-American politicians in India and claimed that one of them told Tharoor that her office did not get any call from any Indian-American voter asking her to raise the issue with India.The silence of the Indian-origin tech CEOs has also come under scrutiny as they use the H-1B visa programs the most and now that the Donald Trump administration raised the H-1B visa fee to $100,000, these companies will have to pay the fee if they want to hire Indians or skilled people from any other countries.Tharoor's accusation triggered a debate with many Indian-Americans commenting that their situation is difficult as they are often considered as 'foreign agents' in India and 'deportable' in the US.""As American citizens of Indian origin we are indeed in a unique position to provide nuance to often one-dimensional narratives about India and Indians. We help elected leaders understand ground realities in India and dispel disinformation, not as mouthpieces for any Indian government or political party, but as Americans who straddle both cultures and are engaged in the democratic processes of our own country.And we do,"" the Hindu American Foundation said.Tharoor replied to the pushback and said he's happy that his questions got the diaspora thinking. ""Their challenges are indeed different from those of Jewish-Americans and Cuban-Americans, the examples I cited in my piece. But that doesn’t mean that within the rules of US democracy, they can’t make their voices heard — as these other groups so effectively do!"" he said.Earlier, HAF director Suhag A Shukla reacted to Tharoor's allegation and said the Indian government should not expect the diaspora to become their lobbyist. ""The Govt of India does not ask our approval for its oil policy or import duties, and so @shashitharoor and the GOI shouldn't be expecting us to champion their sovereign policy decisions with the U.S. government.

'Brightest minds' essential to America's future argues Huang



Critics warn of talent exodus







US President Donald Trump passed an executive order increasing the H-1B visa fees last month. After the revised regulation the H-1B visa fee for fresh application stands at $100,000. Now, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has voiced his support from Trump’s proposal to impose $1,00,000 fee. Speaking on the BG2 Pod last week, Huang called the move ‘a great start’. Huang said that the increase in the H-1B visa fees will help in reshaping the immigrant policy, even as critics warn the beginning on brain drain and undermine America’s tech leadership.Speaking about his own journey as an immigrant, Huang stressed on the symbolic power of the American dream. “America has one singular brand reputation that no country in the world has—the American dream… what country has the word dream behind it?” he said. He recounted how his parents sent him to the U.S. with no money, and how he built his life from scratch: “We started from nothing… and here I am.”Along with this, Huang also acknowledged that the fees of $100,000 is quite high but he believes that this increase will set a meaningful threshold. “Probably sets the bar a little too high, but as a first bar, it at least eliminates illegal immigration and that’s a good start,” he added.In a separate CNBC interview Monday, Huang reinforced his position on immigration reform. ""We want all the brightest minds to come to the United States. Remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream, and we represent the American dream,"" he told CNBC, expressing support for Trump's efforts to address the immigration system.Nvidia employed 1,519 H-1B visa holders out of 36,000 employees worldwide at the end of fiscal year 2025, making it one of the largest tech employers of H-1B workers in the United States, according to a Business Insider analysis from March. The White House clarified earlier this month that the $100,000 fee applies only to new applicants, not visa renewals.Announced last month by the Trump administration, the H-1B visa fee hike is described as a one-time charge for new applications. The increase is fees is aimed at prioritising American workers over immigrants. However, the economist and the tech leaders feel that this move could adversely affect the US. Andrew Ng, co-founder of Google Brain, said the policy creates uncertainty that deters global talent.

History of Daylight saving time



Congressional debate and division over ending daylight saving time



Health risks and state efforts to end the twice-yearly clock changes

Daylight saving time (DST) is trending again as Americans get ready to adjust their clocks this fall. Observed since the 1960s, DST was created to maximise longer summer evenings by moving clocks forward in spring and back in autumn. In 2025, clocks will “fall back” on November 2 at 2 am, giving an extra hour of sleep but earlier sunsets in many regions. While some lawmakers and citizens support making DST permanent, others prefer standard time year-round, and many favor keeping the current system. Congressional efforts, including the Sunshine Protection Act of 2025, aim to resolve this debate, but progress has stalled. For now, Americans should prepare to enjoy that extra hour when DST ends, while also considering potential impacts on health, safety, and daily routines across different communities.As per the reports, Daylight saving time in 2025 will end on Sunday, November 2, at 2 am, when clocks will be set back one hour to 1 am This marks the second-earliest possible date for the seasonal time change to conclude. For Americans, this means an extra hour of sleep, earlier sunsets, and longer nights in many parts of the country.Next year, daylight saving time will begin again on Sunday, March 8, 2026, when clocks “spring forward” to extend evening daylight.The “spring forward, fall back” pattern has become ingrained in American life, but it has also sparked controversy over health, safety, and energy efficiency.Daylight saving time was first implemented widely in the US during World War II and later reintroduced in 1973 to conserve energy amid an oil crisis. However, public resistance led to its repeal just a year later. Since the 1960s, DST has been observed nearly nationwide, though some states, like Arizona and Hawaii, have opted out.The practice was designed to make better use of daylight, reducing the need for artificial lighting and giving longer summer evenings. Over the years, however, researchers and policymakers have debated its impact on sleep patterns, health, and productivity.Lawmakers have repeatedly attempted to eliminate the twice-yearly clock changes. In March 2022, the US Senate unanimously voted to make daylight saving time permanent, but the effort stalled in the House of Representatives due to lack of consensus.As reported by The Oklahoman, most recently, a bipartisan group of 16 senators renewed the push to keep DST year-round, but Congress has yet to hold hearings. In December, President Donald Trump also expressed support for ending daylight saving time, calling it “inconvenient” and “costly” for the nation.The American public and lawmakers remain divided: some favor staying on standard time year-round, others advocate for permanent daylight saving time, while many prefer to maintain the current system. H.R. 139, known as the Sunshine Protection Act of 2025, was introduced by Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Florida) to make daylight saving time permanent across the US The bill would allow states that already do not observe DST to remain on standard time, giving them flexibility.An identical version was introduced in the Senate on January 7, 2025. Together, the two bills have 45 cosponsors, including Rep. Stephanie Bice (R-Oklahoma). Despite growing interest, the legislation has yet to see significant movement.Critics of the twice-yearly time change argue that switching clocks can lead to sleep disruption, reduced productivity, and increased health risks. While proponents of year-round DST argue it can improve evening leisure time and economic activity, history shows that public opinion is often mixed, with concerns about darker winter mornings and safety.Since 2015, around 30 states have considered or passed legislation to end the semi-annual clock changes, sometimes contingent on neighboring states doing the same.","In 2025, clocks will “fall back” on November 2 at 2 am, giving an extra hour of sleep but earlier sunsets in many regions.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Court ruling: Personal item, not commercial consignment





The Customs Commissioner had rightly permitted redemption of the Rolex watch.

However, the classification of a single luxury watch as “commercial quantity” was deemed legally incorrect.

The bench stated, “Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use.”

Final outcome and broader implications









In a case that tested the boundaries of customs classification and personal property rights, the Delhi High Court has ruled that a single Rolex watch seized from a Dubai-based Indian traveler does not constitute a ""commercial quantity."" While upholding penalties imposed by customs authorities, the court clarified the legal interpretation of personal use under customs law, offering critical guidance for international passengers carrying high-value personal items.On March 7, 2024, Mahesh Malkani, an Indian citizen and current resident of Dubai, landed at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport wearing a Rolex Submariner valued at approximately AED 56,000 (around ₹12.7 lakh). Upon arrival, he passed through the Green Channel, which is reserved for travelers with no dutiable goods to declare.However, customs officials intercepted Malkani, seized his Rolex watch, and issued a detention receipt. The customs department alleged that Malkani had used the wrong channel to import the watch, thus violating baggage rules. Officials concluded that the watch was not for personal use and categorized the single item as a ""commercial quantity"" under customs provisions.Following the seizure, an Order-in-Original dated January 30, 2025, was issued by the Commissioner of Customs, IGI Airport, permitting Malkani to redeem the watch for re-export purposes. This redemption was allowed on the condition that he pay:The order required Malkani to complete the redemption process within 120 days of its issuance. However, he failed to meet the deadline and instead challenged the order in court, arguing against the classification of the watch as commercial and seeking clarity on the redemption terms.The case was heard by a Division Bench of Justices Pratibha M. Singh and Sahil Jain in the Delhi High Court, which delivered its judgment on September 17, 2025.The court made several key observations:The court concluded that wearing a high-value watch while travelling does not by itself justify its seizure as commercial import, especially when the item is clearly for personal use.While the court upheld the redemption fine and penalty, it provided an extended deadline of October 31, 2025, for Malkani to pay the charges and reclaim the detained watch. The ruling did not waive any financial obligations previously imposed but gave Malkani another opportunity to complete the process.The court also stressed the importance of practical and cautious adjudication in similar future cases, particularly when it involves passengers carrying personal belongings. It urged customs officials to avoid arbitrary or blanket classifications that may not stand up to legal scrutiny.Legal experts have welcomed the judgment as a corrective step in customs enforcement. Supreme Court advocate Dr. Sujay Kantawala noted that the ruling “underscores that customs must take a practical view of what counts as ‘personal use’ versus ‘commercial quantity.’”This case also serves as a reminder to international travelers: under Indian customs regulations, luxury goods exceeding AED 2,000 in value (approx. ₹45,000) must be declared upon arrival. Failure to do so, even unintentionally, can lead to hefty fines, seizures, and legal complications—even if the item is for personal use.","Delhi High Court rules single Rolex watch worn by Dubai resident is for personal use, not commercial import.

Previous Incidents Linked to Jora





GURGAON: In a joint late-night operation by Gurgaon Crime Branch Sector 43 and Delhi Police ’s Special Staff, a wanted criminal from Nepal, Bhim Mahabahadur Jora, was killed in an encounter at Astha Kunj Park, Delhi, late Monday night.The 30-year-old was carrying a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh and was wanted in several crimes including murder, dacoity, and a recent Rs 20 lakh burglary in Gurgaon at the house of a BJP functionary.According to police, the operation was led by Inspector Narendra Sharma of Sector 43 Crime Branch.Crime branch here received a tip-off late Monday that Bhim Jora was spotted at Astha Kunj Park, near Nehru Place, along with an associate. As the teams converged on the location, Jora, spotting the police, opened indiscriminate fire in an attempt to escape.Inspector Narendra Sharma, whose bulletproof jacket was hit during the exchange, narrowly escaped injury. Despite police warnings to surrender, Jora continued to fire. In retaliatory firing, he was critically injured and rushed to AIIMS Trauma Centre, where he died during the treatment.Meanwhile his accomplice managed to flee.Jora, originally from Nepal, was the alleged kingpin of a transnational Nepali theft and dacoity gang. He had been absconding for 17 months, evading arrest for his role in a brutal May 2024 murder of 63-year-old Dr. Yogesh Chandra Paul in Jangpura, New Delhi during a robbery bid. Police say he, along with five others, killed the doctor. While he was evading arrest, four accused were arrested in that case.""He was also involved in a burglary on October 2, whereRs 20 lakh was stolen from the home of BJP functionary Mamta Bhardwaj in Orchid Petals Society, Sector 49, Gurgaon. His associate in the crime, Yuvraj Thapa, was arrested on the same day by Crime Branch 43 from Anand Vihar, Delhi. Delhi Police had announced a reward ofRs 1 lakh and one-rank promotion for personnel involved in his arrest of Jora, wanted in multiple cases of theft, dacoity, and murder across India"", a senior police officer said.Police investigations revealed that Jora operated a well-organized gang that infiltrated Indian cities using fake Aadhaar cards. Male and female associates from Nepal were placed as domestic help in affluent homes in Delhi, Gurgaon, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Surat.They would work for a few days to gain trust, then execute thefts by drugging family members or holding one hostage, looting cash, gold, and valuables before fleeing to Nepal.Last month, three Nepali nationals linked to this gang were arrested by Crime Branch-43 while looking for domestic work in Gurgaon using forged identity documents.In July 2025, a property dealer's house in Civil Lines, Gurgaon was targeted by Jora along with a Nepali woman named Smriti Buda (alias Pooja) and male associate Hemant Thukri. The couple was drugged and looted ofRs 3.8 lakh. Smriti and Hemant fled to Nepal, though Thukri was later arrested by Crime Branch 43.Jora had multiple cases pending in both Delhi and Gurugram, and his true identity remained elusive due to fake documentation, making it difficult for law enforcement to track him.Police officials credited the coordination between Delhi and Gurgaon police for the successful neutralization of a dangerous criminal."" Constable Rohit Balauriya of Crime Branch 43 played a key role in tracking Jora’s movements. A major threat has been neutralised. The joint operation reflects the high level of synergy between law enforcement agencies. Now that Jora is dead, focus shifts to identifying and arresting his fleeing associate, and dismantling the broader gang network spread across multiple cities"", a senior police officer said.","Bhim Mahabahadur Jora, 30, was killed in an encounter at Astha Kunj Park, Delhi, late Monday night.

What is the FCI Fort Dix?







Following his sentencing to four years and two months in prison on federal charges related to the transportation of individuals for prostitution, hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs has requested to serve his term at FCI Fort Dix, a low-security federal facility in New Jersey known for its drug treatment and rehabilitation programs.Combs’ legal team filed a request on Monday designating the New Jersey facility as his preferred prison following his sentencing on Friday for prostitution-related charges.“In order to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts, we request that the Court strongly recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that Mr. Combs be placed at FCI Fort Dix for RDAP purposes and any other available educational and occupational programs,” Combs’ attorney Tony Geragos said in a letter addressed to judge Arun Subramanian, as cited by the New York Post.The Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP) is the Bureau of Prisons’ most comprehensive treatment program.FCI Fort Dix, located on the McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst joint military base about 64 miles southwest of New York City, is the largest single federal prison by population, housing just under 3,900 inmates.The low-security facility also includes an adjacent minimum-security prison camp with 210 inmates.For a time, it was run by the warden who had been in charge of a Manhattan federal jail when financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himself at the jail in 2019.That warden, Lamine N'Diaye, has since retired.Fort Dix has been home to several high-profile inmates over the years, including reputed mobsters, drug traffickers, corrupt politicians, and ""Pharma Bro"" Martin Shkreli, as cited by CBS News.While at Fort Dix, Shkreli was placed in solitary confinement following allegations that he used a contraband smartphone to manage his drug company from prison, a violation of rules that prohibit inmates from conducting business or possessing cellphones.In 2021, a 27-year-old inmate at the prison was stabbed in the eye by another prisoner.In 2019, a Fort Dix inmate, a former inmate, and two others were arrested for using a drone to smuggle contraband, including cellphones, tobacco, weight-loss supplements, and eyeglasses. That same year, a correctional officer at the facility pleaded guilty to accepting bribes to smuggle in contraband in a separate case.","Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was sentenced on Friday to four years and two months in prison on federal charges related to the transportation of individuals for prostitution.

All about the Nobel prize in physiology/medicine

Alfred Nobel had an active interest in medical research and the Physiology/Medicine award was the third prize area the inventor mentioned in his will.

A total of 114 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded since 1901; over 227 individuals have received the award between 1901-2023.

Of the 227 individuals awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 13 are women.

The youngest recipient of the prize was 31-year old Frederick G. Banting in 1923. He was recognised for the discovery of insulin.

The oldest recipient was 87-year-old Peyton Rous in 1966 for his discovery of tumour-inducing viruses.

The Nobel Prize medal in physiology and medicine was designed by Swedish sculptor and engraver Erik Lindberg and represents the Genius of Medicine holding an open book in her lap, collecting the water pouring out from a rock in order to quench a sick girl’s thirst.

Sakaguchi says time will come when cancer is no longer scary, but curable





STOCKHOLM: US scientists Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi from Japan won the 2025 Nobel Prize for medicine Monday for work shedding light on how the immune system spares healthy cells, creating openings for possible new cancer and autoimmune disease treatments.Their work laid the foundation for a new research field identifying so-called regulatory T cells, “the immune system’s security guards” that prevent the body from harming itself, the Nobel committee said.The discoveries relate to peripheral immune tolerance, or “how we keep our immune system under control so we can fight microbes and still avoid autoimmune disease”, said Marie Wahren-Herlenius, professor at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, whose Nobel panel selects the winners.The institute’s Thomas Perlmann said therapies based on the discoveries had yet to win market clearance but over 200 trials on humans were ongoing. AgenciesSakaguchi, a professor at Osaka University, told a press conference in Japan that he hoped the award would “serve as an opportunity for this field to develop further... in a direction where it can be applied in actual bedside and clinical settings”.The Nobel committee was unable to reach the two US-based laureates to break the news to them in person.Brunkow is senior programme manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, while Ramsdell is scientific adviser at Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco.Sakaguchi got a congratulatory phone call from Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba during the presser, who asked him how effective immunotherapy could be for cancer treatment in the future. “I believe the time will come when cancer is no longer a scary disease, but a curable one,” said Sakaguchi.The Nobel jury earlier said, “The hope is to be able to treat or cure autoimmune diseases, provide more effective cancer treatments and prevent serious complications after stem cell transplants.”Brunkow later told the Nobel Foundation she had been sleeping when the call came. “My career in science has changed quite a bit since that work was done, and I don’t actually even work in that particular field anymore,” she said in an interview on the foundation’s website. “It’s an honour to have been a part of that.”Ramsdell had still not been contacted hours after the announcement.","US scientists Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi from Japan won the 2025 Nobel Prize for medicine.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

Layers of Roman life

Anglo-Saxon and medieval insights



A marketplace built over history





Beneath the bustling heart of Leicester, England, archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s historic Market Place. What began as a routine excavation for urban redevelopment has turned into one of the most significant discoveries in recent UK archaeology. The dig, led by the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS), is part of a £7.5 million project by Leicester City Council to create a new market square. The team uncovered the long-lost Gainsborough Chamber—a medieval civic building first recorded in 1533, infamous for its “vile prison.” They also discovered layers of Roman and Anglo-Saxon life, artifacts, and even a Roman infant burial, offering an extraordinary window into centuries of human history lying silently beneath the modern marketplace.At the centre of the discovery is the Gainsborough Chamber, demolished around 1748 but now partially restored in the archaeological record. Historical texts describe it as a “most vile prison,” where harsh conditions likely made it infamous in medieval Leicester. Archaeologists uncovered its thick stone walls, a stone-lined well, and remnants of the dungeon, confirming the building’s architectural and civic importance.According to historian Charles Billson, a prisoner in 1533 described being chained, lying on hard planks, and receiving no comfort or company, highlighting the dungeon’s grim reputation. Gavin Speed, the lead archaeologist, emphasized that this area of Leicester had remained largely untouched until the current excavation, making the discovery even more remarkable.The excavation revealed a wealth of Roman-era remains, including a timber building later replaced by a stone structure. Artifacts such as Roman tesserae, pottery, coins, and jewellery help reconstruct daily life in ancient Leicester. A particularly poignant find was the burial of a Roman infant beneath the timber structure, likely around 1,900 years ago, providing a glimpse into family life and customs from nearly two millennia ago. The later stone building was constructed directly over the earlier timber house, showing how the city evolved over time. These findings underscore Leicester’s long-standing significance as a Roman settlement and trade hub.Beneath the medieval layers, archaeologists uncovered a thick Anglo-Saxon soil layer, shedding light on a little-understood period in Leicester’s history. Compacted pebbles, overlain by silts and successive resurfacing layers, revealed nearly 800 years of continuous market activity. Post-holes from medieval market stalls offer rare physical evidence of the city’s commercial past. Dr. Speed described the site as “like a slice through an archaeological cake,” showing how each layer represents a different generation of market activity and urban life. These discoveries reveal how Leicester’s central square continuously adapted to social and economic changes, blending Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and medieval influences across centuries.The dig confirms Leicester’s role as a historic trade centre, with layers of activity preserved beneath the modern square. The city council plans to repave the market in porphyry by the end of 2026 but hopes to display some of the archaeological finds to the public. Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby highlighted that the expertise of ULAS has revealed how the site has been used for thousands of years, from Roman settlers to Victorian traders. While shoppers walk above, centuries of human history remain hidden just below their feet, from infant burials to bustling medieval markets. This remarkable find reminds us that every step through Leicester’s marketplace is a step across two millennia of living history.","Archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s Market Place.

We share an ambition for a modern defence and security partnership, a fundamental pillar of UK-India Vision 2035, agreed by our PMs this year,” said British high commissioner to India, Lindy Cameron.“The engagements between the CSGs of our two navies demonstrate our commitment to maintaining the rules-based international order in the region and lay the groundwork for future cooperation,” she added.The biennial naval exercise will include complex maritime operational drills focusing on anti-air, anti-surface and anti-submarine exercises as well as flying operations and other seamanship evolutions.The UK CSG is also scheduled to participate in a one-day aerial defence exercise with the IAF, which will deploy Sukhoi-30MKI and Jaguar fighters, off the west coast on Oct 14.“Exercise Konkan will serve as a platform to consolidate strategic ties, enhance interoperability and contribute to regional maritime stability. It is a reaffirmation of the shared commitment to ensuring secure, open and free seas,” Indian Navy spokesperson Captain Vivek Madhwal said.The Konkan series of exercises has grown significantly in scale and complexity over the last two decades, fostering enhanced interoperability and mutual understanding in maritime operations between the two navies, he added.The UK CSG is currently on an eight-month multinational deployment called ""Operation Highmast"", which includes complex exercises with partners and allies in the region.

Defence, investment, and the new space race





Europe’s space ambitions are at a critical juncture, according to Bernard Liautaud, managing partner at Balderton Capital. Speaking at the Italian Tech Week event, Liautaud warned that the continent risks falling behind in the rapidly expanding space and defence sectors due to an excessive dependence on American companies, particularly Elon Musk’s SpaceX . While European start-ups have made notable advances in satellite technology and defence innovation, SpaceX’s dominance in launch services and communications infrastructure poses a “huge risk” to Europe’s technological sovereignty and national security. Liautaud urged governments to accelerate investment in domestic capabilities and nurture home-grown innovation to strengthen Europe’s position in the global space race.Liautaud cautioned that European nations remain overly reliant on American firms for satellite launches and space-based infrastructure. SpaceX, now valued at around $400 billion (£315 billion), dominates both the commercial launch market and the communications satellite sector, a dependency he described as strategically dangerous. “We need to be more self-sufficient,” he said, underlining that control over space technology is becoming a decisive factor in military and economic strength. Despite US dominance, Europe’s start-up ecosystem is showing promising growth. Liautaud argued that supporting such enterprises is essential for Europe’s strategic autonomy, calling start-ups “a key ingredient” in the effort to achieve technological sovereignty.European investment in defence and aerospace technology has surged since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, driving the emergence of new firms specialising in drones, battlefield software, and orbital infrastructure. Liautaud stressed that space-based capabilities are now integral to both military supremacy and global competitiveness. By cultivating independent launch systems and communications networks, Europe can reduce its exposure to foreign political and commercial pressures.Industry leaders share Liautaud’s concern. Hélène Huby, founder of The Exploration Company and a former Airbus executive, described Europe as “quite weak right now regarding space-based infrastructure.” With US giants like SpaceX and Blue Origin racing ahead, the window for Europe to build independent capabilities is rapidly closing. “We must act now,” Liautaud urged, framing Europe’s challenge not merely as a question of innovation but of strategic survival in the new era of space competition.","Bernard Liautaud, managing partner at Balderton Capital, says Europe needs to be more self-sufficient in space technology.

Heat-related deaths in Spain up 88% from last year: Health ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/heat-related-deaths-in-spain-up-88-from-last-year-health-ministry/articleshow/124323927.cms,"Representative image





MADRID: The number of heat-related deaths in Spain between May 16 and September 30 hit 3,832, an 87.6-percent increase from the same period in 2024, the health ministry said Thursday.Nearly two-thirds of the deaths involved people over the age of 85, and almost 96 percent were over 65, it said in a statement.The figures were estimated using statistical models, the statement said, adding that they may still be revised.The ministry used data from Spain's Mortality Monitoring System (MoMo), which tracks daily mortality nationwide and compares it to historical trends.It also incorporates external factors, such as weather data from the national meteorological agency AEMET, to assess likely causes of mortality spikes.Although MoMo cannot confirm a direct cause between deaths and high temperatures, it provides the most reliable estimate of fatalities in which heat was likely a decisive factor.Most heat-related excess deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable.The health ministry reported 25 deaths from heatstroke during the same period.Most victims had risk factors such as chronic illnesses, were exposed to high temperatures at work or during leisure activities, or lived alone or in homes without air conditioning, it said.Scientists have warned persistently that human-driven climate change is resulting in more frequent and intense weather events worldwide.Spain this year sweltered through its hottest summer since records began in 1961, with an average temperature of 24.2C, according to AEMET.Of the 90 days of summer, 33 were marked by heatwaves, AEMET said.The country endured a 16-day heatwave in August which fuelled wildfires that killed four people and destroyed a record area of land.That heatwave was ""the most intense on record"", with an average temperature 4.6C higher than average, exceeding the last record set in July 2022.Nine of the 10 hottest summers in Spain since 1961 have occurred in the 21st century, according to AEMET.Britain, Japan and South Korea also endured the hottest summers this year since each country began keeping records, according to their weather agencies.","The number of heat-related deaths in Spain between May 16 and September 30 hit 3,832.

What is K Visa





China’s new K visa for foreign professionals is facing criticism on social media even before it comes into effect. Netizens have raised concerns over its timing, fairness, and potential impact on domestic employment.Originally scheduled to launch on October 1, the visa’s rollout has been delayed as Chinese embassies abroad remain closed until October 8 for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays.The K visa, described as China’s version of the H-1B, was announced in August but gained attention only after US president Donald Trump highlighted the USD 1,00,000 fee for H-1B visas, which mainly benefit Indian professionals.Critics pointed to China’s high unemployment, estimated at around 19 per cent over the past two years, and the pressure of 12 million new graduates entering the job market each year. Many questioned the policy favouring foreign STEM graduates over domestic talent.Concerns were also raised over the lack of employer sponsorship, which could increase the risk of fraud and low-quality applications.One Weibo user wrote: “It is already hard to verify domestic degrees. With the K visa, agencies may exploit the system to help foreigners get visas. How will each application be properly vetted?”Others asked why foreign bachelor’s degree holders are treated as ‘tech talent’ while young Chinese graduates struggle to find jobs and often pursue master’s degrees.Some suggested that a master’s degree should be the minimum requirement for K visa applicants.The newly introduced K visa, announced in August, aims to attract young international STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates by offering entry, residency and work authorisation without requiring any prior work offer.According to Xinhua, the K visa will offer longer validity, multiple entries, and extended stay periods compared to China’s 12 existing visa types. Holders can engage in education, culture, science and technology exchanges, as well as entrepreneurial and business activities.","The K visa, described as China’s version of the H-1B, was announced in August.

NEW DELHI: India and China are set to resume direct passenger flights by the end of October 2025, the ministry of external affairs said on Thursday, marking a significant step towards restoring normalcy in bilateral ties.In a press release, the MEA said both sides have been holding technical-level discussions since earlier this year on restarting direct air services and revising the Air Services Agreement.""Following these discussions, it has now been agreed that direct air services connecting designated points in India and China can resume by late October 2025, in keeping with the winter season schedule, subject to commercial decision of the designated carriers from the two countries and fulfilment of all operational criteria,"" the press release added.MEA added that the move is expected to expand people-to-people contact between the two neighbours.""This agreement of the civil aviation authorities will further facilitate people-to-people contact between India and China, contributing towards the gradual normalisation of bilateral exchanges,"" it said.IndiGo announced the resumption of its service to Mainland China following the recent diplomatic initiatives.It will resume its flight services connecting Kolkata to Guangzhou (CAN) with daily, non-stop flights starting October 26, according to the official statement.""Subject to regulatory approvals, IndiGo will also introduce direct flights between Delhi and Guangzhou shortly. IndiGo will use its Airbus A320neo aircraft to operate these flights that will re-establish avenues for cross-border trade and strategic business partnerships and promote tourism between the two nations,"" the airline said.IndiGo said its ""past experience and familiarity with local partners"" enabled it to resume these flights swiftly.IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said: ""We are proud to be amongst the first to resume direct connectivity to China from two points in India. This will once again allow seamless movement of people, goods, and ideas, while also strengthening bilateral ties between the two of the world’s most populous countries and fast-growing economies… looking at introducing more direct flights into China."" The flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou will open for sale from Friday.The significant development came after an ice-breaker meeting between PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in China during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit.In 2019, India and China had 539 direct flights operated by airlines including Air India, IndiGo, China Southern and China Eastern. In March 2020, international flights were halted during Covid. The Galwan Valley clashes in June 2020 sent ties between the two countries into a deep chill. Since 2020, travelling between India and China means doing so through a third country, mostly in Southeast Asia.",India and China set to resume direct passenger flights by the end of October 2025.
