"Ratan Tata made India a better, kinder and more hopeful place: Narendra Modi",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ratan-tata-made-india-a-better-kinder-and-more-hopeful-place-prime-minister-narendra-modi/articleshow/115101491.cms,"- Prime Minister

It has been a month since Ratan Tata left us. From bustling cities and towns to villages, his absence is being deeply felt across every segment of society. Seasoned industrialists, budding entrepreneurs and hardworking professionals are mourning his loss. Those passionate about the environment and devoted to philanthropy are equally saddened. His absence has been deeply felt not only across the nation but also around the world.For the youth, Tata was an inspiration, a reminder that dreams are worth pursuing and that success can coexist with compassion as well as humility. For others, he represented the finest traditions of Indian enterprise and a steadfast commitment to the values of integrity, excellence and service.Under his leadership, the Tata Group scaled new heights, embodying respect, honesty and credibility worldwide. Despite this, he wore his achievements lightly, with humility and kindness.Tata's unwavering support for the dreams of others was one of his most defining qualities. In recent years, he became known for mentoring India's StartUp ecosystem, investing in many promising ventures. He understood the hopes and aspirations of young entrepreneurs and recognised the potential they had to shape India's future. By backing their efforts, he empowered a generation of dreamers to take bold risks and push boundaries. This has gone a long way in creating a culture ofinnovation and entrepreneurship, which I am confident will continue to positively impact India for decades to come.He constantly championed excellence, urging Indian enterprises to set global benchmarks. This vision, I hope, will inspire our future leaders to make India synonymous with world-class quality.His greatness was not restricted to the boardroom or helping fellow humans. His compassion extended to all living beings. His deep love for animals was well-known and he supported every possible effort focused on animal welfare. He often shared photos of his dogs, who were as much a part of his life as any business venture. His life was a reminder to us all that true leadership is measured not just by one's achievements, but by one's ability to care for the most vulnerable.For crores of Indians, Tata's patriotism shone brightest in times of crisis. His swift reopening of the iconic Taj Hotel in Mumbai after the 26/11 terror attacks was a rallying call to the nation - India stands united, refusing to yield to terrorism.On a personal note, I had the privilege of knowing him very closely over the years. We worked closely in Gujarat, where he invested extensively, including in many projects he was very passionate about. Just a few weeks ago, I was in Vadodara with the President of the Government of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, and we jointly inaugurated an aircraft complex where C-295 aircraft would be made in India. It was Tata who started working on this. Needless to say, Tata's presence was greatly missed.I remember Tata would frequently write to me on various issues, be it matters of governance, expressing appreciation for government support, or sending congratulatory wishes after electoral victories.Our close interactions continued when I moved to the Centre and he remained a committed partner in our nation-building efforts. Tata's support for the Swachh Bharat Mission was particularly close to my heart. He was a vocal advocate of this mass movement, understanding that cleanliness, hygiene and sanitation are vital for India's progress. I still remember his heartfelt video message for the Swachh Bharat Mission's tenth anniversary at the start of October. It was among his final public appearances.Another cause close to his heart was healthcare, especially the fight against cancer. I recall a programme in Assam two years ago where we had jointly inaugurated various cancer hospitals in the state. In his remarks at that time, he had categorically stated that he wished to dedicate his final years to healthcare. His efforts to make health and cancer care accessible and affordable were rooted in a profound empathy for those battling diseases, believing that a just society was one that stood by its most vulnerable.As we remember him today, we are reminded of the society he envisioned - where business can serve as a force for good, where every individual's potential is valued and where progress is measured in the well-being and happiness of all. He remains alive in the lives he touched and the dreams he nurtured. Generations will be grateful to him for making India a better, kinder and more hopeful place.","Prime Minister: Ratan Tata's absence is being deeply felt across every segment of society.

Challenges and Limitations of an Electoral College for India



Disproportionate Representation:

Winner-Takes-All System Risks:

Encourages Strategic Targeting:

Potential for Electoral College Deadlock:

In the United States, the Electoral College system plays a pivotal role in presidential elections. Each state is allocated a specific number of electoral votes based on its population, and most states follow a winner-takes-all approach, where the candidate with the majority vote secures all of the state's electoral votes. This system means that winning populous states like California, Texas, and Florida is crucial for a candidate's success. For instance, California, with its 55 electoral votes—the highest of any state—has been a significant factor in determining election outcomes.Imagine if India, with its diverse and populous states, adopted a similar Electoral College system for its general elections. How would key states like Uttar Pradesh , Maharashtra, and West Bengal, known for their significant populations, impact the results? In such a model, securing the majority vote in a few large states could potentially change the entire outcome, making India’s federal elections more strategic and less about direct popular support. With that in mind, let’s explore what India’s 2014, 2019, and 2024 elections might look like if they were held under an Electoral College system similar to that of the US.The US Electoral College is a unique voting mechanism used to elect the President. Each state is assigned a specific number of electoral votes based on its population size, with larger states receiving more votes. In nearly every state, the candidate who wins the majority of votes claims all the electoral votes for that state—a “winner-takes-all” approach. To win the presidency, a candidate needs to secure more than half of the total 538 electoral votes nationally. This system prioritises victories in populous and diverse states, as winning these larger prizes is essential for an overall majority.India’s electoral process for the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament) follows the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system. In each constituency, the candidate who receives the most votes wins a seat, regardless of the percentage of total votes. The party or coalition that wins the majority of Lok Sabha seats forms the government. Unlike the US, every individual vote counts towards a single national result, often allowing one party or coalition to gain dominance with only a plurality, rather than an absolute majority, of the popular vote.To estimate India’s election results under an Electoral College model, we assigned each state a number of “electoral votes” equivalent to its Lok Sabha seats, as they are already based on state populations. This produced a total of 543 electoral votes. For simplicity, states were categorized as either going to the NDA (BJP-led coalition) or to the opposition based on the highest vote share. Here, the NDA would receive all of a state’s electoral votes if it held the majority of the vote share there, and all other votes would go to the “Others” category, representing opposition alliances and regional parties.In the actual 2014 election, the NDA led by BJP swept the country, winning 336 of the 543 seats. Under an Electoral College system:337 electoral votes182 electoral votesThe winner-takes-all system would have amplified the NDA’s victory, giving it a higher electoral total than under FPTP due to its dominance in populous states.In 2019, the NDA further solidified its position, winning 353 seats. Under an Electoral College model:355 electoral votes164 electoral votesThe electoral vote outcome would again favor the NDA significantly. The swing in NDA's favor in key states would secure it a majority, increasing its winning margin relative to the FPTP model.In 2024, the NDA secured 293 seats, while the opposition alliance INDIA won 234 seats. Under an Electoral College system:342 electoral votes177 electoral votesDespite a reduced seat count compared to 2019, the NDA would still maintain a majority in the Electoral College, highlighting the impact of winning populous states under this system.Here’s a breakdown of how this might look:BJP won 282 seats on its own. In an Electoral College model, BJP would win the entire set of electoral votes from each state where it had the majority vote share in 2014.Approximately 312 electoral votesBJP increased its solo count to 303 seats. Under the Electoral College model, it would likely secure the majority vote in several key populous states, especially those it carried comfortably in 2019.: Approximately 325 electoral votesWith BJP winning 260 seats on its own, some populous states might still go to the BJP due to its coalition, even if it lost some solo ground. However, the reduced solo seat count would reflect a tighter margin in key states.: Approximately 300 electoral votesThese estimates assume that BJP secured majority support in key populous states in each respective year. The hypothetical model suggests that the Electoral College system would still amplify BJP’s wins in populous states, translating to a higher electoral vote count compared to their Lok Sabha seats, particularly in 2014 and 2019.If all opposition votes were consolidated against BJP in a US-style Electoral College model, the election results would be notably different, especially in 2014, 2019, and 2024. In 2014, BJP would secure approximately 270 electoral votes, while the consolidated opposition would win around 273, narrowly flipping the majority to the opposition. In 2019, BJP would still win a majority with approximately 285 electoral votes to the opposition’s 258, though by a slimmer margin than in the actual FPTP system. By 2024, however, a unified opposition would clearly prevail, with around 293 electoral votes to BJP’s 250. This scenario illustrates how a consolidated opposition could effectively challenge BJP’s dominance, especially in more closely contested election years.While the Electoral College model might provide new insights, it poses several challenges if applied to India:Like the US, an Electoral College could overrepresent populous states, making regional powerhouses less influential. This might disadvantage smaller states and potentially overlook regional diversity in representation.This approach could lead to substantial disenfranchisement of votes in states where parties lose narrowly. It would discount the voices of voters who supported other parties but lost by a small margin, potentially reducing faith in the electoral process.Candidates may focus their resources on high-electoral states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra , neglecting the needs and voices of smaller or less populated regions. This focus could lead to uneven development and political emphasis across states.With a multiparty system and strong regional alliances, India could face a higher likelihood of electoral deadlocks. In the US, the two-party system streamlines the Electoral College outcome, whereas India’s coalition-based structure would make the process far more complicated and potentially lead to drawn-out election results.Though intriguing as a theoretical exercise, an Electoral College in India would likely lead to challenges in maintaining equitable representation across the country. It might benefit large coalitions but would risk undermining regional voices. By examining the 2014, 2019, and 2024 elections through this lens, it’s clear that the current FPTP system, despite its imperfections, aligns more closely with India’s federal structure and pluralistic society.","India’s electoral process for the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament) follows the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system.

It is this court which has kept me going because there is not a single day when you feel that you have not learned something, that you have not had an opportunity to serve the society,"" a teary-eyed CJI said.""And there is no greater feeling than being able to serve those in need and the people you would never meet, people you possibly do not even know, people whose lives you have the ability to affect without ever having seen them,"" he added.Following in the footsteps of his distinguished father YV Chandrachud, who served as CJI from 1978 to 1985, he assumed office on November 9, 2022.CJI-designate Khanna, along with prominent legal figures including the attorney general, solicitor general, and SCBA president Kapil Sibal, offered heartfelt tributes to mark this significant moment in India's judicial history.In his farewell speech, CJI Chandrachud shared his progression from being a law student seated in the back row to presiding over the Supreme Court . He emphasised the honour of serving the nation, noting how each day provided opportunities for professional and personal development.""I was always aware of the overpowering presence of the greats of this court and the responsibility that came with sitting in this chair. But at the end of the day, it is not about the individual, it is about the institution and the cause of justice we uphold here,"" the CJI stated.He praised his colleagues, particularly noting his collaboration with Justices Pardiwala and Misra, acknowledging how their varied perspectives enhanced their collective work.The CJI expressed confidence in Justice Khanna's future leadership, describing his successor as ""dignified, stable and deeply committed to justice"".In his closing remarks, CJI Chandrachud thanked everyone who contributed to his journey, from senior advocates to staff members. He also sought forgiveness for any inadvertent mistakes, saying, ""If I have ever hurt anyone, I seek your forgiveness.""Justice Khanna commended the CJI, noting, ""He has made my task easy and tough. Easy because of the revolutions ushered in and tough because I cannot walk up to him. He will be sorely missed. His youthfulness is not known here only but also abroad. In Australia, there were so many who came to me and asked what his age was.""Sibal characterised the CJI as ""the extraordinary son of an extraordinary father"".""I have practised in this court for 52 years now and in my life, I have never seen a judge with the kind of limitless patience that you have, the ever-smiling Dr Chandrachud,"" the SCBA president remarked.""What can I say about you as a human being and you as a judge? As a judge, your conduct was exemplary. No one can match it. You reached out to communities in this country who were never heard before, who were not seen before. You brought them before you and showed what dignity meant for them,"" he added.""Be it liberty, be it fraternity, be it life, be it the life of ordinary, marginalised challenged people, you have, unlike your father, dealt with this court when the court was tumultuous. You have dealt with the court when matters were tumultuous. You took them head on, unafraid of the consequences. Your greatest legacy to this court that there will be none like you...,"" he stated.Former attorney general KK Venugopal shared, ""When your father asked me should I advise him (Justice Chandrachud) to continue at the bar or take judgeship, I said he is a great lawyer and let him continue in the same. But you took up judgeship and thank god. If you had listened to me, then we would have lost such a great judge.""Born on November 11, 1959, Justice Chandrachud has achieved notable success in the judiciary.His cricket enthusiasm began in his youth, when he played in his father's Lutyens' Delhi residence backyard.The Bombay high court designated him as a senior advocate in June 1998. He served as additional solicitor general before his appointment as a Bombay High Court judge on March 29, 2000. He later became the Allahabad High Court's chief justice on October 31, 2013.Justice Chandrachud earned a BA in Economics from Delhi's St Stephen's College, an LLB from Delhi University's Campus Law Centre, and an LLM and Doctorate in Juridical Sciences (SJD) from Harvard Law School.Throughout his two-year tenure, CJI Chandrachud delivered numerous landmark judgments. A notable ruling came from the Constitution Bench he headed, which validated the abrogation of some clauses of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.In another crucial verdict, he maintained the existing Special Marriage Act framework, choosing not to extend it to same-sex marriages, leaving this matter for parliamentary consideration. Nevertheless, he strongly affirmed the LGBTQ+ community's fundamental rights to dignity and protection from discrimination.His tenure culminated in a significant ruling that abolished the electoral bonds scheme, establishing stricter requirements for transparency in political funding and directing the State Bank of India to stop issuing electoral bonds.","CJI Chandrachud will retire on November 10 but today was his last official working day.

NEW DELHI: In an eyebrow-raising proposal aimed at safeguarding women, the Uttar Pradesh state women’s commission has suggested a ban on male tailors measuring women and male barbers styling women’s hair. The recommendation, which advocates for a female-only rule in tailoring and salons, is aimed at curbing instances of ""bad touch"" and discouraging ""ill intentions"" from male professionals, according to the commission.The proposal was made during a meeting on October 28, where women’s commission chairperson Babita Chauhan led the discussion, gaining support from the attending members. Himani Agarwal, a commission member, disclosed the details of the suggestion on Friday, as reported by PTI.""At the meeting, we proposed that only female tailors should take women’s measurements and that CCTV cameras should be installed in these areas to ensure women’s safety,"" Agarwal said. ""In salons, only female barbers should attend to female clients."" She explained that such restrictions could help prevent inappropriate behavior, adding, ""Some men in these professions do not have good intentions, which can lead to molestation.""Agarwal clarified that the intent isn’t to paint all men as predatory but to address specific instances where women have felt uncomfortable. ""Not all men have bad intentions,"" she said, acknowledging the potential sensitivities surrounding the proposal.Currently, the commission is in the early stages of pushing this idea and plans to appeal to the state government to consider formal legislation. While the proposal has sparked discussions on the necessity and practicality of such restrictions, the commission believes this measure could create a safer environment for women in Uttar Pradesh.","UP women's body proposes men shouldn't tailor women's clothes or cut their hair.

Deciding to take advantage of the Diwali holidays when the factory was closed for five days, they allegedly crafted an elaborate plan which involved switching off the power supply and CCTV cameras to avoid getting caught in the act. However, they didn't expect a battery-run camera to expose what they thought was a perfect plan. After investigation by security agency heads, a complaint was filed against the 11 with Sanand police.The complaint was filed by Vijay Kushwaha, 48, a resident of Hansol, and an employee of the security agency which provided the guards to Varuna Electrics in Sanand GIDC, which manufactures submersible pumps.On Nov 5, the company's chief security officer Vishwanath Singh called up Kushwaha telling him that 21 submersible pumps had been stolen from the unit.According to the complaint, the security agency's regional head Praharash Vachhrajani and investigation head, Zakir Khan, began an inquiry into the theft. Their investigation found that the unit had 71 pumps on its premises before it closed on Oct 30, a day before Diwali.When the factory reopened on Nov 5, 21 were missing. When the agency heads tried accessing CCTV footage, they found that on Nov 1, all cameras had been switched off around 3.40am and were switched back on around 5.30am, the police complaint states.There was no headway until it was found that a battery-operated CCTV camera had captured one of the security guards, named Mahendra Dabhi, stealing a box containing a submersible pump. Vachhrajani and Khan's questioning of Dabhi and other guards revealed that all 11 had banded together to plan the theft and positioned themselves at their respective spots in the factory after executing their plan.Sanand GIDC police have launched an investigation.","Eleven security guards hired by industrial unit in Sanand GIDC to protect the premises, themselves turned thieves.

NEW DELHI: Central and state law agencies engaged in the fight against terror on Friday agreed on the need to shift towards firmer and more collaborative efforts, backed by a standardised strategy, to counter terrorism in all its forms, particularly cybercrime and financial terrorism .At the end of a two-day anti-terror conference organised by NIA in New Delhi , there was broad consensus that Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, though a powerful legal tool to tackle terror, should be invoked carefully and judiciously to avoid potential misuse and to retain its effectiveness in combating terrorism.The participants, comprising 39 heads of central and state police entities and 150 delegates from across the country, concurred on the need for a holistic and well-rounded strategy to deal with terrorism, encompassing the country's entire counter-terror framework extending from govt down to the police station level.In his concluding remarks, home secretary Govind Mohan urged state police forces to engage in capacity-building to effectively combat terrorism. He urged states to send competent officers to NIA, and added that this would not only help steer the agency's growth but also enrich the investigation culture back home when these officers return to their state cadre.NIA will be conducting several more capacity building sessions for states, he announced, adding that more NFSU campuses and CFSLs were also in the pipeline to promote the quality of digital evidence and secure conviction in terror cases.While underlining the role of Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) in dealing with financial-and cyber-related crimes in a coordinated manner, Mohan echoed home minister Amit Shah's views on the need for all police and investigative agencies and forces to share information in real time.Participants engaged in thematic sessions on topics like 'prosecution and evolving legal framework in counter-terror (CT) investigations', 'significant case studies in terror investigations', 'emerging technologies', 'dismantling terror ecosystem' and 'comprehensive CT strategies'.The police heads called for global cooperation to tackle the misuse of social media by terrorists amid divergent content moderation policies. The session on case studies in terror investigations discussed the Rameshwaram Cafe blast probe, in which central agencies and various state police forces had worked together to crack the case.

HC: Formulate policy to absorb anganwadi staff in government service,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-formulate-policy-to-absorb-anganwadi-staff-in-government-service/articleshow/115098775.cms,"AHMEDABAD: In an important judgment that could benefit 1.06 lakh women in Gujarat and over 24 lakh women across the country, the Gujarat high court has ruled that anganwadi workers (AWWs) and anganwadi helpers (AWHs) are entitled to be absorbed as ""permanent employees holding civil posts"" in the central or the state govts.Justice Nikhil Kariel directed the Centre and the state govt to jointly formulate a policy for the absorption of AWWs and AWHs in govt services and to confer the consequential benefit of regularisation of their jobs under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), a centrally sponsored scheme. Their absorption in the govt service in Gujarat was ordered under the Gujarat Civil Services (Classification and Recruitment) (General) Rules, 1967.The HC further ordered the consideration of the salary of AWWs and AWHs in the minimum pay scale as available to Class 3 and Class 4 posts, respectively. The govt was also ordered to pay arrears, and in the case of the petitioners, the cut-off date will be three years preceding the date of filing the petitions, which was in 2015. This is because the women working in these positions are paid an honorarium, Rs 10,000 to AWWs and Rs 5,500 to AWHs, which is much less than a Class 4 employee working in such a category for four hours a day.The HC in its order directed the Centre and the state govt to complete the exercise of forming the policy within six months from the date of uploading the judgment on the HC's portal, which happened last week. In its order, the HC further directed that until the govts take an appropriate decision in this regard, the petitioners are entitled to a salary in the minimum pay scale in Class 3 and Class 4 posts.The HC's directions are in response to hundreds of petitions filed in 2015 by AWWs and AWHs working for over 10 years and seeking regularisation in service and minimum wages . The women working in these posts claimed discrimination and exploitation and urged the court to hold that the system of employing them under the ICDS scheme on an honorarium is in violation of the constitutional provisions.The HC noted in its order that ""discrimination of AWWs and AWHs vis-a-vis govt employees, is writ large on the face of the functions, duties and responsibilities of the AWWs and AWHs as compared to the emoluments paid to the AWWs and AWHs."" The HC further stated in its order that these women are paid very little considering the fact that an AWW is required to work as a paramedic, a counsellor, a coordinator, a public relations manager, an event manager, a clerk, a pre-school teacher, and more. They are also required to attend the anganwadi between 9am and 3.45pm. The court stated in its order that ""while the govt takes pride in running a programme like ICDS, it pays very little to workers, whereas there exists a master and servant relationship between the state of Gujarat and the AWWs and AWHs"".","Gujarat high court ruled that anganwadi workers (AWWs) are entitled to be absorbed as ""permanent employees holding civil posts"" in central or state govts.

SC mulls making its nod must for all tree felling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-mulls-making-its-nod-must-for-all-tree-felling/articleshow/115098433.cms,"'Tree Authority met 8 times since inception'

NEW DELHI: Taking note of official figures that five trees are felled every hour in Delhi, Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear a plea seeking a complete ban on cutting of any tree in the city without the court's permission, which at present is applicable to only forest trees.Underscoring that something needs to be done to check felling of trees, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih issued notices to Delhi govt and tree officers, asking them to respond by Nov 22. It said the court has to decide under what conditions and manner felling of trees should be allowed.Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan and lawyer Manan Verma, appearing for the petitioner, highlighted the grim picture of continuous felling of trees in recent years and said as authorities set up under Delhi Preservation of Trees Act (DPTA) have failed to check it, Delhi's green cover is depleting.""There are procedural safeguards provided within the DPTA which are clearly visible in the flow of the Act wherein protection and preservation of trees precede the regulatory mechanism for felling of trees. These procedural safeguards have been grossly violated,"" the petition said.""It is clearly enshrined in Section 7 of the said Act that it shall be the responsibility of the Tree Authority to 'preserve all trees within its jurisdiction',"" the petition said.Referring to data compiled by the Delhi forest department, Sankaranarayanan told the bench that as per the latest figures, on an average, five trees are cut every hour. The total number of trees allowed to be felled under official sanction for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 under all categories was 1,33,117, which puts the annual felling of trees at 44,372.33 and over 5 trees per hour (2019-2021).The petition filed by Delhi-based environment activist Bhavreen Kandhari alleged that a comprehensive study of all the meetings of the Tree Authority revealed that the authority had met only eight times since its inception in 1995 till March 2021. ""The Tree Authority had an obligation to meet once every three months. Accordingly, it should have met at least a bare minimum of 104 times till July 2021, as per its statutory mandate,"" the petition said.Accusing the authority of not complying with SC's directions, the petition said, ""The law laid down by this court has great significance for Delhi, as the National Forest Policy mandates that one-third of the total land area of the country should be under forest or tree cover.""""However, it is pertinent to note that till date, Delhi has not met the standards prescribed under the said policy. As per the India State of Forest Report 2021 , the forest cover in Delhi is 13.1% and tree cover is 9.9%. Therefore, the total green cover is approximately 23% as opposed to 33% mandated by the said policy,"" it said.","Supreme Court agrees to hear a plea seeking a complete ban on cutting of any tree in the city without court's permission.

The petitioners explained that the salaries of nuns and priests get transferred to the congregation or diocese running the school, and the congregation submits returns wherever necessary.

NEW DELHI: CJI Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud 's quarter-century-long judicial career, marked by pathbreaking judgments and judicial reforms, ended on Friday with effusive praises sprinkled with superlatives from eminent to little-known lawyers during his farewell ceremony in the largest courtroom of Supreme Court that unprecedentedly continued for over an hour.This remarkable judicial journey of DYC, as he is popularly referred to, would not have begun if then Bombay high court Chief Justice Y K Sabharwal had not dissuaded him from withdrawing his consent for appointment as a judge of the HC.Irked by the delay in his name being recommended for judgeship by the SC collegium, senior advocate DYC had walked into the chamber of CJ Sabharwal and conveyed that he wanted to withdraw his name.Justice Sabharwal, who went on to become CJI, asked him to wait for a week. DYC was appointed as a judge of the Bombay high court on March 29, 2000. A quarter century later, he did not look a day older than how he looked when he took oath as an HC judge.This youthful appearance and the grinding work schedule he maintained till the last day was the envy of many senior advocates, who repeatedly asked him to share the secret of the 'elixir' he drinks daily to maintain his boyish smile, which they said made them look very old. Disciplined life and regular yoga at the dawn is the secret, divulged SCAORA president Vipin Nair.In the presence of his wife and adopted daughters and a crowd of lawyers in the courtroom, CJI Chandrachud said it was a journey of learning for him all through the 25 years, especially in Supreme Court. ""We are pilgrims or birds of passage. Judges come and go. My departure would not make any difference. I am leaving the court in the able hands of Justice Khanna,"" the CJI added.CJI-designate Sanjiv Khanna said it would be difficult for him to measure up to Justice Chandrachud and acknowledged the stupendous work done by the CJI in terms of disposing 9-J bench and larger bench matters pending for years and simultaneously undertake judicial reforms while infusing information technology to ease access to courts.Attorney general R Venkataramani penned a poem to highlight the qualities of Justice Chandrachud and the legacy he is leaving behind. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said though many of his judgments went against the govt, as a lawyer he never felt that he was not heard properly, or his point of view did not get due weightage in adjudication.Supreme Court Bar Association president Kapil Sibal said in his 52 years of practice in SC, he had never come across a judge better than CJI Chandrachud and declared that there will never be one like him, which meant he had surpassed the stature of his father Y V Chandrachud, who was CJI for seven and a half years from 1978 till 1985.

"Three judges dissent, uphold 1967 ruling denying minority tag to AMU",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/three-judges-dissent-uphold-1967-ruling-denying-minority-tag-to-amu/articleshow/115096632.cms,"NEW DELHI: Three judges on the seven-judge bench penned powerful dissents to the CJI D Y Chandrachud-authored majority opinion on behalf of four judges and were unanimous that the 1967 Azeez Basha judgment had correctly decided that Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) was not a minority educational institution.Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Satish C Sharma faulted the decision of a two-judge bench in 1981 to directly refer the dispute over the minority character of AMU to a seven-judge bench and called this judicial indiscipline.They said the 1967 judgment correctly stated that to earn minority tag, an educational institution must be both established and managed by the minority community, which was found to be lacking in AMU, which was incorporated as a university in 1920 by a law passed by the imperial parliament and subsequently amended in 1951 and 1965.On the reference to a seven-judge bench, which the majority opinion termed valid, Justice Datta asked, ""If tomorrow a two-judge bench doubts the 'basic structure doctrine' propounded by a 13-judge bench in Kesavananda Bharati case, can it directly refer the issue to a 15-judge bench?""Justice Kant, in his 102-page opinion, analysed the two crucial parameters - establish and administer - relating to an educational institution getting 'minority tag' under Article 30(1). He said to prove that an educational institution was 'established' by the minority community, its mere establishment by the minority community would not be enough as it must be further proved that it was for the benefit of that community.On the administration issue, Justice Kant said, ""The core part of administration, both de jure and de facto, of the institution must remain in control of the minority community... it must be largely free from external control and must have broad autonomy to mould the institution's functioning and administration as per the idea of what would be best for the community.""Sounding a caution against a two-judge bench referring the issue directly to a seven-judge bench, Justice Kant said this ""would dilute the authority and position of the Chief Justice of India"".Justice Datta was categorical in saying that ""AMU was neither established by any religious community, nor is it administered by a religious community which is regarded as a minority community. Hence, AMU does not qualify as a minority institution"".He said that protection of Article 30(1) of the Constitution was not available to AMU and rejected the university's claim for minority tag, saying its arguments had no historic, legal, factual or logical basis.Justice Datta said from the evidence and the documents put before the court, ""it is clear that the Muslim community had no intention to administer AMU which was left to be worked out as per the AMU Act"".""AMU is a creature of a statute and is engaged in discharging public duties. By passage of time, AMU happens to be one of the foremost central universities in the country. It is, however, entirely dependent on finances allocated by the central govt. It is mandatorily required to function as per the AMU Act as well as provisions of other enactments. There can, thus, be no doubt that AMU is an Article 12 authority (a govt established entity),"" he said.As it is a government entity, admissions to AMU must be based on merit and provide for reservations to students belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBC and EWS categories, Justice Datta said.In his ""neutral"" opinion, Justice Sharma laid down parameters for determining minority character of an educational institution and said protection to minority educational institutions under Article 30(1) was meant only to prevent discrimination and preferential treatment to non-minority institutions.""To assume that the minorities of the country require some 'safe haven' for attaining education and knowledge is wholly incorrect. The minorities of the country have not just joined the mainstream but comprise an important facet of the mainstream itself,"" he said.","Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Satish C Sharma faulted the decision of a two-judge bench in 1981 to directly refer the dispute over the minority character of AMU. They said the 1967 judgment correctly stated that to earn minority tag, an educational institution must be both established and managed by the minority community.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115096712,imgsize-1683913,width-400,resizemode-4/115096712.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India faced extreme weather events on 93% of the days in the first nine months — 255 out of 274 days — in 2024 that claimed 3,238 lives, destroyed over 2.35 lakh houses/buildings and affected crops in 3.2 million hectare (mha) of land, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said on Friday.The number of extreme weather events, including heat and cold waves, cyclones, lightning, heavy rain, floods and landslides, increased in 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023. The CSE’s data shows that the country recorded extreme weather on 235 of 273 days during the corresponding period last year, claiming 2,923 lives, affecting crops in 1.84 mha of land and damaging 80,293 houses.In its annual ‘state of extreme weather report’, the New Delhi-based think tank noted that Madhya Pradesh experienced extreme weather events on 176 days — the most in the country — whereas Kerala recorded the highest fatalities at 550, followed by Madhya Pradesh (353) and Assam (256) this year.The report shows that Andhra Pradesh had the most houses damaged (85,806), while Maharashtra, which saw extreme events on 142 days, accounted for over 60% of the affected crop area nation-wide, followed by Madhya Pradesh in 2024.“This trend is no longer hypothetical — it is visible in the escalating crisis we face today. This report is not good news, but it is a necessary warning, a call to recognise nature’s backlash and the urgent action required to mitigate it. Without combating climate change at a meaningful scale, today’s challenges will only worsen tomorrow,” said Sunita Narain, director general, CSE.Region-wise data shows that central India faced the highest frequency of extreme events with 218 days, followed closely by the northwest at 213 days. In terms of lives lost, the central region had the most deaths (1,001), followed by the southern Peninsula (762 deaths), east & northeast (741 deaths) and northwest (734 deaths).CSE’s analysts, however, pointed out that the reported damage could be an underestimation due to incomplete data collection on event-specific losses, particularly to public property and crop damage.Referring to other climate records in 2024, the CSE noted that January was India’s ninth driest since 1901 whereas the country recorded its second-highest minimum temperature in February in 123 years. May, on the other hand, saw the fourth-highest mean temperature on record while July, August and September all registered their highest minimum temperatures since 1901.","India faced extreme weather events on 93% of the days in the first nine months of 2024.

During his campaign, Donald Trump has made several high-profile promises, some of which have sparked debate over their feasibility and potential impact. Many of Trump’s campaign promises involve significant legal , legislative, and logistical obstacles, meaning that even with substantial executive power, achieving these objectives would require cooperation from Congress, states, and possibly even constitutional amendments.The feasibility of these proposals largely hinges on navigating political opposition, potential legal battles, and the practical realities of implementation, making some of these promises more symbolic than achievable. Here’s a rundown of some of the bold promises he’s made on the trail, alongside an analysis of their practicality:Trump has pledged to overhaul the federal bureaucracy, replacing thousands of federal workers with those he considers ""loyalists.""Although a president can influence federal hiring and policies, sweeping federal layoffs face strong resistance due to existing civil service protections, union agreements, and procedural hurdles. Such moves would likely face significant legal challenges from federal employee unions and watchdog groups questioning the legality of mass firings based on political affiliation.Trump has proposed a 10% tariff on all imports to boost domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign goods.Imposing such a broad tariff would require congressional support, which is far from guaranteed. Economists warn that a blanket tariff could raise costs for American consumers, strain trade relations, and potentially prompt retaliatory tariffs. Higher import costs could impact inflation, a point that might attract criticism from economic policymakers.Trump has vowed to launch the most extensive deportation effort ever, targeting millions of undocumented immigrants.While the federal government has the authority to enforce immigration laws, scaling up to this level would require massive resources, funding, and cooperation from local law enforcement. Such an operation would likely face legal pushback and public resistance, particularly in sanctuary cities. The logistical complexity and potential societal disruption make this a challenging promise to fulfil.Trump has proposed constructing ""freedom cities"" on federal land to address housing shortages and encourage innovation.Creating new cities would be a monumental task involving land use policy, infrastructure development, environmental reviews, and state cooperation. While it’s possible for the federal government to support housing initiatives, building entirely new cities from scratch would require substantial funding, legislative approval, and time—likely extending beyond a single presidential term.Trump has expressed support for imposing the death penalty on drug dealers to deter drug-related crimes.Implementing this would be a significant legal and constitutional hurdle, as it would require changes to federal law and might face challenges regarding Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment. Applying the death penalty broadly would likely encounter strong judicial opposition.Trump has suggested reconsidering US involvement in NATO and scaling back certain international commitments.While a president can influence foreign policy, withdrawing from NATO would face resistance from Congress and military leaders, as it is a treaty-bound alliance integral to US defence strategy. Exiting NATO would likely be unpopular with allies and could be seen as a threat to US influence on the global stage.Trump has proposed imposing term limits for members of Congress.Changing term limits would require a constitutional amendment, as term limits are not currently part of US law for federal offices. This amendment would need a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, as well as ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures—a high bar that makes this unlikely to be achieved swiftly, if at all.Trump has hinted at increasing US control over industries deemed strategic, such as energy.Nationalising industries is rare in the US and would meet strong legal, economic, and political opposition. It would require new legislation, significant federal resources, and could clash with private sector interests, raising questions of economic efficiency and constitutional authority.Trump has pledged to restart and expand the border wall construction with added technological enhancements.While Trump may have executive power to direct border security funds, constructing a larger, more advanced wall would require sustained funding from Congress. Legal disputes over land rights and environmental concerns would also challenge rapid expansion efforts.Trump has promised to restore and prioritise energy independence by maximising US energy production, especially fossil fuels.Increasing fossil fuel production could be pursued through executive orders and regulatory changes, but would face resistance from environmental advocates and potential legal constraints. Shifts to renewable energy and global environmental commitments add further complexity, limiting the extent to which fossil fuels can be prioritised without political and environmental repercussions.Trump has frequently claimed he could end the Russia-Ukraine conflict within 24 hours by negotiating directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.A US president cannot resolve a complex conflict in 24 hours, despite having significant diplomatic influence. ""While a US president has significant diplomatic influence, resolving such a complex conflict in 24 hours is highly improbable,"" according to experts. The conflict involves deep-rooted geopolitical issues, territorial disputes, and significant military and economic stakes. These factors impact both countries involved in the conflict and their allies.","During his campaign, Donald Trump has made several high-profile promises, some of which have sparked debate over their feasibility and potential impact. Many of Trump’s campaign promises involve significant legal, legislative, and logistical obstacles. Even with substantial executive power, achieving these objectives would require cooperation from Congress, states, and possibly even constitutional amendments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115020141,imgsize-25550,width-400,resizemode-4/115020141.jpg"

MUMBAI: A lakh plus Indian families are again biting their nails at the prospect of work (employment) authorization being revoked for the H-4 dependent spouse. Members of the Indian diaspora point out that obtaining an employment authorization document (EAD) means much more than financial freedom. It enables spouses to obtain a social security number, open a bank account and get a driving license. In short – be integrated into the American community.President Trump during his previous tenure had issued the Executive Order – Buy American, Hire American – a slew of measures had then followed including a proposed rule to revoke employment authorization for H-4 dependent spouses.Just in the nick of time before the rule was finalized, the Biden administration stepped in and the proposed rule was formally withdrawn in January 2021. “Trump’s return to power would likely bring a renewed attack, disproportionately affecting Indian families where highly educated H-4 spouses play critical roles in tech, healthcare, and other sectors. Eliminating H-4 work permits would be a severe economic and personal blow, particularly for families facing a decades-long green card wait,” points out Ashwin Sharma, immigration attorney.The EAD rule was introduced by the Obama administration in 2015 to mitigate the problems faced by certain sections of immigrants (such as the Indian diaspora) who faced backlogs running into several decades to obtain an employment based green card. As per an analysis by Cato Foundation, the employment based green card backlog from India (EB-2 and EB-3 skilled category) has crossed one million in March 2023. If factors such as death and ageing out are considered (which will lead to these individuals dropping from the backlog statistics) the wait for a green card is 54 years, else it is a whopping 134 years.Under a specific rule, spouses of H-1B visa holders who are eligible for green cards can apply for work authorization in the United States. This rule applies if the H-1B visa holder is on track to receive a green card or has been granted a visa extension beyond the standard six-year limit. The spouse, who holds an H-4 visa, can then submit an application for employment authorization.The EAD rule has faced several legal challenges. In 2015, an advocacy group of tech workers (Save Jobs USA), who lost their jobs to H-1B visa holders, litigated on the grounds that the Department of Homeland Security was not eligible to introduce the rule. Further, it contended that the right given to spouses to work, took away American jobs and made the H-1B program more attractive. A district court upheld this rule and in 2023, the US department refused to intervene in this decision – and the EAD rule seemed here to stay.With hiring of US workers to be a priority for the Trump administration, the question is not – will the EAD rule be revoked, rather the question being asked in hushed tones among the Indian diaspora is – when?",A lakh plus Indian families are biting their nails at the prospect of work (employment) authorization being revoked for the H-4 dependent spouse.

Why does the US vote in November but the new president starts in January?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-does-the-us-vote-in-november-but-the-new-president-starts-in-january/articleshow/115019371.cms,"US election in November, president inauguration in January: Understanding the timeline

Election timing: In 1845, Congress established the timing for federal elections, setting the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November as Election Day. This date was chosen to accommodate an agrarian society: early November allowed farmers to complete the harvest and travel to polling places without interrupting agricultural duties. Additionally, Tuesday was preferred to avoid conflicts with religious observances on Sunday and local market days on Wednesday.

Inauguration timing: Originally, the U.S. Constitution set the presidential inauguration for March 4, providing a four-month transition period after the November election. This lengthy gap allowed enough time for vote counting, electoral processes, and the physical travel needed in an era when communication and transportation were slow. In 1933, the 20th Amendment shortened this gap by moving Inauguration Day to January 20, reducing the “lame-duck” period in which an outgoing president remains in office without significant power. This change was intended to streamline the transition and address inefficiencies associated with a prolonged wait between election and inauguration.

Reasons for the November-to-January gap

Transition planning

Electoral college process

Appointment of electors : State governors appoint electors, typically by early December, based on the state’s popular vote.

: State governors appoint electors, typically by early December, based on the state’s popular vote. Electors’ vote : On a set date in mid-December, the Electoral College meets in each state to officially cast votes for president and vice president.

: On a set date in mid-December, the Electoral College meets in each state to officially cast votes for president and vice president. Certification of votes: In early January, Congress convenes to count and certify the electoral votes, officially confirming the election results before the inauguration. This process provides a formal mechanism to verify the vote, giving an additional layer of credibility to the outcome.

Legal and procedural safeguards

U.S. president inauguration day: Key traditions and events

Swearing-in ceremony: The president-elect and vice president-elect take their oaths of office, a tradition that has remained largely unchanged since George Washington’s inauguration. The ceremony is typically held on the West Front steps of the U.S. Capitol at noon, symbolising the start of the new administration’s term.

Inaugural address: Following the swearing-in, the president delivers an inaugural address, outlining the vision, priorities, and aspirations for the upcoming term. Each inaugural address is unique, reflecting the themes and goals of the new administration while honouring the traditions of the office.

Departure of the outgoing president: After the swearing-in, the outgoing president and first lady leave the Capitol, often through a formal send-off, signifying the peaceful transfer of power. This departure reinforces the country’s commitment to a democratic process and respect for the electoral outcome.

Inaugural luncheon: The new president attends a luncheon hosted by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (JCCIC), where members of Congress and other dignitaries gather to honour the new administration.

Pass in review: The president reviews military troops, honouring the role of the armed forces and symbolising the president’s new role as commander-in-chief. A ceremonial procession down Pennsylvania Avenue follows, leading to the White House.

Presidential escort and inaugural parade: After the Pass in Review, the president is escorted to the White House in a procession that includes representatives from various branches of the military, celebrating the diversity and unity of the nation.

Inaugural balls and celebrations: In the evening, inaugural balls and other festivities are held to honour the new administration, allowing public participation in the celebrations. These events may be adjusted depending on circumstances, such as security concerns or public health issues.

In the United States, the presidential election and inauguration are separated by several months, a timeline that reflects both historical tradition and logistical needs. While the election occurs on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, the newly elected president is inaugurated only on January 20 of the following year. This transitional period serves multiple functions, from providing the incoming administration with time to prepare for governance to allowing the Electoral College to complete its process. The November-to-January gap is rooted in the structure of the U.S. electoral system, combining constitutional requirements, historical precedents, and practical considerations to ensure a smooth transfer of power. Here’s a detailed look at why this timeline exists and what events fill the gap between Election Day and Inauguration Day.The U.S. electoral timeline sets the country apart from other democracies, where elections and the transfer of power often occur within a shorter timeframe. The U.S. approach stems from a combination of historical scheduling and constitutional amendments that have shaped the election-inauguration gap over centuries.The period between Election Day and Inauguration Day serves several purposes essential to a stable and orderly transition of power.: The transition period is crucial for the president-elect, who must assemble a team, nominate cabinet members, and begin formulating key policies. This period allows the incoming administration to prepare for governance, helping to ensure that they are ready to address national and international responsibilities immediately after taking office. It includes detailed briefings, security updates, and policy reviews.An orderly transition is particularly important in times of crisis, allowing the new administration to continue policies or make necessary adjustments without disruptions. The transition also allows time for outgoing staff to assist the incoming team, ensuring continuity in government operations.: Unlike many countries, the U.S. does not select its president based solely on the popular vote. The Electoral College, an intermediary body, formally elects the president and vice president. The Electoral College process includes key dates and steps:: The period between the election and the inauguration also provides time for legal and procedural safeguards, including recounts and the resolution of potential disputes. In close or contested elections, this timeline allows for legal challenges to be addressed in court, ensuring that the final result is legitimate and free from unresolved disputes before the inauguration.This period offers a buffer against any attempts to disrupt or contest the election outcome, reinforcing the stability of the democratic process and giving citizens confidence that the result reflects their choice.Inauguration Day is a ceremonial event that formally marks the transfer of power to the new administration. Traditionally observed on January 20, it includes several symbolic events that reinforce the nation’s commitment to a peaceful and orderly transition.","In 1845, Congress established the timing for federal elections, setting the first Tuesday after November as Election Day.

Trump Towers In India: Trump luxury real estate arm to have maximum properties in India outside of the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trump-luxury-real-estate-arm-to-have-maximum-properties-in-india-outside-of-the-us/articleshow/115025972.cms,"File photo: Donald Trump sr (left) & jr with Kalpesh Mehta (centre)

NEW DELHI: India will have the maximum number of Trump Towers outside of US-president elect’s “The Trump Organisation” home country. From four all-residential high-rise luxury residential Trump Towers in Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon and Kolkata, the number will swell to 10 in the next six years with as many more projects — including office, golf course and villas — to be built in Noida, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Gurgaon and Pune.Trump’s luxury real estate partner in India, Tribeca Developers founder Kalpesh Mehta, now sees even more growth after the news of his victory in the US polls came in on Wednesday.“I did my MBA from Wharton, where the Trump family, including President Trump, went to. A professor there connected me to Donald Trump jr. We met at a bar in New York 13-14 years ago and on the back of a cocktail pier napkin discussed and made our initial plans which eventually became a reality. President Trump’s advice when we subsequently tied up and since then has been just this: ‘We don’t want to do too many projects, but whatever we do should be the best in class’,” Mehta (46), who comes from a family of architects, told TOI Wednesday.In 2014 when the two companies were launching Trump Tower Mumbai, Donald Trump had come to India. “This was shortly after PM Modi had won the 2014 general election. He generally discussed India during his first time trip to the country and the topic here was mainly Modi at that time. Since then he has been very fond of our PM. The President has always believed firmly in the potential of India but he became more bullish after Modi became the PM. India will have the maximum Trump properties outside of the US,” Mehta said.The Trump real estate business is run along the lines of management contract hotels where the Indian partner invests in the hardware (brick and mortar) and the foreign partner, Trump Organisation in this case, brings its branding and software in terms of service level and global reach. The Trump real estate business is doing very well here.“The four Trump Towers (one each in Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon and Kolkata) have a combined area of 30 lakh square feet with about 800 residences in the range of Rs 6-25 crore each and a total sale value of Rs 7,500 crore. The six more coming up in as many years will have a combined floor area of 80 lakh square feet and total sale value of Rs 15,000 crore,” Mehta said. Pune, which already has a Trump Tower, is getting another Trump complex with an office block.Trump golf course and villas will come up in another city.“A Trump presidency is fundamentally good for the world and for further strengthening the India – US relationship. PM Modi and President Trump greatly admire and respect each other and this relationship has the potential to be greatly beneficial to the world at large…. Trump is the only super luxury real estate brand in the world,” he added.","From four all-residential high-rise luxury residential Trump Towers in Mumbai, Pune, Gurgaon and Kolkata, the number will swell to 10 in the next six years.

"The writing on the wall is clear: Tighter H-1B norms on anvil, perhaps with wage-hikes and stiffer vetting of applications",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections-the-writing-on-the-wall-is-clear-tighter-h-1b-norms-on-anvil-perhaps-with-wage-hikes-and-stiffer-vetting-of-applications/articleshow/115025897.cms,"Image credit: lexica.art

Challenges Ahead for H-1B Visa Extensions :

Hike in wages and restrictions in eligibility norms:

MUMBAI: American companies, including tech giants have been meeting with their attorneys over the past several days, debating what lies ahead. With President Trump’s victory, the immediate impact is expected to include greater scrutiny for new H-1B visa applications (the window for which will open in March) and also visa extensions.Scrutiny is expected to cover whether the job qualifies as a specialty occupation and ensuring an employer-employee relationship exists. A rise in Requests for Evidence (RFEs) and also denials is expected, which will have to be taken in stride. Policy changes relating to the H-1B program, that were previously stalled due to court rulings may be reintroduced.Indians are major beneficiaries of the H-1B program, receiving over 70% of all H-1B visas granted each year, both for initial applications and extensions. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023, Indians received 2.8 lakh H-1B visas, accounting for 72.3% of total allotments. Thus, procedural and policy changes will impact not only American employers but also the Indian diaspora.Immigration attorney Kripa Upadhyay told TOI, “During the last Trump administration, there was significant disruption due to the introduction of ‘extreme vetting’ for visa interviews. Certain job categories, such as ‘Computer Occupations, All Other,’ may no longer be an option, as they may require applicants to demonstrate specific technical skills and knowledge.”Those seeking H-1B visa extensions could be particularly affected. H-1B visas are typically issued for a maximum of three years, with the possibility of another three years. If the beneficiary (the individual sponsored by an American employer) is on track for a green card, further periodical extensions are permitted. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023, around 210,000 Indians received H-1B visa extensions, compared to 68,825 visas for new employment cases.Snehal Batra, managing attorney at NPZ Law Group, explained, “We expect Trump will rescind the ‘deference policy’ again. During his first term, Trump directed USCIS not to defer to any previous approvals for extension cases and each extension application was treated as a new one leading to challenges. President Biden reinstated the deference policy, but it hasn’t been codified in regulations. If Trump rescinds this policy it will again lead to chaos and unpredictable outcomes.”Immigration attorney Cyrus D. Mehta added, “Similarly, the Trump administration could make it more difficult for employers to renew H-1B visas by requiring artificially high wages and making it harder to prove that the job qualifies as a specialty occupation for H-1B classification.”Policies pushing for steep wage increases for H-1B workers and linking visa allotments to the highest salaries within their occupations and locations may return. In early December 2020, a US district court struck down a rule issued by the Department of Labor (DOL), which had increased H-1B and employment-based green card wages by 40% to 100%. The court invalidated this rule, citing its rushed implementation without public notice and comment, violating the Administrative Procedure Act.""If a wage hike is announced for H-1B workers and allotment is linked to the highest wages, it would badly impact international students. F-1 students typically transition to an H-1B and earn the lowest range of salary in the initial years of their career,"" points out Adam Cohen, partner at immigration law firm Siskind Susser. The contingent of Indian students in the US is quite significant. According to the Open Doors Report, during academic year 2022-23 there were nearly 2.70 lakh Indian students in the US.The same court judgement also struck down a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rule that had imposed stricter definitions for the employer-employee relationship and specialty occupations, targeting tech companies, including Indian firms like Infosys and Wipro, which typically place H-1B workers at client sites. It also limited the H-1B visa duration to one year for workers in third-party placements.Steven A. Brown, partner at immigration law firm Reddy, Neumann, Brown, told TOI, “Many of Trump’s previous court losses were due to procedural issues, not substance. The incoming team may now proceed in a ‘smarter’ way to prevent courts from overturning their policy changes.”Ashwin Sharma, immigration attorney, noted, “In Trump’s first term, stricter H-1B eligibility criteria and increased paperwork, particularly for third-party placements, led to denials and RFEs that complicated approvals. A second term would likely bring swift reinstatement of these policies, creating new obstacles for Indian professionals in specialized fields, especially IT consulting.”US visa challenges may result in housing foreign employees to neighbouring countries or even having a major share of the work done remotely in India, state immigration experts.Charles H. Kuck, another immigration attorney, summed up, “Prepare for major H-1B changes: a lottery based on wages, higher filing fees, and stricter enforcement against job shops. Expect higher denial rates, longer processing times, no immigration reform, no increase in green card allotments, no changes to the 7% per-country limit, and possibly reduced legal immigration.”","With President Trump’s victory, the immediate impact is expected to include greater scrutiny for new H-1B visa applications and also visa extensions. A rise in Requests for Evidence (RFEs) and also denials is expected, which will have to be taken in stride. Policy changes relating to the H- 1B program, that were previously stalled due to court rulings may be reintroduced.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115026242,imgsize-1105056,width-400,resizemode-4/115026242.jpg"

Let's take a closer look (Image via WWE)

The U.S. Elections resulted in a huge dip in WWE's viewership

Will WWE’s viewership go back to normal following the U.S. Elections?

The U.S. election atmosphere often impacts WWE viewership , since live events and debates end up drawing attention away from WWE’s programming. Moreover, SmackDown and Raw both air during weekdays, which further brings their numbers down while elections are in full swing.When WWE SmackDown debuted on the FOX network back in 2019, the show opened with a massive viewership of 3.869 million. Unfortunately, the blue brand’s debut on the USA network this year only managed to bring in about 1.723 million viewers. This drop in viewership can be blamed on the heightened political engagement and on the fact that the NFL season kickoff happened around the same time. Let's take a look at a few more numbers.Also Read: 16-time WWE World Champion Shocked with Donald Trump's Victory in US Presidential Elections Before Donald Trump and Kamala Harris were holding multiple rallies a week, WWE's numbers looked pretty solid. For example, SmackDown averaged 2.199 viewers throughout the months of June, July and August in 2024 as per Fightful. But, as soon as election day started to get closer, the numbers began to drop.In September 2024, SmackDown only averaged about 1.64 million viewers, this means that their viewership was down 30% when compared to their numbers from September 2023. Just like SmackDown lost a few viewers as the elections drew closer, so did Raw and NXT. That’s not all, as WWE’s PLEs also took a bit of a dip. But, now that Kamala Harris has conceded, the elections are all but over. Let's take a look at what this means for WWE's viewership.Now that the elections are over, more and more viewers will divert their attention from political coverage and go back to their regular TV programming. This leads us to believe that WWE’s numbers should go back to normal soon, since there won't be any debates or rallies distracting the regular public. However, this will also require a fair amount of build up.For now, WWE must put all their efforts into building hype for their best storylines and upcoming PLEs. Doing so will help them recapture the viewers they lost because of the elections. It’ll be interesting to see what WWE’s viewership will look like for this month now that the voting phase of the elections is over.Also Read: WWE Hall of Famer slams Donald Trump's Presidential Election victory : ""SAD""","The U.S. Elections resulted in a huge dip in WWE's viewership.

“Here is a critical question to its leadership: don't you have the vision and imagination to invest $400 million in another line of business where you can deploy those people you hired but you don't want anymore? Are there no such opportunities in tech? Are you so lacking in curiosity, vision and imagination? Are you so lacking in empathy?”.

What Freshworks CEO said



“In November 2024, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (the Plan) to better align the Company's talent with its strategic priorities and to improve operating efficiency. The Company estimates that this will result in approximately 13% reduction in headcount and approximately $11 million to $13 million in charges in the fourth quarter of 2024, consisting primarily of cash expenditures for separation-related payments, employee benefits and related costs. The Company expects that the Plan will be substantially complete by the end of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.”

“There’s simply no good time to make a decision like this that affects people’s lives and it’s my responsibility to be transparent about how and why this decision was made. I am immensely grateful to those who will be leaving for their significant contributions to Freshworks. While this is likely an unexpected way to end your time here, I hope you leave feeling proud of the impact you’ve had.”

Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu slammed IT company Freshworks for its recent job cuts. Taking to microblogging site X (formerly Twitter), Vembu called the move “naked greed”, questioning the “vision” of its leadership.Earlier this week, Freshworks announced to lay off 12%-13% of its workforce. The job cuts, which is a part of the company’s efforts to streamline operations, will impact 660 employees across the US, India and other locations.In the post, Zoho CEO criticised the company for laying off employees, despite maintaining high cash reserves. He said “A company that has $1 billion cash, which is about 1.5 times its annual revenue, and is actually still growing at a decent 20% rate and making a cash profit, laying off 12-13% of its workforce should not expect any loyalty from its employees ever.”He stated that what adds ‘insult to injury’ to the impacted employees is that the layoffs are announced at a time “when it can afford $400 million in a stock buy back.” For those unaware, Freshworks recently announced that its board of directors approved a $400 million share buyback programme of its outstanding Class A common stock.He saidHe stated that this behaviour, “has become all too common in the US corporate world” and is being imported in India. “It has only resulted in large scale employee cynicism in the US and we are importing that too,” he added.Announcing the job cuts, Fresh works CEO Dennis Woodside said:","Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu slammed IT company Freshworks for its recent job cuts.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
