Trump Thinks 50% Tariff on India Has Put Pressure on Russia, Ex-US Official Calls His Strategy Wrong

Nayara Energy in troubled waters

Russia-backed Nayara Energy, an Indian refinery, faced with European Union sanctions for its procurement of crude from Russia is looking at damage control. Nayara Energy is now sending a shipment to China, a first for India since 2021.According to a Bloomberg report, a shipment of Indian diesel is en route to China, marking the first such delivery since 2021. This development comes as Nayara Energy, which has Russian connections, faces uncertainty in its oil product exports due to new European Union sanctions.The vessel EM Zenith departed from Nayara's Vadinar terminal carrying approximately 496,000 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel on July 18, as reported by Kpler, a port agent document and vessel tracking information gathered by Bloomberg.Also Read | Fresh trouble for Russia-backed Nayara Energy! SBI stops trade & foreign currency transactions of Indian refinery; doesn’t want to risk US tariffs, EU curbs The ship left just before the EU announced sanctions on the Rosneft-supported refinery, as part of its intensified measures against Russian oil commerce. The ship, originally heading to Malaysia, changed course in the Strait of Malacca and remained anchored for approximately 12 days whilst several Nayara cargoes were affected by EU sanctions. The vessel has since changed its destination to Zhoushan, China, the Bloomberg report said.Recent sanctions have created payment difficulties for Nayara, prompting the company to request advance payments or letters of credit before loading fuel shipments. Additionally, the company had to reduce production at its Vadinar refinery due to disruptions in crude oil deliveries.According to Kpler data, this diesel cargo to China marks the first such shipment from India since April 2021, coinciding with improved diplomatic relations between the two Asian countries.Meanwhile, State Bank of India, India’s largest public sector bank, has discontinued processing international trade and forex transactions for Nayara Energy following recent US tariff increases. According to a source who spoke to ET, this decision was taken to prevent potential US and European Union sanctions. The US administration has implemented a 25% additional tariff on India regarding its Russian crude oil trade.Also Read | ‘China issue more complicated…’: After tariff on India, will Donald Trump impose additional duties on China for Russia oil trade? What JD Vance said Since July, Nayara Energy has encountered difficulties after the European Union implemented its 18th sanctions package, restricting fuel imports from Russia and setting a $47.6 per barrel limit on Russian crude prices.""These European sanctions imposed on July 18 were the last straw. All banks with international branches and operations have to adhere to the government laws to ensure that they do not attract regulatory scrutiny,"" said the person cited above. ""The last European sanctions along with the US tariffs imposed after that have made the processing of transactions for Nayara difficult.""""This call has been taken by the bank very recently after the US sanctions to ensure compliance with international rules,"" the source told ET.

The new roster came into effect Monday.The roster change was effected after an SC division bench did not delete a key paragraph (para 24) that instructed the high court chief justice to ""immediately withdraw the present criminal determination"" from Justice Kumar.Now, as per the new roster, a division bench comprising senior judge Arindam Sinha and Justice Kumar will hear civil matters pertaining to family court appeals, matters pertaining to the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act of 2007, and Writ C (a specific category of writ petitions) matters, except as provided elsewhere.Following a controversy over the SC order, the same bench of the apex court had deleted critical remarks against Justice Kumar and also the direction that he not be assigned any criminal matter as long as he is in office. This order, especially the direction for removal of criminal law work from Justice Kumar until retirement, drew criticism within SC as well as Allahabad HC.Subsequently, at least 13 high court judges had written to Chief Justice Arun Bhansali urging him to convene a full court meeting and not comply SC's directives against Justice Kumar.Interestingly, the letter was authored by Justice Arindam Sinha.In its Aug 4 order, SC, while hearing a special leave petition, had strongly criticised Justice Kumar's reasoning and expressed shock at his conclusion that civil disputes could be pursued through criminal prosecution because civil suits ""take years to conclude"". However, following the controversy, the apex court re-listed the matter to reconsider its directions. It was done on the request of CJI B R Gavai.

Key points:

PM Modi will be addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort for the 12th time.

Ahead of the address, the Prime Minister visited Rajghat and paid his tribute.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday greeted the nation on its 79th Independence Day and urged everyone to work even harder to build a developed Bharat.""Wishing everyone a very happy Independence Day. May this day inspire us to keep working even harder to realise the dreams of our freedom fighters and build a Viksit Bharat. Jai Hind,"" Modi said in a post on X.In his 98-minute address on August 15 in 2024, he had made an unequivocal pitch for a ""secular"" civil code instead of the current framework which is ""communal"" and promoted ""discrimination"", and also for simultaneous polls.He had announced that 75,000 more medical seats will be created in the country in the next five years.Social ills like crimes against women have also figured prominently in some of his speeches, and so are his push for cleanliness and empowerment of women and traditionally disadvantaged communities.Political watchers will eagerly look out for any signalling from him on the foreign policy front at a time when India's generally solid ties with the US are under strain amid Trump's repeated claims of mediating cease fire between India and Pakistan and use of tariff to pressure India on trade.Trump's decision to single out India for high tariff of 50 per cent, his occasional praise of Pakistan and ceasefire claims have given the opposition fodder to attack the Modi government.With Parliament's Monsoon session continuing and marred by disruption from the Opposition, which has alleged poll irregularities and demanded a discussion on the Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar, it will be seen with interest whether the prime minister responds to the allegations.His government's muscular stand against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism and naxalism has been a regular highlight in Modi's annual speeches, and this year is unlikely to be any different.The prime minister had sought suggestions from citizens for his address, and it will be keenly watched if some of these ideas make it to his speech.","PM Modi will be addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort for the 12th time.

Bands from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Indian Coast Guard, NCC, CRPF, ITBP, CISF, SSB, BSF, IDS, RPF, and Assam Rifles will perform at over 140 prominent locations nationwide.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7 as a decisive military response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives. The Indian Armed Forces targeted terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, eliminating over 100 terrorists. The government also sent seven multi-party delegations abroad to present India’s stand against cross-border terrorism.The Har Ghar Tiranga Abhiyan, launched at the Prime Minister’s call, has inspired citizens with a patriotic spirit. Under the Ministry of Culture, the 4th edition of this campaign was announced on August 11 as part of ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’, encouraging citizens to bring the Tiranga into their homes and hearts.Union Minister for Culture and Tourism Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said, ""This year, we are going to celebrate the fourth edition of the Tiranga campaign, for which more than 5 lakh youths have registered as volunteers. These youths will inspire people for the Tiranga campaign.""The Ministry of Culture is the nodal body for the campaign and is working closely with State Governments, Union Territories, educational institutions, community organisations, and the public to ensure widespread participation. Citizens are encouraged to hoist the Tiranga at homes, offices, and public spaces and share their celebrations online using the hashtag #HarGharTiranga.The campaign builds on the success of previous editions, encouraging personal and community engagement with the national flag. This year, the celebrations unfolded in phases, culminating on August 15, with a unified display of the Tiranga nationwide, symbolising a collective affirmation of national pride.The campaign’s strength lies in a whole-of-society approach, bringing together ministries, States, Union Territories, and citizens in a unified effort, ensuring the celebrations reach every part of the country and resonate with people from all walks of life.","The Prime Minister will speak from the iconic ramparts of the monument.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Thursday directed Election Commission to publish district-wise, names of 65 lakh voters deleted after the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls, along with reason for each deletion - death, migration or duplication, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. The details are to be uploaded on district electoral officers' websites.In another significant directive, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi directed EC to accept Aadhaar as identity proof from deleted voters applying for inclusion.""We want transparency in the entire process (of special intensive revision of electoral rolls) as an adult has a constitutional right to be included in the voters list and with a consequential statutory right to vote,"" the Supreme Court said on Thursday while directing Election Commission to publish names of deleted voters in Bihar along with reason for deletion.EC had earlier argued that there was no statutory obligation for it to make public the details of deletions. It had also pointed out that the details were with booth level officers and had been shared with political parties. On Thursday, the bench persuaded the poll body to relent on its stand by suggesting that transparency will blunt the allegations against SIR.""We are not interdicting EC's power to conduct SIR. But we want transparency in the entire process of revision of electoral rolls.If you (EC) publish the names of 65 lakh voters with reason for deletion from the draft list and provide a fair opportunity to the aggrieved persons to take remedial measures, it will counter a certain narrative that is being spread,"" the bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said.The bench also said Aadhaar was to be accepted as identity proof for deleted voters who seek inclusion of their names, as Aadhaar is the most easily available identity document. ""(EC's) list of 11 documents seems citizen-friendly, but Aadhaar and EPIC are readily available... your notice can say that those who have not submitted so far, they can submit their Aadhaar and EPIC also,"" Justice Bagchi said.The bench asked EC, represented by senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, to give wide publicity to uploading of booth-wise list of deleted names in the websites of chief electoral officer as well as district electoral officer; and, display of the printed list in panchayat and block offices by issuing advertisements in layman's language in vernacular and English newspapers as well as on radio and television. ""We want Poonam Devi and Anita Devi to know which website is to be accessed to find whether their names are in the voter list,"" the bench said.The data uploaded in the CEO and DEO websites should be searchable through EPIC number, the bench said, and directed EC to file a compliance report by Aug 22, the next date of hearing.After SIR, EC had produced a draft roll containing 7.24 crore voters and revealed that approximately 65 lakh had been deleted from the existing voters list. The 65 lakh included 22 lakh dead voters, 36 lakh who have permanently migrated outside Bihar and 7 lakh whose names were found included in voters lists for multiple constituencies. Aadhaar will now be considered by Election Commission as an identity proof for any of the voters for inclusion in the voter list if they figured among the list of deleted names.At the commencement of EC's turn to respond to the two-day-long caustic arguments against SIR and deletion of 65 lakh voters, Dwivedi said EC does not claim to be either omnipotent or impotent when it comes to revising the voters list, which is sine qua non for a fair election.""But those who lose elections always need an excuse. If they win, EVM is fantastic. But if they lose, they raise hundred questions about EVM's fairness. Though the SC has settled the fairness of EVMs through a series of judgments, the narratives of those who lose elections would continue and neither the Supreme Court nor EC can stop it,"" Dwivedi said.","Supreme Court orders Election Commission to publish district-wise, names of 65 lakh voters deleted after the special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016.

Brian Flores’ case highlights NFL hiring bias and diversity issues

Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores can now continue his racial discrimination lawsuit against the NFL and three teams in open court. On August 14, 2025, a federal appeals court in New York ruled the league's arbitration process invalid; otherwise, it could have stopped his case. Initially filed in February 2022 against organizations including the New York Giants, Houston Texans, and Denver Broncos, Flores asserted that head coach hiring discriminated against him. This decision allows his ideas to be openly broadcast. According to Flores’ attorneys Douglas Wigdor, David Gottlieb, and John Elefterakis, the NFL’s arbitration is “biased and unfair.”The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan agreed with a 2023 ruling from U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni. Judge Caproni had said Flores’ claims should not be forced into the NFL’s private arbitration, which gives Commissioner Roger Goodell power over disputes. The appeals court confirmed that this arbitration is “plainly unenforceable” because it lacks fairness and independent oversight.Brian Flores’ lawyers- Douglas Wigdor, David Gottlieb, and John Elefterakis called the ruling a major win, saying it is important not just for NFL employees but for all workers seeking fairness and transparency.They said the NFL’s arbitration wasand this decision sends a strong message that such practices cannot continue. NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy responded by saying the league disagrees and plans to appeal the ruling.This is the second legal setback for the NFL in just a few days, after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled against the league on August 11 in former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden’s arbitration case.Claiming NFL teams discriminated against Black applicants for head coach jobs, Brian Flores brought the lawsuit in February 2022. According to the Rooney Rule, which requires teams to interview minority candidates, he said that teams like the New York Giants and Houston Texans conducted ""sham interviews.Also Read: Kylie Kelce And Ciara Spark Heated Rivalry Talk After Targeting The Dallas Cowboys Brian Flores contended that this reflects a general bias in the NFL against Black coaches. The appeals court decision lets his case progress in public court, therefore opening the NFL's employment practices for scrutiny.Brian Flores' lawyers claim that the judgment might bring about real changes in the league's treatment of fairness and equal opportunity. The NFL has stated it will continue battling the case, including seeking for rehearing or bringing it before the Supreme Court.Legal experts observe that the outcome could affect upcoming rules on NFL recruiting and diversity, hence making teams more accountable for candidates' fair treatment.

Kai Trump swaps Elon Musk’s Cybertruck for Cadillac Escalade ahead of Miami golf career

Kai Trump prepares for University of Miami golf team after standout high school career

Kai Trump, the granddaughter of US President Donald Trump , has begun her senior year of high school in Florida with a new look on the driveway. Instead of Elon Musk ’s Tesla Cybertruck that her grandfather once gave her, she is now posing with a black Cadillac Escalade decked out in University of Miami colors. The large SUV has “The U” on the window and “2026” written in orange and green. Kai, who will join the University of Miami’s golf team next year, shared the photos on Instagram as school started.On August 14, 2025, Kai Trump, a high-school senior, posted photos showing her beside a black Cadillac Escalade. The Escalade has a painted “The U” logo- a nickname for the University of Miami and the back window reads “2026”, marking her expected college graduation year. Her mother, Vanessa Kay Pergolizzi, is also seen in one of the photos.Earlier, Kai Trump had been pictured driving a special Cybertruck that her grandfather, Donald Trump, gifted her. That gift matched her MAGA-style image and even featured in her social media posts.But after a public fallout between Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in early June, the Cybertruck is nowhere in sight.

Bengaluru: It is not just ordinary citizens who are exasperated by Bengaluru's traffic mess, even DCM DK Shivakumar admitted he gets an earful about it at home.Speaking in the legislative council Thursday, Shivakumar said his children berate him almost every day over the city's crippling congestion and deteriorating road infrastructure.Participating in a debate on the proposed tunnel road project, BJP MLC CT Ravi said Bengaluru has over 1.2 crore registered vehicles, with citizens spending an average of 117 hours a year stuck in traffic.Acknowledging the problem, Shivakumar said around 40 lakh additional vehicles enter the city daily from surrounding districts. ""Bengaluru is not as planned as New Delhi. The road dimensions have remained the same since city founder Kempegowda's time, but vehicle numbers have exploded. It can take six to seven hours to travel just 10-15km. My own kids complain it takes up to three hours to reach some parts of the city and fight with me. High court judges who commute to work from Hebbal have also been complaining that it takes 45 minutes to travel to work,"" he said.Shivakumar noted the city's population has doubled from 70 lakh to 1.4 crore, including 25 lakh tech professionals — nearly double the number in California's Silicon Valley.But road widening, he argued, is nearly impossible given property costs exceeding Rs 10,000 per sqft.Instead, he proposed largescale double-decker flyovers and elevated corridors. Citing a pilot flyover from Ragigudda to Silk Board executed by minister Ramalinga Reddy after a study visit to Pune, Shivakumar said PM Narendra Modi recently appreciated the concept and advised to expand it, even suggesting solar panel coverage.","DCM DK Shivakumar said his children berate him almost every day over the city's crippling congestion and deteriorating road infrastructure.

The winding river is now home to nearly 442 crocodiles—a staggering 60% increase from 2020, when 275 were counted.""We conducted the census in a scientific manner, carrying out surveys both during the day and at night. A detailed report was submitted to the forest department and the VMC. The findings clearly indicate an increase in the crocodile population,"" said Ritesh Gehlot, former deputy director of the GEER Foundation, who supervised the exercise.Herpetologist Raju Vyas said, ""The crocodiles have fully adapted to the river and its urban ecosystem, despite the rapid growth of human settlements along its banks. A major reason for the substantial rise in their numbers is the abundance of food in the river, coupled with favourable living conditions.""Sayajibaug Zoo curator Pratyush Patankar added, ""Human interference in the Vishwamitri is minimal, as its polluted water is of little direct use to people. Yet, the river supports a healthy fish population that provides ample food for the crocodiles, along with stray dogs and pigs that live along the banks. This is one of the main reasons for their thriving numbers, even though crocodiles are highly territorial.""Although the civic body has banned dumping non-vegetarian food and other waste into the river, the practice continues in certain areas, giving the reptiles easy access to food. While they often prey on stray dogs entering the river, attacks on humans remain rare.Wildlife activist Kartik Upadhyay, who participated in the census, noted, ""A few dozen crocodiles once lived in city lakes, but with several of these lakes either encroached upon or filled in recent years, the reptiles may have migrated to the Vishwamitri, leading to the spike in numbers.""""Though the river has predators like mongooses and monitor lizards that feed on crocodile eggs, the reptiles have still managed to survive and grow in strong numbers,"" Upadhyay added.However, some wildlife experts have voiced concern that such a sharp rise in the crocodile population could increase the risk of human-animal conflicts in the future.","A census carried out in February by the GEER Foundation revealed a significant rise in their population.

Tsunami threat along the Cascadia Subduction Zone

Poll What do you think should be prioritized to mitigate tsunami risks? Early-warning systems & evacuation planning Resilient infrastructure & community drills

The potential mega-tsunami threat

Areas at highest risk of tsunami

Urgency of preparedness for tsunami and earthquake





Scientists are warning of a potentially catastrophic mega-tsunami that could strike parts of the US Pacific Coast, triggered by a major earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). Stretching roughly 600 miles from Northern California to Vancouver Island, this fault line accumulates massive tectonic stress as the Juan de Fuca Plate slides beneath the North American Plate. Researchers from Virginia Tech, led by geoscientist Tina Dura, estimate there is a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 or greater earthquake occurring along the CSZ within the next 50 years.According to their study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, such an event could suddenly sink coastal land by up to 6.5 feet, dramatically expanding floodplains and generating tsunami waves hundreds of feet high, posing unprecedented risks to millions of residents, critical infrastructure, and ecosystems along the West Coast.The Cascadia Subduction Zone is one of North America’s most hazardous fault lines, according to the Virginia Tech research team. Over centuries, tectonic stress builds as the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate is forced beneath the North American Plate. When this stress is released during a major earthquake, coastal regions could experience sudden land subsidence, dramatically increasing floodplain areas and altering shorelines almost instantly.The last great earthquake along this fault occurred in 1700, triggering a tsunami recorded as far away as Japan. The Virginia Tech study emphasizes that a similar event today would have far more devastating effects due to dense populations, developed urban infrastructure, and critical transportation networks along the coast. Researchers warn that rapid inundation could leave little time for evacuation, magnifying the human and economic toll.According to simulations conducted by Dura and her team, a major CSZ earthquake could generate a “mega-tsunami” with waves potentially reaching up to 1,000 feet, far surpassing typical tsunami heights of only a few feet. Coastal cities including Seattle, Portland, and towns in northern California could be submerged within minutes. The Virginia Tech study ran tens of thousands of models, showing that thousands more people, buildings, and miles of roads would be exposed to flooding than current hazard maps predict.Researchers emphasize that such an event would combine sudden ground subsidence with extreme wave heights, creating conditions unlike any historical tsunami in the region. The study highlights the urgent need for improved early-warning systems, evacuation planning, and resilient infrastructure to minimize potential loss of life.The Virginia Tech research identifies southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California as the regions most vulnerable to flooding from a CSZ mega-tsunami. While Alaska and Hawaii also face tsunami risks due to their own seismic activity, they are geographically farther from the CSZ and would experience less immediate threat. Low-lying coastal zones along the fault line could face permanent inundation, particularly when combined with climate-driven sea level rise projected by 2100.The study underscores that communities must prioritize flood-resilient urban planning, fortification of critical infrastructure, and preparation for long-term displacement scenarios. Emergency planners are advised to use the study’s simulations to guide evacuation routes, reinforce hospitals and shelters, and prepare for cascading impacts to energy, water, and transportation systems.Lead researcher Tina Dura emphasizes that a mega-tsunami triggered by a CSZ earthquake would be sudden and catastrophic, not a gradual environmental change. The study warns that without proactive disaster planning, evacuation protocols, and resilient construction, a major quake could result in more than 30,000 deaths, damage over 170,000 structures, and incur economic losses exceeding $81 billion. Researchers highlight that combining earthquake and tsunami hazards with projected climate-driven sea level rise makes this a “compound disaster” scenario that demands immediate attention.According to Dura, local governments, policymakers, and coastal residents must act swiftly to implement early-warning systems, strengthen building codes, and conduct community-wide preparedness drills. The Virginia Tech study serves as a critical wake-up call, emphasizing that preparation today could dramatically reduce the human and economic costs of a future mega-tsunami. Experts also advise coastal residents to maintain emergency kits and establish communication plans with family and neighbors. Community education programs on tsunami awareness and earthquake safety are being promoted to enhance resilience and reduce panic during sudden disasters.","Scientists warn of a potentially catastrophic mega-tsunami that could strike parts of the US Pacific Coast, triggered by a major earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone.

Igor Babuschkin , a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the founding members of Elon Musk ’s AI startup xAI , has officially announced his departure to launch a new venture focused on AI safety research and responsible innovation. Babuschkin played a pivotal role in shaping xAI’s technical infrastructure, building engineering teams, and overseeing the development of its Grok chatbot.On August 13, 2025, Babuschkin announced his resignation, writing on X: “Today was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023… Building AI that advances humanity has been my lifelong dream.” Elon Musk replied publicly, “Best of luck, Igor,” a cordial farewell that contrasted with Musk’s often tense relationships with departing executives. With his new firm, Babuschkin Ventures , he aims to fund research and startups developing AI systems that advance humanity while ensuring the technology’s safe and ethical deployment in an increasingly competitive global AI landscape.While Babuschkin has kept much of his personal life private, his career trajectory reflects a consistent passion for advanced machine learning systems and the ethical use of technology. He studied computer science and artificial intelligence, developing a strong foundation in deep learning, neural networks, and natural language processing before entering the tech industry’s most competitive AI labs.As reported by Reuters, Babuschkin’s AI journey began at Google DeepMind, one of the world’s most prestigious research labs known for breakthroughs in AlphaGo and protein-folding prediction. As a research engineer, he contributed to projects pushing the boundaries of reinforcement learning and large language models.Later, he joined OpenAI, working on technical infrastructure that powered the organization’s advanced AI models. This experience exposed him to both the incredible potential and serious risks of powerful AI systems — insights that would later shape his philosophy at xAI and beyond.In 2023, Babuschkin became a founding member of xAI, a company Musk envisioned as a transparent and mission-driven alternative to Big Tech AI platforms. He recalled his first meeting with Musk: As per his tweet on X(formerly Twitter) he shared, “We talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold. We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed. Building AI that advances humanity has been my lifelong dream.”At xAI, Babuschkin played a central role in building the company’s infrastructure, assembling engineering teams, and developing foundational tools used to manage large-scale training jobs. One of his signature achievements was overseeing the creation of the Memphis supercluster — a high-performance computing hub powering xAI’s flagship Grok chatbot.Babuschkin revealed plans to start Babuschkin Ventures, a firm dedicated to:His focus marks a pivot from building AI systems to funding projects that ensure AI’s safe deployment — a move aligned with growing global regulatory interest in AI governance.During his tenure, Babuschkin helped xAI achieve rapid operational milestones, including:Despite its technical progress, xAI faced operational controversies during Babuschkin’s time.The Memphis facility powering Grok’s training relied on natural gas-burning turbines, prompting protests from locals who claimed emissions worsened air quality in West Tennessee. Environmental activists demanded cleaner energy alternatives, highlighting concerns about health risks, increased pollution, and the facility’s impact on vulnerable communities nearby.May 2025: Grok generated false claims about “white genocide” in South Africa after an unauthorised modification to its system prompts.July 2025: A code update led Grok to post antisemitic content, including praise for Adolf Hitler.These incidents prompted public apologies from xAI and drew regulatory scrutiny from the European Union.",Igor Babuschkin is a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the founding members of Elon Musk ’s AI startup xAI.

Poll What is your stance on the Supreme Court's directive to shelter stray dogs? Supportive of the directive Opposed to it Need more information Indifferent

Former India cricket captain Kapil Dev has called on Delhi authorities to provide stray dogs with a better life, following a recent Supreme Court directive to move them to shelter homes. The order instructed the Delhi government and other relevant bodies to remove stray dogs from public spaces and house them in designated shelters.The decision has sparked controversy among animal rights activists, who fear challenges in its implementation. In a video message for animal welfare group Petfamilia, Kapil Dev said he believed dogs were among the most beautiful creatures and appealed to officials to treat them with compassion. “I request the authorities to look after them, give them a better life, and not throw them out,” he said.The matter returned to court after another bench questioned why authorities had begun picking up animals even before the earlier order was made public. The bench also criticised the lack of proper implementation of animal control guidelines, which has contributed to the current situation.A bench comprising Justice Vikram Nath, Justice Sandeep Mehta, and Justice NV Anjaria heard the case this morning. This followed an August 11 order by a two-judge bench of Justice JB Pardiwala and Justice R Mahadevan, which led to protests by animal lovers against the removal of strays from residential areas.Representing the Delhi government, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta highlighted incidents of stray dog attacks on children, some resulting in fatalities from rabies. He argued that sterilisation alone cannot prevent rabies and stressed that while dogs should not be killed, they need to be separated from public spaces for safety reasons. Citing government data, he said there were 37 lakh dog bite cases in the last year, adding that the issue requires urgent court intervention.","Kapil Dev has called on Delhi authorities to provide stray dogs with a better life.

Japan recorded modest economic growth in the April–June quarter, overcoming the pressure of steep US tariffs, official figures showed on Friday.Preliminary data from the Cabinet Office indicated that gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.3% from the previous quarter, outpacing market expectations of 0.1%. The January–March reading was also revised up to 0.1% growth from a previous estimate of contraction, avoiding what could have been a technical recession.On an annualised basis, the economy expanded 1%, higher than forecasts of 0.4% and following 0.6% growth in the prior quarter, reported news agency AFP.Economists polled by Reuters had anticipated a weaker performance, but robust exports, which contributed 0.3 percentage points to GDP after a sharp drop in Q1, helped support the uptick, according to CNBC. Japan’s trade deficit also narrowed in the second quarter.The improvement offers some relief to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose political future has been under strain after his coalition lost its majority in the upper house in July.“This is a welcome sign, but the economy still faces many downside risks,” said Yoshiki Shinke of Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, as quoted by AFP, cautioning that export volumes could come under pressure if automakers adjust pricing to offset tariffs.Japan’s auto sector, a key employer and export driver, has been hit by US duties of up to 27.5%. A recent trade agreement reduced the rate on cars to 15%, but the change has not yet taken effect.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday used his 79th Independence Day address from the Red Fort to underline India’s renewed focus on semiconductor manufacturing, while pointing to decades of missed opportunities in the sector.“When we talk about different dimensions of technology, I want to draw your attention. Let me take semiconductors as an example… files related to semiconductors started moving 50–60 years ago… but the idea was stalled, delayed, and blocked,” PM Modi said at Red Fort.“The very idea of semiconductors was aborted before it could take shape. Today, decades later, many countries have mastered semiconductors and established their strength in the world”, he said.The Prime Minister said his government had “freed ourselves from this burden” and was advancing semiconductor work “in mission mode.” He announced that “six different semiconductor units are coming up on the ground” and that “four new units have already been given the green signal.”Significantly, he declared, “by the end of this very year, a Made in India chip, built in India by the people of India, will arrive in the market.”The remarks come days after the Union Cabinet approved four new semiconductor projects under the India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), with total investments of around Rs 4,600 crore.These include facilities in Odisha, Punjab, and Andhra Pradesh, covering compound fabrication, advanced glass substrate packaging, and high-power discrete component manufacturing.With these approvals, India now has 10 ISM-sanctioned projects worth nearly Rs 1.60 lakh crore across six states.The government says these facilities will boost domestic chip design capabilities, meet growing demand in telecom, automotive, data centres, defence, and consumer electronics, and create over 2,000 skilled jobs directly, alongside indirect employment in the electronics manufacturing sector.PM Modi linked the semiconductor drive to the broader vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047, telling young Indians that self-reliance in critical technologies was key to true independence.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi used his 79th Independence Day address from the Red Fort to underline India’s renewed focus on semiconductor manufacturing.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Next-generation GST reforms: What to expect?

In a big cheer for the middle class and common man, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced upcoming Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms. Speaking from Red Fort on the occasion of the 79th Independence Day , PM Modi promised a Diwali gift for people in the form of GST reforms and lower tax burden.""This Diwali, I am going to make it a double Diwali for you... Over the past eight years, we have undertaken a major reform in GST... We are bringing next-generation GST reforms. This will reduce the tax burden across the country,” he said.Also Check | PM Modi's Independence Day speech Live Updates Meanwhile, in the midst of discussions about reducing GST for various products, a group of state ministers, led by Bihar's Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Chaudhary, is scheduled to meet next week. Some members of the GoM, particularly those from the Opposition, have recommended keeping the current slabs and rates unchanged due to concerns about potential negative effects on revenue.However, the government has already done considerable work on this issue. Another group of state ministers is also addressing the matter of applying lower or zero GST on health and term life insurance, where there is less resistance, and a decision is expected soon.In the coming weeks, the government and states are anticipated to collaborate on overhauling the eight-year-old tax system, including revising the cess, which could help offset some potential revenue losses for the states.In July, it was reported that the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has given preliminary approval for a major restructuring of the GST system. The most notable change for the common man could be the potential adjustment of GST rates , with items currently taxed at 12% possibly moving to the 5% category, according to an ET report.The existing GST system includes five tax rates: nil, 5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%, along with special rates of 0.25% and 3% for precious metals. About 21% of goods are currently taxed at 5%.The 12% rate applies to 19% of items, while 44% fall under the 18% rate. Only 3% of items are taxed at the highest rate of 28%.An additional compensation cess is levied on certain luxury and harmful products, like cigarettes and automobiles, in the 28% bracket. This cess was introduced to shield states from potential revenue losses during the GST transition for five years until June 2022. The duration was extended to March 31, 2026, to repay the ₹2.69 lakh crore debt the Centre incurred for states during the Covid crisis to cover the cess fund shortfall.Authorities are considering removing the 12% rate and reallocating these items to the 5% and 18% categories, the report said.The timing for restructuring is favorable as tax systems have stabilized and economic indicators are strong. With upcoming free trade agreements with developed countries, the government seeks to eliminate barriers that could hinder the growth of domestic industries.Also read | Independence Day: PM Modi warns ‘India will not tolerate nuclear threats’; strong message to Pakistan from Red Fort","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced upcoming Goods and Services Tax (GST) reforms.

Zomato’s Independence Day offer is live from August 14 to 17.“By lowering the free delivery threshold for our Zomato Gold members, we aim to make online ordering more rewarding—encouraging customers to enjoy everyday meals while discovering more restaurants,” Aditya Mangla, chief executive of food delivery business Eternal told Economic times.“This change not only offers greater value to our Gold members but also supports our restaurant partners during this important time of year,” he added.Earlier this month, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal urged India to embrace its potential and become a global superpower following US tariff hikes. His call for self-reliance and ambition resonated widely, sparking discussions on economic reforms and strategic independence. The focus shifted towards strengthening local manufacturing, improving trade policies, and leveraging underutilized sectors like tourism to reduce reliance on external forces.In his statement, Goyal noted that such global ""reminders"" happen regularly — “a threat here, a tariff there” — all reinforcing the idea that India should ""stay in its lane."" But instead of reacting with resentment, he urged Indians to respond with ambition. He argued that the only path forward is for India to unapologetically become the largest superpower, not only economically, but also in defense, technology, and self-belief.The sentiment resonated widely, sparking a wave of support across X. One user commented, “It’s not about retaliation, it’s about evolution.” Another said, “We’ve been modest for too long.

A Florida woman has won the 2025 Florida Python Challenge after removing 60 invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades, winning the grand prize of $10,000. Taylor Stanberry outperformed 934 participants from 30 U.S. states and Canada in a 10-day competition aimed at controlling the spread of this dangerous species. The event, held from July 11 to 20, saw a record 294 pythons removed from the wild, highlighting both the scale of the infestation and the critical role of citizen engagement in conservation. Officials described Stanberry’s achievement as a major win for Florida’s native wildlife.Taylor Stanberry, a Naples resident and self-described “venomous keeper” and “relocator,” captured 60 pythons during the challenge, more than any other participant. Known as the “new queen of the Everglades,” she demonstrated exceptional skill and patience, contributing significantly to efforts to curb the Burmese python population in Florida. Burmese pythons are highly adaptable and can lay 50–100 eggs at a time, making them a persistent threat to the Everglades’ delicate ecosystem. Her accomplishment underscores how individual action can make a measurable difference in wildlife conservation and sets a high benchmark for future competitors.The Florida Python Challenge is an annual event organized by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) to reduce the number of invasive pythons and raise public awareness about their impact on native ecosystems. This year, 934 participants competed across eight official locations, including Everglades National Park, to capture the most pythons within the 10-day window. Participants must complete online training and adhere to humane python-killing guidelines. Firearms, dogs, or other animals are not permitted, emphasizing safe and responsible removal.The record removal of 294 pythons in 2025 represents a milestone in ongoing conservation efforts. FWC Chairman Rodney Barreto noted, “With over 1,400 pythons removed during all Florida Python Challenge events to date and over 16,000 pythons removed by FWC and South Florida Water Management District contractors since 2017, collective efforts are the key to continuing to address the threats Burmese pythons pose to Florida’s native wildlife and ecosystems. ” Pedro Ramos, superintendent of Everglades National Park, added that the challenge highlighted the importance of citizen participation in tackling invasive species.Burmese pythons are native to Southeast Asia but have become one of Florida’s most notorious invasive species due to the exotic pet trade. Their rapid reproduction and adaptability threaten the natural food chain in the Everglades, impacting native species and the overall ecosystem. Since 2000, over 23,000 pythons have been removed from the wild, but the challenge continues to play a crucial role in controlling their population. The annual event educates the public about the ecological risks and encourages responsible participation in wildlife management.Aside from the grand prize winner, participants competed in various categories, including the “longest python” captured. Taylor Stanberry’s success has brought additional attention to the Python Challenge, inspiring new participants and emphasizing the importance of collaboration with partners like the South Florida Water Management District and the National Park Service. The inclusion of Everglades National Park as an official competition site this year provided both a new challenge and an opportunity to raise public awareness about the ongoing threat posed by invasive Burmese pythons.","A Florida woman has won the 2025 Florida Python Challenge after removing 60 invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades.
