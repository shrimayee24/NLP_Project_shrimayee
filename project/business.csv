Underlining a “collective desire for restoration of peace and stability in West Asia and Eurasia as soon as possible”, PM Modi iterated that “solutions cannot be found in battlefields”, and that India, in fulfilling its responsibilities as a “vishwabandhu”, would continue to make every effort to contribute to peace efforts.“I come from the land of Buddha, and I have repeatedly said this is not the age of war.It’s essential to respect sovereignty, territorial integrity and international laws,” he said while addressing the East Asia Summit in Laos Friday.In a message to Asean countries amid growing Chinese assertiveness, Modi said the region’s approach should be focused on development and not expansionism. He said a free, open, inclusive, prosperous and rules-based Indo-Pacific is crucial for progress of the entire region, and peace, security and stability in South China Sea are in the interest of Indo-Pacific region.We believe that maritime activities should be conducted in accordance with UNCLOS. Ensuring freedom of navigation and airspace is essential. A robust and effective Code of Conduct should be developed. And, it should not impose restrictions on the foreign policies of regional countries, said PM Modi.Calling for concerted action against terrorism, he said the menace poses a serious challenge to global peace and security. “To combat it, forces that believe in humanity must come together & work in tandem. And, we must strengthen mutual cooperation in the areas of cyber, maritime, and space,” he said. While endorsing Asean’s approach toMyanmar , Modi said India believes it is crucial to sustain humanitarian assistance and implement suitable measures for the restoration of democracy.“We believe that, Myanmar should be engaged rather than isolated in this process. As a neighbouring country, India will continue to uphold its responsibilities. Friends, the most negatively affected countries, due to ongoing conflicts in various parts of the world, are those from Global South,” he said, adding India has consistently supported the unity and centrality of Asean that is also pivotal to India’s Indo-Pacific vision and Quad cooperation.Underlining the severe impact of conflicts on Global South, PM highlighted that the path of dialogue and diplomacy based on a humanitarian approach must be adopted for peaceful resolution of conflicts in the world.","PM Modi said the region’s approach should be focused on development and not expansionism.

Ratan Tata's legacy





I dedicate my last years to health: Ratan Tata in Assam

NEW DELHI: Ratan Tata , chairman emeritus of one of India's biggest conglomerates Tata Group , died at 86 after prolonged illness. He was admitted to the hospital due to his age and related medical conditions.In a statement, Tata's family said, ""We his brothers, sisters, and family take solace and comfort in the outpouring of love and respect from all who admired him. While he is no longer with us in person, his legacy of humility, generosity and purpose will continue to inspire future generations.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi mourned Ratan Tata and called him a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being.""Shri Ratan Tata Ji was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being. He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond the boardroom. He endeared himself to several people thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.""One of the most unique aspects of Shri Ratan Tata Ji was his passion towards dreaming big and giving back. He was at the forefront of championing causes like education, healthcare, sanitation, animal welfare to name a few,"" he added.Ratan Tata, who is also known for his charitable work, served as the chairman of the Tata Group from 1991 to 2012. During his tenure, he made significant contributions to the conglomerate founded by his great-grandfather over a century ago.In 1996, Tata established Tata Teleservices, the telecommunications arm of the group, and in 2004, he led the initial public offering of Tata Consultancy Services, the group's IT company.After stepping down as chairman in 2012, Tata retained the honorary title of chairman emeritus for several Tata companies, including Tata Sons , Tata Industries, Tata Motors , Tata Steel, and Tata Chemicals.Tata was awarded two of India's highest civilian honors: the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2008.One of India's most successful business tycoons, he is also renowned for his philanthropic endeavors. His personal involvement in philanthropy began in the 1970s with the initiation of The Aga Khan Hospital and Medical College project, which laid the foundation for one of India's premier healthcare institutions.After becoming the chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, Tata's philanthropic efforts gained new momentum. He actively guided the Tata Trusts, established by his great-grandfather Jamsetji, towards addressing crucial social needs and established institutes of excellence such as the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, while also funding educational initiatives across India.Despite his reputation for class and elegance, Tata was not immune to controversies. Although the Tata Group was not directly implicated in the 2008 scam involving the allocation of second-generation telecom licences, Tata was drawn into the controversy through leaked recordings of purported phone calls he made to lobbyist Nira Radia. However, he was not implicated in any wrongdoing.In December 2012, Tata handed over control of Tata Sons to Cyrus Mistry, his deputy at the time. However, the owners had issues with the functioning of the first non-Tata family member, leading to Mistry's ouster in October 2016. Ratan Tata was said to be one of the shareholders who disagreed with Mistry on several projects, including Mistry's decision to discontinue the loss-making small car Nano, which was a pet project of Ratan Tata.Since 2017, Tata has been the emeritus chairman of Tata Sons. During this time, he has taken on a new role, supporting young entrepreneurs of the 21st century by investing in new age tech-driven start-ups that will play a significant role in shaping the future of the country. In his personal capacity and through his investment company RNT Capital Advisors, Tata has invested in over 30 start-ups, including Ola Electric, Paytm, Snapdeal, Lenskart, and Zivame.One wet monsoon evening not many moons ago, dog-lover Tata had decreed that any strays outside the conglomerate's HQ in downtown Mumbai be allowed shelter. Some never left but their benefactor is no more.","Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata Group, dies at 86 after prolonged illness.

"Congress reviews Haryana loss, to pause EVM attack till it has ‘enough evidence’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-reviews-haryana-loss-to-pause-evm-attack-till-it-has-enough-evidence/articleshow/114131317.cms,"To ‘avoid bad optics’, Hooda & Selja not invited to Congress meet

NEW DELHI: Congress , which reacted to its Haryana debacle by blaming it on EVMs and rejecting the result as “unacceptable”, has decided to pause the line of attack and has turned the focus inwards to look into the role of factional feuds and weaknesses that prevented a win.The decision was taken at a review meeting convened on Thursday by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge , with the party brass agreeing that it will firm up its position on EVMs as one of the key causes for the electoral loss only after it had gathered “firm evidence” of wrongdoing, sources said.A statement issued by Kharge’s office later in the evening said the party has decided to depute a technical team to look into complaints and discrepancies noted by candidates. “Congress will issue a detailed response based on the fact-finding team’s report on the counting process and functioning of electronic voting machines,” it said.The deliberations, held against the backdrop of supporters of factions led by former Haryana CM B S Hooda and former Union minister Kumari Selja pointing fingers at each other, saw Rahul Gandhi asserting the need for all to bury their differences and unite for the party’s interest. “The party’s interest is paramount,” a source quoted him as saying in the meeting. Fight between rival factions is widely seen to be the major factor in Congress’s defeat.Hooda, his loyalist and PCC chief Udai Bhan, Selja and her ally Randeep Singh Surjewala were not invited for the meeting, with sources attributing their exclusion to the concern to “avoid bad optics”. The party is planning to carry out booth-level assessment by seeking a report from each candidate to study the factors that played a role in the loss.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Ajay Maken said, “As you all know, as the exit polls and opinion polls had showed, the results were unexpected. There was a lot of difference between the exit polls and the actual results. We discussed what could be the reasons.” On whether infighting had hurt Congress’s chances in the polls, Maken said, “There are various reasons, from EC to internal differences, we have discussed all that and will hold more discussions going forward.”On Tuesday, party general secretary Jairam Ramesh and spokesperson Pawan Khera had blamed the “slow counting of EVMs” for the party’s defeat to BJP: a bitter surprise which has helped the saffron rival gain momentum and raised doubts about the viability of Congress’s planks — guaranteed MSP purchase of entire farm produce, scrapping of Agnipath scheme, caste census and an “imperilled Constitution”.The rejection of the outcome, a first for a national party, drew a strong protest from EC, which rejected all the charges and raised eyebrows in independent quarters. BJP, of course, lashed out at Congress.Besides Kharge and Rahul, general secretary K C Venugopal, senior observers for the polls Ashok Gehlot and Maken, as well as secretaries for the state participated in the review meeting. Party in-charge of the state Deepak Babaria joined the meeting online from Ahmedabad.","Hooda, his loyalist and PCC chief Udai Bhan, Selja and her ally Randeep Singh Surjewala were not invited for the meeting.

What is the Mahadev betting scam?

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: Sourabh Chandrakar, one of the main promoters of the Mahadev betting app , is expected to be brought to India soon following his recent formal arrest in Dubai on the basis of an Interpol issued arrest warrant in a money laundering and fraud case.Chandrakar along with another promoter of the app, Ravi Uppal was detained in that country late last year following the ED 's request for issuance of a Red Notice (RN) against them.Sources said Chandrakar is expected to be either extradited or deported to India over the next few days after he was formally placed under arrest in Dubai recently.Red corner notices was issued against Chandrakar in October 2023 after the ED had moved a special court in Raipur, filed a chargesheet and obtained a non-bailable warrant against him.The Mahadev online betting scam, a complex web of illicit operations involving individuals from Bhilai, the steel city, and orchestrated from the UAE and various states in India, was uncovered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) following a series of raids in Chhattisgarh in 2023.The scandal, which unfolded during the previous Congress regime in Chhattisgarh, has since become one of the most significant controversies in the state.According to ED findings, the Mahadev online betting app was an unauthorized platform that facilitated illegal betting on various sports, including cricket and football, as well as other forms of gambling. Operating across India and internationally, the app attracted a large number of users with the promise of easy money.However, beneath the surface, it was allegedly involved in laundering vast sums of money, funnelling illegal earnings through a complex network of offshore accounts and shell companies.The ED's crackdown involved a series of high-profile raids across multiple locations, targeting individuals who wielded significant power during the Congress regime. These raids resulted in the seizure of incriminating evidence, including digital devices, financial records, and documents that revealed the extent of the app's illicit activities.The ED suspects that the betting app laundered over Rs 5,000 crores—a staggering amount that has raised concerns about the reach of such illegal operations within the Indian financial system.","Saurabh Chandrakar, the promoter of the Mahadev Online Book gaming-betting app, was arrested in Dubai.

MUMBAI: In one of the last cabinet meetings before the announcement of the assembly elections, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , who holds the finance portfolio, was present for only around 10 minutes and left immediately after tribute was paid to Ratan Tata Thursday.Thirty-eight decisions - many of them having major financial implications - were taken in the two and a half hours that the meeting continued for after he left.Chief minister Eknath Shinde presided over the meeting, and deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis was with him all the time.Insiders said it was possible he was unhappy with the state of affairs and the high number of urgent proposals being brought before the cabinet meeting at the last minute without prior circular. Over the past few weeks, the finance department has raised objections to several proposals moved in the cabinet.While Ajit Pawar could not be reached for his comments despite repeated attempts, NCP state unit chief and Lok Sabha MP Sunil Tatkare said there was no question of any friction in Mahayuti .""I was in Raigad and don't know what happened in the cabinet. But there is no question of any friction in the Mahayuti, and nothing should be read into anyone leaving the cabinet early if that has happened at all,"" Tatkare said.The state has already come under criticism for a slew of pre-election sops costing Rs 96,000 crore announced in the budget, including the Ladki Bahin scheme. The expenditure on the Ladki Bahin scheme on its own is slated to be Rs 46,000 crore per year.The state is on a spree of clearing land allotments, subsidies and guarantees in the run-up to polls. The finance dept has already warned that fiscal deficit could be as high as Rs 2 lakh crore for 2024-25.The department has warned that the fiscal deficit had crossed 3% of the GSDP, the limit set by the Maharashtra Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Act.""This was probably first time that Ajit Pawar has left the cabinet like this. The exact reason is not known, but this is uncommon. His chair was vacant throughout the meeting,"" an official said.Over the last few weeks, fault lines have emerged between the Mahayuti partners - Shiv Sena and Ajit's NCP.","Ajit Pawar, who holds the finance portfolio, was present for only around 10 minutes.

NEW DELHI: The BJP Friday claimed that the opposition INDIA bloc was mulling to make the Leader of Opposition 's post in the Lok Sabha rotational. ""If the INDIA bloc feels that Rahul Gandhi is not able to handle this responsibility with full dedication, they will have to make that decision,"" BJP's Delhi MP Bansuri Swaraj said.Suggesting that there are many leaders in the opposition parties who are ""capable"" of handling the work of the LoP, the Delhi MP, however, said the onus is on the opposition to make that call as it is a ""internal matter"".The claim by the BJP comes as the Congress party has come under intense scrutiny from its allies in the bloc after the poll debacle in Haryana, where BJP defied the exit polls to emerge victorious for the third straight time.However, the claim has not been confirmed by the opposition parties so far. It is usually that only an MP from the single largest party in the opposition with at least 10 per cent seats can be appointed as the LoP. Rahul Gandhi was appointed as the LoP in the Lok Sabha with the Congress party emerging as the single largest opposition party in the House after the Lok Sabha results.The BJP MP made these remarks in response to questions regarding discussions about opposition parties potentially rotating the LoP position in the Lok Sabha.""Yes, absolutely. I have also heard that there is talk of making the post of Leader of Opposition rotational. But I would politely say that this is an internal matter of the opposition,"" Swaraj told a press conference at the party headquarters in Delhi.""Yes, there are definitely many leaders in the opposition parties who are quite capable of fulfilling the responsibility of the Leader of Opposition. If the INDI Alliance feels that Rahul Gandhi is not able to fulfill his responsibility with complete dedication, they should take such a decision,"" she added.Meanwhile, BJP's Amit Malviya hit out at Rahul Gandhi and held him responsible for the grand old party's performance in the recently concluded Haryana elections. The BJP spokesperson also urged the parties in the opposition bloc to relieve him of LoP duties.""According to media, Rahul Gandhi got up and stormed out of the Haryana review meet, blaming leaders for fighting amongst themselves,"" he wrote on X.If true, reflects poorly on Rahul Gandhi’s leadership, his ability to manage fluid situations, bring resolution, besides making him look petulant. Opposition parties should strip him off his status as LoP,"" he added.When asked whether the LoP's post could be made rotational, former Lok Sabha secretary general PDT Achary explained that only a MP from the single largest opposition party in the House can be appointed as the Leader of Opposition, according to news agency PTI.The person whom the single largest opposition party wants to be appointed as the LoP is chosen by it only, he said.""Neither the government nor the Speaker have any role to play in it,"" Acharya was quoted as telling news agency PTI.","BJP claims that the opposition INDIA bloc was mulling to make the Leader of Opposition's post in the Lok Sabha rotational.

NEW DELHI: To boost India’s surveillance system from space, the Cabinet Committee on Security led by PM Narendra Modi has quietly approved the phase III of the Space Based Surveillance ( SBS-III ) for launching a big bunch of spy satellites in low earth and geostationary orbits.“CCS on Monday gave the approval for launching 52 satellites under the SBS-III project, which would cost around Rs 27,000 crore,” a source in Isro toldIndia had already launched several spy or earth observation satellites under the SBS programme like Risat, Cartosat and Gsat-7 series satellites. The SBS-1 was first approved under the Vajpayee regime in 2001 under which four surveillance satellites were launched. Thereafter, six such satellites were launched under the second phase in 2013. The 50+ satellites, which are likely to be launched in five years, will boost the numbers of ‘eyes in the sky’, adding punch to the space-based surveillance system of India’s land and sea borders at a time the country is facing security concerns on the western border with Pakistan, northern border with China and increased sea surveillance by Chinese spy vessels and submarines in the Indian Ocean Region.The new fleet of satellites will be based on artificial intelligence (AI) that can “interact with each other in space to gather geo-intelligence” on the Earth. “We will have communication between satellites, so that if some satellite detects something, which is at GEO (geosynchronous equatorial orbit) at 36,000km altitude, it can ask another satellite in the lower orbit (at 400-600 km altitude) to check much more carefully and then give us more information. This capability will give us enormous potential,"" a senior Isro official said last December.The new tech will be able to “improve the ability of satellites to detect changes, to bring in more AI-related and data-driven approaches to analyse data, reduce data downloads and get only the necessary information”. “If India is able to launch satellites at this scale, threats to the country can be better mitigated,” he said. The recent Cabinet clearance to purchase 31 weaponised Predator drones from US-based General Atomics will add more teeth to the surveillance capability of the SBS-3 mission.Like the earlier dedicated satellites such as Gsat-7B (Indian Army), GSAT-7 (Rukmini for Navy) and GSAT-7A (Angry Bird for the IAF) for the armed forces, the three wings will have more such dedicated satellites for their special operations and missions.SBS operates 24-hours a day, 7-day a week collecting metric and space object identification data for man-made orbiting objects without the disruption of weather, time of day and atmosphere that can otherwise limit ground-based systems.","The Cabinet Committee on Security led by PM Narendra Modi has quietly approved the phase III of the Space Based Surveillance ( SBS-III ) for launching a big bunch of spy satellites.

The guidelines replace norms over a decade old and will prevent the elected govt from making backdoor or out-of-turn appointments, an official said.The updated regulations were outlined in a govt notification, bringing them into effect right away.The move follows complaints of dubious recruitments in state-owned entities such as J&K Bank, other bodies and govt departments by successive NC and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) regimes earlier.In the aftermath of the Aug 2019 abrogation of J&K’s statehood and special status, powers of such recruitments were vested with LG Sinha.

NEW DELHI: Air India Express Tiruchirapalli-Sharjah flight returned to land safely at the origin on Friday night after suffering a hydraulic snag due to which the landing gear of the Boeing 737 could not be retracted after take off. The Boeing 737 (VT-AYB) had left Trichy at 5.43 pm as IX613 with about 150 people on board.“Since the aircraft was fuelled up to fly to Sharjah , a long flight, the crew burnt fuel for well over a hour by circling nearby before landing.This was done to avoid over weight landing by coming below the maximum landing weight. An over weight landing can damage the landing gear,” said sources. It landed safely around 8.15 pm in Trichy after safely burning fuel.The pilots’ action is being commended. “While we are all trained for such situations in simulators, doing what is required when actually the time comes by keeping presence of mind is key. The pilots of IX613 did that on Friday,” said many pilots.Union aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said in a statement: “Following the hydraulic failure reported on Air India Express flight AXB 613, operating from Trichy to Sharjah with 141 people on board, we are relieved that the aircraft has landed safely at Trichy Airport. The crew followed all safety protocols, ensuring the well-being of every passenger during the emergency. The airport and emergency teams responded swiftly and effectively after a full emergency was declared at 18:05 IST. We commend their quick coordination in preparing for the aircraft's landing, which was successfully carried out at 20:15 IST.”“The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has been instructed to conduct a thorough examination of the aircraft to determine the exact cause of the hydraulic issue. In the meantime, Air India Express has been advised to provide all necessary assistance to the passengers, including alternate arrangements for their onward journey. Passenger safety is our top priority, and we will continue to work closely with all airlines and aviation authorities to ensure the highest standards of safety and comfort in our skies,” Naidu said.An AI Express spokesperson said: “We are aware of media reports related to an Air India Express flight operating on the Tiruchirappalli - Sharjah route. We would like to clarify that no emergency was declared by the operating crew. After reporting a technical snag, the aircraft circled multiple times in the designated area as an abundant precaution, to reduce fuel and weight considering the runway length, before making a safe precautionary landing. The cause of the snag will be duly investigated. In the interim, an alternative aircraft is being arranged for the onward journey of our guests. We regret the inconvenience and reiterate our commitment to prioritising safety in every aspect of our operations.”Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin said on X: “I am heartened to hear that the AI Express flight has landed safely. Upon receiving news of the landing gear issue, I immediately coordinated an emergency meeting with officials over the phone and instructed them to implement all necessary safety measures, including deploying fire engines, ambulances, and medical assistance.

He addresses Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying “now is the time to order the Chinese army to take Arunachal Pradesh back” and falsely claiming that “Arunachal Pradesh is the territory of China”.“SFJ will continue to use the protection and support of Canadian and American laws to continue to campaign for independence movements to Balkanise and disintegrate the Union of India,” Pannun threatens in front of a poster with the words “2047 None India"".“By 2047, the current borders and boundaries of the Union of India will be redrawn and wiped out from the world map,"" he threatens.

Among the projects, 19 are in J&K, 18 in Arunachal Pradesh, 11 in Ladakh, 9 in Uttarakhand and 6 in Sikkim.Singh on Friday also said the armed forces must be prepared for ""asymmetric warfare"", which has been brought home by ongoing conflicts in the present ""complex and ambiguous world situation"".""Unconventional and asymmetric warfare, including hybrid war, will be part of future conventional wars. This necessitates that armed forces should keep all these facets in consideration while formulating strategies. Be alert, regularly modernise and prepare continuously for various contingencies,"" Singh said.","India has been pushing China for the sequential process of first disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok.

This is in line with what several public health experts have been saying.Sanjeev Sanyal, an EAC-PM member and former principal economic advisor to the finance minister, wrote an article just a fortnight back questioning the wisdom of large-scale food fortification. He cautioned that ""an important driver of fortification-heavy strategy is advocacy by international donors and NGOs"" and suggested that ""much stronger evidence supporting different kinds of fortification"" was needed.Shamika Ravi, another EAC-PM member, was one of the authors of a paper published by EAC that analysed the latest household consumption survey data and showed that prevalence of anaemia among children and women was associated with poor dietary diversity of iron sources. The analysis flagged ""the limited impact"" of universal fortification of cereals to improve iron and zinc intake and reduce anaemia in India. The analysis based on survey data for 2022-23 and 2011-12 was done by Ravi and several experts from Indian Statistical Institute.Sanyal questioned whether fortification was an efficient response to undernutrition with thousands of crores of public money being spent on fortification for the universal distribution of fortified rice through PDS, midday meals and Integrated Child Development Scheme. He pointed out that of 18 studies on the impact of rice fortification on anaemia, which was used as scientific evidence by central govt to justify ramping up rice fortification programmes, only four were from India and that the results were ambiguous.According to Sanyal, even international donor community might be having second thoughts about fortification as Bill Gates also had recently stated that it is very important to diversify the diet. However, Sanyal concluded by stating that they were not advocating a blanket withdrawal of fortification but merely pointing out that much stronger evidence supporting different kinds of fortification was needed.","Government is pushing ahead with the rice fortification scheme, which will cost over Rs 17,000 crore.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar said on Friday that he had left the cabinet meeting early on Thursday to attend a farmers' event in Latur and that there was no friction between him and CM Eknath Shinde or anyone in Mahayuti . The opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi, meanwhile, took a dig at the state govt over the issue, with Congress' leader of opposition Vijay Wadettiwar saying efforts were being made to sideline Ajit Pawar.TOI had reported on Thursday that Pawar left early from the cabinet meet and 38 decisions were later taken.Senior officials who were present said Pawar, who holds the finance portfolio, was missing when decisions with major financial implications were taken.“The cabinet meeting started late, and I had to leave for a pre-scheduled meeting. The cabinet meet was supposed to start at 11 am but it started late. I had to take a flight to reach Nanded and then take a chopper to Ahmadpur to attend a farmers’ meeting. So I informed CM Eknath Shinde and DCM Fadnavis and then left,” Ajit Pawar said.Wadettiwar said, “It is coming to light that there are always disputes in the cabinet meetings, but this dispute is not for the interest of the state, but for the sake of self-interest. Eighty decisions were taken even when there is no money in the coffers. Ajit Pawar tried to discipline the finance department. Lately, fiscal discipline is being undermined. Mahayuti will leave the state destitute. That is why Ajit Pawar may have taken a step out from the cabinet meeting.”Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut said things were never all well in Mahayuti. “An illegal govt was formed only to break the Sena and NCP. Nobody cares about Devendra Fadnavis as the CM now has direct access to Amit Shah,” Raut said.The state has come under criticism for pre-election sops costing Rs 96,000 crore, including the Ladki Bahin scheme.

NEW DELHI:: As if responding to the oft-thrown jibe at judges - ""tyranny of the unelected and unaccountable"" - CJI D Y Chandrachud said judges, though neither elected nor accountable directly to the people like the political executive, are bound by the constitutional mandate to ensure equitable distribution of resources and protection of individuals' rights.The ""tyranny of the unelected and unaccountable"" jibe was repeatedly thrown at SC when it quashed the irregular allocations of 2G spectrum and coal blocks by UPA govt, and also when it struck down the NJAC enacted by NDA govt.Delivering the Jigme Singye Wangchuk lecture at Thimphu in Bhutan on Thursday, the CJI said the essence of the public trust doctrine is that parliamentarians, judges, and govts hold constitutional authority only as representatives and trustees of the people.He said while the political executive, directly elected by the people, is the sole authority to decide how natural resources and other tangible and intangible resources are distributed among the people, it is the judiciary which is vested with the responsibility to ensure that the distribution is equitable and not as per the whims and fancies of certain individuals.""We are not elected representatives. Public trust applies to us differently from other wings of govt,"" the CJI said, adding that judges are peculiarly placed in the doctrine of public trust linked with accountability as accountability is typically associated with elected representatives in democratic theory.Unlike the case of elected representatives, people do not have a role to play in the appointment of judges or influencing their decisions, he said. ""Populist decision-making sits rather uncomfortably on the sinewy shoulders of judicial independence . Yet the courts do require public trust and legitimacy.""""Public trust is central to the credibility of the judicial branch, which is otherwise insulated from public opinion in its operations - as it must be. Yet our insulation, which is intrinsic to our independence, provides a crucial need and justification for ensuring public trust in our functioning,"" he said.","The ""tyranny of the unelected and unaccountable"" jibe was repeatedly thrown at SC when it quashed the irregular allocations of 2G spectrum and coal blocks by UPA govt.

Similarly, Rule 48 specifies that at any time after a government servant has completed 30 years of qualifying service, “he may be required by the appointing authority to retire in public interest”. Such officers get an opportunity to respond and can also challenge the order in court.Government departments have so far compulsorily retired over 500 officers invoking these rules.“The PM’s message was clear that government employees need to perform, address people’s issues and ensure ease of living. Though departments are taking action against deadwoods, there is a need to do more,” said a source.Officials said there is a need to tweak the current regime as the present screening system is based on benchmarks and not on ranking of employees. Almost all employees get above benchmark annual ratings by their seniors, and they pass the yardsticks for promotion.Addressing the ministers and secretaries, Modi said good governance and development works get rewarded by people, a reference to BJP ’s hat-trick in Haryana and a good show in J&K, sources said.The PM asked top officials and ministers to ensure public grievances are comprehensively and expeditiously addressed, rather than files being pushed from one desk to another. He also asked secretaries to spare a day every week to address grievances, and ministers of state to monitor them.Sources said Modi mentioned how the PMO received 4.5 crore letters, including grievances from people, in the last 10 years, compared to only 5 lakh such letters received during Manmohan Singh’s last 5 years in office, underlining how people are more hopeful of redressal of complaints.Modi pointed out that while around 40 per cent of these were related to central government departments and agencies, the remaining 60 per cent were related to state government issues.","PM Narendra Modi has asked Union secretaries to carry out a rigorous assessment of performance of employees. The PM referred to Fundamental Rule 56(j) of the CCS (Pension) Rules, which specify that the “appropriate authority” can retire any government servant if it is of the opinion that he/she is unfit for retention.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114130142,imgsize-445280,width-400,resizemode-4/114130142.jpg"

Mutual love of dogs

NEW DELHI: Ratan Naval Tata's trusted assistant and youngest general manager, Shantanu Naidu , mourned the loss of the visionary leader on Thursday. Tata passed away on Wednesday night at the age of 86 at Breach Candy Hospital after a brief illness.Sharing a heartfelt post on LinkedIn of his 'dear lighthouse' 30-year-old Shantanu expressed the deep void left by the industrialist's passing.“The hole that this friendship has now left with me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to fill. Grief is the price to pay for love. Goodbye, my dear lighthouse,” his post read. Ratan Tata , the late chairman, emeritus of Tata Sons , one of India's largest conglomerates, had formed an extraordinary bond with Shantanu Naidu. The memory of that bond is still vivid, with videos and images of Shantanu celebrating Tata’s birthday just a few months earlier fresh in everyone’s mind.Shantanu’s journey from an engineering intern to Tata’s trusted general manager highlighted his dedication and the unique approach that defined their remarkable relationship.Their friendship began in 2014 when Shantanu created reflective collars to protect stray dogs from being hit by cars at night.Impressed by Shantanu’s initiative, Tata invited him to work for him, and their mutual love for animals further strengthened their bond.""Shantanu and I first met because of our common concern and affection for stray dogs. He has led a team of young college students to 'adopt' these dogs and give them affection, food, find homes for them and give them a sense of belonging,"" Tata had earlier told the BBC in an email.Their friendship transcended the boundaries of age, seamlessly bridging the gap between two generations and their differing perspectives.An old video footage shared by Tata Power shows how Shantanu Naidu explores the way ethics is deeply ingrained in the Tata way of life, often spanning across generations.Earlier sharing a series of posts on X, PM Modi paid his tribute and said he was ""extremely pained"" at the demise of Tata.""Shri Ratan Tata Ji was a visionary business leader, a compassionate soul and an extraordinary human being. He provided stable leadership to one of India’s oldest and most prestigious business houses. At the same time, his contribution went far beyond the boardroom. He endeared himself to several people thanks to his humility, kindness and an unwavering commitment to making our society better,"" PM Modi wrote on X.","Ratan Naval Tata's trusted assistant and youngest general manager, Shantanu Naidu, mourned the loss of the visionary leader on Thursday.

Discovery studio in Los Angeles on Thursday. The futuristic two-door vehicle, resembling a smaller version of Tesla's Cybertruck , coming next year.The Cybercab robotaxi features gull-wing doors and lacks a steering wheel or pedals. There’s only space for two passengers.The Cybercab relies solely on cameras and artificial intelligence for navigation, eschewing other hardware commonly used by robotaxi competitors.It also uses inductive charging, eliminating the need for charging ports.Announcing the robotaxis, Musk showed off 20 fully autonomous vehicles , including Cybercabs and modified Model Ys. He emphasised the safety benefits of autonomous vehicles, stating they could become ""10 times safer"" than human-driven cars.Musk announced that Cybercab production is slated to begin in 2026, with the vehicles expected to cost less than $30,000. He claimed the autonomous taxis would operate at around $0.20 per mile, making them cheaper than public transportation.During the event, Musk also introduced the Robovan, a larger self-driving vehicle capable of transporting up to 20 people, and demonstrated Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot. He suggested the Optimus could be sold for $20,000 to $30,000 in the future.The CEO outlined plans to begin ""unsupervised FSD "" (Full Self-Driving) in Texas and California next year with Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. However, Musk acknowledged his tendency to be ""highly optimistic with timeframes.""While the unveiling marks a significant step for Tesla's autonomous ambitions, the company faces challenges.

Could Tyreek Hill Return to the Chiefs? Cryptic Posts Fuel Trade Speculation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/could-tyreek-hill-return-to-the-chiefs-cryptic-posts-fuel-trade-speculation/articleshow/114157742.cms,"Image - AP News

Is Tyreek Hill Returning to Kansas City?



What does Miami have to lose?



Chiefs Have The Cap Space to Make it Happen



Will the Trade Really Happen?



Rumors are swirling that Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill may be on the verge of a sensational return to his former team, the Kansas City Chiefs. Recent social media activity from Hill, combined with insider reports, has fueled speculation about a potential trade. While nothing is confirmed, the financial logistics of the deal appear feasible for both teams, making the possibility more real than ever.Also read - ""Kayla Nicole Breaks Silence on Hateful Comments and Rumors Amid Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's Relationship"" Tyreek Hill is probably the most dynamic wide receiver of the present NFL, but recent posts on his Snapchat set the rumor mill ablaze when he started posting nostalgic highlights from his time with the Kansas City Chiefs.Cryptic postings by Hill have, for now, become a source of wonder among fans and are trying to understand why the wide receiver is signaling his return to his former team-a move that would address the Chiefs' current lack of a primary wide receiver.The NFL aficionados and analysts are quarreling over each and every minute detail. The chatter over the proposed trade has grown louder after Hill's recent social media posts.Trade Hill? It is well unlikely but not impossible. The Dolphins currently have $6 million of cap space left, and trading the star wide receiver would bring substantial financial losses. If Hill is traded, he would be taking away with him an $11.9 million dead cap hit in this year while leaving behind a $19.3 million dead cap hit the following season. It's also saving the Dolphins $8.4 million in 2025 which would be an excellent incentive, given Hill is to receive a salary of about $27.7 million that season.In short, while the Dolphins can make the trade happen, it would require crossing significant financial hurdles. It could very well come down to whether the team believes in building a more balanced squad or continues to heavily rely on Hill.From Kansas City's perspective, Tyreek Hill's return fits all possibilities in terms of money. Kansas City should easily have enough remaining cap space to pay Hill what he makes this season, $800,000. Adding $25 million that they project for 2025, that would be more than enough to fit in his fully guaranteed salary of $27.8 million for next year.With the current requirement of the team to find a dependable wide receiver especially given the sidelining of Rashee Rice, the possibility of returning Hill to play along with quarterback Patrick Mahomes again becomes more and more plausible. Those few wide receivers who have this kind of on-field chemistry with Mahomes are a goldmine for the Chiefs' offense.While financial feasibility facilitates the trade, the ultimate question would be whether the two teams were willing to pull the trigger. Both teams are at absolute desperate need for the position, but in reverse sides-the Dolphins do not have a necessity for wide receiver, and the Chiefs badly need one, or two wide receivers: Tyreek Hill has been rumored along with Davante Adams as being on their trade wish list. The Dolphins will have some considerations based on future cap savings but will lose their premier offensive weapon in the short term.Perhaps it is the recent posts by Hill, but it might be too early to tell if this will be a reality. For now, the Chiefs are scrambling for a wide receiver to complement Mahomes' play style, and the clock is ticking for his reunion with Hill.Also read - NFL Fans Shocked as Carrie Underwood’s $18 Million Pay Outpaces Players Like Travis Kelce","Recent social media activity from Hill, combined with insider reports, has fueled speculation about a potential trade.

To enhance accessibility and inclusivity during the Exposition of the sacred relics of St Francis Xavier, a special access card will be issued to persons with disabilities. The access card will allow them to skip queues during the veneration of the relics between Nov 21 and Jan 5, 2025.“The Basilica of Bom Jesus and Se Cathedral will start issuing them very soon,” sources said.The guardians will have to submit the name and age of the person with disabilities (PwD), along with the dates and number of days for the special access card.“Even though the offices of the Basilica of Bom Jesus and Se Cathedral will be operational throughout the 45 days of the Exposition, it is advisable for guardians or relatives of PwD to register for the special access card prior to the person’s visit, instead of spot registration,” sources said, adding. “This will give us enough time to schedule the visit and ensure that persons with disabilities have a shorter wait time in case they require a wheelchair.”Wheelchairs are also being arranged to assist PwD at the venue. In addition, the organisers are also considering giving the guardians a car pass. This would enable them to have vehicle access beyond the designated car park meant for the general public.Currently, people will only be allowed to drive their vehicle until Bainguinim. The organisers are also contemplating stationing disability-friendly electric (EV) autorickshaws equipped with accessibility features at the designated car park.“This is still in the discussion and planning stage. We are yet to source enough e-autorickshaws. We want to make accessibility to the Exposition as easy as possible for PwD,” sources said.","The access card will allow them to skip queues during the veneration of the relics between Nov 21 and Jan 5, 2025.

What Gronk Was Saying About His Friend's Portrayal



Past Work Together



Acknowledge the Differences

A scene from the new FX show American Sports Story ,has been trending on social media, mainly for its comical approach to an impression of Robert Gronkowski . Fans and viewers are sharing the spot, proving how the series will really bring the people that take center stage to life, particularly in the sense that it does with Gronkowski.A few weeks ago, Gronkowski appeared on the “Up & Adams” show with Kay Adams and shared his thoughts on the actor who is playing him in the biopic, Laith Wallschleger .The tight end said that Wallschleger is a good friend of his and that they have known each other for some 14 years. ""It was certainly over the top,"" Gronkowski said. He added: ""Hey, fun fact? That's my good buddy Laith playing me there."". He totally really went all out, and I feel like it just fits the show perfectly, especially with the other characters like Coach Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft. It's exaggerated, but that's just how this show was produced. ""Also Read - How NFL Players Invest Gronkowski also shared that Wallschleger has been his double in the past because, as an example, he was his double in a commercial for FanDuel's Kick of Destiny. That means a collaboration in the past gives another level of bonding between them, which makes the impression even more special.Although Grönowski acknowledged the hard work that went into the impression, he jokingly noted some physical differences between himself and Wallschleger. ""He's shorter than me and not as jacked either,"" Gronkowski joked. ""But he's alright."" This light-hearted commentary shows some aspects of Gronkowski's personality and the ability to take things in stride further into ensuring his likability among fans.Overall, the clip shows not only the comedy of *American Sports Story* but is also a testament of amity and camaraderie, subsisting between Gronkowski and Wallschleger.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

National Coming Out Day: Los Angeles recognises October 11 as National Coming Out Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/los-angeles-recognises-october-11-as-national-coming-out-day/articleshow/114162099.cms,"Representative Image (Picture Credit: Reuters)

Los Angeles made a significant move by officially recognising October 11 as a National Coming Out Day , after Philadelphia in celebration of this important occasion.The date becomes significant as it commemorates the anniversary of the second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, which took place in 1987 amid the early days of the AIDS crisis, as quoted by ABC News.This day aims to foster a safe and inclusive environment for the LGBTQ+ community, where all individuals can openly express their true identities without any fear of judgment.The proclamation comes after anti-LGBTQ+ legislation is on the rise across the United States, with the ACLU reporting over 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced in state legislatures for the 2024 session.“Even in California, often viewed as a progressive state, we’re seeing concerning incidents of anti-gay and anti-trans rhetoric,” said Los Angeles City Council member Nithya Raman.“It’s vital that we create spaces where everyone feels safe and accepted,” she added.National Coming Out Day was founded in 1988 by activists Jean O'Leary and Robert Eichberg. Los Angeles has played a key role in the LGBTQ+ rights movement, notably with the opening of The Black Cat , a gay bar, in 1966. This happened during the time when same-sex relationships were still illegal in California.The bar became the site of a violent police raid on New Year's Eve that sparked protests against anti-LGBTQ+ violence and discrimination.Today, the Black Cat stands as a symbol of resilience and progress in the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ rights.","National Coming Out Day was founded in 1988 by activists Jean O'Leary and Robert Eichberg.

"Residents slog through flooded streets, clear debris after Hurricane Milton tore through Florida",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/residents-slog-through-flooded-streets-clear-debris-after-hurricane-milton-tore-through-florida/articleshow/114161893.cms,"Del Ockey, a seasonal Florida resident from Canada, walks near the damaged bridge from Hurricane Milton, that leads onto his property, Friday, October 11, 2024, in Riverview, Fla. (AP)

LITHIA: Florida residents slogged through flooded streets, gathered up scattered debris and assessed damage to their homes on Friday after Hurricane Milton smashed through coastal communities and spawned a barrage of deadly tornadoes.At least 10 people were dead, and rescuers were still saving people from swollen rivers, but many expressed relief that Milton wasn't worse.The hurricane spared densely populated Tampa a direct hit, and the lethal storm surge that scientists feared never materialized.Gov. Ron DeSantis warned people to not let down their guard, however, citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing water that could hide dangerous objects.""We're now in the period where you have fatalities that are preventable,"" DeSantis said. ""You have to make the proper decisions and know that there are hazards out there.""About 2.2 million customers remained without power in the state, according to poweroutage.us. St. Petersburg's 260,000 residents were told to boil water before drinking, cooking or brushing their teeth, until at least Monday.Also Friday, the owner of a major phosphate mine disclosed that pollution spilled into Tampa Bay during the hurricane.The Mosaic Company said in a statement that heavy rains from the storm overwhelmed a collection system at its Riverview site, pushing excess water out of a manhole and into discharges that lead to the bay. The company said the leak was fixed Thursday.Mosaic said the spill likely exceeded a 17,500-gallon minimum reporting standard, though it did not provide a figure for what the total volume might have been.Calls and emails to Mosaic seeking additional information about Riverview and the company's other Florida mines received no response, as did a voicemail left with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.The state has 25 such stacks containing more than 1 billion tons of phosphogypsum, a solid waste byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer mining industry that contains radium, which decays to form radon gas. Both radium and radon are radioactive and can cause cancer. Phosphogypsum may also contain toxic heavy metals and other carcinogens, such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and nickel.Florida's vital tourism industry has started to return to normal, meanwhile, as Walt Disney World and other theme parks reopened. The state's busiest airport, in Orlando, resumed full operations Friday.Arriving just two weeks after the devastating Hurricane Helene, Milton flooded barrier islands, tore the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays ' baseball stadium and toppled a construction crane.Crews from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office on Friday were assisting with rescues of people, including a 92-year-old woman, who were stranded in rising waters along the Alafia River. The river is 25 miles (40 kilometers) long and runs from eastern Hillsborough County, east of Tampa, into Tampa Bay.In Pinellas County, deputies used high-water vehicles to shuttle people back and forth to their homes in a flooded Palm Harbor neighborhood where waters continued to rise.Ashley Cabrera left with her 18- and 11-year-old sons and their three dogs, Eeyore, Poe and Molly. It was the first time since Milton struck that they had been able to leave the neighborhood, and they were now headed to a hotel in Orlando.""I'm extremely thankful that we could get out now and go for the weekend somewhere we can get a hot meal and some gas,"" Cabrera said. ""I thought we'd be able to get out as soon as the storm was over. These roads have never flooded like this in all the years that I've lived here.""Animals were being saved, too. Cindy Evers helped rescue a large pig stuck in high water at a strip mall in Lithia, east of Tampa. She had already rescued a donkey and several goats after the storm.""I'm high and dry where I'm at, and I have a barn and 9 acres,"" Evers said, adding that she will soon start to work to find the animals' owners.In the Gulf Coast city of Venice, Milton left behind several feet of sand in some beachfront condos, with one unit nearly filled. A swimming pool was packed full of sand, with only its handrails poking out.Some warnings were heeded and lessons learned. When 8 feet (2.4 meters) of seawater flooded Punta Gorda during Hurricane Helene last month, 121 people had to be rescued, Mayor Lynne Matthews said. Milton brought at least 5 feet (1.5 meters) of flooding, but rescuers only had to save three people.""So people listened to the evacuation order,"" Matthews said.Heaps of fruit were scattered across the ground and trees toppled over after both Milton and Hurricane Helene swept through Polk County and other orange-growing regions, Matt Joyner of trade group Florida Citrus Mutual said Friday.Milton arrived at the start of the orange growing season, so it is still too early to evaluate the full scope of the damage.Florida has already seen orange production diminish over the years, with the industry still recovering from hurricanes of years past while also waging an ongoing battle against a deadly greening disease. Milton could be the knockout punch for some growers, Joyce said.In the western coastal city of Clearwater, Kelvin Glenn said it took less than an hour early Thursday for water to rise to his waist inside his apartment. He and seven children, ranging in age from 3 to 16, were trapped in the brown, foul floodwaters for about three hours before an upstairs neighbor opened their home to them.Later that day, first responders arrived in boats to ferry them away from the building.""Sitting in that cold, nasty water was kind of bad,"" Glenn said.Short-term survival is now turning into long-term worries. A hotel is $160 a night. Everything inside Glenn's apartment is gone. And it can take time to get assistance.""I ain't going to say we're homeless,"" Glenn said. ""But we've got to start all over again.""The Federal Emergency Management Agency has enough money to deal with the immediate needs of people impacted by Helene and Milton but will need additional funding at some point, FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said Friday.The disaster assistance fund helps pay for the swift response to hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other disasters. Congress recently replenished the fund with $20 billion - the same amount as last year.","The owner of a major phosphate mine disclosed that pollution spilled into Tampa Bay during the hurricane.
