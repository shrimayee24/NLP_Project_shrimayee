"Pannun case: Russia backs India, questions lack of evidence by US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pannun-case-russia-backs-india-questions-lack-of-evidence-by-us/articleshow/109963886.cms,"with input from agency)

NEW DELHI: The Russian foreign ministry on Wednesday dismissed all allegations made by the US against India regarding a foiled assassination attempt plot involving pro-Khalistan radical Gurpatwant Singh Pannun . The Russian ministry said that Washington has not provided enough evidence to implicate Indian involvement in the case.""According to the information we have, Washington has not yet provided any reliable evidence of the involvement of Indian citizens in the preparation of the murder of a certain GS Pannun.Speculation on this topic in the absence of evidence is unacceptable,"" the official spokeswoman of the Russian foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova said at a briefing on Wednesday.The United States lacks an understanding of the national mentality and historical context of India's state development, showing disrespect towards India as a nation, she said.Zakharova's remarks came in response to a media query on Moscow's reaction to accusations against an Indian official of a foiled ""assassination' plot, and the American news publication .'""The Washington Post', it seems to me, should use the term ""repressive regime' and everything you quoted in relation to Washington. It is hard to think of a more repressive government than Washington, in both domestic and international matters. Now directly about your question,"" Zakharova said, according to the readout of the briefing released by the Russian foreign ministry.""Regular unfounded accusations by the United States against New Delhi (we see that they groundlessly accuse not only India but also many other states) of violating religious freedoms are a reflection of the United States' misunderstanding of the national mentality, the historical context of the development of the Indian state and disrespect for India as a state . I am sure that this also comes from the neocolonial mentality, the mentality of the colonial period, the period of the slave trade, and imperialism,"" she said.""This does not only apply to India. The reason is the desire to unbalance the internal political situation in India in order to complicate the general parliamentary elections taking place in the country. Of course, this is part of interference in India's internal affairs,"" she added.Gurpatwant Singh Pannun is identified as a terrorist designated by India, and he possesses citizenship from both America and Canada. In November, the US justice department revealed an indictment against an Indian individual for their suspected role in a thwarted plan to assassinate Pannun.Earlier, the external affairs ministry rejected a report in The Washington Post in April that named an Indian Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) official's involvement in an alleged plot to kill Khalist terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the US.Describing it as an ""unwarranted and unsubstantiated' imputation on a ""serious matter' that is under investigation, ministry of external affairs (MEA) official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said the US media report was ""speculative and irresponsible'.Jaiswal also responded to media inquiries regarding a report in the Washington Post, a US national daily. He mentioned that an Indian government-appointed High-Level Committee is currently investigating security issues raised by the US government concerning networks of organized criminals, terrorists, and other individuals.""The report in question makes unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations on a serious matter. Currently, there is an investigation being conducted by the High-Level Committee established by the Government of India to address the security issues raised by the US government regarding networks of organized criminals, terrorists, and other individuals. Speculative and irresponsible comments on it are not helpful.""The Washington Post report claimed that a RAW official named Vikram Yadav instructed Indian businessman Nikhil Gupta to hire a hitman to murder Pannun outside his residence in New York.Gupta is currently in custody in the Czech Republic and faces pending extradition to the US to stand trial in the case. According to the report in the US Daily, the operation targeting Pannun was approved by the then-RAW chief Samant Goel.The US justice department has claimed that an Indian government employee (referred to as CC-1), who was not named in the indictment submitted in a federal court in Manhattan, enlisted an Indian individual named Nikhil Gupta to engage a hitman for the purpose of executing the assassination, which was prevented by US authorities, as per prosecutors.Gupta has been accused of murder-for-hire, which can result in a maximum prison sentence of 10 years. Czech authorities apprehended and held Gupta on June 30, following the bilateral extradition agreement between the United States and the Czech Republic.Following this, MEA said that a case filed against an individual in a US court and allegedly linking him to an Indian official is a ""matter of concern' and is contrary to government policy.",The Russian foreign ministry dismissed all allegations made by the US against India regarding a foiled assassination attempt plot involving pro-Khalistan radical Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. The Russian ministry said that Washington has not provided enough evidence to implicate Indian involvement in the case.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109964203,imgsize-54468,width-400,resizemode-4/109964203.jpg"
"For this 125-member Odisha clan, irrigation, jobs & potable water are issues that matter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-this-125-member-odisha-clan-irrigation-jobs-potable-water-are-issues-that-matter/articleshow/109963619.cms,"The Srichandan family of Odisha’s Khordha district has 125 members. While many of the younger lot have moved out to the cities for better prospects, they return twice a year to their 36-bedroom village home. For the family that depends on agriculture, the elephant menace in the region, drinking water scarcity and lack of irrigation facilities are major issues, besides absence of jobs in the state

BHUBANESWAR: There are some polling booths in the country with a handful of voters and then there’s the Srichandan family , whose members can demand a booth in their village just for themselves.The Srichandans are a family of 125 in Gayabandh village in Khordha district of Odisha, 80 of whom are eligible to vote. They have been living together, in a joint family setup, for four generations and the bond is as strong as ever, despite many having left home in search of better-paying jobs in cities.The family has a sprawling house with 36 bedrooms. For lunch, 16 kg of rice and 4 kg dal are cooked every day. Most members still depend on agriculture.Come elections and the family gets together to discuss candidates and votes. There is no pressure on anyone though. Unemployment, drinking water problem, elephant menace and lack of irrigation facilities are some of the issues that keep them worried.“Politics has changed over the years, so have the issues affecting us. Even after getting professional degrees, our children go out of the state for jobs. This even as people from other states are being appointed here,” said Ratnakar Srichandan, who at 85 is the eldest member of the family.Till 2014, the family sup ported the Congress as one of them, Dillip Srichandan, was a legislator from Khordha between 1995 and 2000. However, he lost in the 2009 and 2014 elections. “To serve the country and its people, we do not always need to contest elections,” said Dilip, who has made planting trees his mission in life. In this, he gets support from the rest of the family.Senior members like Gopal Srichandan, 80, feel there should be a change in govt. For youngsters like Smruti Ranjan, 23, and Biswajeet, 19, a first-time voter, candidates must focus on local issues.“Elephant menace, drinking water scarcity and lack of irrigation facilities are major issues. A proposed Manibhadra dam over Mahanadi would have helped irrigate 500 villages in several districts, including Khordha, but is yet to be completed. In summer, vil lagers have to depend on tankers for drinking water. The tankers come once in three days,” rued Gopal.The Srichandans – belonging to the Paika community – depend on farming as a major source of income. They grow paddy, vegetables and pulses for their own consumption. Besides, cashew, mango, jackfruit and guava are grown in over 200 acres of farmland.Men, including elders, are engaged in farming. But with time, many of the younger lot have moved out for em ployment. The whole family assembles twice a year – during Holi in March and Dussehra in October. Then there are important social events like weddings when they come together.The family has a fund, made up of earnings from farming, that covers daily expenses. Those working outside contribute to this kitty too. “We believe in living a frugal life though the family is financially sound and debt-free. We also invest in the education and business ventures of the younger lot,” said Madhu Sudan Srichandan, a third-generation member.“If you have ever lived in a joint family, you will not want to move out,” said Madhu Sudan. “The family is a huge support system. Love, affection, cooperation and adjustment keep us together. There are differences and misunderstandings, of course, but those are manageable.”","The Srichandan family of Odisha’s Khordha district has 125 members.

India now world's 3rd largest solar power producer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-surpasses-japan-becomes-worlds-3rd-largest-solar-power-producer/articleshow/109945435.cms,"NEW DELHI: India surpassed Japan to claim the title of the world's third-largest solar power generator in 2023 as it has climbed from ninth ranking in 2015, according to a report from global energy think tank Ember.On Wednesday, the Global Electricity Review 2024 was published which offers a comprehensive examination of the global power landscape in 2023, drawing on data from individual countries.Accompanying this review is the world's inaugural open dataset on electricity generation in 2023, encompassing 80 nations that represent 92 percent of global electricity demand, along with historical data from 215 countries.""India's growth in solar generation in 2023 pushed the country past Japan to become the world's third-largest solar power generator. It has climbed from ranking ninth in 2015,"" the report said.In 2023, solar energy achieved a milestone as it contributed 5.5 percent to global production and India alone generated 5.8 percent of its electricity from solar energy.India experienced the world's fourth-largest surge in solar generation in 2023, adding 18 Terawatt hours (TWh) to its capacity, following China (+156 TWh), the United States (+33 TWh), and Brazil (+22 TWh). These top four countries collectively accounted for 75 percent of global solar growth that year.""A renewables-powered future is now becoming a reality. Solar power, in particular, is growing at an unprecedented pace"", said Aditya Lolla, Ember's Asia Programme Director.For the nineteenth consecutive year, solar maintained its status as the fastest-growing electricity source worldwide, outpacing coal in new electricity additions by more than twofold in 2023.The trajectory of solar energy has been accelerating rapidly. Global solar generation in 2023 exceeded six times that of 2015, with India experiencing a seventeen-fold increase during the same period. India's share of solar generation surged from 0.5 percent in 2015 to 5.8 percent in 2023.Pathways toward decarbonizing electricity underscore the pivotal role solar energy will play in shaping the future energy landscape.According to the IEA Net Zero Emissions scenario, solar energy's contribution is projected to rise to 22 percent of global electricity generation by 2030. The aim of tripling global renewables capacity by 2030, as agreed upon at COP28, holds promise in advancing this trajectory.India stands among the select few nations committed to tripling renewable capacity by 2030. Ember's analysis suggests that India will need to significantly ramp up annual capacity additions to meet this ambitious target.""Increasing clean electricity isn't just for reducing carbon emissions in the power sector. It's also needed to meet the rising electricity demand in an increasingly electrified economy and decoupling economic growth from emissions, which is crucial for tackling climate change "", Aditya Lolla concluded.(With inputs from ANI)",India surpassed Japan to claim the title of the world's third-largest solar power generator in 2023. India alone generated 5.8 percent of its electricity from solar energy. Solar energy's contribution is projected to rise to 22 percent of global electricity generation by 2030.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109946265,imgsize-78682,width-400,resizemode-4/109946265.jpg"

MUMBAI: India is the origin of the largest number of international migrants – around 18 million, with large diasporas living in UAE, US and Saudi Arabia. It continued its march as the top country receiving remittances , but 2022 was spectacular with the figure crossing the $100 mark.According to the World Migration Report, 2024, released in Dhaka today, by UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM): ""In 2022, India, Mexico, and China were the top three remittance recipient countries, followed by the Philippines, France and Pakistan.""In 2022, India received $111 billion, the first country to reach and even surpass the $100 bn mark.In 2020, it had received $83 billion.Mexico, with inward remittances of $61 billion was the second-largest recipient in 2022, in the previous year it had replaced China to occupy the second spot and continued to hold sway.China’s inward remittances in 2022 were $51 billion. The contraction of remittance flows to China and its slipping to third spot has been attributed to multiple factors, including demographic shifts that have resulted in the shrinking of the working age population and the country’s zero-COVID policy, which prevented people from travelling abroad for work. During 2022, India’s other neighboring countries Pakistan (rank 6) saw an inflow of nearly $30 billion and Bangladesh (rank 8) received $21 billion.The report points out that international remittances have recovered from the dip in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Migrants sent an estimated $831 billion in international remittances globally in 2022, an increase from $791 billion in 2021 and significantly more than $717 billion in 2020.In 1970, there were just 84 million international migrants, which translated to 2.3% of the world’s population. In mid-2020 (which is the latest available data) nearly 280 million people lived in a country other than their country of birth, constituting 3.6% of the world’s population.The size of a migration corridor from ‘country A’ to ‘country B’ is measured as the number of people born in ‘country A’ who were residing in ‘country B’ at the time of the estimate. The Mexico to United States corridor is the largest in the world at nearly 11 million people. This is followed by the Syrian Arab Republic to Türkiye, and Russian to Ukraine corridors attributed largely to displacement of people owing to civil unrest and invasions.The India-UAE corridor is the fourth largest. An interactive map released by IOM shows that there were 3.47 million Indians in the UAE, followed by 2.7 million in the US (which was the sixth largest international migration corridor) and 2.5 million in Saudi Arabia (which occupied ninth position).The report does not separately reflect the top source countries of inward remittances to India, but understandably it would be from the top diaspora countries. Incidentally, the US and Saudi Arabia were the top two countries in the list of those sending remittances overseas. During 2022, $79 billion and $39 billion flowed from the US and Saudi Arabia to other countries.Net migration is the difference between the inflow of migrants into the country as opposed to those who migrate from the country overseas.For ten countries, the estimated net outflow of migrants exceeded one million over the period from 2010 through 2021. In many of these countries, the outflows were due to temporary labor movements, such as for Pakistan (net flow of −16.5 million), India (−3.5 million), Bangladesh (−2.9 million), Nepal (−1.6 million) and Sri Lanka (−1.0 million).Interestingly, India, which had the largest diaspora of nearly 18 million (1.3% of the global population) occupied the thirteen rank as a destination country, hosting 4.48 million migrants (0.3% of the global population).Countries in Asia are the origins of the largest number of internationally mobile students in the world. In 2021, more than 1 million internationally mobile students were from China, by far the highest number globally and more than double the number of students from India, which ranks second (around 508,000). The US is the largest destination country for internationally mobile students in the world (more than 833,000), followed by the UK (nearly 601,000), and Australia (around 378,000).","In 2022, India received $111 billion, the first country to reach and even surpass the $100 bn mark.

How young grads are helping craft poll narratives of veterans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-young-grads-are-helping-craft-poll-narratives-of-veterans/articleshow/109963028.cms,"MUMBAI: Talk of a paradigm shift in politics is often blah but young interns in campaign backrooms are part of just that. You won’t see them at rallies or on TV screens though. These are grads hired in large numbers by consulting firms specialising in communication and public relations, and well entrenched in the political space.Until 2014, poll strategies were devised through a process of trial and error based on public opinion.“But it’s a thing of the past now. After BJP’s 2014 win, they (politicians) started understanding the need for professionals who can gather and analyse data to be put to use,”said an employee of a top consulting firm.Months ahead of an election, political consulting firms deploy teams to interact with voters and seek their opinion on issues ranging from economic concerns to welfare benefits. This understanding of on-ground sentiment then feeds into campaign strategy. The firms also provide support in other areas such as managing media and communication, handling logistics and research and data analysis.A Nation with NaMo (NwN) employee told TOI that in the run-up to polls, NwN teams were split into campaign war rooms (CWRs), political war rooms (PWRs), and under the category governance, policy and intelligence (GPI). “CWRs have a client-facing role. They design campaigns for the client… provide them with a hundred solutions. It is up to them to implement which ones, if any,” he said. GPI, on the other hand, analyses data and handles preparation of manifestos.PWRs comprising field workers form the largest group. “For Rajasthan assembly’s 200 seats, some 80 people were working on ground to collect data. Just speaking to 10 people on an average every day, we were able to get 800 responses in a day and as many as 24,000 in a month,” he added.Given the extent of work, hiring, too, is on a large scale. Most of them are freshers looking for a break and they could be from B-schools, NLUs, or even IITs. But most of them are hired on a contractual basis and once elections are over, the CWRs and PWRs are dissolved. In NwN, there are two kinds of hires — short-term members (STMs) onboarded on a contractual basis and full-term members (FTMs), who are permanent employees hired as part of a Graduate Impact Leadership Programme (GILP). The FTM cohort is given extensive training. For those on contract, “they are directly thrown at the deep end”. Those hired for both categories are paid competitively, but STMs are not eligible for benefits, bonuses, and even the chances of them transitioning to an FTM are slim-to-none.An engineering graduate said, “NwN had stepped up hiring in the run-up to the polls and visited my campus. But they were large ly looking for people for the short term. Though a more permanent role would have been preferable, they had an interesting job description that got me to apply. The job market also hasn’t been the best, so you take what you get.”The pay offered is a deciding factor for many. Among his peers, the employee added, the average package on campus was Rs 9 lakh per annum. NwN was offering as much as Rs 18 lakh for a full-time role. Consulting firms I-PAC, Varahe Analytics, Inclusive minds, and ShowTime Consulting did not respond till the time of going to press, but their policies on staffing and pay may not differ much.The placement cell of Hindu College in Delhi told TOI that political consultancies have been hiring more aggressively, especially for summer interns. “But a key reason why students’ applications have shot up is not because of an interest in politics… it’s due to the lack of opportunities compared to other domains.”A former staff with Varahe Analytics said the average employee age in the industry is between 24 and 27 years, and a significant portion of hiring is via campus placements. “Young professionals are more efficient, driven, and can take the long hours,” he added. Another benefit with a younger cohort is they are largely party-agnostic. Though not a requirement, it plays to the analysts’ benefit when clients or roles change.Aakansha Patodia, an ex-consultant with a leading political consultancy, said youngsters are also chosen as they don’t have a hectic personal life. From the candidate’s viewpoint, Patodia believes motivations are two-fold. “The competitive pay, of course, is a determinant. But it’s also the impact you create.”Many, however, have only a brief stint in the field. This is partly because of how these places are run. “The environment is semicorporate at best. Work is hectic and can come up in the middle of the night also… you have to get it done,” said an industry insider.","Political consulting firms deploy teams to interact with voters and seek their opinion. This understanding of on-ground sentiment then feeds into campaign strategy. Most of them are freshers looking for a break and could be from B-schools, NLUs, or even IITs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109963263,imgsize-839447,width-400,resizemode-4/109963263.jpg"
Why Andhra education barons are joining poll class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-andhra-education-barons-are-joining-poll-class/articleshow/109963027.cms,"On the face of it, these mundane headlines, that appeared over the past couple of years, may seem to have nothing to do with the ongoing Lok Sabha elections . But they do.In Andhra Pradesh, where clearing a competitive exam is seen as the only gateway to success and almost every second student appears for JEE or NEET, these headlines reflect the growing influence, both financial and political, of the founders of the various educational institutions .As more Andhra students clear entrance tests, owners of institutions that train them add more political heft for themselves.Although some of them have always been part of political parties , their numbers are growing every year. Information gleaned from election affidavits list hundreds of crores in assets for each educationalist contesting the elections. Also, safeguarding the interests of their institutions often aligns them closely with parties. A college chain donated Rs 5 crore in elec toral bonds to a leading party in Andhra even though very few educational institutions donated through bonds elsewhere in the country.These candidates contesting across different LS and assembly seats include prominent individuals such as Narayana educational institutions’ founder Ponguru Narayana, Vignan University vicechairman Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu, Gitam deemedto-be-university president and Kautilya School of Public Policy founder M Sribharat, Avanthi educational institutions founder M Srinivasa Rao, and Sri Balaji Educational Society director Palle Sindhura Reddy.Additionally, Andhra Pradesh education minister Botcha Satyanarayana, who runs the Satya Institute of Technology and Management, and Pemmasani Chandrasekhar, founder of US edtech company UWorld, have also announced their candidacies.Take Ponguru Narayana of Narayana educational institutions, known for churning out JEE and NEET rankers. He is contesting in Nellore city assembly constituency on a TDP ticket. As the former minister for municipal administration and urban development from 2014 to 2019, he played a key role in the planning and design of Amaravati, the capital of bifurcated Andhra. Starting with a modest coaching centre serving just seven students, his organisation has now expanded to operate in 23 states. He declared assets worth about Rs 800 crore.State education minister Botcha Satyanarayana is contesting as an MLA candidate from Cheepurupalli. His wife Botcha Jhansi Lakshmi, who serves as Satya Institute’s correspondent, is YSRCP’s pick from the Vizag LS constituency.TDP has fielded another academic leader, M Sribharat, for the Vizag LS seat. Following the death of his grandfather, M V V S Murthi, a former MP and MLC, in a road crash in the USA in 2018, Sribharat ventured into politics. He narrowly lost in 2019 from the Vizag LS segment by 4,000 votes.Asked about how he balances politics and academic affairs, the Stanford alumnus said that his priority was serving and interacting with the public. “The university is managed by experts such as the vice-chancellor, pro VCs, registrar, and deans. They diligently follow the university’s vision plan. I often leverage technology to virtually interact with the university leadership,” Sribharat told TOI.Pemmasani Chandrasekhar, TDP candidate for the Guntur LS seat, recently hogged the spotlight by declaring assets worth Rs 5,705 crore — the highest in these LS elections. His pioneering online education enterprise, UWorld, is widely utilised by students preparing for high-stakes examinations such as SAT, ACT and USMLE.According to H Lajipathi Rai, former VC of Dr B R Ambedkar University, parties often prioritise educationalists who possess a combination of educational expertise and political family background. “These candidates are favoured because they are better equipped to understand complex issues and engage in meaningful deliberations in Parliament,” he said.Former minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao, also known as ‘Avanthi’ Srinivasa Rao due to his association with the Avanthi Group of institutions, is contesting against former HRD minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao as the YSRCP candidate from the Bheemili assembly seat. Avanthi began with a computer training institute and has since expanded to establish a network of management and engineering colleges across north coastal Andhra.V Hari Babu, a faculty member of political science at Andhra University, said founders of academic institutions are increasingly getting into politics. “Their expertise has the potential to contribute to the legislative processes, potentially resulting in more effective and progressive laws. However, political dynamics may differ significantly from academic settings. These leaders may face challenges in navigating the complexities of politics, especially in their formative political years,” he said.Narasaraopet MP and TDP LS candidate, Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu, introduced the highest number of private member’s bills (seven) from Andhra in the 17th Lok Sabha.Lokam Madhavi, the BJP-TDPJana Sena alliance candidate for the Nellimarla assembly constituency, serves as vice-president of the Miracle Educational Society. With extensive experience in the IT industry, Madhavi has declared assets worth nearly Rs 900 crore. Her expertise is expected to be valuable in shaping policies.“While the Constitution doesn’t prohibit non-literates from contesting, having academic leaders serving as MLAs or MPs can benefit society. However, it is important to involve them in manifesto writing and policy formulation,” added Lajipathi Rai.","In Andhra Pradesh, where clearing a competitive exam is seen as the only gateway to success, almost every second student appears for JEE or NEET.

"267 years on, Mir Jafar’s progeny struggle to erase ‘traitor’ taint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/267-years-on-mir-jafars-progeny-struggle-to-erase-traitor-taint/articleshow/109963026.cms,"Lalbagh (Murshidabad) :

In Bengal’s political discourse, Mir Jafar ’s name has long been used as a synonym for ‘gaddar’ ( traitor ). Even 267 years after the decisive battle that brought Bengal under British control, the legacy runs so deep that Mir Jafar’s present-day heirs want to distance themselves from their forefather’s treachery.It was in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 that Mir Jafar, one of the most trusted generals of Bengal nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah, defected to the British side, leading to the victory of the East India Company.TOI travelled to Mir Jafar’s birthplace to learn more about the legacy of deceit that continues to cast a shadow on the present. At Quila Nizamat, in Murshidabad, TOI met the 14th great-grandson of Mir Jafar, Syed Reza Ali Meerza, who lives a humble life and refers repeatedly to how the slur stubbornly haunts his family. His drawingcum-bedroom wall adorns portraits of all his ancestors, even nawab Siraj-udDaula, but not Mir Jafar.“I don’t want abuse from my guests,” he said candidly. In his early 80s, Meerza, known as Chhote Nawab, is agile and amiable despite a monumental decline in the family’s prestige and prosperity. He now rides a bicycle but vividly remembers going to school on a royal elephant.Wasn’t he disgusted with Mir Jafar’s being so widely used in elections to describe a political traitor? “What to do? I cannot alter the course of history associated with my 14th greatgrandfather’s name, nor can I change the popular coinage. Even though Mir Jafar was not part of the original conspiracy hatched by Ghaseti Begum, Jagat Seth, the company’s Qasimbazar chief William Watts. and Robert Clive at Sang-i-Dalan, Motijheel,” he said, feebly trying to defend his ancestor.Chhote Nawab’s son, Fahim Meerza, is a primary school teacher and the Trinamool councillor of ward 10 in the TMC-run Lalbagh Municipality. “My great-greatgrandfather Wasif Ali Meerza, who was educated at Sherborne School, Rugby School and Trinity College, largely redeemed the notoriety earned by Mir Jafar,” Fahim said.“On August 15, 1947, the Radcliffe Award allotted the district of Murshidabad to Pakistan, and the flag of Pakistan was hoisted at the Hazarduari Palace here. But within two days, because of Wasif Ali Meerza’s intervention, two dominions were exchanged.

Caste and poverty can’t be used to brand one as bad character: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-cant-carry-raj-era-bias-to-tag-castes-tribes-history-sheeters/articleshow/109961239.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court ruled that police cannot carry colonial era biases against persons belonging certain tribes and scheduled castes to mechanically brand them in their records as ‘bad characters’ or ‘history sheeters” and said such archaic mindset violated individuals’ right to dignity guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.After nudging the Delhi Police to amend the format for history sheeters, which was copied from 90-year-old Punjab Police Rules of 1934, to exclude the minor children and wife of a person from getting included with him as a bad character, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and K V Vishwanathan on Tuesday asked all states to revisit their rules within six months regarding inclusion of a person in police’s ‘history sheeter/bad character’ record and weed out colonial era biases from relevant provisions.After deciding the case from Delhi, the bench resorted to its suo motu jurisdiction and examined the desirability of ensuring that no mechanical entries in ‘history sheet’ are made of innocent individuals, simply because they hail from socially, economically and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds, along with those belonging to backward communities, SCs and STs.Referring to certain studies on this aspect and without going into their authenticity, Justice Kant-led bench said these reveal a pattern of an unfair, prejudicial and atrocious mindset as they allege that police diaries are maintained selectively of individuals belonging to vimukta jatis (denotified tribes that were listed originally under Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, as criminal tribes because of their alleged addition to committing crimes) reflecting biases of colonial times.Writing the judgment, Justice Kant said, “All state governments are expected to take necessary preventive measures to safeguard such communities from being subjected to inexcusable targeting or prejudicial treatment. We must bear in mind that these preconceived notions often render them ‘invisible victims’ due to prevailing stereotypes associated with their communities, which may often impede their right to live a life with self-respect.”“Value for human dignity and life is deeply embedded in Article 21. The expression ‘life’ unequivocally includes the right to live a life worthy of human honour and all that goes along with it. Self-regard, social image, and an honest space for oneself in one’s surrounding society, are just as significant to a dignified life as are adequate food, clothing, and shelter,” he said.Referring to the court-nudged amendments to the Delhi Police rules on history sheeter/bad character, the bench said 'Delhi Model' would serve as a critical tool for states to weed out biases against certain tribes, castes and communities while preparing the internal record of history sheeters.It directed the states and UTs to “revisit their policy-regime and consider whether suitable amendments on the pattern of the Delhi Model” and asked the SC registry to send copies of the judgment to chief secretaries and DGPs for compliance within six months.","Justices Surya Kant and K V Vishwanathan asked all states to revisit their rules within six months regarding inclusion of a person in police’s ‘history sheeter/bad character’ record.

Putting forward the stand of the state govt that the central agency could not conduct a probe within its jurisdiction without its consent, Sibal said that it would destroy the federal structure if Centre forced its way into the state and conducted a probe.“Centre has no jurisdiction to allow its investigating agency to come in my state against my consent. Such an act is unconstitutional. It would be an encroachment on the rights and jurisdiction of the state and its police. It would be constitutional overreach and exceeding of jurisdiction and would destroy the federal structure of the country,” Sibal said. The lawyer referred to various sections of Delhi Special Police Establishment Act to make a point that Centre controls CBI but clarified that role of Centre is only upto the registration of case but not investigation and probe was not influenced by it. Reading Section 4 of the Act, he said the superintendence of the Delhi Special Police Establishment in so far as it relates to investigation of offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act shall vest in Central Vigilance Commission but the superintendence in all other matters shall vest in the central govt. He said section 5 empowers Centre to extend the powers and jurisdiction of CBI to any area .SG Tushar Mehta reiterated that original suit filed by the state under Article 131 of Constitution against it to not allow CBI probe was not maintainable and is an abuse of legal process. He said that article 131 could be invoked only in case of inter-governments dispute and the grievance of the state in this case was against the CBI and not the Union. The court reserved its order on maintainability of suit and said that it would deliver the verdict after summer vacation.The Centre had submitted that the suit was inherently not maintainable at all. “The Union and the DoPT have nothing to do with registration of cases by CBI, probe and prosecution of a case. We do not have administrative and supervisory power over. I cannot supervise and tell the agency on registration of cases or how to investigate or whether to file closure reports or chargesheet. It is a separate statutory entity, supervised by another statutory body CVC,” Mehta had submitted, adding that CBI is not a limb of the govt.",West Bengal govt told Supreme Court that Delhi Special Police Establishment Act specifically says that its superintendence shall vest in the central govt in all cases except those related to corruption.

Money saved through zero or low-interest loans taxable: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/money-saved-through-zero-or-low-interest-loans-taxable-sc/articleshow/109959409.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a setback to the employees of public sector banks , the Supreme Court has ruled that the money saved by through availing interest free or low-interest loans from their employer would be liable to income tax as it upheld the validity of Section 17(2)(viii) of Income Tax Act and 3(7)(i) of IT Rules.A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta gave this ruling on Tuesday while dismissing petitions by All India Bank Officers’ Confederation and a batch of appeals filed by staff unions and officers’ associations of various banks, who had challenged the validity of the provisions of IT Act and its rules allowing levying of tax on money saved through interest-free or low-interest loans advanced to bank employees.“The benefit enjoyed by bank employees from interest-free loans or loans at a concessional rate is a unique benefit/advantage enjoyed by them. It is in the nature of a ‘perquisite’, and hence is liable to taxation,” the bench said.As per the Rule, when a bank employee avails a zero-interest or concessional loan, the amount he saved annually when compared to the amount paid by an ordinary person by taking a loan of same amount from State Bank of India that attracts market rate of interest, would be liable for income tax.Writing the judgment, Justice Khanna said the value of interest-free or concessional loans is to be treated as ‘other fringe benefit or amenity’ for being taxed as perquisite. “The employer’s grant of interest-free loans or loans at a concessional rate will certainly qualify as a ‘fringe benefit’ and ‘perquisite’, as understood through its natural usage in common parlance,” he said.“Perquisite is a fringe benefit attached to the post held by the employee unlike ‘profit in lieu of salary’, which is a reward or recompense for past or future service. It is incidental to employment and in excess of or in addition to the salary. It is an advantage or benefit given because of employment, which otherwise would not be available,” the bench said.“We are of the opinion that the enactment of subordinate legislation for levying tax on interest free/concessional loans as a fringe benefit is within the rulemaking power under Section 17(2)(viii) of the Act. Section 17(2)(viii) itself, and the enactment of Rule 3(7)(i) is not a case of excessive delegation and falls within the parameters of permissible delegation,” it said.“Section 17(2) clearly delineates the legislative policy and lays down standards for the rule-making authority. Accordingly, Rule 3(7)(i) is intra vires Section 17(2)(viii) of the Act,” the SC said.Justices Khanna and Datta said, “Rule 3(7)(i) posits SBI’s rate of interest, that is the PLR, as the benchmark to determine the value of benefit to the assessee in comparison to the rate of interest charged by other individual banks. Fixation of SBI’s rate of interest as benchmark is neither an arbitrary nor unequal exercise of power.”",The Supreme Court has ruled that the money saved by through availing interest free or low-interest loans from their employer would be liable to income tax.

HYDERABAD: After a 13-year hiatus, city-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) has revised its 'Dietary Guidelines for Indians', considering new scientific findings, lifestyle changes, diseases, and food habits. It advised Indians to restrict intake of sugar to 20-25 grams a day (a teaspoon is roughly 5.7g) since it comes from natural carbohydrates, avoid protein supplements and reduce oils.It also gave a thumbs-up for air-frying and granite-coated cookware.NIN also for the first time released guidelines for interpreting packaged food labels.ICMR director-general Dr Rajiv Bahl released the revised guidelines on Wednesday.One of the key suggestions is to decrease the use of cooking oil and obtain essential fatty acids through nuts, oilseeds, and seafood. Guidelines on ultra-processed foods were also provided.Dietary guidelines revised by National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) after a hiatus of 13 years said protein supplements are best avoided as the benefits are not commensurate with risks. Protein powders are made from eggs, dairy milk, or plant sources such as soybeans, peas, and rice. ""Protein powders may also contain added sugars, non-caloric sweeteners, and additives such as artificial flavouring, hence, are not advisable for regular consumption. Proteins rich in branched-chain amino acids may increase the risk of non-communicable diseases. Consuming high levels of protein is therefore not advisable,"" NIN said.Research findings indicate dietary protein supplementation is associated with only a small increase in muscle strength and size during prolonged resistance exercise training (RET) in healthy adults. Protein intake levels greater than 1.6g/kg body weight/day do not contribute further to RET-induced gains.""A significant proportion of children suffer from impaired nutritional status. Concurrently, there is a rising prevalence of overweight and obesity, creating a dual burden of malnutrition where both under-nutrition and obesity coexist within the same communities and households.

Spurt in post-Covid measles cases reveals big gaps in vaccination,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spurt-in-post-covid-measles-cases-reveals-big-gaps-in-vaccination/articleshow/109959350.cms,"More than one in nine eligible children nationally did not receive any dose of the measles vaccine in the 2019-21 period and nearly 30% received just one dose. This worrying fact came to light after frequent outbreaks of measles post-Covid prompted researchers from the health ministry's immunization division, Banaras Hindu University and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to take a closer look at vaccination data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5).In some districts in Uttar Pradesh, with high number of births, prevalence of zero-dose children was as high as 34.2% in Prayagraj and 32.2% in Hapur.In almost all northeastern states, zero-dose prevalence was roughly 25%.In a paper published in the journal Vaccine, the researchers investigated dose-wise measles vaccination coverage and explored gaps in immunization focusing on zero-dose, one-dose, and two-dose coverage among children aged 24-35 months. The study analysed information from 43,864 children taking into account socio-demographic variables such as birth order, wealth quintile, gender, social group, religion, residence, mother education, delivery-related factors, and media exposure.The study noted that a significant percentage of children receiving zero doses signalled a concerning gap in immunization coverage . The analysis showed considerable variations between states and districts in zero-dose prevalence. Even within a state, there were significant differences at the district level. For instance, in Arunachal Pradesh, West Siang district had the highest prevalence of children classified as zero-dose cases, 49.6%, while Lower Dibang Valley district had 2.8%. Another major cluster region was in UP where Prayagraj and Banda districts had 34.2% and 32.2% respectively, while in Hapur and Etawah 2.6% and 2.1% were zero-dose children.The analysis found children with higher birth orders and those from the poorest wealth quintile exhibited a higher percentage of zero doses. Mothers with lower levels of education showed increased odds of having zero-dose measles children. Additionally, mothers with limited media exposure demonstrated a higher probability of their children having a zero-dose status for measles.""Measles outbreak is considered an early warning sign for immunization programmes and can be effectively used as a signal for tracing missed and dropout children and overall systems strengthening. It is an ideal tracer as measles outbreaks visibly signal clusters with suboptimal immunization service delivery and can drive prioritisation of targeted interventions to improve programme performance and advocacy,"" stated the paper. Measles outbreaks were reported in 2022 from several districts of Maharashtra, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala and Delhi, and measles-related deaths were also recorded subsequently.With humans being the only reservoir for the measles virus and no documented evidence of asymptomatic carriers, it is believed it can be eliminated. In 2017, India adopted the 'National Strategic Plan for Achieving and Sustaining Measles and Rubella Elimination'. In Sept 2022, India adopted a roadmap for eliminating measles and rubella. There is an urgency to reach at least 95% coverage for both doses of measles vaccine as unvaccinated (zero-dose) children ""pose an immediate health risk, amplify disease transmission, and act as a barrier to the measles elimination goal"".""With consistent efforts, the country aims to catch up on the immunization gaps and vaccinate dropped-out and left-out children this year through Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) 5.0 campaigns. So far six phases of Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) have been conducted from 2017 to 2022 with a focus on measles rubella (MR) elimination vaccinating approximately 1.9 million children,"" stated the paper.","More than one in nine eligible children nationally did not receive any dose of the measles vaccine in the 2019-21 period.

NEW DELHI: AstraZeneca on Tuesday announced that it has started the global withdrawal of its Covid-19 vaccine, days after the UK pharmaceutical company admitted that its vaccine has the potential to cause a rare side effect called Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome ( TTS ).The company said the withdrawal was due to a ""surplus of available updated vaccines"" since the pandemic.According to media reports, the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker had previously admitted in court documents that the vaccine causes side effects such as blood clots and low blood platelet counts.The company also said its decision to remove the vaccine Vaxzevria 's marketing authorizations within Europe, noting that this oversupply has resulted in a decrease in demand for Vaxzevria, which is no longer being produced or distributed.""As multiple, variant Covid-19 vaccines have since been developed there is a surplus of available updated vaccines,"" the company said, adding that this had led to a decline in demand for Vaxzevria, which is no longer being manufactured or supplied.AstraZeneca which collaborated with the University of Oxford to create the vaccine is currently dealing with a lawsuit that claims their vaccine has caused deaths and severe harm to those who received it.The UK-based pharma company also collaborated with the Serum Institute of India (SII), the largest vaccine producer globally, to provide the vaccine (Covishield) to the Indian government.The Telegraph, which initially reported the news, said that AstraZeneca's application to withdraw the vaccine was submitted on March 5 and became effective on May 7.Previous year, Jamie Scott, a father of two, took legal action after suffering from a blood clot that left him unable to work. Scott said that he developed a “blood clot and a bleed on his brain”, leaving him with a lasting brain injury following his vaccination in April 2021.According to The Telegraph, Scott’s wife Kate said, ""The medical world has acknowledged for a long time that vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT) was caused by the vaccine.""However, in May 2023, the company informed Scott's lawyers that they do not acknowledge that TTS is induced by the vaccine on a general level.Later in the legal document submitted to the high court, the multinational pharmaceutical company said, ""It is admitted that the AZ vaccine can, in very rare cases, cause TTS. The causal mechanism is not known.""“Our sympathy goes out to anyone who has lost loved ones or reported health problems. Patient safety is our highest priority, and regulatory authorities have clear and stringent standards to ensure the safe use of all medicines, including vaccines,” AstraZeneca said in a statement.“From the body of evidence in clinical trials and real-world data, the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine has continuously been shown to have an acceptable safety profile and regulators around the world consistently state that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of extremely rare potential side effects,” it noted.As per the report, fifty-one cases have been filed in the High Court, with affected individuals and their families pursuing compensation amounting to an estimated £100 million.","AstraZeneca has started the global withdrawal of its Covid-19 vaccine.

Simpl layoffs

in 2023

Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) fintech company Simpl has reportedly laid off approximately 160-170 employees across various departments.

This includes core operations, interns, and call center agents. The company's D2C checkout vertical was also affected.A source reportedly told Moneycontrol that the company held a brief town hall on May 8. ""Founder and CEO Nityanand Sharma had a brief all-hands townhall with employees today at 9 am. It seemed he was reading out of a prepared script.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall flew a fighter jet on Friday that was piloted by AI over the deserts in California, as reported by Fox news.Last month, Kendall announced his intention to pilot an AI-controlled F-16 to the US Senate appropriations committee’s defense panel, discussing the future of air warfare relying on autonomously operated drones.On Friday, the senior Air Force leader carried out his plans, achieving what might be one of the most significant advancements in military aviation since the introduction of stealth planes in the early 1990s.According to Fox news, the US Air Force plans to have more than 1,000 AI-flown planes in commission, with the first in operation by 2028Kendall traveled to Edwards Air Force base, which is the same desert facility where Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier, to observe and participate in AI flight in real time.""It’s a security risk not to have it. At this point, we have to have it,"" the secretary said.The F-16, controlled by artificial intelligence and named Vista, flew Kendall in maneuvers that reached speeds exceeding 550 mph, exerting a pressure on his body equivalent to nearly five times the force of gravity.A human-piloted F-16 was flying alongside Vista and Kendall. The two jets raced within 1,000 feet of each other, performing twists and loops in an attempt to make their opponent surrender.He said that he had seen sufficient evidence to have faith in the AI technology when determining whether to use weapons in a war.Kendall said that human oversight will always be involved in the consideration of weapons.The US Air Force plans to have a fleet of more than 1,000 AI-operated drones, with the first one expected to be operational by 2028.In March, the Pentagon announced its plans to develop new artificial intelligence-guided planes. It offered two contracts to several private companies for them to compete against each other to win.The CCA project, known as the Collaborative Combat Aircraft project, is a component of a program worth $6 billion.The companies that are competing for the contract are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, General Atomics, and Anduril Industries.The Pentagon is interested in pursuing the project because cost-cutting is one of the elements of AI that appeals to them.In August 2023, deputy secretary of fefense Kathleen Hicks said deploying AI-enabled autonomous vehicles would provide ""small, smart, cheap and many' expendable units to the US military, helping overhaul the ""too-slow shift of US military innovation.""","US Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall flew a fighter jet on Friday that was piloted by AI over the deserts in California.

Moreover, the firm also has significant sales of internet and phones in rural parts of the US. These networks interest intelligence agencies due to the data they carry.The Washington Post reported that US experts on the matter fear that these devices may be more susceptible to infiltration by Chinese intelligence agencies. And the report further claims that, despite years of US efforts to stymie its advance, Huawei was still the world's No. 1 company in 2023 in terms of the number of patent applications filed. It is also still the world's top seller of the pipes that make up internet and phone networks, and remains a major player in consumer gadgets like smartphones.Separately on Tuesday, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) announced USD 420 million in grants for companies from the United States and ally nations to build phone network gear that can compete against Huawei's. The NTIA included a requirement for grant recipients to pair up with a network operator to help ensure their products can secure a major buyer when they go to market, according to the report.The initial bans and sanctions on Huawei were introduced under the Trump administration, as US vendors were allowed to make sales, which at that time had forced the company to switch to China-based manufacturers for their demand.

Star witness

Mistrial request

Salacious details

Cross-examination

Donald Trump ’s intimate moments with an adult film star spilled out into open court on Tuesday as Stormy Daniels described her alleged affair with the former president in a highly-anticipated moment of his hush-money trial.The testimony everybody was waiting for arrived Tuesday morning in Manhattan as Daniels took the stand to tell her story of a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.“He was wearing silk or satin pajamas that I immediately made fun of,” Daniels said as a prosecutor questioned her about the encounter. “‘Does Hugh Hefner know you stole his pajamas?’” she recalled asking Trump.Her vivid and often graphic testimony included fresh details on a story that has been pored over for years. The scene injected a tabloid-ready moment into the trial, with the adult-film actress confronting the former president before a jury of New Yorkers who will determine his fate.During a break, Judge Juan Merchan privately warned Trump’s lawyer that the ex-president could be heard uttering vulgarities during the testimony, which the judge said he would not tolerate. The day before, Merchan had threatened to jail Trump for continuing to violate a gag order barring him from publicly discussing potential witnesses.“I understand that your client is upset at this point, but he is cursing audibly, and he is shaking his head visually and that’s contemptuous,” Merchan told attorney Todd Blanche, according to a transcript. “It has the potential to intimidate the witness and the jury can see that.”The private and potentially embarrassing details about the night they met — including her mocking of Trump’s silk pajamas and the manner in which he allegedly initiated sex — are likely to infuriate the former president, who has denied the affair and is deeply protective of his public image. What’s less clear is how damaging the revelations will be to his case or his campaign.The remarkable testimony is the latest example of how Trump’s dealings with women are coming back to haunt him in court. Last year, a federal jury in Manhattan found Trump liable for sexually assaulting New York writer E. Jean Carroll in the 1990s. Another jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages to punish Trump for defaming her by denying her allegation of rape.Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee for the November election even after Carroll prevailed in court in her sexual-abuse lawsuit, and his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton followed a string of damaging revelations about his dealings with women. That included the release of the so-called Access Hollywood tape in which he boasts about sexual assault.Daniels is at the center of a case in which Trump is accused of falsifying business records to conceal the nature of a $130,000 payment to her to keep her quiet before the 2016 election. Her testimony is crucial because the Manhattan district attorney, who brought the case last year, must convince jurors that Trump tried to conceal Daniels’s story before the election.If Daniels can convince jurors that a sexual encounter took place, it can bolster the district attorney’s argument about Trump’s motivation to make the hush-money payment.Many of the details Daniels gave the jury Tuesday have been public for years, but her answers under questioning by prosecutors included new claims that angered the defense, including a suggestion that Daniels felt pressured to have sex with Trump due to a “power imbalance.”Daniels delivered much of her testimony in a colorful demeanor that sometimes bordered on humorous, eliciting frequent laughs from spectators. Daniels avoided looking directly at Trump, even when she walked right by him. For his part, Trump appeared to keep his eyes closed for much of her testimony.Trump and his lawyers mostly let Daniels testify uninterrupted. It wasn’t until after the lunch break, when Trump’s lawyer Blanche seized the opportunity to ask the judge for a mistrial, arguing that the detailed testimony by Daniels had gone too far and prejudiced the jury.Merchan denied the mistrial motion but even so, agreed some of Daniels’s testimony had gone too far. He asked Daniels to stay focused and avoid providing “unnecessary details” in her testimony. He also chided Trump’s lawyers for not objecting to it earlier.Before the jury came back from the break, Judge Merchan told prosecutor Susan Hoffinger that “we don’t need this level of detail, like the color of the floor.”Daniels described how she first met Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite, where she’d been invited after meeting the real estate mogul at a celebrity golf tournament sponsored in part by the adult-film company where she worked. Trump’s bodyguard invited her to Trump’s hotel for dinner and when she arrived at the room, she found Trump in his silk pajamas.Speaking rapidly during her testimony, Daniels was frequently asked to slow down by the judge. She detailed her banter with Trump, describing him as “arrogant.” That prompted Trump to suggest she should spank him, she said.Daniels said she asked Trump about his wife, Melania. He told her not to worry about that and that they “don’t even sleep in the same room.” She said she excused herself to go to the bathroom, and found Trump waiting for her on the bed when she returned.She regretted her decisions that had led her there that night, and said she didn’t disclose her affair with Trump because she felt “ashamed.” The consensual tryst left her shaken, Daniels said, but she stayed in touch with Trump because he promised he’d help her get on his reality TV show, The Apprentice.Daniels said hundreds of people knew of her relationship with Trump, but few knew they had sex. Her story briefly became public in a 2011 gossip blog post. But by 2016, she decided to accept a $130,000 payment from Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen to keep quiet about the affair.Extorting money from Trump, as the former president has suggested, wasn’t her goal, Daniels testified.“My motivation wasn’t money,” Daniels said. “It was to get the story out.”Trump’s team used cross examination to portray Daniels as a liar who wanted to make money off a fake story about the former president.Trump lawyer Susan Necheles accused Daniels at one point of making up her testimony as she went along, pointing to evidence that she’d told a Los Angeles lawyer she didn’t have sex with Trump, and that she told some entertainment news outlets that the story about the affair was false.“You’re making it up as you sit there, right?” Necheles said.Necheles suggested that Daniels was an extortionist and someone determined to avoid paying Trump more than $500,000 in legal fees she owed him.“You’re looking to extort money from President Trump, right?” Necheles asked.“False,” said Daniels.The lawyer at one point got Daniels to say she hates Trump and that she hopes he’ll go to jail, seeking to convey to the jury that Daniels has biased feelings about Trump.“Am I correct that you hate President Trump?” Necheles asked.“Yes,” Daniels said.“And you want him to go to jail?” Necheles asked.“I want him to be held accountable,” Daniels said.",Stormy Daniels testifies about a 2006 sexual encounter with Donald Trump in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite.

His strained relationship with his family garnered significant attention as he appeared alone at the event.The younger son of King Charles, Harry currently resides in California with his wife Meghan and their two children.His recent memoir, interviews, and TV documentaries have contributed to his estrangement from other members of the royal family , as he openly criticized both them and the institution itself.Despite a brief reunion with his father, King Charles, following the announcement of the monarch's cancer diagnosis in February, there are no plans for the father and son to meet during Harry's latest trip to the UK. A spokesperson for Harry, the Duke of Sussex, cited the king's busy schedule as the reason for the missed opportunity, saying that Harry understands his father's commitments and priorities.While Harry attended the Invictus Games service at St Paul's Cathedral, King Charles hosted the first annual garden party at Buckingham Palace, accompanied by other senior royals. Additionally, the king was scheduled to carry out engagements at a military training base the following day.Harry's presence at the service marked the sole royal figure in attendance, highlighting his association with the international sporting event he founded in 2014 for wounded military personnel.

Announcing the initiative, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak declared the project a strategic step to ""prise Vladimir Putin 's blood-soaked hands off Europe's energy market.""As per a Daily Mail report, the new plant, backed by a £200 million government investment, will be constructed in Cheshire at the Capenhurst site near Ellesmere Port.The facility, operated by nuclear specialist Urenco, aims to produce 10 tonnes of advanced nuclear fuel annually by the early 2030s. This fuel is crucial for the next generation of modular nuclear reactors, currently a market dominated solely by Russia.During a press briefing, Sunak highlighted the urgency of establishing a UK-based uranium enrichment plant, emphasizing that ""Russia has been the sole provider of this powerful nuclear fuel for too long and this marks the latest step in pushing him out of the energy market entirely.""The project is expected to create 400 skilled jobs and power the UK's future nuclear power plants, ensuring that other countries are less reliant on Russian advanced nuclear fuel. It's part of broader efforts to improve energy security and isolate Moscow from global energy markets, following Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Daily Mail report said.Energy secretary Claire Coutinho remarked on the significance of the new facility, noting it will fuel the new generation of advanced modular reactors necessary to quadruple the UK's nuclear capacity by 2050. Additionally, the government plans to streamline the planning process for developing nuclear fusion technology, inviting firms to compete for up to £600 million in funding to build the UK's first commercially viable fusion plant.This strategic move by the UK government not only aims to secure a future of sustainable and independent energy but also positions Britain as a leader in the global shift towards advanced nuclear technology.","Britain is set to establish Europe's first advanced nuclear fuel production facility.

Therefore, he could still have access to significant resources in various jurisdictions,"" CPS barrister Nicholas Hearn told the court.""His detention has simply been too long for allegations of economic offences,"" argued Fitzgerald, claiming that his client no longer posed any alleged threats of interfering with witnesses as there had been no such activity despite him having phone access in prison over the years.He also pointed to the ""well established"" history of Modi's mental problems, including depression and suicide risk, which had deteriorated further due to incarceration first at Wandsworth prison, south-west London, and now at Thameside, south-east London.The judge acknowledged that Fitzgerald had made the case ""forcefully and fairly"" and that Modi had not yet been convicted of any crime as that was a ""matter for the Indian judicial system"". However, he aligned with the CPS assertion that he was at the ""epicentre"" of the fraud allegations in which many of his co-defendants in India had been granted bail.(with input from agency)","The UK Westminster Magistrate’s court rejected the bail application of fugitive Nirav Modi on Tuesday for the fifth time. Modi had filed the application citing long incarceration. The court heard that while Modi had lost his legal fight against being extradited, there were ""confidential"" proceedings ongoing which had been instigated by him.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109924234,imgsize-677494,width-400,resizemode-4/109924234.jpg"
Cyberattack hits UK defence ministry targeting armed forces' personnel data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/details-of-uk-military-personnel-exposed-in-huge-payroll-data-breach/articleshow/109911714.cms,"NEW DELHI: The UK's ministry of defence has been hit by cyberattack , affecting the personal information and bank details of armed forces personnel, as confirmed by work and pensions minister Mel Stride on Tuesday.The attack targeted a system operated by a third-party company, highlighting the severity of the incident.According to former minister Tobias Ellwood, the attack targeted a payroll system used by the defence ministry and alleged that it exhibited characteristics of a Chinese cyberattack.""Targeting the names of the payroll system and service personnel's bank details, this does point to China because it can be as part of a plan, a strategy to see who might be coerced,"" said Ellwood, an ex-soldier and former chairman of a parliamentary defence committee on BBC radio.The personal addresses of current and former armed forces members are believed to have been exposed in some instances due to the breach.Stride assured that the affected database had been swiftly removed from the internet by the defence ministry, according to statement given to Sky News. However, the government has not directly accused Beijing of being responsible for the attack at this time. ""That is an assumption.... we are not saying that at this precise moment,"" Stride clarified.In March, the UK government accused China of targeting the Electoral Commission and lawmakers' email accounts. The Electoral Commission attack, discovered in October 2022, allowed hackers to access the commission's systems for over a year before detection. China strongly denied the allegations, calling them ""malicious slander"".Mandiant, a Google subsidiary, reported in June of the previous year that online attackers with clear ties to China were responsible for a widespread cyberespionage campaign targeting government agencies of interest to Beijing. The United States has also frequently accused China of conducting cyberattacks against American targets.Two British men, including a former UK parliamentary researcher, recently appeared in a London court, facing charges of spying for China. Later on Tuesday, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to provide further details about the Ministry of Defence data breach to parliament.(With AFP inputs)","The UK's ministry of defence has been hit by cyberattack, affecting personal information and bank details of armed forces personnel.
