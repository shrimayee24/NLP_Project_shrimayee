NEW DELHI: Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday made a strong pitch for generational transition in leadership, suggesting that the older generation should step aside once systems begin to function smoothly and allow younger people to take charge.Addressing a press conference in Nagpur ahead of the Advantage Vidarbha–Khasdar Audhyogik Mahotsav, Gadkari said he firmly believes in gradually handing over responsibility to the next generation.The industrial expo has been conceptualised by Gadkari and is organised by Ashish Kale, president of the Association for Industrial Development (AID).Highlighting Kale’s role, Gadkari said the initiative has actively involved young people. “I believe that gradually, the generation should also change,” he said.Referring to his long association with Kale’s family, Gadkari added, “Ashish's father is my friend. Now we should be gradually made to retire and the responsibility be given to the new generation, and when the vehicle starts running smoothly, then we should withdraw and do some other work.”Gadkari, who serves as AID’s chief mentor, said this year marks the third edition of the Advantage Vidarbha expo, which will be held in Nagpur from February 6 to 8.He noted that Vidarbha has strong entrepreneurial talent across multiple sectors and said the aim of the event is to position the region as a growing industrial hub.“The objective of the three-day event is to establish Vidarbha as a strong and emerging growth hub on India's industrial map,” he said.Emphasising the pillars of regional development, Gadkari underlined the importance of the industrial sector, agriculture and allied activities, and the services sector. He said balanced growth across these areas is essential for long-term economic progress.The Advantage Vidarbha expo will see participation from industries across a wide range of sectors, including textiles, plastics, minerals, coal, aviation, logistics, IT, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, defence, real estate, renewable energy, and startups.",Union minister Nitin Gadkari makes a strong pitch for generational transition in leadership.

"In 2023 too, -40 was good enough for NEET PG",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-2023-too-40-was-good-enough-for-neet-pg/articleshow/126663852.cms,"There is much outrage in the medical community that the cut off for NEET PG 2025 has been reduced to zero percentile for the reserved category, which is equivalent to a score of minus 40. However, this is not the first time a score of minus 40 was good enough to qualify. The cut off was similarly reduced to zero percentile in 2023 for all categories and then too the equivalent score was minus 40.In 2023, when the medical counselling committee announced the reduction to zero percentile, it did not reveal that this was equivalent to a score of minus 40. TOI had analysed the NEET scores and pointed out that zero percentile meant 14 candidates who scored zero marks, 13 with negative marks and the one getting the lowest mark of -40 out of 800 would also qualify. In 2025, there are 126 candidates who have scored zero or less. Zero percentile means the lowest score or that none of the candidates got less. In 2023 and in 2025, one candidate got the lowest score of -40.Interestingly, in July 2022, in response to a petition filed by three students seeking lower cut off, the government had stated in court that ""minimum qualifying percentile for admission is required to be maintained to ensure minimum standard of education and general standards for admission to professional courses"".Taking the government's argument into consideration, the court dismissed the petition and ruled against lowering the standards of medical education as it ""involves in its ambit the matter of life and death"".In 2023, govt officials were quoted in news reports justifying lowering the cut off to zero as a one-time measure to fill vacant PG seats. However, this has become a regular feature with cut offs being lowered to abysmal levels every year. About 2 lakh to 2.3 lakh students appear for NEET PG for over 70,000 seats (about 57,000 MD/MS seats and the rest are DNB and PG diploma seats). However, the seats in private medical colleges remain vacant as the fees for clinical subjects in many of them runs into crores which most candidates cannot afford. Lowering the cut off increases the pool of 'qualified' candidates and improves the chance of finding candidates with deep pockets who can afford the fees even if they have rock bottom scores.""To lower NEET PG qualifying marks to abysmal level is driven solely by commercial considerations. This decision 'reserves' post-graduate medical seats to the rich and mighty in commercial fiefdoms called private medical colleges. This is shameful and must be condemned as unadulterated corruption,"" tweeted former principal health secretary of Andhra Pradesh Dr PV Ramesh.","The cut off for NEET PG 2025 has been reduced to zero percentile for the reserved category, which is equivalent to a score of minus 40. In 2023 and in 2025, one candidate got the lowest score of -40.

IndiGo to inform if it can fly 2k flights daily,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indigo-to-inform-if-it-can-fly-2k-flights-daily/articleshow/126662186.cms,"IndiGo chaos lasted beyond 3 days DGCA probed: Pilots body

NEW DELHI: As IndiGo's exemption from the new safety-enhancing flight duty rules for A320 fleet pilots expires Feb 10, the airline must tell DGCA this week, likely Monday, whether it can still run more than 2,000 flights a day under the new rules that increase pilot requirement, reports Saurabh Sinha.If it cannot, authorities are expected to step in and cut flights in time to avert a repeat of last December's chaos, for which the DGCA fined the airline Rs 22.2cr, an amount pilots' body has dismissed as ""peanuts"", saying the regulator counted only three days of disruption when the turmoil lasted far longer.Regular meetings are being held with IndiGo to get a status on their preparedness for once the flight duty time limitation (FDTL) exemption ends on Feb 10. They have informed us about their pilot hiring plans. The airline has been doing dry runs with its scheduling software by matching available pilot strength with number of flights to be operated. On Monday they are expected to share their post Feb 10 preparedness,” said people in the know.It is learnt that from Feb 1 IndiGo will plan its crew rosters as per new FDTL rules and without factoring in the current exemption that will end later that month.IndiGo flights have been reduced till the end of winter schedule (which ends on last Saturday in March) and the airline plans to serve its entire network with these cuts under the new FDTL rules. It is learnt IndiGo may not seek any further exemptions.The aviation ministry and the DGCA are keeping a very close watch on the situation. “We can’t and won’t allow a repeat of what happened last Dec,” said sources.The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) has termed the DGCA’s Rs 22.2cr fine on IndiGo as “peanuts” and questioned some aspects of its report. FIP president Captain CS Randhawa said: “The DGCA probe takes cognisance of IndiGo flight disruptions only on three days — Dec 3, 4 & 5. In reality, the disruptions lasted much longer till about mid Dec and the scale was much higher.”Captain Randhawa questioned the lack of action. “Issuing a warning letter after a massive disruption of this scale is a joke, like the fine amount. Also with IndiGo flights cut, why hasn’t the FDTL exemption been revoked? The DGCA is levying a fine of Rs 30 lakh for each day of non-compliance of the new flight duty rules. Does it mean that non-compliance of the law can be traded with a penalty?” Captain Randhawa said.IndiGo said on Saturday that it is “committed to taking full cognisance of the orders and will, in a thoughtful and timely manner, take appropriate measures… an in-depth review of the robustness and resilience of the internal processes at IndiGo (is) underway to ensure that the airline emerges stronger out of these events in its otherwise pristine record of 19 plus years of operations..”","IndiGo's exemption from the new safety-enhancing flight duty rules for A320 fleet pilots expires Feb 10.

Vande Bharat Sleeper ticket cancellation to be costly affair,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vande-bharat-sleeper-ticket-cancellation-to-be-costly-affair/articleshow/126661131.cms,"India Reveals First Vande Bharat Sleeper Offering Faster Overnight Travel On Kolkata-Guwahati Line

NEW DELHI: Cancelling confirmed tickets of newly launched Vande Bharat Sleeper trains will be costlier for passengers, according to new norms notified by the Railways. While a 25% deduction will apply if a ticket booked in this premium train is cancelled anytime after purchasing, a 50% charge will be levied if cancellation is done between 72 hours and eight hours before the train's scheduled departure.There will be no refund, if a ticket is cancelled less than eight hours before scheduled departure, the norms state. This provision has been introduced considering that the Railways has started preparing the reservation chart eight hours before a train's departure against the earlier norm of four hours.The new cancellation rules for Vande Bharat Sleeper trains are significantly different and stricter as compared to other trains, including the operational Vande Bharat chair-car trains. Officials said the norms reduce the time for cancelling tickets and change refund amounts for Vande Bharat Sleeper trains as passengers will be issued only confirmed tickets in these services. There will be no provision for reservation against cancellation tickets, they said.Rules for other trains state that passengers are levied a flat cancellation rate of Rs 240 for first AC, Rs 200 for Tier-2 AC, Rs 180 for Tier-3 AC, Rs 120 for Sleeper and Rs 60 for Second Class, if they cancel tickets anytime before 48 hours prior to a train's scheduled departure.If anyone cancels a ticket between 48 hours and up to 12 hours before scheduled departure, a 25% cancellation charge is levied, and there is a 50% deduction for tickets cancelled between 12 hours and up to four hours before departure.

It has also requested finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to issue sector-specific clarification or guidance regarding her ministry’s 2024 order to end arbitration for all such projects.In its circular with regard to revised dispute resolution issued on Jan 12, the road transport ministry, while referring to the finance ministry order, said that any dispute between parties involving value of Rs 10 crore or more will not be referred to arbitration, and these will be resolved by conciliation.In its letter to road transport secretary V Umashankar, the National Highway Builders Federation (NHBF) has said invoking this provision in ongoing projects is “against settled principle of fair contracting” and would have a cascading impact on lenders and highway builders. It has urged the ministry to withdraw the revised provisions to ongoing projects, claiming that such a move will “impair project cash flow and debt servicing ability”, “trigger lenders concerns” as well as shift financial stress to the banking system.In a separate letter to Sitharaman dated Jan 17, the federation has submitted that the revised dispute framework, in its present form, discourages investment, increases project cost, delays execution and transfers the financial risk to the banking system.“Given the long concession periods, high leverage, dependence on stable cash flows and sensitivity of financing structures, dispute resolution mechanisms for highway projects require sector-specific calibration,” the NHBF said.Separately, NHBF has flagged the issue with bankers and financial lenders, suggesting they assess the impact of ending arbitration on highway loan portfolio with respect to ongoing projects as well as bankability of future projects under the amended model concession agreements of BOT, HAM and EPC.",National Highway Builders Federation (NHBF) has opposed the road transport ministry’s move to end arbitration in disputes with claims of over Rs 10 crore.

"Driven by state-run utilities, distribution companies post Rs 2,700cr profit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/driven-by-state-run-utilities-distribution-companies-post-rs-2700cr-profit/articleshow/126661081.cms,"From Power Cuts To 500 GW Grid, India Emerges As Global Data Centre Hub Under Modi: Piyush Goyal

NEW DELHI: Power distribution companies in the private and public sectors have staged a smart turnaround, reporting a combined profit of over Rs 2,700 crore in 2024-25, as against losses of Rs 25,553 crore in the previous year, govt said on Sunday.Power ministry officials attributed this to improved performance by state-run power utilities.""If we look at the last three financial years, private distribution companies have been posting profits, which went up further in the last financial year. The positive profit after tax in 2024-25 is the result of a sharp decline in losses of state-run power discoms,"" said a senior power ministry official.The Centre said infrastructure modernisation and accelerated smart metering, prudent tariff structures and the transparent accounting of subsidies to ensure full recovery had aided the performance of discoms. Providing for subsidies is seen to be critical as state after state is announcing free power for consumers up to a certain level, and in the absence of money being set aside in the budget, discoms have to bear the burden.Additional measures - such as introducing uniform accounting and greater transparency across distribution utilities to improve financial governance, enforcing legal contracts through timely payments to support investment in new renewable energy projects and incentivising states to implement critical power sector reforms by linking borrowing limits to performance metrics under the additional borrowing scheme - also contributed to the improved financial performance, govt said.The impact of these reforms is evident not only in the bottom lines but also in other performance indicators, including a reduction in aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses and a narrowing gap between the average cost of supply and the average revenue realised, the ministry said.AT&C losses, a key parameter of efficiency, have reduced from 22.6% in 2013-14 to 15% in 2024-25, an official statement said. Reforms such as late payment surcharge rules led to a 96% reduction in outstanding dues to generating companies, from Rs 1.4 lakh crore in 2022 to Rs 4,927 crore by Jan 2026, while reducing payment cycles from 178 days in 2020-21 to 113 days in 2024-25, it added.Sambitosh Mohapatra, partner at consulting firm PwC India, said the return of some state discoms to profitability should be seen as a structural inflection point rather than an accounting exercise, driven by improved billing efficiency, lower AT&C losses, better subsidy discipline and selective tariff rationalisation.Yet, there is a long way to go for the discoms, which had accumulated losses of Rs 6.8 lakh crore in 2022-23.Besides, regulatory assets, due to insufficient pass-through of costs, were estimated at over Rs 3 lakh crore, mainly in states such as Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi and West Bengal.Anujwsh Dwivedi, partner at Deloitte India, said from a financial sustainability perspective, resolving the outstanding debt pile of over Rs 7 lakh crore in state-owned discoms is the most significant challenge facing the sector.","Power distribution companies in the private and public sectors have staged a smart turnaround.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, while addressing a rally in Singur, West Bengal, said that the people of the state are determined to oust the ruling Trinamool Congress and bring an end to the 15-year “maha-jungleraj” of the Mamata Banerjee-led government.PM Modi was in West Bengal to launch development projects worth over Rs 830 crore and to flag off three Amrit Bharat trains connecting Kolkata with other parts of the country.Hitting out at TMC “maha-jungleraj”, PM Modi said, “A very large number of mothers, sisters, and farmers have come. Everyone has come with the same hope that we want real change. Everyone wants to change the 15-year mega-jungleraj. The BJP has once again stopped the jungleraj in Bihar, and now West Bengal is also ready to bid farewell to TMC's maha-jungleraj.”He further criticised the state government on security and border issues, saying, ""The TMC government is playing with the security of West Bengal and the country as well, so the youth here, in particular, need to be extremely cautious. TMC provides all kinds of facilities to infiltrators here. It holds protests to protect infiltrators.”“For the past 11 years, the Central Government has been repeatedly writing letters to the TMC government that fencing needs to be installed on the Bengal border, for which land is required, but TMC doesn't care.TMC provides patronage to such gangs that give protection to infiltrators and create fake documents for them. The time has come when infiltration must be completely stopped,” he added.""West Bengal has immense potential, it has very large rivers, very extensive coastlines, fertile land, every district of West Bengal has something special...

Your vote for BJP will ensure no Sandeshkhali, says Modi

SINGUR: “Maha jungle raj” must end if Bengal is to regain law and order, attract industry and restore investor confidence, PM Narendra Modi said Sunday, launching a blistering attack on Trinamool Congress govt as the state heads towards assembly elections due in about three months.Addressing a rally at Singur — about 40km northwest of Kolkata in Hooghly district — Modi framed the contest as a straight fight between “Trinamool’s maha jungle raj and BJP’s sushasan (good governance)”, accusing Bengal’s governing party of playing with national security by protecting infiltrators for vote-bank politics.“Infiltrators who have settled using forged documents must be identified and sent back,” Modi said, urging voters to replicate Bihar’s verdict against “jungle raj” and end what he called Trinamool’s 15-year misrule.He charged TMC with facilitating infiltration by denying land for fencing along Bangladesh border. “For the past 11 years, Centre has repeatedly written to state govt that a barbed-wire fencing must be erected along Bengal’s border and land is required for it. But TMC has shown no concern,” he said.This story continues on page 9 in the newspaper. For your reading convenience we have added it below.“Your vote for BJP will ensure there is no more Sandeshkhali or theft of jobs,” Modi said.Modi accused Trinamool of blocking central schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, PM Matsya Sampada Yojana and PM Shree Schools, alleging Bengal followed the path of erstwhile Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi govt in stopping benefits.Despite BJP’s pre-rally pitch built around “Tata”, “Nano” and land-for-industry, Modi made no reference to Singur’s past as flashpoint of land acquisition protests that helped Mamata Banerjee end Left Front’s 35-year govt in 2011 and drove Tata’s Nano project to Gujarat. Instead, he linked industry’s return to law and order. “Industry and investment will come to Bengal only when there is proper law and order. If voted to office, BJP will end syndicate tax and rioters,” he said.Earlier, Modi inaugurated and laid foundation stones for port-led development projects worth 830 crore, including an “extended port gate system” at Balagarh, about 60km north of Kolkata along Hooghly river.He said project would ease pressure on Kolkata Port, turn Hooghly into a warehousing and trading hub, draw hundreds of crores in investment and create jobs. “New markets will open for farmers here,” he said, flagging export potential for local produce.Outlining BJP’s economic script, Modi promised district-wise capacity building, a one-district-one-product push, a special plastic policy and immediate encouragement to jute packaging. Hooghly anchors Bengal’s jute belt and hosts nearly 60 mills. Turning to women and youth, Modi invoked social reformer Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, urging them to become agents of change.“Children will not get good education or jobs so long as TMC is in govt,” he said, alleging education sector was under grip of a mafia and Hooghly had been shamed by an education scam. “If voted to office, we will ensure they are behind bars.”Modi credited his govt for Durga Puja in Kolkata securing Unesco’s intangible cultural heritage tag, Santiniketan — about 160km northwest of Kolkata in Birbhum district — gaining world heritage status, classical language recognition for Bengali and installation of Subhas Chandra Bose’s statue at India Gate. “TMC was part of Sonia Gandhi’s govt but made no effort. It happened only after BJP formed govt in Delhi,” he said.","Modi accuses TMC of playing with national security by protecting infiltrators for vote-bank politics. “Your vote for BJP will ensure there is no more Sandeshkhali or theft of jobs,” he says.

Final green light for India’s 1st PPP Earth imaging Sat project likely this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/final-green-light-for-indias-1st-ppp-earth-imaging-sat-project-likely-this-week/articleshow/126660465.cms,"BENGALURU: More than four months after India’s space regulator-cum-promoter Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) announced the winners of India’s first EO Satellite System (EOSS) under PPP, a concession agreement is expected to be signed as early as this week, allowing the winning consortium to finally begin work on ground.“It has taken longer than expected, but the [concession] agreement is now expected to be signed shortly, after which work on the project can finally move from paper to the ground,” a source familiar with the matter confirmed to TOI.TOI had reported in Aug 2025 that the consortium had won the project through a “zero-bid”. While the concession agreement was to be signed within three months, delay in processes will see the agreement be signed this week. Another source said that if all goes as planned it could happen in the “first-half” of this week at Isro headquarters in Bengaluru.The project, which will create a constellation of 12 satellites, assumes importance not only because it has the private sector at its heart, but also in the backdrop of the persistent gap in strategic space assets and demand.The data from the satellites will be used for applications ranging from climate change monitoring and disaster response to agriculture, infrastructure planning, maritime operations, and national security, where there are huge gaps so far as having eyes in the sky is concerned.The consortium of Pixxel Space, Piersight Space, Satsure Analytics India, and Dhruva Space is expected to implement the project through Allied Orbits. IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka had told TOI after announcing the winning consortium that the project would be implemented through a special purpose vehicle (SPV).Over the next four to five years, the consortium is expected to invest more than Rs 1,200 crore to create a constellation of 12 satellites in low-Earth orbit. The project is designed to enhance India’s data sovereignty and reduce dependence on foreign imagery. All satellites will be manufactured in India, launched on Indian rockets, and controlled from ground infrastructure within the country.IN-SPACe described the programme as a paradigm shift in India’s space policy – one that places private enterprise at the heart of building national capability. As per IN-SPACe: “Satellites will carry a mix of panchromatic, multispectral, hyperspectral, and microwave sensors, capable of delivering high-resolution, analysis-ready geospatial data…”In addition to meeting India’s own needs, the consortium is expected to be allowed to sell analysis-ready data and value-added services commercially.","A concession agreement is expected to be signed as early as this week, allowing the winning consortium to finally begin work on ground.

Advanced version of Nagastra drone used in Op Sindoor developed: Rajnath,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/advanced-version-of-nagastra-drone-used-in-op-sindoor-developed-rajnath/articleshow/126658304.cms,"Rajnath Singh Pushes Self-Reliance In Ammunition Production, Recalls '88-Hour Intense' Op Sindoor

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh revealed on Sunday that an advanced version of the Nagastra drone, which was extensively used during Operation Sindoor to “accurately strike terrorist targets”, has been developed. He said that the Nagpur-based Solar Defence and Aerospace Plant, which developed Nagastra, has also developed ‘Bhargavastra’, a micro-missile-based system, having conducted a successful test-launch.Rajnath stressed that the govt is focusing on ensuring that the private sector’s contribution in defence manufacturing reaches 50% or more in coming times.Inaugurating a medium-calibre ammunition manufacturing facility at the company’s plant in Nagpur, Rajnath said, “We witnessed the brilliance of your (company’s) ingenuity in Operation Sindoor. The Nagastra drone developed by this group was successfully deployed. This drone struck precisely those who harboured ill intentions towards our country.” Lauding the development of a more advanced version of Nagastra, the minister said, “One never knows when it might be needed, given that our neighbour is so unpredictable. ”Nagastra-1 is a ‘kamikaze’ (suicide) drone that can search and destroy any target by crashing into it.Bhargavastra, on the other hand, is India's first indigenous, low-cost counter-drone system, developed to neutralise hostile drone swarms using micro-rockets and guided micro-missiles, featuring radar detection of up to 6 km and engagement of up to 2.5 km.The newly inaugurated facility is a fully automated plant manufacturing 30mm ammunition, which is extensively used by the Indian Army and Navy. Rajnath also visited the Pinaka rocket manufacturing facility and flagged off the first tranche of guided Pinaka rockets bound for Armenia.He said that Op Sindoor had lasted for approximately 88 hours, but the sheer scale and intensity of those 88 hours couldn’t be described in words. “In such operations, every minute, every decision and every resource is crucial. If we look around today, we see various kinds of wars. One thing becomes clear: warfare is becoming increasingly complex, and its intensity is constantly increasing. In such a situation, preparation for wars should be done on a war footing. ”Rajnath recalled the time when ammunition shortages hampered the country’s defence preparedness, making the govt realise the need to become self-reliant in the field. Commending the contribution of private enterprises to making the defence sector ‘Aatmanirbhar’, he said the nation is steadily marching forward in ammunition production, manufacturing quality and reliable products. “In such a situation, increased involvement of the private sector in manufacturing and research & development is the need of the hour,” he added.",Rajnath Singh says advanced version of Nagastra drone used in Operation Sindoor has been developed.

‘Can’t Stay Two Days In Delhi’: Gadkari On Severe Pollution, Transport Sector Role

Under the leadership of Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta, the Delhi Government has taken a major decision to further expand the capital's Metro network. The Government has released its share of funds for the remaining three corridors of Phase IV of the Delhi Metro Rail Transit System (MRTS).According to an official release, the Chief Minister stated that these projects will provide improved Metro connectivity to various parts of Delhi and further strengthen the public transport system. The corridors are expected to be completed within four years. Efficient metro operations will also play a significant role in controlling pollution.The three Phase-IV Metro corridors will have a combined length of 47.225 kilometres. The projects are estimated to cost approximately Rs 14,630.80 crore, of which Rs 3,386.18 crore will be met by the Delhi Government.The first corridor is proposed from Lajpat Nagar to Saket G-Block, with a length of 8.385 kilometres and eight elevated Metro stations. The second corridor is proposed from Inderlok to Indraprastha, with a length of 12.377 kilometres. This line will have a total of ten Metro stations, one elevated and nine underground.This corridor has been included under a combined financial framework with the Lajpat Nagar- Saket G-Block corridor. The combined project cost of these two corridors is Rs 8,399.81 crore, of which the Delhi Government's share will be Rs 1,987.86 crore.The third and longest corridor is proposed from Rithala to Kundli, extending connectivity to the neighbouring state of Haryana. This corridor will be 26.463 kilometres long and will include 21 stations. The total cost of this project has been estimated at Rs 6,230.99 crore, with the Delhi Government's share amounting to Rs 1,398.32 crore. Of the total cost, Rs 5,685.22 crore will be spent for Delhi and Rs 545.77 crore for Haryana, the release noted.These three corridors will provide better travel facilities to residents across several parts of Delhi. The Lajpat Nagar-Saket G-Block corridor will pass through Lajpat Nagar, Andrews Ganj, GK-1, Chirag Delhi, Pushp Bhawan, Saket District Centre and Pushp Vihar.The Inderlok-Indraprastha corridor will connect areas such as Inderlok, Dayabasti, Sarai Rohilla, Ajmal Khan Park, Jhandewalan, Nabi Karim, New Delhi Railway Station, Delhi Gate, and Delhi Secretariat-IG Stadium.The extensive Rithala-Kundli corridor will pass through Rithala, Rohini Sectors 25, 26, 31, 32, 36, Barwala, Rohini Sectors 35 and 34, Bawana Industrial Area-I (Sectors 3-4 and 1-2), Bawana JJ Colony, Sanoth, New Sanoth, Bhorgarh village, Narela Anaj Mandi, Narela DDA Sports Complex, Narela, Narela Sector-5, Kundli and Nathupur.The tendering process for these corridors is underway, and basic work has already begun on some of them. All three corridors are expected to be completed within four years. The construction of these metro corridors will enhance connectivity across northern, central and southern parts of Delhi, as well as the Delhi-NCR region. This will reduce traffic pressure on roads, save commuters' time and promote the use of public transport.According to a release, Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said that the three Phase-IV corridors will provide Delhi with a modern and robust public transport system aligned with future requirements. She said the project will ensure safe, convenient and time-efficient travel for commuters, reduce dependence on private vehicles and contribute to pollution control. The Chief Minister added that the Delhi Government is continuously taking concrete steps towards making the capital a world-class city, and the expansion of the Metro network is a key part of this commitment.","The Government has released its share of funds for the remaining three corridors of Phase IV of the Delhi Metro Rail Transit System.

Ranchi ED Raid: Jharkhand HC Calls Police Action ‘Pre-Planned’, Orders Security Boost

(With PTI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Sunday said it has filed a chargesheet against Magicwin, a betting website owned by two Pakistani nationals based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).According to the ED, the prosecution complaint—equivalent to a chargesheet—was filed on January 15 before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.The agency has named 14 individuals and entities as accused in the money laundering case linked to Magicwin. The case originates from an FIR registered by the Ahmedabad cyber crime police, which accused the portal of unauthorised hosting, streaming, and broadcasting of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024. The tournament’s broadcasting rights had been granted by the International Cricket Council (ICC) to Star India Private Limited.During the investigation, the ED found that the Magicwin brand portal is owned by Magicwin Sports Limited, a UK-registered company with Pakistani nationals Gulab Harji Mal and Omesh Kumar Gurnani listed as directors. Both individuals are based in the UAE.The agency alleged that the portal and its mobile application functioned as a betting exchange offering sports betting and leisure gambling, with transactions routed through mule accounts.The website allegedly facilitated betting on cricket, tennis, football, and horse racing, while also providing live match streaming and real-time scorecards to users placing bets.The ED further claimed that several celebrities and social media influencers had promoted Magicwin and that proceeds from the betting operations were routed through hawala channels and cryptocurrencies.In October 2025, the Centre banned real-money online gaming and betting, describing it as a “financial and social menace” that “drains the hard-earned money of users, especially the youth.”","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Sunday said it has filed a chargesheet against Magicwin, a betting website.

' network work

How 'mule accounts' hold key

NEW DELHI: Security agencies have flagged a sophisticated “crypto hawala” network allegedly being used to bypass the country’s financial safeguards to funnel untraceable foreign funds into Jammu and Kashmir, raising concerns that the money is being used to finance terror activities in the Union territory, officials said on Sunday.The development has put the security establishment on high alert. Officials warned that these shadow funds are aimed at reviving separatist elements and reigniting ""anti-national propaganda"" in the region—activities that had been largely curtailed following sustained crackdowns by police and central agencies.According to officials, this digital version mirrors the traditional ""hawala"" system, in which money is sent through non-banking channels. The ""crypto hawala"" network operates entirely off the grid, using the anonymity of unregulated cryptocurrency to erase the financial trail and inject cash into the domestic economy.An investigation by the Jammu and Kashmir Police, in coordination with central security agencies, has found that handlers based in countries including China, Malaysia, Myanmar and Cambodia were directing individuals in the Union Territory to create private cryptocurrency wallets.These wallets were often set up using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to evade detection and typically did not require Know Your Customer (KYC) or identity verification.Jammu and Kashmir Police has suspended the use of VPN services in the Valley, amid growing indications that such tools were being used to facilitate crypto wallet registrations. VPN is seen as a handy tool for terrorists as well as separatists to avoid detection.Officials further said that the foreign handlers transfer cryptocurrency directly into these private wallets, placing the funds under local control without routing them through any regulated financial institution. The wallet holders then travel to major cities such as Delhi or Mumbai, where they meet unregulated peer-to-peer (P2P) traders and convert the cryptocurrency into cash at negotiated rates.This process effectively “breaks the financial trail,” allowing foreign funds to enter the local economy as untraceable cash, they added.The network hinges on the use of “mule” or “parking” accounts that layer transactions to obscure the money trail. To keep the system running, syndicates have instituted a structured commission mechanism under which such account holders earn between 0.8 and 1.8 per cent per transaction.These accounts typically belong to ordinary individuals drawn in by the promise of commissions and reassured that their role is low-risk, limited to temporarily parking funds. In reality, full control of the accounts—including net banking usernames and passwords—is handed over to the operators.A single operator is usually given access to multiple mule accounts at a time, often ranging from 10 to 30 accounts.The emergence of “crypto hawala” is being viewed as a new challenge linked to off-exchange trading. By operating in the “grey market,” such networks are able to bypass anti-money laundering regulations that apply to registered financial entities.(With PTI inputs)","Security agencies have flagged a sophisticated “crypto hawala’ network allegedly being used to funnel untraceable foreign funds into Jammu and Kashmir.

Infrastructure as a catalyst for industrial growth

‘India Outperforming Emerging Markets’: Economist On India's 7.4% FY26 GDP Growth Estimates

Translating policy intent into global manufacturing competitiveness

(Arnab Basu is Partner and Chief Industries Officer, PwC India)

As India advances towards achieving the government’s vision of Viksit Bharat, Budget 2026 arrives at a poignant moment in the country’s economic journey. Over the past decade, public policy has laid strong structural foundations through reforms, infrastructure expansion and a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing which has collectively reshaped India’s growth trajectory. The task before the upcoming Budget is not to reset direction, but to consolidate gains, deepen execution and ensure that public investment continues to crowd in private capital at scale.At the heart of this agenda lies infrastructure. Sustained public CapEx has been one of the most defining features of recent budgets, supporting growth even amid global uncertainty. Investments in roads, railways, ports, airports and digital infrastructure have improved connectivity, reduced logistics costs and strengthened India’s competitiveness across sectors.The Union Budget FY26 has the opportunity to build further on this momentum by continuing a high level of CapEx allocation, while sharpening focus on project execution, asset monetisation and state-level capacity building. The next phase of infrastructure growth must prioritise outcomes related to productivity gains, faster completion cycles, and stronger linkages between physical and digital networks.Equally important is the role of infrastructure in enabling India’s manufacturing ambitions. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, announced over successive Budgets, have begun to yield tangible results across electronics, pharmaceuticals, automotive components and renewable energy equipment. As India seeks to position itself as a trusted manufacturing partner in global value chains, this year’s Budget can focus on refining these schemes—shifting from capacity creation to deeper supply-chain integration, technology adoption and MSME participation. Simplifying compliance, improving access to long-term finance, and strengthening industrial clusters will be critical to sustaining manufacturing competitiveness beyond initial incentives.The manufacturing opportunity in India is both cyclical and structural. While geopolitical realignments and supply-chain diversification are creating near-term openings, domestic demand, urbanisation, and rising incomes provide a long-term anchor. Policy continuity will therefore be key. Measures such as stable customs regimes, faster approvals, and coordinated centre-state frameworks can reinforce investor confidence. Targeted investments in logistics parks, warehousing and multimodal transport can further reduce the cost of manufacturing and exports which has been a long-standing constraint for India’s manufacturing industry.While infrastructure and manufacturing form the core of Budget expectations, the role of technology (especially AI) cannot be overlooked. AI is increasingly becoming a horizontal enabler, enhancing productivity in design, operations, maintenance and supply chain planning across infrastructure and industrial sectors. Budget 2026 can support this transition through targeted incentives for digital adoption, investments in data infrastructure, and skilling programmes that prepare the workforce for technology-enabled manufacturing. The focus should be on practical application rather than experimentation alone, ensuring that AI investments translate into measurable productivity gains.Skilling and human capital development remain another critical lever. Large-scale infrastructure and manufacturing expansion will require a workforce equipped with both technical and digital skills. Building on initiatives such as Skill India and recent efforts to align skilling with industry needs, the Budget can further strengthen public-private partnerships in vocational training, apprenticeships, and continuous upskilling. Ensuring that India’s demographic dividend is absorbed into these sectors will be central to achieving inclusive and sustainable development.From an investor's perspective, policy predictability and fiscal discipline will be crucial. In the past, India has demonstrated that growth-oriented spending can coexist with a credible fiscal consolidation path and the Union Budget FY26 will have to continue this balancing act by maintaining CapEx while managing deficits and debt prudently. According to PwC’s 28th Annual Global CEO Survey: India Perspective, a majority of Indian CEOs remain confident about the country’s economic growth, underpinned by reform stability and sustained public investment. Preserving this confidence will depend on the Budget’s ability to reinforce continuity while addressing emerging execution challenges.Beyond numbers and allocations, this year’s budget will be read as a signal of intent. For global investors, it will indicate how firmly India is committed to strengthening its role in global manufacturing and infrastructure-led growth. For the domestic industry, it will shape decisions on capacity expansion, technology adoption, and long-term investment, while for the states, it will define the contours of cooperative federalism in delivering large-scale projects.The Union Budget FY26 represents an opportunity to reinforce the foundations of Viksit Bharat through steady, purposeful policy action. By sustaining infrastructure investment, deepening manufacturing capabilities and enabling technology-led productivity, the Budget can help ensure that India’s growth story remains resilient and inclusive. As the economy navigates an evolving global landscape, it is this consistency of direction and execution that will preserve momentum and translate ambition into enduring economic outcomes.","At the heart of this agenda lies infrastructure.

Budget 2026: Will tax provisions ease for crypto assets?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-will-tax-provisions-ease-for-crypto-assets/articleshow/126525033.cms,"Losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.

Key concerns flagged:

Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities.

Use of offshore exchanges, private wallets, and decentralised platforms complicates enforcement and obscures transaction trails, hindering accurate tax assessment and recovery.

Jurisdictional limitations add to the challenge, as many transactions occur outside India’s regulatory reach, making compliance and enforcement “virtually impossible.”

A tax framework that bites:

Suggestions for

Budget 2026

:

Allowing set-off of losses between different VDAs, even if not against other income

Providing statutory guidance on the situs of VDAs, especially for non-residents

Reviewing the impact of 1% TDS on market liquidity

The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has raised fresh concerns about the risks posed by virtual digital assets (VDAs) such as cryptocurrencies, aligning its stance with that of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).The tax department’s warning presented recently to a Parliamentary Standing Committee of Finance underscores regulatory agencies' growing scepticism about cryptocurrencies fit within India’s financial and taxation framework. It highlights revenue risks, enforcement gaps and potential misuse for evasion or illicit finance.The tax regime in India, for VDAs can be considered as one of the most stringent in the world.The Finance Act, 2022, ushered in a bespoke tax regime for VDAs by inserting section 115-BBH into the Income-tax Act, 1961 (I-T Act). Income from the transfer of VDAs is taxed at a flat 30%, plus surcharge and cess, regardless of the holding period. The law allows only the cost of acquisition as a deduction, barring transaction fees, exchange charges or other expenses.More critically, losses from VDAs cannot be set off — not against other income, nor even against gains from another crypto asset.Losses also cannot be carried forward. A parallel provision mandates 1% tax deduction at source (TDS) on transfers beyond specified thresholds, further tightening liquidity. To illustrate: For a salaried individual, a 1% TDS is applicable on transfer of the VDAs if the transaction amount exceeds ­10,000.Various associations have in their pre budget submissions, argued that disallowing set-off of losses between VDAs is economically distortive and ultimately counterproductive for tax revenues.The argument is simple: when losses are ring-fenced, but gains are fully taxed, risk-taking is penalised asymmetrically. This has reportedly contributed to trading volumes migrating offshore, exchanges shifting operations overseas and Indian investors being pushed into cross-border structures that raise FEMA and compliance complexities.The result is a tax structure that treats crypto trading far more harshly than equities, real estate or even speculative assets, despite its growing mainstream adoption.While section 115-BBH of the I-T Act, applies equally to residents and non-residents, tax provisions are not clear on a crucial issue: where is a VDA located? For non-residents, taxability hinges on whether income accrues or arises in India (the provisions of sections 5 and 9 of the I-T Act and the relevant tax treaty provisions come into play).Unlike shares or immovable property, VDAs lack a clearly identifiable physical or legal location. In the absence of legislative clarity on the situs of crypto assets, non-resident taxation risks becoming a fertile ground for disputes particularly where trading occurs on global exchanges, assets are held in offshore wallets and sale proceeds are received outside India.Experts point out that clarity is essential to avoid avoidable litigation. Jurisdictions such as the UK offer guidance by linking the situs of crypto assets to the residential status of the beneficial owner, an approach India could adapt.Individuals dealing in cryptocurrencies are required to disclose income from virtual digital assets in Schedule VDA of their annual income tax returns — typically ITR-2 or ITR-3, depending on their income profile. The schedule seeks granular information, including the date of acquisition and transfer, cost of acquisition and sale consideration. Accurate reporting is crucial, as any under-reporting or misreporting of VDA income can attract penalties, apart from interest on unpaid tax.Possible reforms being discussed in policy circles include:Ashish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch said, ""India’s VDA ecosystem is at a pivotal stage, with growing adoption across the country. However, the current tax framework presents challenges for retail participants by taxing transactions without recognising losses, creating friction rather than fairness. A reduction in TDS on VDA transactions from 1% to 0.01% could improve liquidity, ease compliance, and enhance transparency while preserving transaction traceability. Raising the TDS threshold to ₹5 lakh would help protect small investors from disproportionate impact.""""Introduced in 2022 as a stand-in for regulation at that time, VDA taxation has since been complemented by strong oversight from FIU-IND and improved compliance. This Budget presents a great opportunity to revisit the framework in a manner beneficial to both investors and the government. We remain hopeful that the government will recognize this gap and consider reviewing the current framework soon,"" he concluded.","Crypto’s anonymous, borderless and near-instant transfers make tracking taxable income and beneficial ownership difficult for tax authorities. Offshore exchanges, private wallets, and decentralised platforms complicates enforcement and obscures transaction trails, hindering accurate tax assessment and recovery.

Budget 2026 for taxpayers: Five fixes that can make taxes less taxing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-for-taxpayers-five-fixes-that-can-make-taxes-less-taxing-explained/articleshow/126666769.cms,"The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe.

By Nishant Khemani

One return, one choice

Cut the sting in foreign remittance TCS

NPS withdrawals: clarity needed on taxability

Level the NPS field under the new regime

Time for

joint tax returns

(Nishant Khemani is a chartered accountant and Managing Partner of the Saturn Consulting Group)

Every Union Budget comes with its share of grand announcements, but for ordinary taxpayers, the real test lies in the fine print. As Budget 2026 approaches, expectations are modest yet meaningful: simplify compliance, nudge long-term savings, and stop treating convenience as a luxury. Here are five changes that could make the tax system smarter, softer and more sensible.The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe. Form 10-IE, required to opt in or out of the new regime, is a classic case of procedural overkill. Many taxpayers either forget to file it or file it incorrectly, losing out on the more beneficial regime. The fix is simple: embed the option directly into the ITR. A single return, a clear choice, no extra forms. Ease of doing business should also mean ease of filing taxes, especially for salaried individuals who neither game the system nor enjoy paperwork.A 20% TCS on foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme was introduced to plug tax leakages. The intent is understandable, but the dosage is excessive. For genuine remittances for family support the high TCS blocks liquidity and creates avoidable stress.A more balanced approach would be to reduce TCS to 10%, or introduce a slab system: lower rates up to, say, ₹50 lakh, and higher rates thereafter. Compliance should be encouraged, not coerced.Recent changes to NPS withdrawal rules are a welcome step. Subscribers can now withdraw up to 100% of the corpus if it is within ₹8 lakh, and 80% if it exceeds that limit. This adds flexibility and makes NPS more attractive.But there’s a catch—or rather, a question mark. Till now, only 60% of the corpus was tax-free on maturity. How will the additional 20% be taxed? The Budget should clarify this and remove the ambiguity. Ideally, the extra withdrawal should also be tax-free, reinforcing NPS as a credible retirement pillar rather than a tax puzzle.Under the new tax regime, deductions are scarce, making Section 80CCD(2), the employer contribution to NPS, a rare oasis. However, the additional ₹50,000 deduction under Section 80CCD(1b) is still unavailable in the new regime. Extending this deduction, and enhancing it to ₹1 lakh under the new regime, would send a strong signal. Global evidence is clear: tax incentives drive long-term savings. A stronger NPS today means lower old-age dependency and reduced fiscal pressure tomorrow.India’s tax system still treats married couples as financial strangers. Introducing joint tax returns, with a higher exemption threshold for married couples, would recognise modern household economics—especially double-income families. Such a move would put more disposable income in the hands of families, improve tax equity and align India with global best practices. After all, if households plan together, why shouldn’t they file together?In sum, Budget 2026 doesn’t need fireworks. It needs fine-tuning. Fewer forms, fairer taxes, clearer rules, and smarter incentives could go a long way in making taxation less intimidating—and more humane.","The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers.

India has a river that flows backwards: Know which river it is,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/india-has-a-river-that-flows-backwards-know-which-river-it-is/articleshow/126525975.cms,"The Narmada river flows in the opposite direction and here’s why

The origin of the Narmada River

The reason why the Narmada flow westwards

What landscapes does the river support

Dams and projects that lie on the river

Natural sites found along the Narmada

Narmada and its importance for faith and culture





India’s river systems are usually described as following a clear pattern. Most major rivers rise in the Himalayas or the central highlands and travel eastward to the Bay of Bengal, a rule taught early in geography lessons and seldom challenged. Yet one notable river defies this logic. Flowing westward across the subcontinent, it reshapes landscapes, livelihoods, and belief systems along its course. Far from obscure or insignificant, this river is long, deeply revered, and extensively studied, though its direction often surprises first-time learners. The Narmada stands apart not for its size or speed alone, but because its westward journey is dictated by geology rather than convention.The river that flows west instead of east is the Narmada. Extending roughly 1,310 kilometres, it is the fifth-longest river in India. Unlike major rivers such as the Ganga or the Godavari, the Narmada does not flow into the Bay of Bengal. From its point of origin, it maintains a steady westward path before eventually emptying into the Arabian Sea. Only a handful of major Indian rivers follow this course, with the Tapi being another prominent example.The idea that the Narmada flows “backwards” exists simply because most rivers in the region move in the opposite, eastward direction.The Narmada begins at Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh. The area is forested and also known as a place of pilgrimage. From here, the river starts moving west. It passes through Madhya Pradesh, briefly touches Maharashtra, and then enters Gujarat. Its journey ends near Bharuch, where it reaches the Arabian Sea. Along the way, the river then changes character. While in some places, it cuts through hills and narrow valleys, in other places, it opens out and slows down. The upper stretches feel remote, while the lower ones feel settled.Geology shapes the Narmada's flow direction. It flows across a rift valley caused by previous tectonic action. The valley slopes east to west. Water follows the slope. The Vindhya Range sits to the north of the basin, while the Satpura Range extends to the south. Because the river passes through this gap, it behaves differently than many others. It does not form a wide delta. Instead, it creates an estuary where it joins the sea.The Narmada basin covers varied terrain. The upper areas are hilly and forested, with fewer people living nearby. Further west, the land becomes flatter and more open. These plains are fertile. Farming depends heavily on the river here. Crops such as wheat, pulses, and cotton are common. The river also supplies drinking water. Over time, canals and reservoirs have extended its reach. Towns and cities along the river rely on it in quiet, everyday ways.Several large dams have been built along the Narmada. The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is the most widely known. Others include the Indira Sagar Dam and the Omkareshwar Dam in Madhya Pradesh. These projects generate electricity and supply water for farming and households. They have also changed how the river flows. Over the years, they have been linked to debates about land, displacement, and environmental impact. These discussions continue.The river is also associated with well known natural features. Near Jabalpur, it passes between tall marble cliffs known as the Marble Rocks. Close by, the Dhuandhar Falls send water crashing down in a thick spray, especially during the monsoon. These places are not vast, but they leave an impression. The river here feels contained. The sound carries. The landscape holds it in place.For numerous individuals, the Narmada signifies more than merely a river. Temples in Maheshwar, Omkareshwar, and Amarkantak attract pilgrims year-round. Some individuals undertake the Narmada Parikrama, an extensive pilgrimage along its banks. The river is regarded as a living entity. Its trajectory has remained consistent across generations. Throughout its extent, faith, establishment, and customary practices persist in expanding around it.","The Narmada is the fifth-longest river in India.

Passports are often treated as background documents, noticed only at airports or borders. Yet their strength shapes how easily people can move across the world. Global passport rankings measure this strength by counting how many destinations can be entered without arranging a visa in advance. These include visa-free access, a visa on arrival, and electronic travel authorisation. The higher the number, the fewer barriers a traveller faces. In 2026, the latest Henley Passport Index reports again show a clear gap between the most powerful passports and the rest. The countries at the top benefit from long-standing diplomatic ties, economic stability, and reciprocal agreements.According to the Henley Passport Index ranking, India's passport has become slightly more powerful in 2026, albeit it is still not among the strongest in the world. While rising up to 80th rank, Indian visitors can now enter 55 countries without seeking for a visa in advance or receiving one upon arrival. For travellers, this ranking is about actual freedom more than reputation. They have an impact on cost, planning time, and the speed with which a voyage can be completed when the need or opportunity arises.Singapore holds the top position with access to 192 destinations.This marks its third consecutive year at number one. The passport’s strength reflects the country’s strong diplomatic reach and reputation for stability. While it lost visa-free access to a small number of countries over the past year, it gained entry to Papua New Guinea, keeping its overall score high. Singapore’s role as a financial and transport hub continues to support its global mobility.Japan and South Korea share second place with access to 188 destinations. Both countries have built extensive travel agreements over decades. Their passports benefit from trust built through trade, tourism, and political alignment with many regions. Although neither sits at the very top this year, they remain among the most flexible for short-notice international travel.Denmark, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland occupy third place with scores of 186. These countries benefit from European Union agreements alongside separate bilateral arrangements. Their citizens can move easily within Europe and beyond. Stability, strong institutions, and consistent foreign policy help maintain this level of access year after year.Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and the Netherlands all rank fourth with access to 185 destinations. The grouping reflects similar travel privileges rather than shared geography alone. These passports offer broad reach across the Americas, Asia, and Africa, supported by long-established diplomatic networks.Hungary, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the United Arab Emirates sit at rank five with 184 destinations. The UAE stands out as a newer entrant to the top tier, reflecting rapid diplomatic expansion. The European countries in this group continue to benefit from EU mobility and steady international relations.Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Malta, New Zealand, and Poland share sixth place with 183 destinations. These passports combine regional access with growing global reach. New Zealand’s inclusion highlights how geographic isolation does not prevent strong travel freedom when trust and agreements are in place.Australia, Latvia, Liechtenstein, and the United Kingdom rank seventh with 182 destinations. The UK remains high despite changes to its relationship with the European Union. Its passport still offers wide access, though the pace of expansion has slowed compared with earlier years.Canada joins Iceland and Lithuania at rank eight with access to 181 destinations. Canada’s position reflects steady, rather than growing, mobility. Its passport remains strong for leisure and business travel, even if it no longer leads the rankings.Malaysia ranks ninth with access to 180 destinations. It is the only Southeast Asian country in the top ten besides Singapore. Its passport strength reflects regional agreements and growing international ties, giving its holders broad travel options.The United States completes the top ten with connectivity to 179 destinations.

Delhi air quality: AQI at many stations touches ‘severe-plus’ for several hours; experts warn of health risks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/aqi-at-many-stations-touches-severe-plus-for-several-hours/articleshow/126657451.cms,"Delhi Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.







NEW DELHI: The air quality index at several monitoring stations in Delhi touched the extreme end of the severe category for several hours on Sunday. On a scale of zero to 500, Anand Vihar touched 497, followed by 491 each in Mundka and Rohini. All three are in the severe-plus range (451 and above).Out of 37 active continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations, the day's standard reading — the one taken at 4pm — was severe (401-450) at 32 stations and very poor (301-400) at five. The lowest reading in the city was 356 in Ayanagar.As the air started worsening from Saturday onwards, many stations saw the index remaining above 480 for long stretches on Sunday. Most of them are the usual pollution hotspots: Nehru Nagar in Lajpat Nagar (488), Sonia Vihar (487), Wazirpur (486), Ashok Vihar (485), Bawana (483), Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium (483) and North Campus of Delhi University (481).The index is calculated using eight individual pollutants — particulate matter 10, PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, ammonia and lead — at every monitoring location using its 24-hourly average concentration value (eight-hourly in the case of carbon monoxide and ozone).The worst sub-index is shown as the reading for that location.Many of these pollutants had much higher levels than the standard at several locations. In Anand Vihar, the hourly PM2.5 concentration reached 890 micrograms per cubic metre at 1 am. It was almost 15 times higher than the daily national ambient air quality standard of 60µg/m³ and 59 times higher than World Health Organisation's daily safe guideline. In Nehru Nagar, it touched a peak of 952µg/m³ on Saturday night, data from Delhi Pollution Control Committee showed.Experts said local emissions and unfavourable meteorological conditions caused the index readings to shoot up.Dipankar Saha, former head of Central Pollution Control Board's air laboratory, said, ""Air quality is dependent on the local emissions and wind speed. Wind speed helps dispersion and dilution of these emissions. In the absence of adequate ventilation, pollutants may stagnate, resulting in poor air quality. Such stagnation is highly toxic and may cause ailments in the long run, particularly in children and the elderly.

NOIDA: The region's air quality deteriorated sharply into the ‘severe' category on Sunday after remaining in the ‘very poor' range for five days on trot. Visibility remained poor during the morning hours, dropping to as low as 100m.Noida logged an AQI of 430 against Saturday's 338, while Greater Noida's AQI shifted to 402 from 332. In Ghaziabad, the AQI was recorded at 458, compared to 394 the day before.Delhi's AQI stood at 440, against 428 on Saturday. This was the highest Jan reading since the index had touched 447 on Jan 14, 2024, and the joint-worst on record for the second half of the month — 440 was also the reading on Jan 17, 2019According to the data from Central Pollution Control Board's portal, Ghaziabad recorded the worst air quality in the country on Sunday. This also marked both Noida and Ghziabad's first ‘severe' air day of the year, with air quality largely ranging between ‘poor' and ‘very poor' for most of Jan.Data showed that all air monitoring stations in Noida recorded ‘severe' air on Sunday, with Sector 1 recording the worst AQI at 460, followed by Sector 116 (AQI 443), Sector 62 (AQI 410), and Sector 125 (AQI 406). In Greater Noida, Knowledge Park V (AQI 431) also recorded ‘severe' air, while Knowledge Park III (AQI 372) was in the ‘very poor' range.In Ghaziabad, too, all four air monitoring stations recorded ‘severe' air quality. Loni recorded the worst AQI at 479, followed by Vasundhara (AQI 475), Indirapuram (AQI 456), and Sanjay Nagar (AQI 422).Calm winds linked to a western disturbance, along with dense fog, led to the air quality plunging. The highest contribution of Delhi's air pollutants was from its own transport sector (12.5%), followed by emissions from GB Nagar at 12%, Ghaziabad (9.4%) and Bulandshahr at 8.34%, according to the Centre's Decision Support System.The air is likely to improve to ‘very poor' on Monday and remain within the range on Tuesday, according to the Centre's Air Quality Early Warning System.According to the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), on Monday, the city is expected to witness a partly cloudy sky, with moderate fog at many places and dense fog at isolated locations during the morning hours. The predominant surface wind is likely to be from the northeast, associated with calm conditions reaching up to 5 kmph in the morning, before increasing to around 12 kmph in the afternoon and then decreasing to about 8 kmph during the evening and night.In view of worsening air pollution levels, the CAQM implemented Stage IV ofGRAP on Saturday.The minimum temperature was 5.3 degrees Celsius on Sunday, two notches below normal, and 0.9°C higher than Saturday's minimum. As cold wave conditions eased across the region, the minimum is predicted to rise to around 9°C to 11°C by Jan 23. Delhi may receive very light rain on Jan 23 under the influence of a fresh western disturbance, said a Met official.","Noida logged an AQI of 430 against Saturday's 338, while Greater Noida's AQI shifted to 402 from 332.

Big relief for EPFO members! Subscribers can now withdraw PF via UPI; rollout expected by April,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/big-relief-for-epfo-members-subscribers-can-now-withdraw-pf-via-upi-rollout-expected-by-april/articleshow/126611464.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) subscribers will soon be able to withdraw their provident fund savings directly into their bank accounts using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The system is expected to be operational by April 2026.The move is aimed at simplifying access to funds and reducing delays in withdrawals for the country’s eight crore EPFO members.Currently, EPF members must file withdrawal claims, a process that can be time-consuming. Under the new system, a portion of the EPF will be frozen as a minimum balance, while the rest can be transferred directly to members’ bank accounts using their linked UPI PIN for secure transactions. Once credited, the funds can be used for payments or ATM withdrawals, according to news agency PTI.According to the agency, EPFO is working to resolve software glitches to ensure smooth implementation.“This system will benefit around eight crore members,” the official familiar with the matter said. Under the auto-settlement mode, withdrawal claims are electronically settled without manual intervention within three days.The claim limit for auto-settlement has already been increased from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, enabling members to access funds quickly for illness, education, marriage, and housing purposes.EPFO first introduced online auto-settlement of advance claims during the Covid-19 pandemic to provide timely assistance. However, all members had to file claims to access their own funds. The new system will eliminate this step, easing the burden on the EPFO, which processes over five crore claims annually.The source clarified that EPFO cannot allow unrestricted direct withdrawals as it does not hold banking licences, but the government aims to make EPFO services at par with banks.In October 2025, the EPFO’s apex decision-making body, the Central Board of Trustees (CBT), approved simplification and liberalisation of partial withdrawal provisions. Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya has since approved the minutes of the meeting, which will be formally notified shortly.Under the revised provisions, partial withdrawals have been streamlined from 13 complex rules into three categories: Essential Needs (illness, education, marriage), Housing Needs and Special Circumstances.Members can now withdraw up to 100 percent of their eligible balance, including both employee and employer contributions, while maintaining 25 per cent as a minimum balance to continue earning interest at the current 8.25 per cent per annum.This rationalisation ensures members can access funds easily while preserving a substantial retirement corpus. With simplified procedures, zero documentation and 100 percent auto-settlement for eligible withdrawals, the new system is expected to significantly enhance the ease of living for EPF members.",EPFO subscribers will soon be able to withdraw their provident fund savings directly into their bank accounts using the Unified Payments Interface.

‘Daily Struggle To Survive’: Lawyer Exposes Grim Reality For Air India Crash Families





: The families of nine British victims of the AI 171 June 12, 2025 plane crash are suing Air India in the London high court.The families have filed a joint legal claim for personal injury and damages in the King’s Bench Division through their law firm.James Healy-Pratt, aviation partner at Keystone Law, said: “High court proceedings have been issued against Air India but have not yet been formally served on them. This is against the backdrop of upcoming confidential negotiations in London. Hopefully the parties will resolve their claims through such dialogue without the need for a trial.”When contacted by TOI, Air India declined to comment.The Boeing 787 crashed in Ahmedabad shortly after take-off; 241 of the 242 people on board perished.Mariam Javed Ali Syed (35) a brand ambassador at Harrods, and her husband Javed Ali Syed (37), manager at the Best Western Kensington Olympia Hotel, and their children, Zayn (6) and Amani (4), died in the crash. The family had gone to India to celebrate Eid and look after Javed’s mother, Farida. A claim has been brought by Syeda Minnat, the administrator of Mariam’s estate, and two relatives, Sadaf Javed and Syed Ali Hassan.Ramesh Hirani (51), the founder of Reset From Diabetes, was in India developing a wellness project when his life was cut short. He left a wife, Tina, and their three children. His claim is being brought by his brother Pritesh Hirani (53) and his mother Amarbai Hirani.Ashok Patel (74) and his wife Shobhanaben Patel (71), from Gujarat, who had settled in the UK in 1978, died on the Gatwick-bound flight. They had gone to India on a spiritual pilgrimage. Their sons Miten and Hemit Patel are bringing the legal action.Ketan Kumar Shah Bharatbhai (43), from Dorset, had come to India to visit his sick father in Padra, Vadodara. A claim is being brought by his wife Megha and two children, Vyom and Yhavi.Lawrence Christian (30), from Maninagar, Gujarat, who was living in London, had gone to India to perform the last rites for his father, Daniel, and was killed on his return home. His wife, Ayushi, is bringing the legal action.Last July Air India announced an interim payment of Rs 25 lakh to the families of all the deceased passengers, and to Viswashkumar Ramesh, the sole survivor of the crash, which would be adjusted against any final compensation.Ramesh (39) is now back in Leicester. He is using a different law firm and is not involved in this HC case. His spokesperson, Sanjiv Patel, told TOI: “Mr Ramesh’s legal claim remains ongoing, and he is currently undergoing rehabilitation. Our focus remains on his recovery, with appropriate care and support being coordinated.”","Families of nine British victims of the AI 171 June 12, 2025 plane crash are suing Air India in the London high court.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge Labs is a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

YouTuber MrBeast says “I have negative money”; cannot buy a McDonald’s meal despite $5 billion company valuation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/youtuber-mrbeast-says-i-have-negative-money-cannot-buy-a-mcdonalds-meal-despite-5-billion-company-valuation/articleshow/126557701.cms,"YouTuber MrBeast

MrBeast’s 'Beast Industries' hits $5 billion valuation, but personal liquidity tells a different story



MrBeast’s Forbes net worth vs. personal cash



MrBeast: “I actually have negative money”



Focus on reinvesting, not personal savings



High-cost decisions driven by time constraints



MrBeast borrowed money for his wedding



Multiple ventures under the MrBeast brand







Jimmy Donaldson, widely known as MrBeast, is one of the most well-known people on YouTube. He runs a business and content empire that reaches hundreds of millions of people around the world, and he's only 27. His videos often have big challenges, giving back, and record-breaking prize money. People often think that MrBeast is personally wealthy in the traditional sense, with lots of money on hand, because of how he looks to the public. But a recent interview has brought a different side of his financial situation to light. Donaldson was honest about money and said that even though the company he started is worth billions, his own bank account tells a very different story. He said he has ""negative money"" and is currently borrowing money, even for big life events. His comments have brought attention to the differences between startup valuations, equity ownership, and personal liquidity, especially for founders who keep putting money into growth. The conversation gives us a better idea of how digital businesses work today and how money is often tied up on paper instead of cash.Beast Industries, MrBeast's main business, is at the heart of what he does.As per a report from Fortune in September 2025, the company is now worth $5 billion. Donaldson owns a little more than half of the company, which gives him a big stake in it. Beast Industries runs a number of businesses, such as making big YouTube videos, creating branded content, and making consumer goods. The value takes into account the company's reach, potential for revenue, and high levels of audience engagement across platforms.But the value of a company is not the same as the cash it has on hand. A valuation is what investors think the business is worth based on how much money it will make and how fast it will grow in the future. It is not the amount of money the founder has to spend every day.Forbes said that MrBeast's net worth was $85 million in June 2025. This number includes the worth of his stake in Beast Industries and other things he owns. Donaldson has made it clear that most of this net worth is in stocks and not cash.He talked about common ideas about his wealth in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He said that a lot of people think he is a billionaire, but that is because they mix up his net worth with his available cash. He said that it is not easy to use equity in a company for everyday expenses unless it is sold or converted, which he has decided not to do.Donaldson said something very interesting about his finances during the interview. He said, ""I really... I have negative money right now."" I am borrowing money. He also said that if you take away the equity value of his company, many viewers would technically have more money in their bank accounts than he does.He gave a simple example to explain the situation, saying that company equity can't be used to buy a McDonald’s meal in the morning. This comment made it clear that there is a difference between wealth on paper and money you can actually spend.Donaldson said that his focus on work and growth affects how he handles his money. He said he doesn't think about his bank balance very often. Instead, he is focused on making videos and growing his businesses.He has said many times that a lot of the money he makes goes back into making more content. He says that spending on making content alone is expected to reach about $250 million in one year. This model of reinvesting in productions allows for more complicated works, bigger prizes, and higher production standards, which are now a defining feature of his brand.Donaldson has made some expensive spending choices when he needed to, even though he keeps a small personal account. He told one story about how he rented a private jet to see his fiancée, Thea Booysen, who was studying in the UK at the time.He said that because of where he lived and when he worked, commercial travel took a lot of time. It took a long drive and a lot of layovers to get to a big airport. Donaldson says that a private jet cut down on travel time a lot, which meant he could keep working without losing almost a whole day to travel. The flight is said to have cost about $150,000.Donaldson told people on social media in June 2025 that he had borrowed money from his mother to help pay for his wedding. He said that this happened because he put most of his money back into his businesses.He also pointed out how ironic it was that he owned companies worth billions of dollars but still needed short-term personal loans. He said again that even though the businesses look very valuable on paper, that value doesn't always turn into cash that you can use for yourself.Donaldson's business portfolio includes several big projects, not just YouTube videos. One of them is ""Beast Games,"" a competition series that gave its first-season winner $10 million, which is one of the biggest single prizes in entertainment history. Feastables is another important business. It's a consumer brand that focuses on chocolate and snack foods, and it has grown quickly in retail markets.All of these projects need a lot of money up front. Donaldson's strategy of reinvesting rather than taking personal income is supported by high operating costs, which come from prize money, production costs, staffing, and logistics.","Jimmy Donaldson, widely known as MrBeast, is one of the most well-known people on YouTube.

Record spending planned as global health indicators worsen

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason





Bill Gates has started putting in place the first major steps toward closing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s most-influential philanthropic organisations. The foundation recently announced that it will spend a record $9 billion in 2026, its highest annual budget so far, while also preparing to cut up to 500 staff positions over the next five years. According to a Fortune report, these moves follow Gates’ decision last year to formally wind down the foundation by 2045, after spending roughly $200 billion over two decades.The latest plan marks a significant shift for the foundation at a time when many of its long-term focus areas — including global health, poverty, and US education — are under pressure due to cuts in international aid.Gates Foundation was established in 2000 as a nonprofit fighting poverty, disease, and inequity around the world. Bill Gates and his former -wife are among the top donators to the foundation. Together, they contributed $60.2 billion to the endowment through 2024. Warren Buffett, who is a former trustee and a clsowe friend of Gates donated $43.3 billion from 2006 to 2024.The foundation’s board has approved a cap on operating costs, limiting them to $1.25 billion a year, or about 14% of its budget.To meet that limit, the organisation will reduce its workforce from the current 2,375 roles, including by leaving some positions unfilled.Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said the reductions will be gradual:“We will do this thoughtfully, carefully, and systematically … We’ll be recalibrating it every year. That 500-person target is a maximum target. I very much hope that we won’t have to do it as large as that number.”Suzman said operating costs were projected to reach 18% by 2030 if no action was taken.The $9 billion budget for 2026 includes increases for programmes focused on women’s health, vaccines, polio, AI tools, and education. Gates recently wrote that global health indicators slipped last year, noting that child deaths increased for the first time in two decades.“The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools,” Gates wrote. Still, he said he remains optimistic about long-term progress.The foundation plans to accelerate spending in three key areas:• maternal and child health• infectious disease prevention• poverty reductionNotably, Bill Gates has repeatedly warned about risks from artificial intelligence (AI) but is also investing in its development. The foundation joined a coalition pledging $1 billion toward AI tools for public-sector workers in the U.S.AI remains one of the programmes that will continue to grow, Suzman confirmed.The foundation is also expanding operations in Africa and India, creating a new division focused on the two regions. Work on HIV and tuberculosis will increasingly shift from Seattle to Africa.Despite its planned closure, Suzman said the foundation still has two decades to operate and aims to make its most significant impact during that time.“We are moving into what I believe is going to be the most impactful period of the Gates Foundation,” he said.","Gates Foundation was established in 2000 as a nonprofit fighting poverty, disease, and inequity around the world.

State-owned Nalco is open to venturing into mining of rare earth elements (REEs) with its bid advisor conducting due diligence on domestic auctions for REEs, magnesium and chromite blocks, its CMD Brijendra Pratap Singh Monday said.The move signals National Aluminium Company Ltd's (Nalco) diversification strategy beyond bauxite and alumina, targeting high-value critical minerals essential for electronics, defence, renewables and electric vehicles REEs are important for magnets in wind turbines, EV motors and missile guidance systems. India, heavily import-dependent with negligible domestic output, views REE self-reliance as key to Atmanirbhar Bharat and reducing China's 80 per cent global dominance amid US-China trade tensions.In an interview to PTI here, the Chairman-cum-Managing Director (CMD) said the bid advisor will assess mine viability, optimal acquisition premiums and participation in upcoming auctions.""The bid advisor will assess if we should participate in domestic auctions of REEs,"" Singh said.Nalco, Singh said, is also conducting due diligence for acquiring a stake in an operational lithium mine in Australia through Khanij Bidesh India Ltd (KABIL).KABIL is a joint venture between Nalco, Hindustan Copper Ltd and Mineral Exploration and Consultancy Ltd.All three are PSUs under Ministry of Mines. The stake purchase would ensure a minimum guaranteed offtake of lithium for import to India, bolstering domestic supply for EV batteries and renewables amid global shortage.""The due diligence is going on,"" he explained. Lithium, a cornerstone of the clean energy transition, faces supply constraints with demand surging for India's EV push and net-zero goals.Nalco, with a 40 per cent stake in KABIL, plans to potentially raise it to 50 per cent to fund overseas critical mineral acquisitions. The company, he said, has prioritised maximising volumes, cutting costs and ensuring customer satisfaction in 2026, while fast-tracking key expansion projects.""Our first priority is to see our existing operations operate to the fullest capacities. We will maximise our volumes and reduce our costs. Customer satisfaction is one area where we have to focus -- be it quality, packaging or cost -- and align all our operations as per customer requirements,"" the CMD said.On expansion plans, he said the fifth stream refinery would be commissioned in June 2026, making it the ""topmost priority"".""We also target to start the Pottangi bauxite mines in June 2026,"" he added.The official further outlined the next phase of expansion involving a 0.5 million tonne smelter capacity along with a 1,080 MW power plant.National Aluminium Company Ltd, a 'Navratna' public sector undertaking, is one of country's leading integrated complexes in the aluminium value chain having bauxite mining, alumina refining, aluminium smelting including power generation and coal mines.","State-owned Nalco is open to venturing into mining of rare earth elements (REEs) with its bid advisor conducting due diligence on domestic auctions.

FIRs drive down drunk driving cases by 39%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/step-up-police-presence-on-mumbai-streets-to-improve-traffic-discipline/articleshow/126668401.cms,"File photo







MUMBAI: Over 5700 cases were registered against drunk drivers in city in 2025, down 39% from 9462 cases recorded annually in 2024. Traffic Police have attributed this reduction in numbers to registration of FIRs against offenders which began around the middle of last year. Also, over 2400 driving licences of offenders were sent to Regional Transport Offices (RTO) last year for suspension.Earlier, the police used to record cases under local acts (LACs) against drunk drivers, but this was not proving to be deterrant enough.In 2024, an inebriated Mihir Shah, 24, was allegedly speeding at Worli Seaface when his BMW hit a couple commuting on a scooter. Pradeep Nakhwa, who was riding the scooter, fell on the bonnet while his wife was dragged for almost two kilometres and died. Shah was arrested two days after the incident. His father, a former member of Shiv Sena (Shinde faction), and driver were also arrested for shielding him and arranging his escape.After the incident, then Chief Minister Eknath Shinde instructed the police to initiate strict action against drunk drivers and underscored the need to carry more checks at nights and at weekends. The number of drunk driving cases recorded in 2024 was very high.In mid-2025, the traffic police took the decision of registering FIRs against offenders. Between April and Dec 2025, the police recorded 3228 cognisable offences, under provisions of Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita and Motor Vehicles Act.""After registration of an FIR, the motorist's driving licence is seized and sent to the RTO for suspension. He has to appear before court. After the case is chargesheeted, it goes to trial where evidence in the form of breath analysis report is produced,"" explained an officer. Registration of FIR can also impact the motorist's employment prospects and his passport application.""The impact of registration of FIRs against drunk drivers was seen on New Year's Eve 2025 also when the number of cases (211) were lower as compared to 333 cases recorded on Dec 31, 2024,"" said joint commissioner, traffic, Anil Kumbhare.Activist AV Shenoy of Mumbai Vikas Samiti commended the police's move but added that visible policing on streets must be stepped up for improving traffic discipline among motorists. ""Traffic violations should be segragated into categories on the basis of risk to life. For instance, riding in the wrong direction and extremely high speeds must be categorised as high-risk offences, just like drunk driving, and such offenders shouldn't be let off with just a challan,"" said Shenoy.","Over 5700 cases were registered against drunk drivers in city in 2025, down 39% from 9462 cases recorded annually in 2024.

After hitting a fresh alltime high of 26373 on January 5, the Nifty index has slipped into a corrective phase. The decline, however, has been orderly, taking support near the 100day EMA, a key technical zone that has held firm for the past five sessions. At present, the index is hovering around this level, reflecting consolidation rather than any signs of panic selling.On the weekly chart, Nifty has formed a Doji candle, highlighting indecision among market participants—largely influenced by the anticipation of Q3 earnings from heavyweight constituents such as Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank. The key question now is whether this consolidation is simply a pause before the next upward leg, or a setup for a deeper corrective move.Technically, the 20day EMA continues to slope downward, while the 50day and 100day EMAs remain flat, underscoring the lack of strong trend direction. Momentum indicators echo this neutral setup—the daily RSI has been stuck within a narrow 38.55–42.84 band for five straight sessions, signalling subdued momentum and a clear wait-and-watch stance among traders. Such prolonged compression in momentum often precedes a decisive move, but the direction remains uncertain.Going forward, the upcoming earnings from major index heavyweights are expected to act as the primary catalyst for Nifty’s next directional move. On the upside, the 20day EMA zone of 25900–25950 will serve as a key barrier. A sustained move above 25950 could trigger a swift rebound toward 26200, with further potential to test 26500 in the short term. Conversely, the 25500–25450 range remains a critical support zone, and a decisive break below 25450 may accelerate the ongoing correction.Bank Nifty continued its strong outperformance against the frontline indices for the second consecutive week. While the broader market remained largely flat, the banking benchmark gained 1.42%, further cementing its relative strength. On the weekly chart, the index has formed a bullish candle with a minor lower shadow, signalling steady buying interest at lower levels.The Bank Nifty–Nifty ratio chart has now reached a 132week high, reaffirming the sustained phase of outperformance. Technically, the index remains in a robust uptrend, supported by its position above all key moving averages. Momentum indicators also validate the positive setup, with the daily RSI holding above 60 and trending higher, indicating strengthening bullish momentum.Looking ahead, the Q3 earnings of heavyweights HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, set to be released over the weekend, are expected to act as major catalysts and could play an important role in determining the index’s next directional move.In terms of key levels, the zone of 60400–60500 is likely to act as a significant resistance area. A decisive breakout above 60500 could pave the way for a sharp rally toward 61200, with an extended move possible up to 62000 in the near term. On the downside, the region of 59400–59300 will remain an immediate and crucial support zone for the index.LTIM has delivered a decisive downward-sloping trendline breakout on the daily chart, signalling a shift in trend. Over the last seven sessions, the stock has consistently held above its 50-day EMA, which continues to act as a strong dynamic support. Friday’s breakout was backed by a healthy surge in trading volumes, adding credibility to the move.Momentum indicators are supportive, with RSI jumping sharply and sustaining above 60, while MACD has crossed above both the zero line and its signal line, indicating strengthening bullish momentum. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 6,310-6,290 with a stoploss of 6,110. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 6,740 in the short term.ULTRACEMCO has formed a sizable bullish candle on the daily chart and closed decisively above its previous swing high of 12,250, supported by a notable surge in volumes over the last two sessions. The 50-day EMA has provided reliable support in two of the last four sessions, reinforcing the short-term bullish structure, while also aligning with the Bollinger Band midline.Importantly, Bollinger Bands have begun to widen after a prolonged narrow phase, signalling expansion in volatility and the potential start of a trending move. RSI rising near 68 highlights strengthening bullish momentum. Hence, we recommend to accumulate the stock in the zone of 12,400-12,300 with a stoploss of 11,900. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of 13,260 in the short term.","Sudeep Shah, Head - Technical Research and Derivatives, SBI Securities, says top stock picks for this week are LTIMindtree Ltd and UltraTech Cement.

President Donald Trump’s proposed “Board of Peace” is being positioned as a new international peacekeeping body, with member countries invited to extend their participation beyond an initial three-year term by contributing more than $1 billion within the board’s first year.According to a draft charter reviewed by The New York Times, the board was originally conceived as part of Trump’s plan to oversee post-war administration in the Gaza Strip, the draft charter makes no mention of Gaza.The omission has fueled speculation that the body could be given a far broader mandate, potentially covering multiple global conflicts and even serving as a US-led alternative to the United Nations Security Council.A UN Security Council resolution adopted in November 2025 had endorsed Trump’s proposal to end the war in Gaza and welcomed the creation of the board as a transitional authority to set the framework and coordinate funding for Gaza’s redevelopment. However, the charter appears to outline a significantly more expansive role than that described in Trump’s Gaza plan published in October 2025 or in the subsequent Security Council resolution.The draft charter was circulated with invitations to prospective members over the weekend. An official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the diplomacy involved, confirmed the document’s authenticity. Bloomberg had earlier reported the $1 billion buy-in requirement.On Friday, the White House announced that the board’s initial members would include secretary of state Marco Rubio, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and World Bank President Ajay Banga. Other people included in the executive board are US special envoy Steve Witkoff, former UK PM Tony Blair, billionnare Marc Rowan and US national security advisor Robert Gabriel.- Canada- Turkey- Egypt- Paraguay- Argentina- Albania",President Donald Trump’s proposed “Board of Peace’ is being positioned as a new international peacekeeping body.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
