In the last 10 years, he said, violent incidents in the northeast have reduced by 71%, and civilian deaths have reduced by 86%, thanks to the various peace agreements and boundary dispute settlement accords signed by the Modi regime.Stating that it is now time to give a big push to the country’s efforts to become a 5 trillion dollar economy through the development of northeast, Shah said the ministries of DONER and the North Eastern Council (NEC) are working to implement the mantra of “Act East, Act Fast, and Act First” to achieve this.Praising NEC for having served as an important platform over the past 50 years for discussing the aspirations, needs, and potential solutions to challenges before thr northeast, Shah said it has become the blueprint for the development of the region.

He underlined that it is crucial for the northeast to attract industrial investment, and efforts to accelerate this need to be intensified.With preparations underway to fully implement three new criminal laws across all the states in the Northeast, Shah said the focus of the police, now that violence has almost ceased in the Northeast, must be on ensuring that every citizen in the region is granted their constitutional rights to property, honor, and family protection.",Home minister Amit Shah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision and sensitivity for development of the northeast region has worked.

Experts debate ‘forest cover’ definition after release of forest survey report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-debate-forest-cover-definition-after-release-of-forest-survey-report/articleshow/116548075.cms,"DEHRADUN: The release of Forest Survey of India published ‘ India State of Forest Report ’, on Saturday, evoked mixed response from experts. Many continued to debate on why the plantation of trees outside forests was not counted as green cover, considering that it is a place that is “habitat to myriad animals and endless microorganism and invisible lives thriving on that ecosystem”.B K Singh, retd principal of chief conservator of forests and head of forest force, Karnataka, said, “We have added 1445 sq km of forest and tree cover in two years. Of this, the increase in forest cover is only 156 sq km, and more interesting is that it is only 7 sq km in recorded forests. Forest and tree cover areas put together are 8,27,357 sq km, where the forest cover is a sizable chunk of 7,15,343 sq km. The increase is quite meagre, as compared to the size. Forest departments have been planting in recorded forests at the rate of 100 sq km annually. Why do these plantations not show an increase in cover?”He further said that around 7 sq km has been lost in mangroves. “Again, coastal states are planting mangroves, and the report shows a loss in mangroves. Deforestation is continuing all over, and the report has attempted to cover that,” he added.Environmentalists said that the forest department’s efforts should be assessed and discussed in the biennial report rather than public areas and plantations. Veteran environmentalist Ravi Chopra said, “For quite some time, the ministry has been recording the trees outside of the forest department and the forests in its estimates of the forest cover. It appears from a quick glance of the report that much of the increase has taken place in trees outside of the designated forest area and therefore, it would be incorrect to pat the ministry on its back. For all we know, this may be people’s efforts on tree planting. In fact, if we look at Uttarakhand, there are so many landslides that are taking place that we should be losing forest cover under the forest department. The new plantations ought not to be counted as forest cover until the plants have matured.”(Inputs from Pankul Sharma)","The release of Forest Survey of India published ‘ India State of Forest Report ’, on Saturday, evoked mixed response from experts.

The target is to reclaim these areas and completely eliminate Left-wing extremism by March 2026,” an official told TOI.With counter-Naxal operations in top gear, 287 Naxalites were neutralised, 992 arrested and 837 Maoists surrendered this year.Engagements initiated by the security forces against Left-wing extremists in 2024 have been the highest in the past four years, with Chhattisgarh alone witnessing 112 of a total 156 such encounters recorded nationwide. Significantly, 102 of these 112 engagements were in the seven districts of Bastar division.A three-dimensional strategy to defeat LWE- which includes strengthening of the security grid by replacing the defensive approach with offensive one; better coordination between the Central and state agencies; and pushing development in LWE-hit villages such that locals experience the fruits of governance that had been craftily blocked by the Maoists -- is credited for shrinkage in LWE-hit area by in the last 10 years.The offensive approach has seen the forces move deeper into what for long were Naxal strongholds, procure sophisticated weapons like sniper rifles for forces deployed in ‘core’ areas, and employ innovative force-multipliers like all-terrain armoured trucks and drones to overwhelm the Maoists. Location, mobiles, social media analysis and use of scientific methods like call logs and forensics are being tactically used to tighten the noose around Left-wing extremists.“The Centre, setting aside differences in political ideologies and ego issues, helped the LWE-hit states' tackle Naxals by deploying Central forces to reclaim Maoist areas, helicopter services, training, funds for better weapons and equipment, intelligence flow and offering assistance for the setting up of over 600 fortified police stations,” said an officer.Simultaneously, the funding channels of Maoists have been choked; over Rs 98 crore was seized from Left-wing extremists, of which states seized around Rs 22 crore and ED, Rs 11 crore. NIA registered 96 LWE cases and filed a chargesheet in 77 until Nov this year. It also got properties worth Rs 40 crore, allegedly linked to the Maoists, attached.Importantly, the improved security strategy is not being pursued in a vacuum; the 289 forward area bases (FOBs) or security camps set up by counter-Naxal forces in Red bastions, with more coming up, have created a secure bubble to facilitate development in the villages surrounding the camps. The key flagship schemes and welfare initiatives of the Modi govt are being rolled out in these villages in a mission mode, robbing the Maoists of a reason to exploit the grievances of villagers by brainwashing them into believing that the State is responsible for their poor living standards, said an officer.“Maoists themselves have been the biggest barrier between the villagers and development. With FOBs securing the areas freed of Maoists, schools, anganwadis and PDS shops are coming up fast in the surrounding villages. Locals are using the camps’ medical facilities and getting access to tap water and electricity,” a CRPF officer told TOI.","The area under Left-wing extremists' influence in south Chhattisgarh has shrunk to just 8,500 sq km from a sprawling 18,000 sq km “liberated’ area where Maoist writ ran a decade ago.

The US government supported India's request to extradite Tahawwur Rana, a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai attacks . The government called upon the top US court to reject ""the petition for a writ of certiorari"" submitted by Rana.Rana, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, recently petitioned the Supreme Court to block his extradition. The US Solicitor General, Elizabeth B. Prelogar , filed a response on December 16 urging the court to deny the petition.Rana had previously appealed his extradition in lower courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, but was unsuccessful. ""The (India US Extradition) Treaty permits Rana's extradition,"" the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had ruled in August.He then filed a ""petition for a writ of certiorari"" with the Supreme Court on November 13. This petition represents Rana’s final legal attempt to avoid extradition.A writ of certiorari is a request to a higher court to review a lower court's ruling. The term ""certiorari"" comes from Law Latin, meaning ""to be more fully informed.""Rana's ""petition for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"" contends that he was previously tried and cleared in the federal court of Northern District of Illinois (Chicago) regarding the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. His petition states, ""India now seeks to extradite him for trial on charges based on the identical conduct at issue in the Chicago case.""However, Prelogar argued that Rana is not exempt from extradition. She contends that the Indian charges against Rana are not fully identical to the charges he faced in a US federal court in Chicago. ""The government does not concede that all of the conduct on which India seeks extradition was covered by the government's prosecution in this case. For example, India's forgery charges are based in part on conduct that was not charged in the United States: petitioner's use of false information in an application to formally open a branch office of the Immigration Law Centre submitted to the Reserve Bank of India,"" she said as quoted by news agency PTI.She further explained that the prior US case against Rana, which resulted in an acquittal on some charges, does not cover all the conduct India intends to prosecute. ""It is not clear that the jury's verdict in this case - which involves conspiracy charges and was somewhat difficult to parse - means that he has been 'convicted or acquitted' on all of the specific conduct that India has charged.""","Tahawwur Rana is a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

"Luigi Mangione Bail: Luigi Mangione's lawyer speaks up on not seeking bail: 'I was blindsided, never seen anything...'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/luigi-mangiones-lawyer-speaks-up-on-not-seeking-bail-i-was-blindsided-never-seen-anything-/articleshow/116516268.cms,"Luigi Mangione's lawyer said she was blindsided by the spate of federal charges against her client.

Did lawyers make a wrong decision in not fighting extradition?



Luigi Mangione's lead attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo has spoken about not seeking a bail as Luigi Mangione the accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was present in a court in Manhattan Thursday after Mangione was extradited from Pennsylvania to New York. Mangione did not challenge the extradition indicating that his lawyers were prepared to fight in New York where he had been charged with first and second-degree murder.But Agnifilo did not apply for bail when Mangione was presented in the court in New York because by that time federal murder charges were imposed on her client. Agnifilo who appeared in the court relying on crutches told the court that she was blindsided by the federal charges as she never encountered something like this in her career of over three decades.Agnifilo said that Mangione was being charged with two separate crimes and the charges are very different.""These seem like two different cases,"" she said. ""The theory of the murder charge of the Manhattan DA case is terrorism and intimidating a group of people. This is stalking an individual.""""Is there one case, two cases, two investigations? Is there a joint investigation?"" Agnifilo asked Judge Kahterarine Parker. ""Frankly, I've never seen anything like that and what's happening here,"" she added. ""This is a highly unusual situation that we find ourselves in.""Mangione's next date of court appearance has been fixed on January 18, 2025.Luigi Mangione's Pennsylvania lawyer Thomas Dicky advised Mangione not to fight the extradition and to face the charges in New York. Explaining his decision, Dicky earlier said that facing the charges in New York was inevitable and hence they decided to focus on the main charges against Mangione instead of getting caught up in the procedural legalities. But at that time, Mangione's legal team did not have any idea that Mangione would be charged with federal murder.",Luigi Mangione's lawyer said she was blindsided by the spate of federal charges against her client.

and accusations against Roc Nation

Buzbee’s defense: Conspiracy and smear campaign

A troubling future for Buzbee's legal career

Texas lawyer Anthony Buzbee, a prominent figure in the Lone Star State’s legal landscape, is facing serious legal and public scrutiny following a series of shocking accusations. Known for his aggressive litigation style, Buzbee is no stranger to high-profile cases. Recently, however, his name has been thrust into the limelight for far more troubling reasons.Buzbee, who has represented a host of celebrity clients and high-profile cases, is now at the center of a lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Thursday, where he faces accusations of deliberately transmitting a sexually transmitted disease (STD) to a woman and causing physical harm.As per the report by the New York Post, the lawsuit, filed anonymously, alleges that in 2018, Buzbee “lured” the woman into a sexual encounter while concealing the fact that he was infected with a venereal disease. According to court documents, Buzbee “manipulated” the woman into silence, offering her free legal services in exchange for her compliance and to cover up his misconduct.The woman claims that Buzbee’s actions didn’t stop there. The lawsuit further alleges that after seeing her talk to another man at a bar in New York City, Buzbee became violently possessive, smashing a glass against her face and causing two broken teeth. The woman continued her relationship with Buzbee out of shame, as he was the only sexual partner she did not feel obligated to inform about her STD test results, reported the Post.In 2021, Buzbee allegedly represented the woman, referred to as Jane Doe, in her divorce case, using the legal proceedings to further manipulate her. The suit accuses him of doctoring medical records to make it appear as if her husband, not Buzbee, had infected her with the disease, and then attempting to blackmail her husband by sending a fraudulent demand letter.These allegations come on the heels of Buzbee's involvement in yet another high-profile lawsuit—one involving music mogul Jay-Z. In October, Buzbee filed a controversial lawsuit against Jay-Z and Sean “Diddy” Combs, accusing them of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl at a party in 2000. Jay-Z, through his lawyer, has denied the allegations, calling the suit “full of inconsistencies.”Buzbee, in turn, has accused Jay-Z’s Roc Nation of orchestrating a smear campaign against him. He claims the entertainment company has been soliciting former clients to file lawsuits against his law firm. Buzbee filed a suit in Texas, alleging that Roc Nation is engaging in illegal tactics to manipulate individuals into bringing frivolous cases against him.As these legal battles unfold, Buzbee's reputation as a powerful attorney is now mired in controversy. While he maintains that these lawsuits are part of a larger conspiracy to damage his career, the serious nature of the allegations against him is raising questions about his future in the legal world and the long-term impact on his career.","Texas lawyer Anthony Buzbee is accused of deliberately transmitting a sexually transmitted disease (STD) to a woman and causing physical harm.

Just imagining the feelings it would elicit years from now gives her delight about how revisiting it will bring to mind the joy and growth she's experienced.Steinfeld's little things that she puts in would be like ""watching a comfort movie"" or ""calling a friend."" One can easily assume Josh Allen will be part of some of those moments, from sharing any relaxing movie night to enjoying the chocolate chip cookies Steinfeld had planned for this week. Well, the fans, eagerly following their journey, are also excited about the couple's first Christmas as an engaged couple.Steinfeld's personal musings are just warm and cozy; Allen's career achievements are by no means inferior.

They were supposed to be in the car, but...

BENGALURU: ""A container truck going over the road divider and crashing on a car coming in the opposite direction, it was one of the most horrible accidents ever witnessed on this busy highway. Six innocent lives were snuffed out within seconds for no fault of theirs. Pulling each victim from the mangled remains of the SUV was heart-wrenching. These images are sure to haunt us for some time,"" recounted a fire service staffer at the accident spot near Nelamangala, where city-based automotive software company CEO Chandram Yegapagol and five of his family members were killed.The cause of the tragedy: A callous and mindless car driver who decided to slow down his vehicle in the middle of the road!Reconstructing the sequence of events, a Nelamangala policeman said: ""The tragedy was sparked by a thoughtless decision made by a car driver. A blue car ahead of the container truck suddenly slowed down in the middle of the road, possibly to search for a restaurant or exit. This abrupt slowdown forced the container truck driver, who was trailing the car, to brake hard. In the chaos, he lost control, causing the truck to veer across the divider and collide fatally with Chandram's Volvo SUV, which was moving in the opposite direction. The SUV was crushed beyond recognition, with the family caught in the tragic incident they couldn't have foreseen or avoided.With traffic coming to a halt, locals and fellow motorists rushed to the spot hoping to rescue the victims trapped in the SUV. Nelamangala fire station officer KN Siddavanappa said: ""Taking the container truck, which was laden with aluminium, off the car was a herculean task. The truck was so heavy it wouldn't budge an inch despite hundreds of people trying to push it to the side. Subsequently, four heavy-duty cranes had to be summoned to the spot. It took nearly three hours to lift the container.""Following this, the locals along with police tried to pull out the victims, but in vain. ""Extricating their bodies from the metal wreckage was also a big challenge, they were all dead in their seats,"" said Manjunath, a local volunteer. Based on Chandram's brother's complaint, Nelamangala traffic police registered a case against container truck driver Arif and have also launched a search for the blue car, which triggered the tragedy.Srinivasulu, an accounts manager in Chandram's company for the last five years, said: ""This is an unfortunate thing to have happened to all of us. Chandram was a very good employer. He had started the new company and we were all set to move into a new building in the next two months, the puja was also done. He told us he was taking off as he had to go to his village. His father, who was not keeping well, was discharged from hospital recently and he was eager to meet him. But fate had other designs. His death is a great loss for all of us."" Chandram had given employment to around 150 people and was planning to expand in Pune.Two family members narrowly escaped being part of the tragedy, their stories underscoring the twist of fate that spared them. Shashikanth, nephew of Chandram, recounted how close he came to being in the ill-fated SUV. ""Yesterday, Chandram uncle asked me to come home with him. We were supposed to travel together to the village today. But I couldn't get leave from work. And now, this has happened,"" he said, wiping away tears.Chandram had bought the SUV during Deepavali and this was a long trip planned. Another relative, Veena said: ""Chandram had invited me to travel with them. When I last spoke to him on the phone, he said they had crossed the city. I had planned to join them later by bus in the evening, but the accident happened and the loss of my family is unbearable.""","Chandram Yegapagol and five of his family members were killed.

What is Tailgating?

The history of Tailgating

Tailgating tradition now

Tailgating, a pre-game gathering, has evolved from a simple gathering in American football to an essential part of the sports and entertainment experience. This article explores top locations for tailgates, unique traditions, and creative ideas for modern celebrations. It highlights the best places to tailgate across college campuses and professional sporting event hotspots, shares unique traditions like BYU's donkey ritual, and provides themed party ideas for modern tailgate celebrations.Tailgating is a casual gathering prior to a football game where everyone has food and discusses Super Bowl predictions and game-day plans while sitting behind the back of their trucks parked in a parking lot outside the stadium. Unfamiliar faces would turn into friends before the players snap the ball. Tailgating is a perfect party to enjoy your team's glory with fellow fans, sharing the spirit which will transfer to the game itself. For the past 70 years, football tradition has been a big part of the Latine culture of the NFL.Tailgating has now been indeed one of the age-old American traditions that fell into place in Greece and Ancient Rome during the fall harvest celebrations to have kicked off in the 1860s, when picnicking American spectators washed out in the Civil War battles. “Historians generally agree this was a case of the right idea at the wrong time, war not being a spectator sport,” as per AmericanHeritage.com. “Still, for those who attended, there was socializing and tradition, tension and excitement.”Green Bay Packers fans popularized it among enthusiasts during the '50s, although the term was coined in 1919. Just like all cultural detention, tailgating is an important contributor to building a community and offering warmth and hospitality. Our strong sense of family welcomes new fans with open arms, and we are well versed in throwing parties, ranging from quinceañeras to Día de los Muertos events, showcasing our enthusiasm for celebrations.Tailgating parties happen in a total of 30 American cities where NFL teams hold sway; 10 of these cities boast a Latin population that is 25% or more. Among them, Miami has the highest Latin population at 73% (as destination of the Dolphins), followed closely by Los Angeles (49%; home to both Rams and Chargers). This demonstrates how significant these cities are to Latine NFL fans .Nielsen reports that there was a growth in Latino NFL fans from 31 million in 2020 to more than 39 million last year, mainly because of initiatives such as ""Por La Cultura,"" creating identity on cultural roots. The NFL community brings within, current, and past Latino players giving a strong bond for both fans and athletes. Current Latino players include Cairo Santos, a Brazilian-American kicker for the Chicago Bears, Cesar Ruiz, and Isiah Pacheco, a Dominican and Puerto Rican lineman for the New Orleans Saints and Kansas City Chiefs, respectively.Also Read: How Does the NFL Draft Work? A Beginner’s Guide Tailgating, a popular activity among Latine NFL fans, often reflects their culture, particularly in terms of the food served at these parties. Latine football fans continue to maintain a tradition that has grown over generations, preserving cultural identity, strengthening family bonds, and creating a sense of belonging. It's crucial to pass these traditions down to future generations, even if the team isn't performing well, to celebrate their pride in being a Latine football fan.","Tailgating is a casual gathering prior to a football game where everyone has food and discusses Super Bowl predictions and game-day plans.

A deepfake video of Elon Musk endorsing a fake $20 million crypto giveaway is going viral, causing widespread confusion and concern. Sharing the video on X (formerly Twitter), DogeDesigner posted: “BREAKING: A deepfake of Elon Musk promoting a $20 million crypto giveaway is going viral.” The post further warned: “Elon Musk and his companies are NOT running any crypto giveaways. Don’t fall for scams! Stay safe.”In the video, Elon Musk can be seen saying “Here’s a surprise for everyone.

It’s just a few quick steps that shouldn’t take longer than three minutes”.The Tesla CEO wrote on X that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates might go bankrupt if Tesla becomes “the world’s most valuable company by far,” reigniting the feud over Gates’ short position against the electric vehicle giant. At present, Tesla’s market capitalization sits at $1.251 trillion, trailing far behind Apple Inc. – the world’s largest company, which leads at $3.729 trillion. For Tesla to claim the top spot, it would need to grow by nearly 200%.In the post on X, Musk wrote “If Tesla does become the world’s most valuable company by far, that short position will bankrupt even Bill Gates”. Short position here refers to a stock market strategy where an investor borrows shares of a stock they do not own, sells them on the open market, and aims to buy them back later at a lower price. The goal is to profit from a decline in the stock's price.","A deepfake video of Elon Musk endorsing a fake $20 million crypto giveaway is going viral, causing widespread confusion and concern.

Withholding Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan ( SSA ) funds to Tamil Nadu for not accepting a three-language formula in PM SHRI schools will become a major poll issue in the 2026 assembly elections, according to school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. In an interview to TOI, he discussed various issues including the status of State Education Policy (SEP), addressing poor learning outcomes, quality of mid-day meals and plans to ensure functioning toilets and furniture in govt schools. Edited excerpts:We are trying to bring technology to our schools. We have entered Microsoft TEALS (Technical Education and Learning Support) to teach AI to school students studying in Classes VI to IX. Robotics labs and multi-sensory park to improve the sensory activity, fine motor skills, and intelligence of differently abled children are also other initiatives we are planning.Infrastructure and sanitation are two most pressing issues. There are old, dilapidated school buildings and lack of school rooms in some areas and lack of functioning toilets and sanitary workers in some schools. We are addressing these issues with the Perasiriyar Anbazhagan School Infrastructure Development Scheme under which we built 3,601 classrooms. And, 3,401 buildings are under construction. Separate funding of 100crore has been allocated for school maintenance and outsourcing sanitary workers and night watchmen. These infrastructure needs including classrooms, toilets and compound walls will be addressed by 2027.The committee headed by Justice Murugesan has submitted its recommendations. It is under consideration. The panel has suggested various reforms including teaching methodology, common age for school entry, and teacher training. Our CM will take a call on that.According to the state planning commission’s report, the breakfast scheme has improved attendance, memory power of students and enhanced nutrition.

Withholding Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan ( SSA ) funds to Tamil Nadu for not accepting a three-language formula in PM SHRI schools will become a major poll issue in the 2026 assembly elections, according to school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. In an interview to TOI, he discussed various issues including the status of State Education Policy (SEP), addressing poor learning outcomes, quality of mid-day meals and plans to ensure functioning toilets and furniture in govt schools. Edited excerpts:We are trying to bring technology to our schools.

Robotics labs and multi-sensory park to improve the sensory activity, fine motor skills, and intelligence of differently abled children are also other initiatives we are planning.Infrastructure and sanitation are two most pressing issues. There are old, dilapidated school buildings and lack of school rooms in some areas and lack of functioning toilets and sanitary workers in some schools. We are addressing these issues with the Perasiriyar Anbazhagan School Infrastructure Development Scheme under which we built 3,601 classrooms. And, 3,401 buildings are under construction.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
