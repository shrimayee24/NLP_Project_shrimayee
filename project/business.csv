"Jet, SET, go: Indian DJs now play the hottest parties in the world",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jet-set-go-indian-djs-now-play-the-hottest-parties-in-the-world/articleshow/111030810.cms,"Even for those who rave about techno music , the sub-genre of ‘hard techno’ doesn’t make for easy listening. “To be honest, it’s an acquired taste,” admits Kashish, Mumbai-based DJ and producer who goes by the stage name, Kollision. With not much of a fan base at home, she started throwing curated parties. It was at one such party that Kashish hosted a popular British DJ, Sterling Moss. “He liked my work and just like that, I got invited to play last month in one of the most iconic clubs in East London called Fold. It was a dream come true. My next international gig will be in a club in Rome,” says Kashish, who found her calling after a series of odd jobs in call centres, HR, marketing and real estate.From a time not so far away, when one would wonder if mixing songs on a turntable could even qualify as a craft or career, cut to now when Indian DJs are clocking more miles than CEOs. From clubs in the world’s tech no capital Berlin to Roman castles and big fat Indian shaadis across Europe and the US, they’re spinning everywhere, and getting sweaty palms to clap and chant for them.In the early 2000s, Kishore Kumar songs remixed by DJ and composer Aqeel Ali or DJ Aqeel, as he’s better known, threw the dance floor into a frenzy. Most millennials will remember chartbusters like ‘Kehdu Tumhe’ and ‘Tu Tu Hai Wahi’. While much has changed in the last 20 years, Ali is doing rather well for himself.Cut to 2024, he has perfected what he calls ‘ Bollywood Techno ’ and ‘Indohouse’ for an international audience, with his Instagram full of jet-setting updates from New York to Melbourne, where he fills up concert-size venues. In fact, he is the only Indian DJ to play twice at the World Economic Forum in Davos for the likes of Bill Clinton.“Weddings, parties, private shows, concerts, night clubs...I have performed everywhere. For the last year, I have been mixing Bollywood and techno, and even the ‘goras’ like it. After Diljit Dosanjh’s Coachella performance last year, interest in Bollywood music has gone up even more. International clubs, especially in the US and Australia, are hiring more Indian DJs because they have at least one Bollywood night a week,” says Ali on the phone before taking the stage at Vice in Dubai, hoping to get a crowd of 800-1,000.One reason for this is that festival lineups and club scenes throughout the world want to diversify. But visas are a big hurdle, says Mumbai DJ Arjun Vagale. Some of his tracks like ‘She Said’ and ‘Terrakoz’ put him on the global map of electronic music. But having jet-setted across the world, he’s aware of the hoops Indian DJs have to jump through. “Getting a visa is so difficult, and the waiting time has only gone up. It makes more sense for UK and European clubs to spend on local talent or fly down DJs from neighbouring countries than fly in acts from India. It’s pure economics.”No such visa woes plague an Indian wedding DJ, though. Sponsored by rich families who fly a bevy of pandits, caterers, designers and make-up artists, wedding DJs have seen business boom. Gaurav Malvai, who’s been behind the console for 27 years, says, “I am doing an international wedding gig every month now. Indian DJs have the versatility to switch from hard-core Bollywood to hip-hop and house. Foreign DJs don’t have a good grasp of Indian music,” says Malvai, who recently performed at the party thrown by the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art at Venice Biennale to mark the opening of a M F Husain show. He also did sets at Reliance scion Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta’s Harry Potter-themed pre-wedding bash and Deepika and Ranveer’s wedding functions in Italy.But some electronic music artists are loath to play at weddings. “You know how a sangeet works. The same track is played 20 or 30 times. The Indian wedding DJ is treated like a jukebox,” says Vagale.Some traverse both worlds with equal ease. Delhi-based DJ Avantika Bakshi, whose dance music blends elements from Arabic, Latin, Indian and African influences, has played in clubs in London, Miami, New York, Berlin and Nepal to NRI weddings and parties for luxury brands. “I had the most amazing time playing in 15th century castles in Rome where I was flown by the Maharaja of Jaipur for his birthday. I have even played at a Mexican wedding,” says Bakshi, who also performed at the Burning Man festival in 2022 and opened for Grammy-winning DJ Black Coffee.Anish Sood aka Anyasa, who has been signed on by Anjunadeep, an independent record label based in London, did a 10-city US tour this spring, followed by appearances in Amsterdam, Mauritius and Bali. He says that being signed to an international label helps. “They already have international audiences. That fast-tracks your music reaching people in different parts of the world,” says Sood, pointing out that aping western DJs, as some Indian acts tend to do, isn’t enough to build an audience.Madhav Shorey, aka Kohra, is another globetrotting DJ and founder of Qilla Records that promotes underground electronic music from India. “The highest figures for our sales are from Europe, and then the US, Brazil and Mexico. The audiences are overseas,” says Shorey.","Indian DJs are clocking more miles than CEOs.

took to martial arts for money and respect. As

Budhana village

greeted the winner with garlands and dhols, it was also a kick for patriarchy

FIGHTING SPIRIT

WINNING BOUT

Puja Tomar first started fighting out of anger, then for money and finally for respect. The third daughter in a Jat family living in Uttar Pradesh’s Budhana village in Muzaffarnagar, Tomar knew her life was defined by what she was not. She was not a boy and she was not really desired, not by her family, or her relatives and, definitely, not by her community.On June 9, Tomar did something that made everyone change their minds. She made history, not only as the first-ever Indian female fighter to sign up with Ultimate Fighting Championship ( UFC ), but also as the first Indian to win a bout. Dedicating her win to her mother and country, Tomar said, “This is not just my win. This win is for all Indian fans and all Indian fighters who people didn’t think could stand here.”To be fair, her father, a tractor dealer, quickly reconciled to the hand fate had dealt him and loved all three daughters in his own special way. He wanted them to be tough and athletic and ready to face the harsh world. “Main bachpan main sochti thi, sab duniya so rahi hai aur hum daud rahe hain (I used to wonder why we are running when the whole village is asleep),” she recalls now. Tomar’s father died in an accident when she was six and suddenly everything changed. “From being pampered with new clothes to struggling for two meals a day, it was a big shock for our family. But my mother is a very strong person and made sure all of us got an education.”Her older sisters showed academic prowess—one is now a doctor and the other a nurse — but Tomar couldn’t quite see herself hitting the books. She would much rather hit boys instead. “I knew that everyone liked boys more than girls. So, I thought if I beat them up, people will like me,” says Tomar, who watched Jack ie Chan films to pick up some tricks. It helped relieve some of the frustration she felt at the time as relatives bore down on her mother to stop her from going out and hanging around boys. Days would be spent on the small piece of land where the family grew sugarcane, their only source of sustenance.In school, Tomar tried karate, even winning a couple of competitions and honing a deadly sidekick. “I was a street fighter. Lots of strength from hours spent on the farm but no technique,” she adds. Tomar stumbled on martial arts Wushu when she was about 17 and quickly learned to excel in it despite very little guidance or help, picking up five national championship titles. Her mother’s mantra was always on her mind: ‘Darna nahi hai, maarna hai’ (Don’t be scared, fight hard) “I was winning but not earning, and though everyone at home supported me, I knew that there was a fund crunch,” she says. Medical college fees for her sister had meant an additional burden. In 2017, Tomar was offered Rs 50,000 for a mixed martial arts ( MMA ) fight. “All I asked was ‘where?’ I was willing to fight anyone to earn a few bucks,” she recalls.As she grappled, kicked and boxed her way, she was spotted by the Matrix Fight Night (MFN) company promoted by Bollywood star Tiger Shroff, his mother Ayesha and sister Krishna. In 2022, Ayesha Shroff offered to pay for her training at the Soma Fight Club in Bali, Indonesia. Things finally seem to be looking up. “They said I had potential, but I needed to train properly,” Tomar says. So, at 28, Tomar finally found a dedicated coach who corrected her technique, gave her a game plan against her opponents, and monitored her exercise and diet. “Pitte, pitte…peetna seekha.” (After being beaten up several times, I learnt how to outwit others.)In June 2023, Tomar stepped into the ring and won the MFN world championship. “I came back home and gave my mother the championship belt. Again, some boy from the village created trouble. He told her this was a small belt, and that I should bring back the big belt which is the UFC one. He didn’t even let me enjoy my win for a day,” she laughs.Exactly a year later, when she stepped into the Octagon for the UFC bout on June 9, she was fighting for respect. After the second round of the tough 15-minute fight, Tomar felt fatigue creeping and she remembers her coach shaking her, “Ankhen khol aur maar” (Open your eyes and hit). “I just summoned whatever willpower I had.” Her Brazilian opponent Rayanne dos Santos tried to intimidate her by screaming, and Tomar screamed right back. And then landed her signature sidekick sending dos Santos flying across the ring. Her kicks and punches didn’t stop as her coach’s words rang in her ears, “Don’t buckle, keep standing no matter what.” The last five minutes felt like an eternity, Tomar says, as she eked out a 30-27, 27-30, 29-28 split-decision win. “I just collapsed after that,” she says.Her sparring partner of 12 years Himanshu Kaushik says he has never met anyone as strong-willed as her. “It is what has defined her in all these years of struggle,” he says. Post-match, Tomar was treated to pizza “chicken wala with buffalo sauce” which was a sorry substitute for her most favourite thing in the world: sarson ka saag and makki ki roti, but it still felt like the best meal in the world. The 30-year-old has since been busy giving media interviews and dispensing advice to village girls on how to take off on their MMA journey. “They all want to fight now,” she says with obvious pride.And on June 13, Budhana welcomed its daughter, hoping to drown the past judgment it had meted out with garlands and dhols.","Puja Tomar is the first-ever Indian female fighter to sign up with Ultimate Fighting Championship ( UFC ), and the first Indian to win a bout.

Long live longevity! Why everyone is trying to turn the clock back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/long-live-longevity-why-everyone-is-trying-to-turn-the-clock-back/articleshow/111030615.cms,"A greying world has meant a new focus on living longer and healthier. A look at how science and money are coming together in the quest for immortality

The pursuit of ‘forever young’ has never been more popular with people throwing everything at the ticking clock — from ozone therapy and fasting regimens to cold plunges and collagen powder, celery juice to supergummies — whether science backs it or not. But can there really be a cheat code to dodge ageing and death? Turns out, the answer doesn’t matter because people are not going to give up trying.Scientists are bringing their big brains, while tech billionaires — after shaping the cars people drive to the phones they use — are throwing big bucks at projects that could hack the age code and keep the good times rolling a bit longer. According to one estimate, the longevity market is expected to be worth $44 billion by 2030.Some of these ultra-wealthy longevity evangelists include the likes of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Alphabet’s Larry Page, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Oracle’s Larry Ellison, and Paypal’s Peter Thiel who are investing in slowing ageing at a cellular level. Others like Google cofounder Sergey Brin and Sean Parker, co-founder of Napster, and later, Facebook’s first president — are funnelling their dollars into developing revolutionary immune therapies for diseases like cancer and Parkinson’s. Then there are those like Bryan Johnson investing in nutrition, exercise and wellness plans that could break the status quo of the typical ageing process.But using tech and science to outsmart death is no longer just a Silicon Valley obsession. Even in India, where it is considered a luxury to grow old, there is new interest in longevity research. Last month, AIIMS’ geriatric medicine department launched Project Longevity to identify the mechanisms of ageing and ageing patterns in multiple generations within a single family. The project, funded by the Indian Council of MedicalResearch , will last for 36 months. In dian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru launched a Longevity India initiative in April to study the mysteries of ageing. The project will explore factors such as genetics, environment, lifestyle, and culture to develop ways to improve the ‘ health span ’ — the length of time a person remains healthy, not just alive — of Indians.“It was high time we did,” says Deepak Saini, convenor of the Longevity India initiative and professor of Developmental Biology and Genetics at IISc. “Unlike the rest of the world, ageing was never a focus for India for the longest time. Our primary health concerns were related to poor nutrition and hygiene. Ageing was considered inevitable, and the common attitude was ‘So what, everyone gets old’.”However, times have changed with better sanitation, vaccines, antibiotics and other medical advances. “We’ve learned to tackle many diseases that cause early death, so now ageing is the next big challenge,” says Saini.The project is currently in its first phase, and the team is doing a large-scale clinical study involving people from a wide range of disciplines, such as clinicians, bioengineers, data scientists, mathematicians, physicists, and others. “We aim to sample 2,000 Indians who are 18 and above over the next two years at various scales to identify biomarkers and organ specific signatures of ageing in Indians,” Saini says, adding that this discovery stage also involves challenging western knowledge and grasp how ageing uniquely affects Indians. “For example, West sees high cholesterol as a problem. But if we use their standards, most Indians would be considered unhealthy because we typically have high cholesterol. Similarly, low vitamin D levels are common among Indians. Is that pathological or just part of our biology? And should we medicate like they do? These are crucial questions,” Saini points out.The Longevity India project has received initial funding from Prashanth Prakash, founding partner, Accel India with interest from individuals, companies as part of their CSR donations and lifestyle and healthcare chains. “To truly do justice to the project and ensure it achieves its intent, we’re looking at anything upwards of Rs 100 crore to keep operations running successfully,” says Saini.So, what’s the plan? “Once we’ve identified the markers, the next step is to develop cost-effective tests. Creating these panels of tests will enable clinicians to predict a person’s health, prescribe maintenance protocols and keep them out of hospital.”And while finances are crucial, the real investment needed, he says, is time and patience. “This isn’t like developing an app where you research today and launch tomorrow. Biological research takes time, and even longer in a physiological context.”At the same time, a shift towards prevention rather than waiting for the wealthy to hack ageing is what cancer surgeon-turned-longevity expert Dr Peter Attia, who recently authored the bestselling ‘Outlive’, advocates. “We already have the tools,” he had told TOI in an earlier interview.“Currently, virtually all investments in this problem focus on molecules, which I believe only represent a fraction of the tools we have at our disposal to live longer — and more importantly, better — lives,” says Attia, whose age-defying prescriptions seem rather simple. Walk, work out, eat healthy, get a good night’s sleep, and maintain social relationships if people “want to be able to hike a mile and a half, or carry their own groceries, or pick up a great-grandchild, or get up if they fall down.”Ageing doesn’t have to follow the clock, points out Saini. “Haven’t you met people who look much older than their years? They may attribute it to a medical episode, infection, disease, or a surgical procedure but it all comes down to the way we use or misuse our bodies over time. It changes the rate at which ageing creeps in,” he says. “See, genetics is something that’s hardwired into your cells. But the physiological code changes daily based on how you eat, sleep, or handle stress. That’s what we’re trying to tackle.”People indeed are already ditching bar-hopping foreign holidays for ‘longevity vacations’ at upscale ‘ anti-ageing ’ centres cropping up from Hawaii and British Columbia to Spain and Greece. These retreats come at a hefty price tag — $1,000 to $100,000 for a program — mostly accessible to the rich who would rather spend it on a few days of slow hiking, forest bathing, taking IV drips and listening to the sound of crystal singing-bowls than heady jaunts that might just fast forward their clock.IISc’s longevity mission, however, is to make sure everyone gets a shot at a longer, healthier life, not just a privileged few. “The motto of IISc is to reach out to the masses so a lot of our data findings are going to be in the public domain and accessible to anyone who wants to make use of the knowledge we’ve generated. The idea is to decentralise the information for everyone’s benefit.”Conversations from a small opinion campaign that the longevity team conducted made one thing clear. “Most people aren’t obsessed with living forever. They want to live healthier,” explains Saini. “However, there were a few ‘oddballs’ who expressed a desire for immortality.”The current cap on human lifespan is 122 years — that’s the age at which the world’s longest living person died. So, could one live that long if everything falls into place — groundbreaking science to lifestyle changes? “No, because everyone’s lifespan is influenced by various factors,” Saini says.And while some superagers may have lucked out genetically, the focus of India’s longevity project is obvious: “To help people achieve their potential lifespan in as healthy a shape as possible. It’s not just about living longer but about living healthier,” he says, quoting a dialogue from the movie ‘Anand’ where Rajesh Khanna’s terminally ill character had famously said: ‘Zindagi badi honi chahiye, lambi nahi,’ (life should be grand, not long).","Scientists are bringing their big brains, while tech billionaires are throwing big bucks at projects that could hack the age code. According to one estimate, the longevity market is expected to be worth $44 billion by 2030. Even in India, where it is considered a luxury to grow old, there is new interest in longevity research.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111030792,imgsize-887933,width-400,resizemode-4/111030792.jpg"

With Biden headed to Italy, White House said aboard Air Force One there’s an “encounter” likely between the 2 leaders as the president expects to see the Indian PM there, while reiterating it will continue to raise the foiled Sikh separatist murder plot at very senior levels with India.This is the first time the leaders will meet after their bilateral talks over dinner at Modi’s residence here, on the eve of the G20 summit India hosted last year in September. While a formal bilateral meeting isn’t ruled out in Italy, it’s possible that the leaders might just have a pull-aside because of scheduling constraints.PM Modi , in fact, will have a hectic bilateral schedule at G7 with meetings already confirmed with French president Emmanuel Macron, UK PM Rishi Sunak, Japanese PM Fumio Kishida, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian PM Giorgia Meloni. Modi is also likely to meet Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He had met him at the G7 summit in Hiroshima too last year. Zelenskyy had invited Modi for the peace summit in Switzerland, but India never considered participation at the highest level because of efforts to keep Russia out. There was no meeting scheduled with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau till late on Thursday.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, US NSA Jake Sullivan also said that the foiled murder-for-hire plot against Khalistan separatist and US national Gurpatwant Singh Pannun will be “a continuing topic of dialogue between the US and India, including at very senior levels”. Diplomatic sources did not rule out the possibility of the issue coming up in the Modi-Biden meeting.Biden had taken up the issue during his meeting with Modi in September and Sullivan is himself likely to discuss progress, or lack thereof, in the probe India is conducting into the US allegations that an Indian official masterminded the plot during his visit to India next week. While the visit has not been officially announced yet, Sullivan is scheduled to be here on June 18. He’s expected to meet his counterpart for a comprehensive review of the initiative on critical and emerging technology (iCET) that Modi and Biden had launched in May 2022.“He (Biden) expects to see Prime Minister Modi here. It's up to the Indians to formally confirm his attendance, but our expectation is that the two of them will have the opportunity to encounter one another. The nature of that encounter is still fluid because so much of the schedule is fluid,” said Sullivan.Asked about the issue by reporters accompanying the president, Sullivan said the US will continue to raise the issue, like in the past, at the highest level with India. “We have made our views known on this issue, and it will be a continuing topic of dialogue between the US and India, including at very senior levels,” added the official.","PM Narendra Modi is likely to meet US President Joe Biden Friday on the margins of the G7 summit in southern Italy’s Puglia region.

A lot hinges on the USA vs Ireland game in Group A of the T20 World Cup on Friday, but the flood situation in Florida and forecast for more spells of heavy rain threaten to wash out the game, which works in favour of the home team.The three remaining matches in Group A are all scheduled to be held at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill, Florida.It is one of the three stadiums in the US hosting some of the group-stage matches of the T20 World Cup. The other two venues are in New York and Dallas.On Friday, USA find themselves on the brink of another history-making moment with a chance to progress to the 'Super 8s' stage in their debut appearance in the T20 World Cup, and the inclement weather in Florida can make the equation even simpler.If the game gets washed out, USA will move to five points and finish at No. 2 to join group-leaders India as the two teams to enter the 'Super 8s'. That will leave the remaining two matches of the group in Florida -- India vs Canada (June 15) andPakistan vs Ireland (June 16) -- meaningless.However, if weather allows a result-oriented game on Friday and Ireland manage to beat the US, it will breathe new life into Pakistan's campaign. The Babar Azam-led team will then have to beat Ireland, which will take Pakistan through to the next stage in the tournament, edging out USA on net run-rate.For the third day in a row, a line of storms spanning from the west to the east coast of Florida brought heavy rainfall and flooding to certain areas on Thursday, increasing the risk of flash flooding into the evening hours -- according to an AP report.Meteorologists have cautioned residents of Florida to brace for more flash flooding following a tropical disturbance that brought up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain to the southern regions of the state. The situation is anticipated to deteriorate on Friday.Heavy rainfall on Wednesday caused flash flooding from Fort Lauderdale to downtown Miami.Forecasters predict higher rainfall totals, with an additional 4 to 8 inches expected and the possibility of some areas receiving over 10 inches.","USA play Ireland in Group A of the T20 World Cup on Friday.

Likewise, diesel prices have gone up by Rs 3.02 per litre, with the new price being Rs 88.95, compared to the earlier rate of Rs 85.93.The Petroleum Dealers Association has attributed this price hike to the state government's revision of the sales tax on petroleum products.As per the notification, the sales tax on petrol has been raised from 25.92 per cent to 29.84 per cent.

This was confirmed by Modi himself when he posted a photo on social media platform X of the 2 leaders chatting, while holding hands.“I'm not going to get into the details of this important, sensitive issue that we need to follow up, but this was a commitment to work together, in the coming times, to deal with some very important issues,"" he said in a press conference in Italy on Saturday morning. Canada has insisted that its most important issue with India for now is to bring to justice the perpetrators of the Nijjar murder.India continues to officially maintain that Canada has not backed its allegations with any evidence or even information that Indian agencies can look into.

While India has been silent about the probe findings, discussions are expected on the issue next week as US NSA Jake Sullivan arrives in India for talks. The US has been pushing India to support the Canadian probe too.In the case of Canada, even though senior intelligence officials remain in touch about the probe, Indian government sources say there has been no official or formal communication from Canada on the case, including on the 4 arrests made so far. Expecting perhaps an encounter with Trudeau at G7, the Indian government had said just before the summit its main issue with Canada is political space given to extremists.In his remarks on Saturday, Trudeau also said, “We need to continue to engage with various partners around the world, with various partners, even as we highlight challenges as we stand up for the rule of law”. Trudeau and senior Canadian officials have acknowledged the significance they attach to ties with India, including the role India can play in securing a free and open India-Pacific, but have also insisted that their immediate priority with India is to fix accountability for the killing of Nijjar, a Canadian national.While Trudeau had not acknowledged Modi’s post on X till late on Saturday, his office had confirmed immediately the conversation saying Trudeau congratulated Modi on his re-election and the leaders had a brief discussion on the bilateral relationship.

G7 Summit commits to promote India-Europe corridor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/g7-summit-commits-to-promote-india-europe-corridor/articleshow/111026947.cms,"NEW DELHI: The G7 countries have committed to promoting the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor ( IMEEEC ), in what is seen as a boost to the strategic initiative amid tension in West Asia, which may have delayed work on the project.While the Indian govt has started its end of the work on the initiative that was announced on the sidelines of the G20 Leaders Summit in Delhi last year, there are rail links in Saudi Arabia and some other countries that need to be established.PM Modi attended the meeting as India was a special invitee along with Brazil, Argentina, UAE and Turkiye, among others.The backing for IMEEEC came along with a similar statement of support by G7 for the Lobito Corridor in Central Africa and Luzon Corridor and the Middle Corridor. IMEEEC is to connect ports on India’s west coast to UAE, from where goods are to be shipped by rail to Europe, and potentially open greater access to the African continent.Many experts have argued that the IMEEEC would have helped prevent some of the disruption caused by the tension around the Red Sea and allowed for freer movement of goods to Europe. The Houthi attacks have caused massive disruptions, forcing ships to take a much longer route, delaying shipments by 30 days or more. The G7 members also hit out at the Houthis, condemning their attacks on vessels.“These illegal attacks must end. We call for the immediate release by the Houthis of the Galaxy Leader and its crew. We reiterate the right of countries to defend their vessels, in line with UNSCR 2722 and in accordance with international law… The continuing Houthi attacks in the Red Sea risk destabilising the region, stopping freedom of navigation and trade flows and endangering the UN-led roadmap towards peace in Yemen,” said the communique issued at the end of the meeting in Apulia, Italy.","The G7 countries have committed to promoting the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor.

NEW DELHI: Concerned over irregular meetings of the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committees (DISHA), rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has decided to write to all the newly elected MPs to ensure meetings are held to expedite development work on the ground.The Chairperson of a DISHA committee is the senior most MP (Lok Sabha) elected from the district and the meetings of the committee are to be attended by all elected representatives and officials from the district.The issue was discussed at a meeting with officials on Friday evening, as Chouhan reviewed the action plan for the next 100 days of various schemes and emphasized on implementation of the same in an effective manner.Besides this, while discussing the National Social Assistance Programme ( NSAP ), Chouhan has asserted that going forward they will have to structure the project for an “ideal life for the elderly, widows and the disabled, and for this, if there is a need to change the rules and regulations of the scheme, then amendments should also be made.”A significant component of NSAP is focussed on pension for seniors, persons with disabilities and widows, all of whom belong to the Below Poverty Line category. The eligibility criteria and other concerns related to NSAP were discussed at the meeting.During the review Chouhan also emphasized on the importance of the district development coordination and monitoring committees (). The ministry has stressed “there is a need to further strengthen the Disha Committees” and therefore he will write a letter to all the newly elected MPs to request them to ensure that the meetings of these committees are held on time so that problems can be addressed and progress monitored continuously.These committees are formed to ensure better coordination among all the elected representatives in Parliament, state legislatures and local govts like Panchayati Raj institutions and Municipal bodies for efficient and time-bound development. They are supposed to hold quarterly reviews of all development activity at the district level.The DISHA committees have the power to seek information and demand effective follow up on issues raised during the deliberations and the district collector is responsible for ensuring compliance.","Rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has decided to write to all the newly elected MPs to ensure meetings are held to expedite development work.

Global civil society organisations, Public Eye and IBFAN, have submitted a formal request to the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), urging legal action against Nestle “unethical and unfair business practices” in low- and middle-income countries.

Accusing the Swiss major of “double standards”, the NGOs had in April said the company’s two best-selling baby food brands sold in developing countries, including India, have a high content of added sugar, which is prohibited under WHO guidelines. Nestle’s misleading and aggressive marketing and its double standard over added sugar are unfair business practices that affect hundreds of thousands of people in poor countries, they said. The cessation of unethical practices is important not only to protect children, but also the reputation of Nestle’s home country, they said.

When contacted, a Nestle India spokesperson said: “We understand that the authorities are conducting analysis of infant cereals and infant formulas sold by all companies in the country.” It maintained its commitment to compliance and highlighted a reduction in sugar content by up to 30% in its baby food products in India over the past five years.

In April, days after the issue became public, Nestle India’s chairman and managing director Suresh Narayanan had said Cerelac complied with local food norms, saying added sugars in the baby food are much lower than what India’s food regulator permits.

The food giant controls 20% of the baby food market, valued at nearly $70 billion. With over $2.5 billion in global sales in 2022, Cerelac and Nido are some of Nestle’s best-selling baby food brands in low- and middle-income countries.

Another meeting is slotted next week.It may be recalled that the medical education department refused a fee hike in nursing courses for the upcoming year in the meeting held Thursday.The draft seat matrix for engineering will be released soon. The public will be given seven days to respond to it, after which the final matrix will be released. Those colleges which get approval later will be added in subsequent counselling rounds.Karnataka Examinations Authority said it would wait for counselling of NEET by the Medical Counseling Committee before commencing CET counselling. ""As soon as the dates are announced for NEET counselling , we will have clarity on CET counselling as well. We wanted to hold CET and NEET simultaneously as many top rankers would stand a chance for both. We need to give them the best chance,"" said H Prasanna, executive director of KEA.",The fees for engineering and architecture seats in private colleges will go up by 10% in the academic year 2024-25.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals.

"Gates begins building smaller, cheaper nuclear reactors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gates-begins-building-smaller-cheaper-nuclear-reactors/articleshow/111028285.cms,"Kemmerer, Wyoming: Outside a small coal town in southwest Wyoming , a multibillion-dollar effort to build the first in a new generation of US nuclear power plants is underway. Workers began construction Tuesday on a novel type of nuclear reactor meant to be smaller and cheaper than the hulking reactors of old and designed to produce electricity without the carbon dioxide that is rapidly heating the planet.The reactor being built by TerraPower , a startup, won't be finished until 2030 and faces daunting obstacles. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission hasn't yet approved the design, and the company will have to overcome the inevitable delays and cost overruns that have doomed countless nuclear projects before.What TerraPower does have, however, is an influential and deep-pocketed founder. Bill Gates , currently ranked as the seventh-richest person in the world, has poured more than $1 billion of his fortune into TerraPower, an amount that he expects to increase. ""If you care about climate, there are many, many locations around the world where nuclear has got to work,"" Gates said during an interview near the project site Monday.""Wind and solar are absolutely fantastic, and we have to build them as fast as we can, but the idea that we don't need anything beyond that is very unlikely,"" Gates said.As demand for electricity surges because of new data centers, factories and electric vehicles, there is a renewed enthusiasm around nuclear energy .Traditional reactors are huge, complex, strictly regulated projects that are difficult to build and finance. And nuclear power is prohibitively expensive. The only two US reactors built in the past 30 years, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Georgia, cost $35 billion, more than double initial estimates. Gates is betting that radically different technology will help. With TerraPower, he funded a team of engineers to redesign a nuclear plant from scratch.Today, every US nuclear plant uses light-water reactors, in which water is pumped into a reactor core and heated by atomic fission, producing steam to create electricity. Because the water is highly pressurized, these plants need heavy piping and thick containment shields to protect against accidents. TerraPower's reactor, by contrast, uses liquid sodium instead of water, allowing it to operate at lower pressures. In theory, that reduces the need for thick shielding. In an emergency, the plant can be cooled with air vents rather than complicated pump systems. The reactor is just 345 megawatts, one-third the size of Vogtle reactors, making for a smaller investment.Chris Levesque, TerraPower's CEO, said its reactors should ultimately produce electricity at half the cost of traditional nuclear plants. ""This is a much simpler plant,"" he said. ""That gives us both a safety benefit and a cost benefit.""","Bill Gates has poured more than $1 billion of his fortune into TerraPower, a startup.
