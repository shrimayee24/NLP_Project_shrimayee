"DTC losses mounted by Rs 35,000 crore in 6 years: CAG",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dtc-losses-mounted-by-rs-35k-crore-in-6-years-cag/articleshow/118541905.cms,"DTC losses mounted by Rs 35k crore in 6 years: CAG (Pic credit: PTI)

CAG points out deficient route planning by DTC

NEW DELHI: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has stated that Delhi Transport Corporation 's cumulative losses soared from Rs 25,300 crore in 2015-16 to nearly 60,750 crore in 2021-22 as it was weighed down by dwindling fleet, with 45% of buses being overage and prone to high levels of breakdown, resulting in below-par fleet utilisation.In the long overdue report, expected to be tabled in assembly by the new BJP govt on Tuesday, the auditor pointed to multiple lapses, including the transport utility's inability to augment its fleet, sources told TOI. This is the first of 14 reports that the AAP govt had refused to share in the assembly.The primary reason for the losses was DTC fares remaining unchanged since 2009, sources said, with the Delhi govt refusing to pay heed to multiple requests. The burden further went up as women were given free bus rides. The auditor also pointed to the absence of any business plan and there was no roadmap to check the bleeding and to ensure its financial viability , said sources who have seen the report.The skeletal DTC fleet, with broken down buses part of commuters' daily experience, turned into a political issue, with BJP and Congress repeatedly talking up AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal's 2015 promise to boost the fleet by 10,000.In 2007, Delhi High Court had ordered that DTC should have a fleet of 11,000 buses. However, five years later, the Delhi cabinet pegged the number at 5,500. The CAG report is learnt to have pointed out that at the end of March 2022, DTC had a fleet of 3,937 buses, of which 1,770 were overage. The low-floor buses were more than 10 years old and were due to be phased out by the end of next month.Although there was a shortage of 1,740 buses, except the addition of 300 buses in 2022, procurement was not done despite Rs 233 crore being available. It did not avail of central assistance of another Rs 49 crore under FAME-I scheme, which CAG attributed to indecision and lack of clarity on specifications. A delay in the finalisation of 300 electric buses under FAME-II resulted in the contract period being reduced from 12 years to 10 years.An ageing fleet meant that DTC could not achieve operational efficiency compared to the national average. Besides, breakdowns ranged between 2.9 and 4.5 for every 10,000 km of operations, which was seen to be very high in comparison to other state transport corporations as well as cluster buses run by private operators on contract.CAG pointed out that the performance of cluster buses was much better than that of the DTC fleet on each operational parameter, despite both operating in similar circumstances.The federal auditor also faulted DTC for deficient route planning with the state utility operating on 468 routes or 57% of the total 814 routes. ""The corporation was unable to recover its operational cost in any of the routes operated by it. As a result, it suffered losses of Rs 14,199 crore on operations during 2015-22,"" a source said.While losses soared, the Delhi govt provided a revenue grant of Rs 13,381 crore between 2015 and 2022, which left a gap of Rs 818 crore. Further, DTC did not sign an MoU with the Delhi transport department setting physical and financial targets.Further, CAG is learnt to have pulled up DTC for not implementing an automatic fare collection system and having CCTV surveillance system that remained incomplete even nine years after the project was initiated.","Delhi Transport Corporation's losses soared from Rs 25,300 crore in 2015-16 to nearly 60,750 crore in 2021-22.

Poll What Is Most Important for the Success of the Current Assembly Session? Advancing Development Projects Ensuring Financial Accountability

Will focus on making Delhi a 'viksit rajdhani': Sachdeva

NEW DELHI: CM Rekha Gupta said Sunday the previous AAP dispensation left the state coffers ""empty"", but assured that the BJP govt was ""committed"" to rolling out the Rs 2,500-per month honorarium scheme for eligible women.Addressing a joint press meet with Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva after a legislative party huddle, Gupta said several rounds of meetings had been held with govt officials on the issue in the past four days since she took over.""The condition the previous govt left for us... when we sit with officers to review the financial status... the entire govt exchequer is found empty,"" Gupta said, while replying to a question on preparations to implement the women's aid scheme. ""But giving the money to women is a routine work we have to do. We will surely implement the scheme with detailed planning. It's our commitment. We will do it 1,000%,"" the CM said.According to an estimate, after excluding taxpayers, govt servants and beneficiaries of other state welfare schemes, around 38 lakh women above 18 will be eligible for assistance under this scheme. The govt may need over Rs 11,000 crore annually for this.Giving a monthly honorarium of Rs 2,500 per month to women in Delhi under the ' Mahila Samriddhi Yojana ' was one of the prominent electoral promises made by BJP in the run-up to the assembly polls.The Delhi CM said the first day of the Delhi assembly session on Monday will see the election of Speaker and Deputy Speaker followed by the newly-elected legislators taking oath. She added that the three-day assembly session will focus on discussions about development projects. ""The most important aspect of the session, as we committed, will be the laying of the pending CAG reports in the house and the previous govt must now answer the people of Delhi for the misuse of their hard-earned money,"" Gupta said, adding that all commitments made by BJP will be fulfilled.On former CM Atishi's statement that her govt followed the procedure and forwarded the CAG reports to the lieutenant governor for approval before tabling them in the house, Sachdeva said the AAP dispensation was in a habit of ""peddling lies."" ""They should be ready to reply (on CAG reports),"" he added. The assembly session is starting Monday and will continue till Thursday.Sachdeva also said that the BJP govt in the next five years will focus on making Delhi a ""viksit rajdhani"" (developed capital). ""All MLAs discussed in the meeting on how to take forward the developmental works in their respective constituencies. Our govt will complete all the projects and fulfil the expectations of the people. AAP's attempts to defame the BJP by spreading lies will be countered by the work of our legislators,"" the Delhi BJP president said.","Delhi CM Rekha Gupta says previous AAP dispensation left state coffers ""empty"" But she assured that the BJP govt was ""committed"" to rolling out the Rs 2,500-per month honorarium scheme for eligible women.

Why BSE Sensex, Nifty50 crashed today

1) Consumer Confidence Declines in US

2) Economic Growth and Inflation Concerns

3) Markets Await Inflation Report

4) Ongoing Foreign Investment Outflow

Stock market crash today: BSE Sensex and Nifty50, the Indian equity benchmark indices, tanked in trade on Monday. While BSE Sensex crashed 900 points, Nifty50 went below 22,550 intraday. BSE Sensex ended the day at 74,454.41, down 857 points or 1.14%. Nifty50 ended at 22,552.50, down 243 points or 1.07%.American consumer confidence hit its lowest point in 15 months during February, with inflation expectations rising amidst worries regarding President Donald Trump's proposed tariff policies, as indicated by recent data.Asian markets largely declined, following the negative performance on Wall Street from Friday, driven by growth-related concerns.Shares of Zomato, HCL Tech, TCS, Tech Mahindra, HDFC Bank, and IndusInd Bank started lower, whilst Sun Pharma, Maruti, M&M, Bajaj Finserv, and Nestle India registered initial gains.In sectoral performance, the Nifty IT index fell by 1.8%, with LTTS, Persistent Systems, and Coforge leading the decline. Additionally, Nifty Financial Services, Media, Metal, PSU Bank, Realty, and Consumer Durables indices all opened more than 1% lower.Global markets retreated following an unexpected reduction in US services activity, influenced by tariff concerns and rising costs. Reports indicated the White House was urging Mexico to implement tariffs on Chinese goods.American consumer confidence decreased significantly in February, reaching its lowest point in 15 months as inflation outlook increased. The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index reduced to 64.7 from 71.7 in January, below analysts' forecasts. Citizens voiced worries about how President Donald Trump's tariff policies might affect their spending capacity.The US faces worries about concurrent economic slowdown and rising inflation, creating market uncertainty.

Chennai Water Safety: Govt rejects IIT Madras findings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/chennai-water-safe-govt-rejects-iit-madras-findings/articleshow/118511457.cms,"Chennai: Rejecting IIT Madras' findings, govt asserted that Chennai's drinking water sources, including lakes, are free from ‘forever chemicals' PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances).A state pollution control board study across 40 locations, including Chembarambakkam lake, Adyar river, and Buckingham Canal, found PFAS levels below the quantification threshold. Govt maintained that industries near waterbodies follow strict waste discharge policies, though some samples collected between Napier Bridge and Tondiarpet contained fluoride, iron, and chloride. On the outskirts and southern part of the city, sewage mixing was detected, and steps are being taken to address it.IIT-M's study reported PFAS levels between 23 and 136 ng/L about 400 times higher than advisory limits of 0.004-0.02 ng/L. NGT principal bench in New Delhi, taking suo motu cognizance, directed TN and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to hold a detailed examination.PFAS are synthetic chemicals, commonly found in non-stick cookware, upholstery, industrial materials, and food packaging. Their presence in drinking water has been linked to serious health risks, including liver damage, low infant birth weights, hormonal imbalances, fertility issues, immune system suppression, and even cancer.While Tamil Nadu has asserted that its water is safe, CPCB informed NGT that only a limited number of studies on forever chemicals have been conducted in India. Based on past research, CPCB noted a significant rise in perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) levels in water samples from south India. CPCB attributed this increase to a shift in industrial production from developed nations to countries such as China and India, following the US environmental protection agency's (EPA) phase-out initiative under the stewardship programme a voluntary agreement with manufacturers to reduce and eliminate PFAS use.The tribunal noted that while Bureau of Indian Standards has yet to set drinking water standards for PFAS, this does not absolve CPCB and the Union environment ministry from establishing compliance norms under Water Act, 1974. It has added the ministry as a respondent in the case, which is scheduled for a hearing on April 29.","State pollution control board study across 40 locations, including Chembarambakkam lake, Adyar river, and Buckingham Canal, found PFAS levels below the quantification threshold.

NEW DELHI/AMRITSAR: A batch of 12 illegal Indian immigrants deported from the US to Panama arrived Sunday in Delhi via Istanbul on a Turkish Airlines flight, making them the first group to be sent back without restraints since three American military aircraft brought 332 deportees to Amritsar within a fortnight this month.The 12 deportees are said to be among 50 undocumented Indian nationals who reportedly arrived in Panama recently. Panama has been assisting the US in its deportation efforts.According to local media reports, the UN-affiliated International Organisation for Migration helped purchase plane tickets for people of various nationalities whose citizenship was confirmed, 17 of them Indians. More deportees from the group are expected next week once MEA verifies their nationality.Deportation from Panama is being carried out under the Regional Assisted Voluntary Return Programme , an IOM protection and support response to facilitate the dignified, safe, regular and orderly return, as well as voluntary and based on an informed decision, of migrants to their countries of origin.Four men from Punjab in the latest batch took a connecting IndiGo flight from Delhi to Amritsar.Airport authorities in the city were informed in advance about the arrival of Patiala resident Jatinder Singh, Maninder Dutt of Jalandhar, and Jugraj Singh and Harpreet Singh from Gurdaspur, but it wasn't immediately clear whether they came unescorted all the way from Panama.Official sources said after the mandatory debriefing that Jatinder, 34, paid a travel agent from Patiala Rs 52 lakh to help him enter the US through a route criss-crossing Guyana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.Maninder, 21, put his faith and Rs 42 lakh in the hands of a Delhi-based illegal immigration agent, who then sent him on a perilous journey through Spain, Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. Jugraj and Harpreet, both 30, paid Rs 38 lakh each to an agent from Batala and reached the US via Nicaragua.Punjab NRI minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal said the state govt had registered cases against 15 travel agents based on complaints from natives of the state who were deported from the US this month. Of these, three agents have been arrested, while police have been raiding offices and homes in search of the absconding 12.Sources said the deportees who arrived on Sunday told authorities they intended to file cases against the travel agents who duped them only if there was a chance of getting their money back.The first US military flight that arrived on Feb 5 brought 104 deportees, with both men and women handcuffed and their feet shackled. The second flight, carrying 119 deportees, arrived on Feb 15.

MUMBAI: French engineering giant Systra, which has designed and overseen the metro construction in Mumbai, has levelled allegations of corruption against senior officials of the planning agency, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), accusing them of seeking ""undue favours"" and delaying payments. Complaints, which have been communicated to the govt, include pressuring the firm to inflate orders to contractors, stalling approvals for key staff and imposing arbitrary penalties.Systra sought diplomatic intervention. In a letter dated Nov 12, 2024, the French embassy asked Rupinder Singh, resident commissioner of Maharashtra in Delhi, to intervene for the firm, which cited ""severe harassment and challenges"" while working as general consultant on MMRDA projects.CM Devendra Fadnavis said the complaint had not reached him but he would speak to chief secretary Sujata Saunik. ""Transparency is at the core of our administration. We will ensure it is restored at any cost,"" Fadnavis told TOI.In its response, MMRDA called the allegations ""baseless"" and ""a deliberate attempt to malign"" the reputation of the agency and its personnel.Systra's complaint routed through the embassy highlighted its record in executing rail and metro projects in India and said, ""Since August 2023, Systra has been facing severe problems in its daily operations, escalating to the suspension of its payments due in January 2024.""It requested that the matter be ""studied in depth"" and left it in the hands of the resident commissioner ""to resolve the situation."" It said, ""Systra is keen to work together with MMRDA for mutual benefit in an atmosphere of peace and cooperation, without external pressure.""Systra said the trouble began in Aug 2023 following a leadership shake-up at MMRDA. As general consultant for Mumbai's Metro lines 5, 6, 7A, 9, 10, and 12, and detailed design provider for lines 2A, 7, and associated depots, the company alleges that MMRDA officials began pressing for monetary benefits, which were thinly veiled as demands from higher-ups.Systra claimed ""favours"" were sought on the pretext that the ""MC (metropolitan commissioner)"" was demanding it. Systra said it informed the authority that the company ""shall not be able to do the same"".Reacting to the allegations, MMRDA said a detailed report was sought from the department concerned and submitted to govt for consideration. The report revealed multiple contractual and regulatory violations by Systra, extending beyond the initial cost overruns of 4.27% to 10% in fees, it said.MMRDA said it has issued a termination notice to Systra for various violations, including security concerns and operational lapses. ""It is important to note that the present matter pertains to a commercial dispute,"" it said. ""Unfortunately, Systra appears to be attempting to escalate this into an issue between a foreign country and an agency of the government of Maharashtra, which is not an appropriate practice.""Systra's general manager for Mumbai, Arun Mishra, said, ""We cannot comment as the matter is sub judice."" Systra has approached Bombay high court over the issue.Between Jan and Feb 2024, Systra alleges that MMRDA issued payment suspension notices, citing supposed deficiencies in already-resolved issues on line 5 (Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan), 9 (Dahisar-Mira-Bhayander), 7A (Gundavli-Airport), and line 6 (Lokhandwala to Vikhroli). Additionally, MMRDA issued notices changing the scope of contractual work, alleging deficiencies in civil and systems contracts for line 10 (Gaimukh-Shivaji Chowk) and 12 (Kalyan-Taloja), issues that had already been resolved, it said.Systra said the payment suspension was lifted for lines 6, 5, 9, and 7A (systems) in June 2024 following the company's response. However, the freeze continues for lines 5, 9, and 7A (civil), with Rs 30 crore still unpaid. Systra also alleges MMRDA attempted to pressure the firm into approving inflated orders for a contractor on line 9. It said, ""Since we are not obliging... we believe MMRDA is continuing the suspension of payments for general consultant services for lines 5, 9, and 7A (civil). From what we understand, MMRDA is taking further steps to terminate the general consultant services for these contracts.""It claims similar pressure tactics are being applied to DB E&C, a German consultancy handling the general consultant contract for line 4. Systra and DB E&C are consortium partners for lines 10 and 12. Systra said MMRDA has stopped making payments on these projects, including the ones where suspension notices were revoked. Compounding the issue, Systra says MMRDA has stalled approvals for key staff, imposed arbitrary penalties, and demanded certifications for payments to minor contractors hired directly by the agency.","French firm levels graft charges against MMRDA, seeks diplomatic intervention.

NEW DELHI: Facing allegations from Centre that ""lakhs of crores of rupees"" were being collected through issuance of halal certification for various products, including cement, iron bars, bottles, etc, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind Halal Trust told SC Monday that govt's statement in court ""was completely incorrect, vexatious and scandalous"".In an affidavit filed in SC to counter Centre's allegation, the trust said it had never given certification to cement and iron bars and pleaded the court to seek explanation from Centre on what basis it had made the statement. It also said its annual collection is close to only Rs 2.1 crore, out of which Rs 59.2 lakh is paid as tax. It, however, justified halal certification for lipstick, tulsi water , biscuit, water bottle, etc, saying it is done to ensure that animal fat, bones or any other component has not been used in their manufacturing.Referring to Centre's statement during court hearing on Jan 20, the affidavit said, ""It is submitted that statements of Centre are completely incorrect, vexatious and scandalous. The statements are without any basis, inconsistent with the record and the pleadings sworn on oath by public officials submitted before this court. The instructing officer of govt has shown irresponsible behaviour while instructing the solicitor general to make such statements. This court may direct govt for disclosure of the fact as to which officer instructed the SG to make such statement before this court as these statements have caused serious prejudice to the concept of halal; which is considered to be one of the basic requirements of behaviour and lifestyle of a very large community of our country.""Centre had told court that 'halal' certification was not confined to food items but it was done for all sorts of products, even cement & iron bars have to be halal-certified.Responding to allegations, the trust said, ""It is submitted that the petitioner has not issued any halal certification to iron bars or cement. Govt is hereby put to strict proof for producing such certification having been granted to any of such manufacturing.

Indian-origin billionaire’s daughter Vasundhara Oswal narrates shocking ordeal in Uganda jail

Arrested without a warrant, thrown into a van

Denied legal rights, trapped in the system

From petty crimes to murderers’ block

'They wanted money'

Seeking justice

NEW DELHI: Vasundhara Oswal , daughter of Indian-origin billionaire Pankaj Oswal , has broken her silence on her three-week nightmare behind bars in Uganda. Falsely accused of kidnapping and murdering her father’s former employee, she endured prison conditions that she calls a “gross violation of human rights.”The 26-year-old was arrested on October 1, 2024, over the alleged abduction of Mukesh Menaria , a former employee of Pankaj Oswal. However, the case crumbled when Menaria was found alive in Tanzania just days later.Despite this, Vasundhara remained imprisoned for weeks. Speaking to PTI on Friday, she recalled the horrors she faced, ""I was detained for five days, then thrown in prison for two weeks. I wasn’t allowed to shower, and they denied me food and water. My parents had to bribe police officers just to get me basic necessities.”At one point, she was reportedly denied access to a washroom as punishment.According to Vasundhara, Ugandan police raided her premises without a warrant and took her away under false pretenses. ""When I asked them to present a search warrant, they said, ‘We are in Uganda, we can do anything. You’re not in Europe anymore,’” she alleged.She claimed a male officer physically forced her into a police van when she refused to comply immediately.Forced to give a statement without a criminal lawyer, Vasundhara said she was made to pay $30,000 and surrender her passport for a police bond—yet she was still thrown back in her cell. Even after obtaining an unconditional release order from the courts, she was illegally detained for another 72 hours.Shockingly, instead of dismissing the case after Menaria was found alive on October 10, authorities kept her in prison and even escalated her charges from kidnapping to attempted murder.Initially housed in a facility for petty criminals, Vasundhara was later moved to a prison for convicted murderers and human traffickers. She spent two weeks in Nakasongola prison , fearing for her life.After weeks of legal battles, she secured bail on October 21, but her ordeal was far from over. Her passport was only returned on December 10, and the case was not dismissed until December 19.Vasundhara alleges that corrupt officials kept the charges alive even after Menaria was found, reducing them later to a misdemeanor confinement charge—all in an attempt to extort more money.""This was done to keep something over our heads and squeeze more money from my family,"" she said.Now free, Vasundhara wants the Ugandan government to be held accountable for what she calls an unjust persecution. ""This is up to the Ugandan government to correct its mistakes. We have invested in their country for years, and this is how they treat us?"" she said.As she reviews legal options, her case has raised global concerns over police corruption and human rights violations in Uganda.","Vasundhara Oswal was arrested on October 1, 2024, over the alleged abduction of Mukesh Menaria, a former employee of Pankaj Oswal.

She also increased the private-practice distance cap from 20 km to 30 km for state service doctors (they can now conduct private practice up to 30 km from their workplace) and, in another significant decision, scrapped the suspension of seven Midnapore Medical College junior doctors (which followed the death of a young mother after a Caesarean delivery).The CM also outlined her expectations from the community: doctors should spend at least the required eight hours at their workplace and seniors should not leave patient care, including Caesarean deliveries, to junior doctors. Doctors should not have any ""political colour""; they should rise above politics and have ""only one colour (humanity)"", she said.Monday's meet, organised by the grievance cell set up by the state in the wake of the RG Kar crime and the public protests that followed it, was Banerjee's first with a general body of doctors following the August 9 incident (though she has met agitating doctors as well as other small groups of doctors in the interim). Her 40-minute speech started with a reference to the RG Kar crime: ""I extend my condolences to the family of the sister who was killed. We demand proper punishment. Our government has passed the Aparajita Bill but it is pending (with Rashtrapati Bhavan). I give the responsibility to my brothers (so that such incidents are not repeated); you protect our sisters. Sisters, too, should protect their brothers.""","Banerjee announced significant hikes - ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000 - for junior and senior resident doctors as well as specialists working at state-run hospitals.

Rat-hole miners arrive to assist in rescue of 8 workers after tunnel collapse in Telangana: What we know so far,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rat-hole-miners-arrive-to-assist-in-rescue-of-8-workers-after-tunnel-collapse-in-telangana-what-we-know-so-far/articleshow/118537616.cms,"The view of tunnel after it collapsed in Telangana

More than 48 hours, still 8 people trapped after tunnel collapsed

Chances of survival very, very remote: Telangana minister Krishna Rao

'Gush of water increased and loose soil also started falling off': Survivor

Six teams of rat miners have arrived in Telangana's Nagarkurnool to assist in the ongoing rescue operation for the Srisailam Left Bank Canal collapse (SLBC), where eight workers are trapped.Firoz Qureshi, a member of rat miner's team, said that a total 6 more teams set to join their 6 teams who already arrived for the rescue of 8 more people, who are trapped after the tunnel collapsed.""I have come from Delhi, our whole team has come from Delhi, Collector has called us here. 6 of us have come here and 6 more will be coming, we are a team of 12 people. In Uttarakhand, we had rescued 41 labourers...till now, we have not received much information. As of now, we have been told that we need to go along with NDRF and SDRF teams. It will be difficult to say something until we see the situation there,"" he added.These Rat miners were previously involved in the successful rescue mission during the Uttarkashi tunnel collapse in Uttarakhand that occurred on October 31 last year.A miner from the team discussed the difficulties ahead, noting that the presence of water in the tunnel and the considerable distance would present significant obstacles during the rescue operation. Nevertheless, he remained optimistic about their chances of success."" We have come from Delhi...we will go inside along with the NDRF and SDRF teams. We will be able to say something when we see the situation inside...our 12-member team rescued the labourers when an incident took place in Uttarakhand during Diwali...we took part in the last 26-hour operation...that situation was different from here...there is difficulty as the distance where the incident has happened is 14 km from entrance point and because of water as well...it might take some time, but we hope that we will succeed,"" one of the members of the Rat miners team.The survival prospects appear grim for the eight individuals who have been trapped for more than two days in the SLBC tunnel following its partial collapse. The rescue teams continue their tireless efforts to reach them. The Indian Army, Navy, NDRF, and other agencies have faced significant challenges in their rescue attempts, having to work through dense muck, intertwined iron rods, and cement blocks.The accident occurred at the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) project in Telangana's Nagarkurnool district on Saturday morning.A substantial rescue force comprising 584 skilled personnel from the Army, Navy, Singareni Collieries, and other agencies, alongside central and state disaster response teams, has conducted seven tunnel inspections. Official sources confirm that gas cutters are being used continuously to cut through the metal obstructions.The rescue operation also employed sniffer dogs to locate the trapped individuals. However, their progress was hindered by water accumulation in the tunnel.The chances of survival of the eight persons who remain trapped in the SLBC tunnel after a partial collapse two days ago are ""very remote,"" though every effort is being made to reach them, Telangana Minister Jupally Krishna Rao said on Monday.""To be honest, the chances of their survival are very, very, very, very remote. Because, I myself went up to the end, almost just 50 meters short (of the mishap site).When we took photographs, the end (of the tunnel) was visible. And out of the 9 meter diameter (of the tunnel)--almost 30 feet, out of that 30 feet, mud has piled up up to 25 feet"", he said.""When we shouted their names also, there was no response...so, there is no chance at all,"" he said.During the ongoing rescue mission for the eight trapped personnel, survivors of the incident remained hopeful for their colleagues' safe return whilst recounting the harrowing events they witnessed.Nirmal Sahu, a worker from Jharkhand, described how on February 22 morning, they encountered a sudden increase in water flow inside the tunnel, accompanied by falling loose soil. He told PTI videos that whilst some workers managed to escape after recognising the imminent danger, eight individuals remained trapped inside.Obi Sahu, who is related to one of the trapped workers, Sandeep Sahu, mentioned that several workers sustained minor injuries whilst fleeing from the tunnel.","Six teams of rat miners have arrived in Telangana's Nagarkurnool to assist in the ongoing rescue operation for the Srisailam Left Bank Canal collapse (SLBC), where eight workers are trapped.

He urged people to observe National Science Day by spending “One Day as a Scientist”, which he said will foster curiosity among children and youth about science.On the country’s space sector achievements, Modi said, “Champions Trophy is going on these days and there is an atmosphere of cricket for everyone. We all know the thrill of a century in cricket. But today, I am not going to talk about cricket, rather I will talk about the wonderful century that India has made in space. Last month, the country was a witness to Isro's 100th rocket launch. This is not just a number, but it shows our resolve to achieve ever-new heights in space science. Our space journey started in a very normal manner. There were challenges in every step, but our scientists continued moving forward achieving victory over them.”“With time, the list of our achievements in space flights continues to grow longer. Be it building a launch vehicle, success of Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and Aditya L1 or carrying out the unprecedented mission of sending 104 satellites into space in one go with one rocket. The ambit of Isro's success has been quite large. In the past 10 years, around 460 satellites have been launched, in which many satellites of other countries are also included,"" the PM said.On growing women’s power in the industry, Modi said, “The participation of women power has been continuously rising in the space sector. I feel very happy seeing that today the space sector has become a favourite of the youth. For our youth who want to do something thrilling and exciting in their life, the space sector is becoming an excellent option for them.""Speaking about National Science Day 2025, which will be celebrated on Feb 28, the PM said that the interest and passion of youth in science matters a lot. ""You try to spend one day as a scientist. You must visit places like a research lab, planetarium or space centre that day. This will increase your curiosity about science. Like space and science, India is rapidly making its mark in another field. That is AI (Artificial intelligence). I went to Paris to take part in an AI summit. There, people lauded India's strides in the field of AI,"" PM Modi said.He also mentioned a teacher from Telangana, Thodasam Kailash, who is harnessing AI technology in digital song and music to help preserve the tribal languages, including Kolami. His tracks are being liked a lot by the tribal people.

J&K is peaceful even now but you should make sure that the peace is permanent,” he said while exhorting the children to carry back the message of peace and development that they have witnessed in rest of the country during the ‘Watan ko Jano’ tour, to their family, friends, neighbours and village in J&K.Around 250 children from J&K visited Jaipur and Delhi as part of the tour aimed at familiarising them with the social and cultural diversities of the country and bringing about an emotional connect among them. “We got a chance to visit the Hawa Mahal and enjoyed the non-Kashmiri cuisine in Jaipur,” Samriti Balraj from Reasi replied when asked by Shah about her experience. “Get your parents to visit next,” he promptly advised.Stating that he sincerely believes that “no govt can maintain peace in J&K as only its children can”, the home minister asked the young J&K visitors to convince their parents and neighbourhood that the entire country belongs to them and that terrorism should be replaced with peaceful co-existence “that is witnessed in the other parts of the country”. To make sure that his message was understood by the children, the home minister gave the analogy of a house with several rooms, saying that states/UTs are like rooms that make India and that Kashmir is one such room. “Like you visit all rooms in your house, you must familiarise with the other states/UTs as well,” he said, even persuading them jokingly to fight with their parents to plan their next family vacation outside J&K.Stating that J&K had witnessed a major change in the last 10 years, with civilian deaths down by 80% and a big push to development, infrastructure and industry, Shah said he was still not satisfied as he firmly believes that not a single Kashmiri youth should die. “Fifteen years ago there were no religious processions like tazia, schools were facing shutdowns and cinema halls were closed. In the past 10 years, roads, bridges, hospitals and educational institutions came up...we empowered the grassroots with the panchayati raj system. Stone-pelting, bomb attacks and terrorism were controlled and school shutdowns became a thing of the past...Development follows when there is peace..You should tell your family and friends that terrorism will not lead you anywhere,” he said.",Around 250 children from J&K visited Jaipur and Delhi as part of the tour aimed at familiarising them with the social and cultural diversities of the country. ‘Watan ko Jano’ (Know Your Country) programme is aimed at bringing about an emotional connect among them.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118540219,imgsize-1144546,width-400,resizemode-4/118540219.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India's technological sector is on the rise and is expected to reach $300-$350 billion in the next five years, defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday.Speaking at the foundation day celebrations of IIT-Mandi , he said the biggest challenge before the country is not only to adapt to rapidly changing technology, but to create new technologies.""Don't just be adapters, become the disruptors who lead innovation,"" the minister said, highlighting the rising number of start-ups in the country. With more than 1.25 lakh start-ups and 110 unicorns, the country is emerging as the third-largest start-up ecosystem in the world, he said.The minister said India is progressing towards self-reliance in defence where it has achieved 88% self-sufficiency in ammunition production.

Rescue operations stalled as water level rises in Telangana tunnel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rescue-operations-stalled-as-water-level-rises-in-telangana-tunnel/articleshow/118540155.cms,"Rescue operations stalled as water level rises in Telangana tunnel (Pic credit: PTI)

HYDERABAD: Hopes for two engineers and six labourers trapped in the Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) tunnel in Telangana 's Nagarkurnool district are diminishing, as more than 48 hours of strenuous efforts to rescue the eight people have come to a standstill, with rising water levels and shifting silt making the operation riskier by the hour.The eight people were trapped deep inside the tunnel when the tunnel roof caved in on Feb 22, while 52 others managed to come out to safety. By late Monday evening, family members of some of the trapped people were also flown in by the authorities.State govt, which initially considered vertical drilling and digging from the top of the tunnel, above 400 metres, has now abandoned that approach. Instead, the authorities have decided to continue efforts from within the tunnel to mitigate any potential harm to rescuers. The increased water inflow and the sudden accumulation of silt have raised grave concerns about the structural integrity of the tunnel, forcing officials to reconsider their strategy.On Monday morning, rescue teams entered the tunnel to assess the situation, only to find that the silt had increased by about one metre, to over seven metres. The influx of water continued unabated, complicating the dewatering process. Experts suspect the fresh water surge could be due to either a sudden increase in activity at the collapsed roof or the onset of a new collapse-though they have been unable to confirm this. Officials further reported that the tunnel boring machine had moved 500 metres, likely due to the rising water, and the conveyor belt used for material removal was damaged.The rescue operation remains on hold as the authorities tread carefully, awaiting more information on how best to proceed without endangering additional lives.The National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) urged govt to slow down operations and proceed with utmost caution. No risks could be taken at this point, they advised, suggesting the tunnel should be observed for any further signs of collapse while the water and silt gushed in.Australian tunnel expert Chris Cooper, too, strongly urged against using gas-cutters or any form of digging, emphasising that the area near the collapsed roof remained unstable. He advised waiting for a more thorough assessment before any further action could be taken.""To gain a clearer picture of the terrain and soil conditions, govt has sent coordinates and maps to institutions like the National Remote Sensing Centre, National Geophysical Research Institute, and Geological Survey of India for further analysis,"" a senior official said.","Two engineers and six labourers trapped in Telangana tunnel since Feb 22.

NAAC purges 900 assessors after corruption allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/naac-purges-900-assessors-after-corruption-allegations/articleshow/118539755.cms,"MUMBAI: The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) took a dramatic step, cutting nearly a fifth of its peer reviewers - almost 900 of them - after allegations of corruption surfaced in the grading process. The purge followed a tip-off to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that assessors visiting Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation , a deemed university in Andhra Pradesh, solicited a bribe in exchange for the highest accreditation grade.At a moment when NAAC was already reassessing its accreditation framework, the mass removal of reviewers signalled a deeper shift. Letters from the NAAC director to the remaining peer reviewers made clear that their work was more than procedural; it was a ""nationally important assignment"".""We were reviewing our processes for over a year. We were also looking at the assessors on board and while we removed many, we were also looking at onboarding some senior academicians, vice-chancellors, deans, and directors of reputed institutes,"" said professor Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman of the NAAC executive committee.In a move aimed at eradicating corruption and streamlining accreditation, after the KLEF case, NAAC abruptly halted physical inspections of colleges. Evaluations, it said, would now be conducted entirely online, eliminating campus visits for colleges. Universities, though, would see a hybrid approach-most assessments would be remote, but select reviewers would still conduct on-site visits to ensure oversight.""Integrity is not a line item-it is the very foundation of trust in the system. We dropped more than 900 assessors. In some cases, the data about these assessors was insufficient; in others, we reviewed their assessments and found them lacking. Some were removed based on feedback we received, and in others, we analysed how they wrote their reports,"" NAAC director Ganesan Kannabiran told TOI.The scrutiny extended beyond individual assessors. NAAC also examined assessment reports from institutions that requested a re-evaluation of their grades. ""In some cases, we compared the two assessment reports and felt that certain assessors' performance did not meet NAAC's requirements,"" Kannabiran added. Those names, too, were struck off the list.The crackdown went beyond internal reform. Each peer team member now receives a direct letter from the NAAC director, reminding them of the expectations placed upon them. ""In recent times, we received complaints that a few higher education institutions (HEIs) were offering above-normal hospitality, organising elaborate cultural activities, arranging sightseeing, and most importantly, offering gifts. Please discourage these aspects and report to us if you notice any such acts or intentions of the HEIs."" A similar message is sent to the institutes too, asking them not to indulge in ""elaborate"" hospitality.The letter is unequivocal. ""We are in the process of identifying such practices of the HEIs and taking punitive action. Keeping the long-term requirements of our nation in mind, I sincerely request you to ensure that a critical and transparent approach is adopted during the entire period of assignment. I strongly believe your invaluable commitment with honesty and integrity in this regard shall positively impact the credibility of NAAC and eventually enhance the quality of education.""",The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) cut nearly a fifth of its peer reviewers.

"2-wheeler crashes have 71% share in traumatic brain injury, reveals study at CMC-Vellore",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/less-than-1-bike-riders-in-crashes-wear-helmets-study/articleshow/118539590.cms,"Less than 1% bike riders in crashes wear helmets: Study

NEW DELHI: In glaring evidence of how two-wheeler crashes have a high share in traumatic brain injury (TBIs) in India, a study at Christian Medical College in Vellore has revealed that over 70% of injuries were due to such accidents and less than 1% of patients were wearing a helmet at the time of crash.The results of the study — based on patients admitted to the hospital and carried out over six and a half years from March 2013 to Sept 2019 – was published on Friday. The report gains significance considering that 77,539 two-wheeler occupants died in road crashes, which was nearly 45% of all road fatalities in 2023 in India. There has been an increase both in the number and share of two-wheeler occupants getting killed in road crashes in the past decade.During the study, researchers identified 3,172 patients, of which 84% were males, who were admitted with TBI. Two-wheeler road traffic crashes caused 2,259 (71%) injuries and only 13 (0.6%) of these patients were wearing a helmet, as per the study. Around one-third of patients reported alcohol consumption.The study paper — prepared by researchers from Cambridge University, CMC’s neurological sciences department, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens — mentioned that the lesser causes of injury included falls (307), pedestrian–vehicle accidents (278) and four-wheeler road traffic accidents (163). The median time from injury to arrival at the emergency department was three hours and 1,093 patients were transferred from a referring hospital. While 1,162 (37%) patients experienced a mild injury, around 33% had moderate injuries and the remaining around 30% (968) had severe injuries.While there were 174 (5%) inpatient deaths, the overall mortality was 540 (17%) in three to nine months. Among the inpatient mortalities, 82 died within two days of admission, 108 within four days, and 147 within eight days. Only around 4% patients had health insurance, and 31% patients were unable to cover their hospital expenses. The average hospital expenditure was Rs 35,850 and the average patient expenditure was Rs 28,900.The report, in its conclusion, said, “In a high-volume tertiary care centre in India, we described a predominantly young male TBI population with a high contribution of two-wheeler road traffic accidents and significant post-discharge mortality. We also identified clinical features associated with inpatient mortality and found that existing prognostic models performed poorly when predicting which patients died after leaving hospital.”It added that a large proportion of TBI cases in low and middle income countries (LMICs) can be prevented or made less severe through public health policies , particularly those addressing road safety and access to pre-hospital care.","Less than 1% of patients were wearing a helmet at the time of crash. 77,539 two- wheeler occupants died in road crashes, which was nearly 45% of all road fatalities in 2023 in India.

Silt, water pose challenge for rescue team at Telangana tunnel

HYDERABAD: Six members of the team behind the heroic Nov 2023 Silkyara tunnel rescue operation in Uttarakhand joined the Army, NDRF, SDRF and local agencies on Sunday in accelerated efforts to save the eight workers - two of them engineers - trapped inside a collapsed portion of Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) in Telangana's Nagarkurnool district, reports Roushan Ali.As the clock ticked on an operation that yielded little in over 36 hours, families of the trapped men and agencies trying to reach them drew hope from the rescue of 41 workers confined for 17 days inside the Silkyara Bend-Barkot tunnel after a portion had caved in.Fears centred around the possibility of debris, including segments of the tunnel's concrete slab, having fallen on the eight workers. There was no contact with any of the trapped men until late Sunday, although rescue teams were stationed just outside the roof collapse site 13.5km inside the tunnel.The teams couldn't make any headway beyond the tunnel boring machine and debris because of the twin barriers of silt and water.Minister Jupally Krishna Rao, who is supervising the rescue effort along with his colleague N Uttam Kumar Reddy, said there was waterlogging along a 2km stretch leading to the collapse point. ""Getting through this is a challenging task. We have to flush out the water before the equipment can push ahead. Only then can removal of debris start. Additional motors have been brought to speed up water removal,"" he said.An irrigation department official said there was hardly 5 to 10 metres of space left where the eight workers were believed to be trapped.""The Telangana govt has requisitioned the Uttarakhand tunnel rescue team along with rat-hole miners to assist in the operation because they have the expertise. Better to have more hands in such a situation. We hope all lives will be saved,"" he added.The ground above the tunnel is 400 metres or nearly half a kilometre in height. Agencies involved in the operation are exploring all possible options to find the easiest exit for the trapped workers.","Silt, water pose challenge for rescue team at Telangana tunnel.

What is the policy on cheerleaders dating players?

It is unacceptable. No fraternizing.

“Our first date was very undercover,” disclosed SI model Camille Kostek about her date with New England Patriots TE Rob Gronkowski

The New York Post

“Our first date was very undercover because I was a cheerleader for the New England Patriots and you’re not allowed to date the players. But I was a bad girl, we went to the movies at Patriot Place in the lux level and we went with our hoodies up.”

“We read our calendars to each other,” Camille Kostek uncovered the secret of long-lasting love before marriage when you’re dating

FOX News Digital

“We read our calendars to each other. We don’t spend every waking moment together, so it’s exciting for us to get on the phone. It’s a common thing weekly to get on the phone together when we are in different states and put out our calendars.

It’s exciting when we line up our schedules. We have our press week, then we squeeze in a dinner together or even just a bagel together on a park bench and make it a romantic movie, even if it’s 30 minutes. But I think that’s what keeps it alive. We both are just so supportive of each other, and whether we are far or together.

Role of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)



Also Read |

Most people consider GDP overall to rank the wealthiest countries in the world, this particular method can be quite unfairly defined. Countries like China and India will rank very different from a small, wealthier country. A straight measure of wealth would be GDP per capita, using the total economic output of a country divided by the actual population. This would give a much fairer estimate of the amount of wealth existing per person to give insight into living standards and the share of the economy owned by the average person which provides the list of top 10 richest countries as per Forbes report.However, GDP per capita does not actually control all differences in cost of living and sometimes purchasing power that people actually have. Economists typically make adjustments for this with Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). The adjustment takes in relative prices of goods and services within countries, thus better enabling comparisons of economic well-being across countries.GDP per capita is calculated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and if adjusted for PPP, the richest ten nations for 2025 are as follows:Luxembourg boasts the world's highest GDP-PPP per capita at $154,910, a result of its extremely high standard of living. The nation's wealth stems from having a highly advanced financial services sector in the areas of banking and investment as well as having a business-friendly environment. While small, the Luxembourg economy is well-developed, and the growth rate of 2.7% is indicative of the country continuing to expand, though at a declining rate, due to the already very high level of prosperity.Singapore is also rich, with a GDP-PPP per capita of $153,610. The economy of Singapore is supported by global trade, finance, and high technology. With one of the world's top financial hubs, Singapore has been favored by its geographical location in Asia and its secure and well-run economy. Economic expansion over the long term of 2.5% captures a healthy business environment and ongoing world trade as per the recent data.Macao SAR, China's Special Administrative Region, boasts an incredible GDP-PPP of $140,250 that indicates its economic wealth largely from the gaming and tourist sectors. It boasts a well-developed casino industry that has contributed a lot to its wealth. It boasts a growth rate of 7.3%, recording a whopping economic growth, mostly due to rising tourism and gaming revenue, and is among the fastest-growing economies in this list.The per capita GDP-PPP in Ireland stands at $131,550 and represents its level of living that is largely triggered by its financial and technology sector. Ireland currently exists as the destination of multinationals, particularly technology and pharmaceutical companies. The economy in Ireland continues to move forward in a steady pace of 2.2% spurred by overseas investment and foreign export as the remainder of the globe experiences boom and bust.Qatar is also endowed with natural resources in the form of oil and natural gas, as is evident from their GDP-PPP per capita of $118,760. Fossil fuel wealth has put Qatar on the list of wealthiest nations. Their growth rate is slower at 1.9%, but that is likely due to the reason that the economy is oil-dependent and diversification has been challenging. But Qatar has a high quality of life for its citizens.Norway has a GDP-PPP per capita of $106,540 due to its massive natural resources, specifically oil and gas. Norway also has a very good social welfare system and lifestyle. Its economy is quite developed although it is fairly low on the list with the 1.8% growth rate in comparison to some of the others on the list since the country's stable but not necessarily rapidly growing economy has already achieved a high degree of prosperity.Switzerland's per capita GDP-PPP of $98,140 is due to its robust economy, which is backed by industries like finance, pharma, and manufacturing industries. Switzerland boasts a high standard of living and a stable financial system. Its economy is expanding at a slower pace at a paltry growth rate of only 1.3%, maybe because it is already economically well-developed and because its market is stable.Brunei Darussalam has a GDP-PPP of $95,040 courtesy of the oil and gas industries. Brunei is very wealthy, if only modest, due to its fossil fuel exports. Its 2.5% growth rate speaks to moderate development, if perhaps less than more diversified nations. Its reliance on petroleum also leaves its economic future at the whim of global energy prices.Guyana, located in South America, has a GDP-PPP per capita of $91,380, which is quite high among countries in the continent. Guyana is economically growing very fast at a rate of 14.4% due to its new oil production industry. This very fast growth of oil production is changing the country's economy and turning it into a wealthier nation, ranking it among the world's fastest-growing economies.The United States' GDP-PPP per capita of $89,680 reflects its high standard of living and huge diversified economy. America is a global leader in industry, technology, and finance. The 2.2% growth rate indicates that the United States' economy is increasing steadily but growing at a lower rate than a few of the new rising economies such as Guyana. Still, it is one of the richest nations with a diversified and healthy economy.At first glance, it may seem surprising that Luxembourg, Singapore, and Macao top the list, while major economies like the United States and China rank lower. The reason is that smaller countries often have advantages that boost their GDP per capita.Per capita GDP is an approximation of wealth, but it certainly does not take into account differences in price indices across countries concerning household consumption expenditures. Thus, Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) eliminates these differences in relative prices of goods and services, so that a more realistic measure of purchasing power is applied. Richer countries looking richer are actually richer with costlier goods and services, then they simply look honest with PPP adjustment per head-there is still incompleteness in that aberrations such as tax havens inflate GDP figures with money that comes from other countries.","Luxembourg boasts the world's highest GDP-PPP per capita at $154,910.

Ashneer Grover-led fantasy cricket platform CrickPe has shut down operations just two years after its launch, according to an Inc42 report. The platform, which was the first product from Grover’s startup Third Unicorn , was introduced ahead of the 2023 Indian Premier League (IPL) season. However, it has now stopped launching new contests.A message on the CrickPe app reads, “We’ve had an amazing innings together. While we won’t be rolling out new contests on the app anymore, this is just a timeout.”Grover told the publication that CrickPe will be shut down by the end of 2024 due to regulatory challenges and taxation issues. He said:“CrickPe has been halted end 2024 as we are not keen on the space given misplaced connotation of gambling with gaming in India and imposition of 28% GST last year. We had great fun with the space but feel it’s best for incumbents like Dream11 and others and the economics of the business does not have scope for incentivising the cricketers out of the game pot – which was our initial idea.”A major challenge for CrickPe was the 28% GST levied on online real-money gaming. The new tax regime, implemented on October 1, 2023, replaced the earlier 18% GST on platform fees for skill-based games.Grover has been a vocal critic of this move. He once posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) that the 28% GST had ""murdered the online gaming industry”. The post was later deleted.While the Supreme Court recently put a temporary hold on GST proceedings against 49 real-money gaming companies, the uncertainty surrounding taxation and regulations appears to have played a role in decision to halt CrickPe.Despite ceasing new contests, CrickPe still allows users to withdraw their winnings.","Ashneer Grover-led fantasy cricket platform CrickPe has shut down operations just two years after its launch.

Fans Question Giancarlo Stanton's Future with Yankees as Elbow Injury Sidelines Him for Spring Training



Yankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton is uncertain for opening day because of tendinitis in both elbows

“The pain was very high in general,” Stanton said. “Tennis elbow or however they call it, is tears in your tendon, so it’s not when did it feel good, when did it feel bad? There’s always the pain level there and you got to deal with that. So, yeah, it’s just the wisest point to give time right now.

“Bro’s gotta stop playing tennis,

“The first double Tommy John in the history of baseball?”

“Man, I’d love to see what this guy’s career HR total would be without all his injuries

.“ Waste of money. I’m tired of seeing him injured every year,”

Sluggish reactions are coming from the fans towards the New York Yankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton for missing Spring Training due to an elbow injury . Reportedly, Stanton, who is nursing a tennis elbow in both his arms, flew back to New York for further medical testing, per various reports including The New York Post.His not being present in the Yankees' spring training camp in Tampa raised concerns among the fans and analysts alike.""Definitely not just soreness. It’s a manageable thing, that's how the year last year and this year will go,"" Stanton said during the recent meeting with the reporters. Stanton was not very sure whether he would be ready for Opening Day, thus raising questions about the Yankees line-up for early-season games.Stanton, a victim of injuries in recent years, has been an All-Star five times. Hitting .233, with 27 home runs and 72 RBIs in 114 games, he battled a left hamstring strain that cost him more than a month on the sidelines in June. However, he enjoyed a postseason breakout with a .273 average, seven homers, and 16 RBIs, leading the Yankees back to the World Series for the first time since 2009. The 35-year-old stated that elbow pain plagued him for much of last season and will now require treatment during Spring Training.Stanton explained” However, fans are starting to grow frustrated, particularly with his recurring injuries that seem to limit his performance year after year.The outcry from fans has been swift, with many voicing their dissatisfaction over Stanton’s inability to stay healthy. Some fans took to social media to share their thoughts:” one frustrated fan wrote.another quipped, referencing Stanton’s history with injuries.,” a fan lamented.” another posted, expressing doubt over Stanton’s long-term valueone fan summed up the sentiment.Giancarlo Stanton's future is rather nebulous as the Yankees gear up for what would be their season-opener against the Milwaukee Brewers on March 27. It will be critical for him, both personally and from a 2025 standpoint, to return to form again and to stay healthy.","Yankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton is uncertain for opening day because of tendinitis in both elbows.

It might have something to do with the 27-year-old's catchphrase 'responsibility' which has him turning inward.Rublev is back at the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships , where he was defaulted 12 months ago, following an animated rant at a lines judge at the fag end of the semifinals. The Russian, known as much for his mercurial temper as for his penchant for self-harm, beating himself with his racket and leaving his hands and legs bloodied, spoke about his struggles with burnout and depression.""I was completely lost. I was thinking what's the purpose of living,"" said Rublev, who has battled in the dark for a few years now. ""The thing is when it happens for a few months, you still have patience (that you can overcome), but when it goes on for years you feel you cannot take it anymore.""It's like a pain,"" he said, pointing at his arm. ""It starts to grow more and more, and you want to cut the arm.""Rublev, who fell in the first round of the Australian Open , won his 17th career title in Doha last week. ""I was taking antidepressants, but after one year of taking antidepressants, I realized that in the beginning you feel a bit better, then nothing afterwards,"" he said. ""After some time I realized that while it's not getting worse, something was weird. I didn't like that feeling so I stopped taking the medication.""With the help of his charismatic compatriot Marat Safin , a former World No. 1, Rublev started finding his way back. ""Marat made me understand myself, that was a bit of a restart from the bottom. From there, little by little, I started to move in a better direction,"" he said, adding, ""I'm not in a good or a bad place (now), but I'm not feeling any more stress, I'm not feeling anxious, I'm not having depression. I'm just neutral. Not happy, not bad, but I have found a base and that's a beginning.""The main thing is to be honest with yourself,"" the World No. 9 said. ""All of us think that we (may not be) honest with people, but with ourselves we are honest. This is a huge lie because most people are not even honest with themselves. I was the same. I (thought) I have no problem saying if I'm wrong, if I'm right, if I made a mistake.""I was lying to myself about many things. I didn't even want to understand or notice it. You need someone who can make you see yourself in an honest way.""""People put masks on, they make excuses for that, I'm doing that because someone hurt me or I don't want them to see the real me.,"" he said, ""They are already lying, running away from the problem, finding an excuse. They don't want to face themselves. The first thing is to be honest with yourself, then start to be more aware.""This search for his true self is stirred by a one-word reminder - responsibility -which Rublev writes on his shoes. Every time he looks down the word stares back at him. ""I'm putting that word there to remind myself that I'm the one, it's not because of anything or anyone. If something bad or good happens to me, it's not because of luck but because I made a mistake (or did something right). You cannot blame anything or anyone, this is a reminder to myself not to complain.""",Andrey Rublev talks about his struggles with burnout and depression.

WRC Drivers Challenge FIA's Strict Ban on Swearing



World Rally Championship (WRC) drivers are speaking out against the FIA ’s stringent ban on swearing, labeling the rule as “unrealistic” and urging motorsport's governing body for open dialogue to find an “urgent solution.” The controversy stems from the FIA’s updated sporting code, which now enforces stricter punishments under Article 12 for misconduct, including bad language and actions deemed as causing ‘moral injury’ to the organization.The debate over swearing in motorsport began last year when FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem ordered a crackdown on drivers’ language, leading to notable penalties. Max Verstappen was sentenced to a day of community service, while Charles Leclerc received a monetary fine for swearing during FIA press conferences. This year, the FIA has doubled down with a revised sporting code that outlines severe consequences, including fines and the potential for suspensions or point deductions for repeat offenders.The guidelines are enforced through a tiered system, with Formula 1 facing the harshest penalties—four times the base fines—while the WRC falls under tier three with base fines multiplied by three. The first significant penalty under the new rules was imposed on Adrien Fourmaux, who was fined €10,000 for using the F-word while discussing his performance at Rally Sweden. Fourmaux candidly stated, “We f***ed up yesterday,” when reflecting on a challenging stage, which led to the hefty fine.The incident has amplified frustrations among WRC drivers, who argue that the rules are ambiguous and the penalties disproportionately harsh. This sentiment has been echoed by the World Rally Drivers Association (WoRDA), which issued a statement demanding clearer guidelines from the FIA. They stressed the need for consistency, especially since confusion persists about what language is deemed unacceptable.The issue extends beyond the WRC, as Formula 1 stars Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc also faced varying consequences for similar language-related offenses. This inconsistency has fueled calls for a more transparent rulebook that ensures fairness across all motorsport categories.Also Read: Mercedes unveils 2025 W16 F1 car ahead of Bahrain testing: A glimpse into the future of speed As discussions with the FIA are anticipated, WRC drivers remain hopeful for a resolution that balances professional conduct with realistic expectations, emphasizing that authenticity and raw emotions are intrinsic to competitive racing.","World Rally Championship (WRC) drivers are speaking out against the FIA ’s stringent ban on swearing.

Buldhana hair loss cases: Expert blame high selenium in wheat crop,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/maharashtras-buldhana-hair-loss-cases-expert-report-blames-high-selenium-in-wheat/articleshow/118544933.cms,"NEW DELHI: Medical experts have linked cases of sudden hair loss affecting 279 people in Maharashtra's Buldhana district to high selenium content found in wheat supplied through local ration shops from Punjab and Haryana.The incidents, which occurred between December 2024 and January 2025, primarily affected college students and young girls, causing significant social challenges and prompting authorities to launch an investigation.The affected individuals experienced symptoms including headache, fever, scalp itching, tingling, and in some cases vomiting and loose motions. Many faced social stigma, leading some to shave their heads to avoid embarrassment.""The primary cause of the outbreak was linked to wheat imported from Punjab and Haryana, which was found to have a significantly higher selenium content than the locally produced wheat,"" said Dr Himmatrao Bawaskar, MD of Bawaskar Hospital and Research Centre in Raigad.""Our analysis of wheat from the affected region revealed that it contained 600 times more selenium than the locally grown variety. This high selenium intake is believed to be the cause of the alopecia cases,"" Dr Bawaskar explained.The condition progressed rapidly, with patients experiencing total baldness within three to four days of initial symptoms.""The blood, urine and hair samples showed a 35-fold, 60-fold and 150-fold increase in selenium content, respectively. This suggests that excessive selenium intake is a direct contributor to the outbreak,"" Bawaskar said.""Our team also found that zinc levels were significantly lower in the affected individuals, pointing to a potential imbalance caused by the excess selenium,"" he added.The investigation revealed that the high selenium content was naturally present in the grain and not due to external contamination. Selenium, a mineral found in soil, is essential for human metabolism in small quantities.""The region where the outbreak occurred is known for its salty, alkaline soil and recurrent droughts, which have affected agricultural productivity. Many families rely on government-subsidised wheat from ration shops, which have been poorly regulated for quality,"" Bawaskar stated in his report.""The wheat supplied to the affected villages was sourced from the regions with high selenium content, contributing to the health crisis,"" he noted.The expert emphasized the need for stronger regulation of food supplies, particularly in areas dependent on government-provided rations.Authorities have advised residents to stop consuming the selenium-rich wheat. Some affected individuals have reported partial hair regrowth within 5-6 weeks after discontinuing consumption of the contaminated wheat."," 279 people in Maharashtra's Buldhana district suffered sudden hair loss.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
