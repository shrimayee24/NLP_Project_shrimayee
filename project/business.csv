Purulia arms drop case: Why Denmark denied India's extradition request for Niels Holck,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/purulia-arms-drop-case-why-denmark-denied-indias-extradition-request-for-niels-holck/articleshow/112910799.cms,"NEW DELHI: A Danish court on Thursday turned down India's request to extradite Niels Holck, accused of air-dropping four tonnes of weapons in West Bengal's Purulia in 1995.The court said that there is a possible risk Holck would be subjected to treatment that violates the European Convention on Human Rights if he were sent to India, despite India's diplomatic assurances that he would be housed in a special detention centre during the criminal proceedings, potentially accompanied by Danish police officers as observers.India has been seeking Holck's extradition for several years to face trial on suspicion of arms smuggling. Holck had previously admitted to a Danish court that he was part of a seven-member group responsible for smuggling weapons into West Bengal on a Russian cargo plane on December 17, 1995.The illegal arms drop, known as the Purulia Arms Drop, occurred in the Purulia district of West Bengal on December 17, 1995. The weapons were dropped from an Antonov An-26 aircraft before an Indian Air Force aircraft intercepted it.Five Latvian citizens and Peter Bleach, a British citizen and former Special Air Service officer, were arrested after the Indian Air Force intercepted their returning plane, while 'Kim Davy' alias Niels Holck, escaped. All of them were sentenced to life imprisonment in 2000 but eventually released.Meanwhile, Holck was arrested later in Denmark in April 2010 following a deal with India over the terms of his extradition, including a promise that he would not be given the death penalty and would serve any sentence in Denmark.However, a Danish district court in 2011 overturned the authorities' decision, saying he risked mistreatment in India. An appeals court later upheld the district court's ruling.India's initial extradition request for Holck was made in 2002. Although the Danish government agreed, two Danish courts rejected the extradition, citing concerns that Holck would face torture or other inhumane treatment in India. In June 2023, Denmark revisited a 2016 Indian extradition request, stating that the requirements in the extradition act had been met.",Niels Holck accused of air-dropping four tonnes of weapons in West Bengal's Purulia in 1995.

"To attract private investment, a robust arbitration system is a must: SC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-attract-private-investment-a-robust-arbitration-system-is-a-must-sc/articleshow/112910722.cms,"Can Railway,

and

PSUs

appoint arbitrators unilaterally?

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday said at a time when private investment in India is crucial to the country’s economy, the need of the hour is a robust, transparent and independent arbitration system to infuse confidence in the domestic and international investors.This observation came from a five-judge bench comprising CJI D Y Chandrachud, and Justices Hrishikesh Roy, P S Narasimha, J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra during the adjudication of a question that is of vital importance to investors’ confidence – can the railways, PSUs and NBFCs create a panel of arbitrators from which the opposite party is to choose from for adjudication of disputes arising from alleged contractual breaches.Many private parties had questioned the impartiality and independence of the panel of arbitrators, which is put in place by the railways, PSUs and NBFCs, claiming that their autonomy of choosing an arbitrator was breached, rendering the arbitration process arbitrary or one-sided.The CJI-led bench said it is of vital public importance that arbitration processes remain fair and private stakeholders’ interest and confidence in the arbitral proceedings is maintained without compromising on the government interests. “But the government's interest is not that it should always get a favourable arbitral award,” the bench said.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the railways and PSUs have hundreds of running arbitration proceedings involving thousands of crores of rupees at a time and for that purpose a panel of arbitrators withdomain knowledge in needed to be in place without compromising on the integrity and capability of the persons included in the panel of arbitrators.He said even the international arbitration laws validate one party appointing arbitrators if that is provided in the contract and a private party enters into an agreement on its own volition to take up the contracted work.He said the Indian Arbitration Act also recognizes the creation of a panel by one party from which both sides to arbitral dispute can choose from. The SG said the Act amply provisioned for party autonomy in the arbitration process while ensuring its fairness.He was supported by additional solicitor general K M Natraj, and senior advocates Guru Krishna Kumar and Madhavi Divan. The two senior advocates said that NBFCs face a huge number of defaulters in repayment of loans and do not respond to notices for arbitration. If arbitrators are not to be appointed by NBFCs unilaterally, then because of earlier judgments of the SC, the arbitral awards would be rendered null and void which would create a paradise for defaulters.Arguments on the crucial issue of whether railways and PSUs can validly and unilaterally create a panel of arbitrators would be concluded on Friday.","Supreme Court says need of the hour is a robust, transparent and independent arbitration system to infuse confidence in the domestic and international investors.

The Mandi MP accused Sirumani Akali Dal leader Simranjit Singh Mann of ""trivializing rape"" after he suggested that the actor-turned politician was in a better position to explain rape as ""she has a lot of experience"".Earlier in the day, SAD leader Simranjit Singh Mann responding to the BJP MP's recent remarks on the farmers' protests over the now-scrapped farm reform laws said, ""I don't want to say this but Kangana Ranaut has a lot of experience of rape and you can ask her how rape happens so that people can be explained.Just as you gain experience from riding a bicycle, similarly, they have experience with rape.""The BJP MP outraged by the comment promptly took to X and said, ""This is so deep rooted in the psyche of this patriarchal nation that it is casually used to tease or mock a women even if she is a high profile filmmaker or politician.""""It seems this country will never stop trivialising rape, today this senior politician compared getting raped to riding a bicycle no wonder rapes and violence against women for fun,"" she added.The actor-turned politician courted controversy earlier this week by suggesting that the farmers’ protest could have led to a Bangladesh-like situation in India if not for strong measures taken by Modi government. The BJP MP also alleged that ""bodies were hanging"" and ""rapes"" were taking place during the farmers' protests, which went on for nearly a year in 2019-2020. She also went one step further and alleged the involvement of China and the US in the ""conspiracy"".The BJP MP however faced severe criticism from many opposition quarters , while the BJP distanced itself from her remarks. “The statement made by BJP MP Kangana Ranaut in the context of farmers’ movement is not the opinion of the party. BJP expresses its disagreement with the statement made by Kangana Ranaut,” the party said.It added that Ranaut was “neither permitted nor authorised” to make statements on the party’s policies. In a statement, the party further said, “BJP is committed to follow the principles of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas and sabka prayas’ and social harmony.” However, after facing backlash and getting reprimanded by the party, the BJP MP so far has met BJP chief Nadda twice with the latest meeting coming on Thursday.The actor's remarks claiming that “Bangladesh like anarchy” could have taken place in India “in the name of farmers’ protest”, came during a protest for upcoming movie 'Emergency'.“Outside forces are planning to destroy us with help of insiders. If it wouldn’t have been the foresight of our leadership they would have succeeded,” the Mandi MP controversially had said.","BJP MP Kangana Ranaut took strong exception to a controversial 'rape' remark made against her by a former Punjab MP.

DGCA puts cash-strapped SpiceJet under its 'enhanced surveillance'; airline sends 150 cabin crew members on furlough,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dgca-says-cash-strapped-spicejet-flights-to-operate-under-its-enhanced-surveillance/articleshow/112901031.cms,"NEW DELHI: Cash-strapped SpiceJet will now operate under the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s ( DGCA ) enhanced surveillance . Following “cancellation of flights and financial stress being experienced by SpiceJet,” the regulator had conducted a special audit of the airline’s engineering facilities on August 7 & 8, 2024, which “revealed certain deficiencies.”“In light of the (airline’s) past record” and audit findings, SpiceJet will again see an increase in spot checks and night surveillance of its aircraft “to ensure safety of operations,” the regulator said in a statement Thursday.The airline also placed 150 cabin crew members on “furlough for three months.”The regulatory action came on a day when poor financial condition saw a SpiceJet Delhi-Dubai flight (SG 11) not overflying Pakistan and taking the longer Gujarat-Arabian Sea route as the airline reportedly could not manage to pay overflying charges to Pakistan. This flight took 3 hours and 44 minutes, 20 minutes more than the same flight on Wednesday when it overflew Pakistan.Then Dubai Airport on Thursday morning stopped boarding of SpiceJet flights — something that has happened multiple times this fortnight — over dues. As a result, the aircraft flew without passengers to India. Industry sources say Dubai Airports could cancel some slots given to SpiceJet which could then go to other Indian carriers.Regarding Dubai trouble, a SpiceJet spokesperson said: “Due to operational reasons, a few SpiceJet flights from Dubai were cancelled. Affected passengers have been accommodated on our subsequent flights; other airlines or provided with a full refund. All our scheduled flights from Dubai are now operating as planned.”Late Thursday night, the airline said it has “made the difficult decision to temporarily place 150 cabin crew members on furlough for three months (due) to current lean travel season and reduced fleet size.” “During this furlough period, they will continue to retain their status as employees of SpiceJet, with all health benefits and earned leave intact. As we work toward enhancing our fleet following the upcoming qualified institutional placement, we look forward to welcoming our crew members back to active duty. We are committed to supporting our employees during this period,” the spokesperson added.The airline — along with its employees, passengers and other stakeholders — have been facing turbulence for some years now due to the former’s inability to so far raise the required amount of funds. It has been reducing operations and its domestic market share this July, 2024, had fallen to 3.1% from 5.6% in January 2024, as per Govt data.“After a series of occurrences reported on SpiceJet fleet in 2022, a special drive of spot checks was undertaken during which the airline was permitted to release aircraft for operations only after confirming to DGCA that all reported defects/ malfunctions had been rectified. In 2023, it was again placed under enhanced surveillance (due to) financial stress,” the DGCA statement added.SpiceJet has not paid July salaries to many employees till date. On Wednesday several airline staffers, including loaders who are supposed to get about Rs 15,000, did not report for work at Guwahati. The airline has not deposited provident fund for a long time. TDS is routinely delayed. Salaries are elusive. Many airport operators and oil companies have put the airline on cash and carry. Some engine and aircraft lessors have the airlines to court to repossess their assets over alleged non-payment of rentals.DGCA data shows only 29.3% of SpiceJet domestic flights operated last month. Many engine and aircraft lessors have taken SpiceJet to court over non-payment of rentals.",SpiceJet will again see an increase in spot checks and night surveillance of its aircraft.

India commissions INS Arighat: Know all about Navy's 2nd nuclear-powered submarine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-commissions-ins-arighat-know-all-about-navys-2nd-nuclear-powered-submarine/articleshow/112900556.cms,"All about INS Arighat

INS Arighat will join its predecessor, INS Arihant , which became fully operational in 2018, to enhance the country's 'nuclear triad'—the capability to launch nuclear weapons from land, air, and sea.

, which became fully operational in 2018, to enhance the country's 'nuclear triad'—the capability to launch nuclear weapons from land, air, and sea. INS Arihant and INS Arighat are powered by 83 MW pressurized light-water reactors, allowing them to remain submerged for extended periods, unlike conventional diesel-electric submarines that need to surface regularly.

Indian nuclear-powered ballistic submarines are named the Arihant class, a Sanskrit term meaning 'Destroyer of the Enemy.' The name was chosen for its subtlety and appropriateness.

The Indian government plans to build both nuclear and conventional submarines as part of its long-term acquisition and capability development strategy. This includes five Arihant-class submarines and six nuclear attack submarines, to be constructed in three phases.

With India’s “no-first use” nuclear policy, SSBNs (Submarine-Launched Ballistic Nuclear Submarines) play a key role in deterrence due to their difficulty in detection and their ability to survive a surprise attack and execute retaliatory strikes.

Countries like the US, Russia, and China have larger SSBNs with longer-range missiles. For example, China has six Jin-class SSBNs with JL-3 missiles capable of 10,000 kilometers, and the US operates 14 Ohio-class SSBNs.

A project costing around Rs 40,000 crore is under consideration by the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security for the construction of two 6,000-tonne ‘hunter-killer’ SSNs (nuclear-powered attack submarines), armed with torpedoes, anti-ship, and land-attack missiles. The construction is expected to take at least a decade.

On conventional submarine development, Indian Navy has acquired six new Kalvari-class submarines and plans to add 15 more through Project 75 India, Project-76, and Project-75 AS.

NEW DELHI: In a major step towards further strengthening its strategic deterrence capabilities, India on Thursday commissioned INS Arighat , which is the country's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles .The commissioning of the almost 112-metre-long submarine, armed with K-15 missiles that have a strike range of 750 km, took place at the secretive ship-building centre in Visakhapatnam in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh and top national security and military officials.""Second Arihant-Class submarine 'INS Arighaat' commissioned into Indian Navy in the presence of Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh in Visakhapatnam. PM Modi-led Govt is working on mission mode to equip soldiers with top-quality weapons & platforms,"" the defence ministry wrote on X.","INS Arighat will join its predecessor, INS Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018.

The complaints were made by six women wrestlers, and the trial court found that the complaint of one of them was time-barred, so it framed charges based on the complaints of five victims, senior advocate Rebecca John stated, adding that, ""this shows there was a deep application of mind.""Appearing for Singh, advocate Rajiv Mohan claimed that the allegations levelled against Singh were motivated with the hidden agenda to remove him from the post of WFI chief. He added that there was no commonality between the complaints yet these were clubbed together. Mohan further stated that there was no continuity in the instances.The high court, however, said that all the averments now being made by Singh must have been considered by the trial court at the time of framing of charges. The court asked Singh's counsel to prepare a short note raising all the contentions prayed for in the plea and granted him two weeks, listing the matter for further hearing on Sept 26.Singh, in his plea, claimed that the investigation was done in a biased manner as only the version of the victims, who were interested in taking revenge against him, was considered and the chargesheet was filed before the trial court without taking care of the falsehood of the allegation.","Delhi High Court declines immediate relief to former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

"Pending cases in SC close to 83,000 now, the highest ever",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pending-cases-in-sc-close-to-83000-now-the-highest-ever/articleshow/112908859.cms,"Times View Cases generally arrive at apex court after spending years in lower courts. It is the last port of judicial refuge. Further delay only aggravates a person’s suffering and misery. That apart, the sluggish pace of trials in momentous matters hurts nation and society. Those in positions of power should devise ways to change the scenario. It has been said a thousand times before but needs to be restated that “justice delayed is justice denied.”

NEW DELHI: Increase in strength of judges in the Supreme Court appears to have had minimal impact on the pendency of cases, which has in the last 10 years grown eight times and reduced only twice. Pendency in the apex court is now close to 83,000 cases, the highest ever.After the sanctioned strength of judges in the SC was increased from 26 to 31 in 2009, the pendency kept increasing steadily from 50,000 to 66,000 in 2013.It reduced to 63,000 during the tenure of CJIs P Sathasivam and R M Lodha in 2014. The next CJI H L Dattu was able to further reduce it to 59,000 in 2015.Next year, it increased to 63,000 cases during the tenure of CJI T S Thakur. Justice J S Khehar, who was the first to propose paperless courts through infusion of information technology in the case management system, was able to reduce it substantially to 56,000. In 2018, during the tenure of Justice Dipak Misra as CJI, the pendency increased to 57,000 cases.Justice Ranjan Gogoi as CJI was able to convince the govt to increase the sanctioned strength of SC judges, through a Parliamentary enactment, from 31 to 34 in 2019. But the increase in judge strength also saw the pendency increase to 60,000 cases. When Justice S A Bobde was CJI, Covid pandemic virtually paralysed the justice delivery system for some time before it limped back through virtual proceedings. The pendency shot up to 65,000.In 2021-22, Covid continued to impede case disposal even during CJI N V Ramana's tenure as CJI. The pendency touched 70,000 cases in 2021 and increased to 79,000 by the end of 2022, a year in which CJIs Ramana and U U Lalit retired, and Justice D Y Chandrachud became CJI.In the last two years, the pendency increased by almost 4,000 cases to get within touching distance of 83,000 cases, the highest ever, displaying its potency to defy many innovative I-T based technological interventions under Justice Chandrachud to streamline categorisation and bunching of pending cases .Of the 82,831 cases pending as of today, 27,604 (of 33% of cases) are less than a year old. While 38,995 fresh cases were filed this year, the SC disposed of 37,158 cases, the rate of disposal almost matching the rate of institution of cases.In the high courts, the cumulative pendency of cases was 41 lakh in 2014. The cumulative pendency never showed signs of a dip in the last decade, except once. From 41 lakh in 2014, it increased to 61 lakh in 2023, before dipping to 59 lakh this year. The trial courts had a pendency of 2.6 crore cases in 2014 and now it has increased to 4.5 crore cases.","Cases generally arrive at apex court after spending years in lower courts.

A Louis county circuit court in Missouri granted divorce by mutual consent in Feb 2016. All possessions, material and financial, were settled between the parties through a separation agreement. She remarried in May 2018.Three years later, Rao filed an FIR against his daughter's erstwhile in-laws in Hyderabad seeking return of her 'streedhan'.The erstwhile in-laws unsuccessfully moved Telangana HC for quashing of the FIR. Then they appealed against the HC order in the SC A bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and Sanjay Karol quashed the case against the in-laws and said the father had no locus standi to seek return of his daughter's 'streedhan' as that belonged solely to her.""The generally accepted rule, which has been judicially recognised, is that the woman exercises an absolute right over the property,"" said Justice Karol, writing the judgment.""The jurisprudence, as has been developed by this court, is unequivocal with respect to the singular right of the female (wife or former wife as the case may be) being the sole owner of 'streedhan'. A husband has no right, and it must then be necessarily concluded that a father, too, has no right when the daughter is alive, well and entirely capable of making decisions such as pursuing the cause of the recovery of her 'streedhan',"" the bench said. ""The object of criminal proceedings is to bring a wrongdoer to justice, and it is not a means to get revenge or seek vendetta against persons with whom the complainant may have a grudge,"" it added. One more aspect which went against the father was that he initiated criminal proceedings for recovery of 'streedhan' after more than two decades of marriage, five years after its dissolution, and three years after his daughter's remarriage.Justice Karol said another crucial element against the father's claim was that he was not authorised by his daughter to initiate action for recovery of her 'streedhan'. The court also found that the father had provided no proof of any 'streedhan' being given to his daughter at the time of her marriage in 1999 and that the parties to matrimony had never raised the issue of 'streedhan' in their separation settlement of 2016. ""There is no evidence to suggest that the claimed 'streedhan' was in the possession of the daughter's in-laws,"" the SC said.","Supreme Court rules that a woman is the sole owner of her'streedhan' The gold ornaments and other articles were given by her parents at the time of marriage.

July-Aug monsoon across India set to be among two wettest in last 30 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/july-aug-monsoon-across-india-set-to-be-among-two-wettest-in-last-30-years/articleshow/112906101.cms,"La Nina

, earlier slated for Aug, may now arrive only by Nov

Cyclone likely in Arabian Sea, the first in Aug since 1976

NEW DELHI: With the run of good rains continuing for over two months, the monsoon in July and Aug this year is set to be among the two wettest the country has seen in 30 years, bringing good news for kharif-crop sowing and for soil moisture in subsequent months.Rain recorded across India in July-Aug currently stands at 585mm and is expected to cross 595mm in the next two days, which will be around 11% higher than the long period average (535.4mm).This will be close to or higher than 596.1mm recorded in 2019, the wettest July-Aug in the 30 years.This follows better-than-expected rains in the country in Aug, which came on the heels of a 9% surplus in July. As of Aug 29, average rainfall across India during the month was 16% above normal. IMD had forecast Aug rains to be in normal range (94-106% of LPA).Rainfall in Aug has been beyond expectations. Weather models were predicting a 10 to14-day weak phase during the month. While rains in central India did see a dip for around two weeks, north and south India continued to receive good rainfall during this period,” said M Rajeevan, veteran meteorologist and former secretary in the earth sciences ministry.July and Aug are the rainiest months in the country, accounting for nearly 62% of total rainfall in the June-Sept monsoon season and usually, the monsoon doesn’t perform well across both months. Last year, for instance, the monsoon was 13% above normal in July but failed in Aug, when the rain deficit was as high as 36%.Rajeevan said active MJO conditions aided the monsoon in Aug. MJO — Madden Julian Oscillation — is a pulse of stormy weather that moves eastwards along the equator, typically returning to the same spot every one to three months. MJO’s presence in the Indian Ocean usually enhances monsoon rainfall in India. Significantly, MJO had aided the monsoon in July as well.Meanwhile, the latest forecast by US agencies said that La Nina conditions, which were earlier expected to set in around Aug, may do so only by Nov. It’s expected to be weak and transitory, the forecast added. La Nina, a cooling of ocean waters in central and eastern equatorial Pacific, is another major weather condition that favours monsoon rainfall in India.“Ocean temperatures in the Pacific haven’t reached La Nina thresholds but the region remains cooler than usual and this has positively impacted the monsoon in Aug,” Rajeevan said.In a forecast released Thursday, IMD said conditions are likely to remain good for monsoon over the next two weeks.In a rare occurrence, the deep depression currently over Saurashtra and Kutch that has been causing heavy rainfall in Gujarat for the past four-five days, is set to cross into the Arabian Sea and intensify into a cyclone by Friday, IMD said.Since 1891, only three cyclones have developed in Arabian Sea in the month of Aug, the last of which was in 1976. While the storm is expected to move westwards along the coast of Pakistan and Iran, winds gusting up to 75kmph are likely along and off the Gujarat coast from Thursday to Saturday, the agency said.Simultaneously, a low-pressure system in the Bay of Bengal is likely to develop into a depression and move towards north Andhra Pradesh-south Odisha in the next two days, IMD warned.",Monsoon in July and Aug this year is set to be among the two wettest the country has seen in 30 years.

The PM said this is a sharp contrast to how the country lived with scarcity.Sources said the PM emphasised on the need to think big and fast track decision-making for rapid development across all sectors. In a sarcastic remark on bureaucrats moving files from one table to another, Modi compared this with pilgrimage. Quoting the PM, a source said, “Char Dham yatra ke baad humein toh moksh mil jaata hai, par files ko 16 dham darshan ke baad bhi moksh nehin milta (After pilgrimage of Char Dham we attain salvation, but files don’t get this even after travelling through 16 desks).”Modi also asked ministers and top civil servants to involve state govt officials for seamless implementation of plans and schemes. His remark came after going through presentations of two groups of secretaries on infrastructure and social welfare, which detailed the roadmap for the next five years and for 2047.He also asked the top bureaucrats to carry out an assessment for restructuring manpower in each department and ministry and also to focus on capacity building of all employees, including the multi-tasking staff. Govt has rolled out iGOT Karmayogi, an online learning platform for capacity building of all employees.TOI has learnt that during interaction, Union minister Kiren Rijiju said that while earlier people used to visit Delhi to see India Gate, Red Fort and Qutub Minar, now the national capital has got more attractions including, the New Parliament, National War Memorial and PMs Museum. “He suggested that cities with iconic structures or elements should be leveraged in branding them like Paris around the Eiffel Tower. There are around 60 plus cities, which can be developed on that model,” said an official.",Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all ministers and top officials to ‘inform’ people about decisions taken by govt.

"Amid China standoff, India set to boost naval power with 3rd N-sub in 6 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-china-standoff-india-set-to-boost-naval-power-with-3rd-n-sub-in-6-months/articleshow/112905487.cms,"NEW DELHI: India plans to commission its third nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) in another six months to further bolster its sea-based leg of the nuclear weapons triad, after the second such boat was formally inducted into the Strategic Forces Command as INS Arighaat at Visakhapatnam on Thursday.The third SSBN, which is now undergoing trials ahead of her commissioning as INS Aridhaman early next year, is slightly bigger than the first two, INS Arihant and INS Arighaat, and consequently capable of carrying more long range nuclear-tipped missiles.Significantly, INS Arighaat is also capable of carrying some K-4 missiles, which have a strike range of over 3,000-km, unlike her forerunner INS Arihant that is armed only with the 750-km range K-15 missiles, sources told TOI.This is crucial for credible strategic deterrence amid the continuing military confrontation with China. Capable of staying submerged for months on end, SSBNs are the most secure, survivable and stealthy platforms for second-strike capabilities, which in turn deter an adversary from launching a surprise first strike.The commissioning of INS Arighaat, which has a 6,000-tonne displacement and four silos on its `hump’ for the vertical launch of missiles, was conducted at the secretive ship-building centre in Vizag, with defence minister Rajnath Singh, chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan, Navy chief Admiral Dinesh Tripathi and DRDO chief Samir Kamat in attendance.“INS Arighaat will further strengthen India’s nuclear triad, enhance nuclear deterrence, help in establishing strategic balance and peace in the region, and play a decisive role in the country’s security,” Singh said.Recalling former PM Vajpayee’s `political will’ that put India on a par with nuclear weapon states by conducting the Pokhran-II tests in 1998, Singh said, “It is essential for us to develop rapidly in every field, including defence, especially in today's geopolitical scenario. Along with economic prosperity, we need a strong military. Our government is working on mission mode to ensure that our soldiers possess top-quality weapons and platforms made on Indian soil.”Indigenous technological improvements on INS Arighaat make it “significantly more advanced” than its predecessor Arihant, which became fully operational in 2018. “The two together will enhance India’s capability to deter potential adversaries and safeguard its national interests. INS Arighaat’s hull and size may be the same as INS Arihant but she is a much more capable version with lot of internal engineering upgrades,” an official said.INS Aridhaman and the fourth under-construction SSBN, in turn, will be even more potent. With a 7,000-tonne displacement and 125-metre long, they will be able to carry a larger number of K-4 missiles.The four submarines, built under the classified advanced technology vessel (ATV) project launched in the 1990s at a cost of over Rs 90,000 crore, are of course less than half the size of the SSBNs of countries like the US, China and Russia.China has six Jin-class SSBNs, with 10,000-km range JL-3 missiles, apart from six nuclear-powered attack submarines (called SSNs, meant conventional warfare). The US, in turn, has 14 Ohio-class SSBNs and 53 SSNs.India is also working on a plan to eventually build 13,500-tonne SSBNs with much more powerful 190 MW reactors. Parallelly, as was reported by TOI earlier, a Rs 40,000 crore project to indigenously construct two 6,000-tonne `hunter-killer’ SSNs, armed with torpedoes, anti-ship and land-attack missiles, is now before the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security for the final nod after repeated iterations and inter-ministerial consultations. It will take at least a decade to construct them.","India plans to commission its third nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) in another six months.

Government to launch ‘repairability index’ for electronics by December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-launch-repairability-index-for-electronics-by-december/articleshow/112904540.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt will launch a ‘ repairability index ’ for mobile phones and electronic products by Dec, a move that will help consumers make informed decisions before purchasing them. The initiative aims to address the growing e-waste problem and encourage manufacturers to produce more easily repairable items.Speaking at a workshop on ‘Right to Repair Framework’ organised by the govt, Union consumer affairs secretary Nidhi Khare said after the roll out of the index, the department will come up with a regulatory framework as well.“As India emerges as the third largest economy in the world, we should have a vibrant and tech-savvy repair system,” she said. Top industry players attended the meeting and supported the govt’s move.The ‘repairability index’ is a display or information that manufacturers will have to put on electrical and electronic equipment to inform about their repairability. Sources said once the regulatory framework is notified, manufacturers in India will have to mandatorily display them like in France.The proposed index will rate products on criteria including availability of technical documents, ease of disassembly, spare parts availability and pricing of spare parts. It will assess various elements that determine how easily a product can be repaired and thereby ultimately promoting a circular economy and reducing e-waste.Officials said the repairability index would score products on a scale of 1 to 5. The lowest score of 1 will be given to products that have increased risk of getting damaged and require dismantling of multiple components to access a single part. Products that offer a compromise, making some components easily accessible while others requiring more complex disassembly will get the score of 3 while items that are easy to repair as they allow direct access to parts like battery or display without unnecessary removal of other components will get the maximum score of 5.In an official statement, the consumer affairs department said that the workshop was aimed at establishing a consensus among industry stakeholders on “key parameters for accessing and evaluating repairability index” besides promoting longevity in product design, and democratising repair information to enhance consumer experiences in reusing the mobile and electronics products they own.HCL Technologies founder Ajai Chowdhry called for legislation to drive the change. “Today, most products are not repairable. We need to design products which can be repaired... Unless we create a law, things will not change,” he said.The govt has launched a ‘Right to Repair’ portal, with 63 companies onboard, including 23 from the mobile and electronics sector. India is the third largest electronic waste producer globally after China and the US.","The initiative aims to address the growing e-waste problem and encourage manufacturers to produce more easily repairable items.

The government had banned the sale of rice for ethanol production last year.In another decision just ahead of the Maharashtra assembly election, government also revoked the restriction on use of sugarcane juice and sugar syrup for ethanol production, which was imposed last December.As per a notification issued by the food ministry, it permitted sugar mills to use cane juice or syrup to produce ethanol for the ethanol supply year (ESY) 2024-25, beginning November 1.According to the food ministry, grain-based ethanol producers can participate in e-auctions and purchase FCI rice between August and October 2024 under the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS). The ministry said ethanol manufacturers can purchase rice through weekly e-auctions and the purchases are subject to ethanol allocation by oil manufacturing companies.FCI has been conducting e-auctions for rice sales to private traders since last July to manage the surplus inventory. The current stock of rice with FCI is more than 540 lakh tonnes, which is over three times more than the required buffer stock. The agency had been staring at the problem of storing fresh crop just ahead of the upcoming harvest season.This move signals a shift in the government’s stance on using foodgrains for biofuel production as it balances food security concerns with the need to manage excess stocks.So far as the decision with regard to sugar mills are concerned, the ministry, in a notification, said, “Sugar mills and distilleries are allowed to produce ethanol from sugarcane juice/sugar syrup, B-Heavy molasses as well as C-Heavy molasses during ESY 2024-25 as per the agreement with OMCs.”The food department in coordination with the petroleum ministry will periodically review the diversion of sugar to ethanol production vis-a-vis the production of sugar in the country, so that year-round sugar availability for domestic consumption is maintained, the notification said.The government has set a target of 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025. The sugar mills body, Indian Sugar and Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association, has welcomed the decision. Its director general Deepak Ballani said this is a significant relief for the industry.",Government lifts a 13-month ban on sale of rice to grain-based ethanol distilleries. Food Corporation of India will be able to purchase up to 23 lakh tonnes of the foodgrain through e-auction till October.

Three such August cyclones (1944, 1964, 1976) were developed where a weather system had its genesis over land before it finally transformed into a cyclonic storm after reaching the sea. The latest one had its genesis over BoB. It criss-crossed the entire landmass.The cyclone - called 'Asna' if formed - is, however, not expected to affect Indian coasts as it's moving towards the Arabian sea, away from the land. The name 'Asna' is given by Pakistan in the list of names of tropical cyclones as per standard protocol. The cyclones around South Asia are usually formed during the pre-Monsoon (March-May) or the post-Monsoon (October-December) period.""Development of cyclonic storms in the month of August over the Arabian Sea is a rare activity,"" said the IMD, noting that there have been, however, a total of 28 such systems in the month of August over the BoB during last 132 yearsIMD records show that the cyclone in 1976 developed over Odisha, moved west-northwestwards, emerged into Arabian Sea, made a looping track and weakened over northwest Arabian Sea near Oman coast. In 1944, the cyclone also intensified after emerging into the Arabian Sea. Another short cyclone developed near the South Gujarat coast and weakened near the coast in 1964.Referring to the current system, the IMD said a 'low pressure' area was formed over northwest BoB and adjoining areas of West Bengal & Bangladesh in the morning of August 16.""It moved across Bangladesh, West Bengal & Jharkhand and lay as a well marked low pressure area over southeast Uttar Pradesh & adjoining northeast Madhya Pradesh in the morning of August 24. Moving further westwards, it concentrated into a depression over northwest MP and neighbourhood in the morning of August 25. It intensified into a deep depression in the morning August 26 over East Rajasthan & neighbourhood. It moved nearly westwards across Gujarat region and lay over Saurashtra & Kachchh on August 29,"" said the Met department, explaining its full track.It noted that the system, once intensified into a cyclonic storm on August 30, would continue to move nearly west-southwestwards over northeast Arabian Sea away from the Indian coast during subsequent two days.Meanwhile, another system of 'low pressure' area was formed over central and adjoining north BoB on Thursday. ""It is likely to move west-northwestwards and become more marked over west-central and adjoining northwest BoB by August 30.

"In big step towards nuke triad, India set to commission 2nd nuclear-sub today",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-big-step-towards-nuke-triad-india-set-to-commission-2nd-n-sub-today/articleshow/112879589.cms,"Top Picks For You US govt approves sale of anti-submarine warfare sonobuoys to India for `hunter-killer’ helicopters

NEW DELHI: India will finally commission its second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles as INS Arighat on Thursday, in a major step towards further strengthening its strategic deterrence capabilities.The commissioning of the almost 112-metre-long submarine, armed with K-15 missiles that have a strike range of 750-km, will take place at the secretive ship-building centre in Visakhapatnam in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh and top national security and military officials.TOI was the first to report on Aug 11 that INS Arighat’s commissioning was now imminent after the 6,000-tonne boat became “fully ready” following protracted extensive trials and technological upgrades.INS Arighat will now join her forerunner INS Arihant , which became fully operational in 2018, to strengthen the country's ' nuclear triad ’ or the capability to fire nukes from the land, air and sea.“While INS Arighat is of the same size, length and displacement as INS Arihant, she can carry more K-15 missiles. The new boat is much more capable, efficient and stealthy,” a source said.Both INS Arihant and INS Arighat are powered by 83 MW pressurized light-water reactors at their core. The miniature nuclear reactors fitted in their hulls ensure they can stay submerged for months on end, unlike conventional diesel-electric submarines that must surface or “snorkel” every couple of days to get oxygen to recharge their batteries.The real punch in India’s deterrence capabilities will come when the third SSBN (naval parlance for nuclear-propelled submarines with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles), a slightly larger 7,000-tonne vessel, is commissioned next year. To be called INS Aridhaman, she will carry K-4 missiles that can hit targets 3,500-km away.A fourth SSBN is also being constructed under the classified Rs 90,000 crore advanced technology vessel (ATV) project to bolster the country’s weak sea-based leg of the nuclear triad. The other two legs, the land-based Agni ballistic missiles and fighter jets like Sukhoi-30MKIs, Mirage-2000s and Rafales that can drop nuclear gravity bombs, are much more robust.Given India’s declared “no-first use” nuclear doctrine, SSBNs are crucial for deterrence because they are difficult to detect and can escape a surprise first strike by an enemy to launch retaliatory strikes.India, of course, still has a long way to go. Countries like the US, Russia and China have much larger SSBNs armed with longer range missiles. China, for instance, has six Jin-class SSBNs, with 10,000-km range JL-3 missiles, apart from six nuclear-powered attack submarines (called SSNs, meant conventional warfare). The US, in turn, has 14 Ohio-class SSBNs and 53 SSNs.TOI had also reported earlier this month that the around Rs 40,000 crore project to indigenously construct two 6,000-tonne `hunter-killer’ SSNs, armed with torpedoes, anti-ship and land-attack missiles, is now before the PM-led Cabinet Committee on Security for the final nod after repeated iterations and inter-ministerial consultations. It will take at least a decade to construct them."," INS Arighat is India's second nuclear-powered submarine with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.

Neutron Rocket: Is Elon Musk’s SpaceX reign over? Rocket Lab’s Neutron set to rival Falcon 9 in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-elon-musks-spacex-reign-over-rocket-labs-neutron-set-to-rival-falcon-9-in-2025/articleshow/112850570.cms,"Peter Beck’s vision for Neutron

The growing rivalry in the space industry

As Elon Musk ’s SpaceX maintains its stronghold in the space industry, a new challenger is on the horizon. Peter Beck , CEO of Rocket Lab USA, Inc., is preparing to launch the Neutron rocket in mid-2025, a development that could disrupt the current market dynamics. Designed to directly compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9 , the Neutron rocket aims to offer partially reusable cargo transportation into orbit at a lower cost, presenting a competitive alternative in an industry where SpaceX has dominated for years, according to Business Insider.Peter Beck shared his strategic vision for the Neutron rocket, emphasizing its dual importance. He was quoted by Business Insider as saying, “Neutron is really important for two reasons. One, we need to bring some balance to the market with the Falcon 9, but we also need a vehicle of our own to launch our own satellites and put our own stuff in orbit,” Beck stated. He believes that offering an alternative to Falcon 9 is crucial, particularly for businesses developing competitors to SpaceX’s satellite internet service, Starlink.Beck’s path to becoming a formidable rival to Musk is unconventional. Without a college education and a background that includes working at a dishwasher manufacturer, Beck has transformed Rocket Lab into one of the top space companies globally, second only to SpaceX in commercial rocket launches. The recent celebration of the 50th launch of Rocket Lab’s Electron rocket marks a significant milestone, with the upcoming Neutron launch expected to propel the company’s capabilities even further.As Beck prepares for Neutron’s launch, Elon Musk’s SpaceX continues to push forward, with plans to ramp up its operations by executing missions every two days in 2025. Musk’s ambitions extend far beyond Earth’s orbit, as he remains focused on colonizing Mars using SpaceX’s Starship rocket.In the face of growing competition, Musk recently dismissed the idea that traditional aircraft companies like Boeing could dominate the space industry. He likened it to how car manufacturers cannot dominate the aircraft business, emphasizing SpaceX's unique position.His comments followed NASA's decision to return astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore from space via a SpaceX vehicle, despite their launch on Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft. Technical issues during docking delayed their return, leading NASA to opt for a SpaceX vehicle for their safe return in February.With the Neutron rocket on the horizon, Rocket Lab’s challenge to SpaceX’s market dominance is becoming increasingly apparent. As the space industry evolves, Beck’s Rocket Lab is poised to offer a competitive alternative, providing businesses with more choices for satellite deployment and other space missions. The rivalry between Rocket Lab and SpaceX is set to intensify, marking a new chapter in the race for space exploration.","Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck is preparing to launch the Neutron rocket in mid-2025.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab govt has claimed before the Punjab and Haryana high court that Amritpal Singh , radical Sikh preacher and Khadoor Sahib MP, was ""involved in anti-state activities and had ties with foreign agencies "".In its response to a petition filed by Amritpal Singh challenging the fresh orders regarding his detention under National Security Act ( NSA ) , the state through SSP Amritsar (Rural) Charanjit Singh on Wednesday claimed that ""Amritpal used to brainwash youngsters"" in the guise of de-addicton centresand ""set up the so-called Anandpur Khalsa Force"".""The intelligence inputs showing the anti-state activities and involvement of Amritpal with the foreign agencies is a threat to the security of the state and public order, especially in view of the territorial jurisdiction of Punjab...,"" the SSP has submitted in his reply.The HC was requested to go through the contents of the secret reports stating that the same being sensitive/confidential, cannot be made public.The HC was informed that the ideology of Amritpal, his associates as well as ""Waris Punjab De"" had affected the public order and security of the state. It was also argued by the state that the decision on detaining the petitioner at Dibrugarh Assam , which is almost 2,600 km away, was based on sensitivity of the case.Responding to Amritpal’s plea, the court was informed that the present detention of Amritpal is a fresh one and his previous term had already expired after 12 months and was not been challenged by him till date.The state also denied that Amritpal has been punished for being vocal, claiming that he was deeply involved in the activities which were prejudicial to the security of the state and public order, and which he had continued even in detention.On the plea taken by Amritpal that he had taken oath of Constitution, the SSP has stated that taking the oath as MP cannot justify the actions of the petitioner against the security of the state and public order.According to the Punjab govt, Amritpal started travelling to India during the farm stir. Thereafter, he started veering towards radical views and ultimately got involved in the outfit, 'Waris Punjab De'. He became active in spreading his ideology, especially among the youth.",Amritpal Singh is a radical Sikh preacher and Khadoor Sahib MP.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
