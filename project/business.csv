"Moral policing not court’s job, says SC, sets aside HC cost for tweets",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/moral-policing-not-courts-job-says-sc-sets-aside-hc-cost-for-tweets/articleshow/120108479.cms,"NEW DELHI: Observing that it is not the court's function to do moral policing, Supreme Court on Tuesday set aside a Punjab and Haryana high court order directing musician Vishal Dadlani and politician Tehseen Poonawalla to pay the cost of Rs 10 lakh for their tweets mocking a Jain monk.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan asked how the high court could impose cost on the duo for their social media comments after holding that no criminal offence was made out by their posts. The HC had in 2019 quashed the FIR registered against them by holding that no offence under Sections 153A, 295A, 509 of the IPC was made out from the complaint but said that it would be appropriate to impose the costs of Rs 10 lakh each so that in future they may not mock a religious sect head just to gain publicity on social media.Quashing HC's order, the SC bench said, ""We are of the view that after finding that absolutely no offence was made out when exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC, high court ought not to have exercised advisory jurisdiction by telling the appellant that the contribution made by the priest was much more than what the appellant and the other accused have contributed. Function of the court is not to do moral policing"".""Perusal of the impugned judgment shows that the high court upheld the fundamental right of the appellant of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. After holding that no offence was made out against the appellant there was no question of imposing cost on the appellant and other petitioner,"" it said.","A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan asked how the high court could impose cost on the duo for their social media comments.

"Extradition: Delhi, Mumbai jails being readied for 26/11 mastermind Tahawwur Rana",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/extradition-delhi-mumbai-jails-being-readied-for-26/11-mastermind-tahawwur-rana/articleshow/120105633.cms,"NEW DELHI: With 26/11 mastermind Tahawwur Rana slated to land in India on Wednesday, two jails, one in Delhi and another in Mumbai, were asked to covertly make special arrangements in line with US judiciary recommendations about extradited subjects. He is initially likely to be in custody of NIA for the first few weeks. The exercise was supervised by national security adviser A K Doval, along with officials from the home ministry.Rana, a Pakistani-Canadian and active member of LeT, had arranged passports for fellow jihadi, Pakistani-American David Coleman Headley , aka Dawood Gilani, to travel to India to select targets for the terror attack that was being hatched by Lashkar in collaboration with ISI, Pakistan's spy agency. Rana gloated over the deaths in Mumbai on Nov 26, 2008 and said that the jihadis responsible for it should be given Pakistan's highest posthumous military honours.So far only Ajmal Kasab, the sole LeT terrorist involved in 26/11 rampage who was nabbed alive, had been prosecuted.In Feb, US President Donald Trump had confirmed Rana's extradition to India saying he was pleased to announce that Rana is ""going back to India to face justice"".The extradition was the result of sustained efforts by the Modi govt since 2019. That year in Dec, India had submitted a diplomatic note to the US to extradite Rana. On June 10, 2020, India filed a complaint seeking the provisional arrest of Rana to pave the way for his extradition.A confidant of ISI's Major Iqbal who conceptualised the Mumbai attacks, Rana and David Coleman Headley had established the groundwork for the Mumbai attacks, according to documents submitted in US court by both countries.Rana had personally arrived in Mumbai via Dubai before the attacks to ensure arrangements were precisely executed, say investigators. ""He had checked into hotel Renaissance in Powai during his visit to India between Nov 11 and Nov 21 in 2008. The attacks occurred five days after he departed,"" states a police document.According to a justice department document, Rana and Headley were apprehended in 2009 by FBI whilst plotting an assault against a Danish newspaper as well as providing material support, from 2005 to 2009, to Lashkar.Headley had testified in a US court that in the early summer of 2006, he and two Lashkar members discussed establishing an immigration office in Mumbai as a facade for his surveillance activities. Headley had travelled to Chicago and informed Rana, his longstanding friend since their schooldays in Pakistan, of his assignment to scout potential targets in India.Such was their understanding that in the late summer of 2009, Rana and Headley agreed that funds that had been provided to Rana could be used to fund Headley's work in Denmark, and the evidence showed that Rana pretended to be Headley in sending an email to the Danish newspaper.For Mumbai attacks, Headley obtained approval from Rana, who owned First World Immigration Services in Chicago and elsewhere, to establish a First World office in Mumbai as a cover for his activities. Headley had travelled to India five times between 2007 and 2008 and conducted reconnaissance for the Mumbai attacks - using a five-year visa that Rana had assisted him in obtaining.""Rana directed an individual associated with First World to prepare documents supporting Headley's cover story, and advised Headley how to obtain a visa for travel to India,"" states the justice department document. Mumbai Police had also discovered email communications between Headley and Rana discussing Major Iqbal.","26/11 mastermind Tahawwur Rana slated to land in India on Wednesday.

Waqf Act amended to neutralise changes made by Congress for 'appeasement': PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/waqf-act-amended-to-neutralise-changes-made-by-congress-for-appeasement-pm-modi/articleshow/120107903.cms,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi

Pasmanda Muslims

, everyone else will benefit from Waqf Act: Modi

NEW DELHI: PM Modi Tuesday aggressively defended the amendments to the Waqf Act, asserting these were necessary to neutralise the changes made by the Congress-led UPA as part of "" politics of appeasement "", which primarily served the interests of fundamentalists and land grabbers, and had also led to India's Partition.""The 2013 changes placed the interests of... land mafia above the Constitution and effectively shut out avenues for justice for their victims,"" the PM said as he referred to the appropriation of plots belonging to govt, churches, temples, gurdwaras and farmers by declaring them waqf property. The new law, which came into force on Tuesday, aims at rectifying these issues, he said.The PM made these remarks at the ""Rising Bharat Summit"" organised by News-18 Group.The PM's comments came on a day govt filed a caveat in the challenges filed by Islamic clerics and others, and a day after SC announced it would soon set a date for hearings.Commending Parliament for passing the legislation to protect common Muslims, Modi said, ""At the core of the controversy surrounding the Waqf Act is the politics of appeasement; its seeds were sown before independence. Other political parties empowered radical elements through waqf protests and also encouraged land mafias. Pasmanda Muslims and everyone else will benefit from this law.""""Many colonies gained independence but did anyone have to pay the price of dismemberment for freedom?"" he asked. The PM said, ""Very few countries got their independence through partition. But it happened to India because politics was kept above national interest.""In a reference to the widespread allegation about the misuse of the waqf law, especially because of the provision in the 2013 law that the designation of a property as waqf asset could not be challenged in a civil court, the PM said, ""The law was meant to be an instrument of justice but it became a source of fear instead and gave rise to a false sense that it was above the Constitution.""Asserting the amended Act is ""in the interest of society and the Muslim community"", he highlighted the democratic process behind the legislation, noting that Parliament passed it after a debate lasting over 16 hours - the second-longest debate in its history.In additional, he said, ""Over 1 crore people shared their views with the joint parliamentary committee (on the waqf bill)"", which had sought public opinions online. ""Democracy is no longer contained within the four walls of Parliament; it is strengthened with the participation of the people.""Modi said politics of appeasement was at the root of the debate over the issue of waqf and it brought Congress to power and some Muslim fundamentalists became rich. ""But, the moot question is what benefits did the ordinary Muslims get? What did the poor Pasmanda Muslims get? They were only subjected to neglect. They did not get education, they faced unemployment and Muslim women faced injustice like Shah Bano, where their constitutional rights were sacrificed at the altar of fundamentalism,"" Modi said.The PM said a similar attitude led to the country's Partition in 1947, when Congress leaders did not wipe out the idea of a separate nation that was nursed by ""some fundamentalists"" and not ordinary Muslims, and Congress succumbed to their pressure for ""lust of power"".","PM Narendra Modi aggressively defended the amendments to the Waqf Act.

SC sets timeline for state governors to decide on bills sent to them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-sets-timeline-for-state-governors-to-decide-on-bills-sent-to-them/articleshow/120107361.cms,"Constitution doesn’t let guvs exercise absolute veto: SC

NEW DELHI: Frowning upon the Tamil Nadu governor for acting in violation of constitutional provisions by sitting on bills forwarded to him after being passed by the state assembly, Supreme Court, in an extraordinary and first-of-its-kind decision, held that 10 bills reserved by the governor be deemed to have been assented by him, and fixed a timeline for Raj Bhavans to decide on giving or denying nod to bills passed by state legislatures in a time-bound manner in order to prevent what happened in Tamil Nadu.As the Constitution restricts itself to saying that the governor has to act ""as soon as possible"" but does not prescribe any timeline, a governor can delay the decision on assent, a prerequisite for a legislation to become law, for months. The court said if assent was to be given, then it has to be done within a month. The court set a timeframe of three months in case a bill is sent to the assembly for reconsideration or to the President. In case a bill is re-sent after reconsideration by the assembly, the governor must grant assent in a month. The court also said any breach of the timeline could be challenged in court. In Tamil Nadu's case, one bill has been pending for over five years.While saying that the Tamil Nadu governor had acted in violation of constitutional provisions by sitting on bills, a Supreme Court bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan on Tuesday said he had shown “scant respect” to various verdicts of the apex court and did not act with bona fides while referring the bills to the President after it was re-sent by the state assembly after reconsideration. It held that governor has no option but to give assent once the bill has been sent back to him after reconsideration by the assembly. The Constitution does not allow him to exercise “absolute veto” or “pocket veto” by indefinitely delaying decision on bills, the bench said.Reading out the operative part of the verdict, Justice Pardiwala, who penned the judgment, said as per Article 200 of the Constitution, governor has only three options when a bill is placed before him — grant assent, withhold it and send it back for reconsideration, or reserve it for the President. It said a bill could be reserved for the President only at the first instance and not when it was sent after reconsideration by the assembly.“As a general rule, it is not open for the governor to reserve a bill for the President after the bill has been re-presented by the govt after being passed again by the assembly. The only exception is when the bill presented in the second round is different from the first version,” Justice Pardiwala said.On Tamil Nadu governor’s contention that he could withhold assent to bills without sending them back to the assembly for reconsideration, the court said such an option was not available under the Constitution.“Withholding of assent or reservation of bills for the consideration of the President, after their due reconsideration by the state legislature, being in contravention of the procedure prescribed under Article 200, is declared erroneous in law and thus hereby set aside. As a result of the above finding, any consequential steps that might have been taken by the President on these 10 bills is set aside,” the bench said.“Having regard to the unduly long period of time for which these bills were kept pending by governor, before the ultimate declaration of withholding of assent, and in view of the scant respect shown by the governor to the decision of this court in ‘State of Punjab’ (case), and for other extraneous considerations that appear to be writ large in discharge of his functions, we are left with no choice but to exercise our inherent powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to declare these 10 bills to have been deemed to have got assented,” it said.","Supreme Court sets timeline for Raj Bhavans to decide on giving or denying nod to bills passed by state legislatures. The court set a timeframe of three months in case a bill is sent to the assembly for reconsideration or to the President.

NEW DELHI: London high court on Tuesday rejected Indian government's application to appeal in the UK Supreme Court against the discharge of Sanjay Bhandari , a defence consultant wanted on charges of tax evasion and money laundering. The judgement also said that Bhandari, in Tihar jail , would be at risk ""of extortion and violence"" from ""other prisoners and prison officials""""In our judgment, having regard to all the evidence and information provided on this ground, including the fresh evidence, we conclude that in Tihar prison, the appellant (Bhandari) would be at real risk of extortion, accompanied by threatened or actual violence, from other prisoners and/or prison officials,"" their judgment said.The application, part of a two-step process to escalate the case to the UK Supreme Court, was the government's first move—but with this stage denied, officials have yet to confirm whether they will seek direct permission from the Supreme Court.""The court received an application from the government of India seeking certification of points of law of general importance and grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court,"" justice Timothy Holroyde said.""Having considered the written submissions, the court is satisfied that no oral hearing is necessary, and no further submissions required. The two points on which leave to appeal was sought is refused. The reasons being that neither of the points of law of general importance were involved in the court's decision,"" he added.The court granted Bhandari's appeal against extradition on human rights grounds, ruling that sending him to India would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) due to concerns over the conditions of his proposed custody in Tihar Jail. Additionally, the court upheld a second ground under Article 6 of the ECHR, citing concerns about the burden and standard of proof in Indian criminal trials, which could undermine his right to a fair trial.Bhandari was ordered to be discharged in February after a ruling by Westminster Magistrates' Court in November 2022, which led to the withdrawal of then UK home secretary Suella Braverman’s extradition order.He faced two separate extradition requests from India—one certified in June 2020 for alleged money laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, and another in June 2021 for allegedly attempting to evade tax under the Black Money Act, 2015.","London high court on Tuesday rejected Indian government's application to appeal in the UK Supreme Court against the discharge of Sanjay Bhandari.

"'Shadow cabinet, Seva Dal': Sanjay Jha's 5-point prescription for revival of Congress",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shadow-cabinet-seva-dal-sanjay-jhas-5-point-prescription-for-revival-of-congress/articleshow/120099394.cms,"Rahul Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge and Sonia Gandhi at CWC meet in Ahmedabad.

Five recommendations for the Congress to reform itself:

1. Announce a shadow cabinet

2. Decentralise Congress

3. Create a model state of development and governance

4. Make Seva Dal strong

5. Make the CWC relevant

NEW DELHI: The Congress Working Committee is meeting in Ahmedabad to chalk out party's roadmap for upcoming assembly polls and decide on slew of measures for the much-needed organisational reforms. The grand old party, which themed its Ahmedabad session as ""Nyaypath: Sankalp, Samarpan aur Sangharsh"", on Tuesday asserted it's claim to Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel's legacy with Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accusing the BJP and RSS of trying to usurp it under a ""well-planned conspiracy"" against the national heroes.But will that be enough to counter the BJP?The Congress has seen a steady decline in its political fortunes since 2014. After a decade of disappointments, the 2024 Lok Sabha elections offered a glimmer of hope as the party nearly doubled its tally in the Lower House. However, the cheer was short-lived as the Congress put up a dismal show in several assembly elections in a row - Haryana, Maharashtra and DelhiSo, what does the Congress need to do to change its political fortunes and prevent this slide. Former party leader Sanjay Jha, who writes ""Congressi by DNA"" in his X bio, has a prescription for the revival of the grand old party. In an exclusive interaction with TOI.com, Sanjay Jha shares a 5-point action plan to rejuvenate the Congress.The Congress must announce a shadow cabinet - just like the leader of the opposition is supposed to be a shadow Prime Minister. The shadow cabinet should name people for at least key portfolios like home, defence, foreign policy, agriculture, industry, finance, HRD etc. If that is done, it will give a massive advantage because people will be able to compare the incumbent govt with what could be the potential cabinet of the opposition govt.More importantly, they can always take on the media and the public can ask questions to the shadow cabinet on policy issues like tariffs and foreign policy. These are the things Congress needs to seize the initiative.Congress is too strongly focused on Delhi-centric president model. This is a big country. It is not easy to run with one president supported by general secretaries of each and every state or a few states. Instead, there should be five vice-presidents for different regions - North, East, West, South and a separate one for North East because it is a very complex area and needs separate attention.These VPs will report directly to the president and the general secretaries within these of diferent states can report to the vice president. This is how Congress will become a lot more focused, it will have a lot more empowerment within the leaders running the party across the country and will open opportunities for people like Sachin Pilot, DK Shivkumar, Shashi Tharoor, Randeep Sujrewala and Manish Tewari who are just not leveraged at all at present.The Congress party needs to create a model state of governance and development - perhaps any one where they are in govt at present like Karnataka, Telangana or Himachal. The party can create a model to tell the people that this is how we run a state.Create a parameter on investment, law and order, job creation, no corruption - basically how it is very citizen friendly and how it has been able to make the youth more successful with startups, ability to extract funds, law order, development and transparency.They create a model state that they can take it across the country to say 'give us a chance and we can make the entire country similar to this.' This is what BJP did with Gujarat, even though it was a fake model, it impressed people and that brought them to power in 2014.The Congress has neglected this very, very crucial organisation that it has. The party should actually put good talent, make a young man the head of it and make sure that the Seva Dal becomes what the RSS is to the BJP.Its ability to work in crisis situations, pan out across communities in India, reach farmers, do household campaigning and actually do social work and not just political, work in areas that require more support. Become a bridge like a political NGO that works between the common people of India, the communities and the political parties that represent them in the parliament.The Congress Working Committee has got too many people in it, it has too many invited members especially guests. It has really become a place where you give people reason to feel promoted or happy and basically used to distribute goodies here and there.The CWC has to be a criticial-thinking organisation that should take all the big calls about alliances, big policy issues and should not be left to a handful of people to make big calls. That is the only way to stop a caucus or coterie to emerge.All the big decisions of the Congress should be left with the CWC where it should be a body of not more than 22 or 24 people. Meeting should not be held for over 25 people.Reduce the bureaucracy, don't make it too unwieldy to manage. These 24-25 people should be having decision-making ability to even tell the president that they don't agree with you. And if the majority of CWC does not agree with the decision, the president should not enforce it.This is how transparency will be built. CWC needs overall restructure - it needs new faces and needs a completely dynamic team of people - some elected, some bright and intellectual and some not even elected but having a core ideology but more importantly, CWC should become the crucial body to run the entire party.","The Congress has seen a steady decline in its political fortunes since 2014.

If the governor agrees with the Bill, a decision must be made within one month.

If the governor wants to return the Bill for reconsideration, it must be done within three months.

If the Bill is to be sent to the President, that must also happen within three months.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday criticised Tamil Nadu governor RN Ravi, saying that a governor cannot withhold assent to Bills passed by the state assembly or use an absolute veto or pocket veto.The court said the governor acted against the law by not approving 10 Bills that were passed again by the assembly after being returned earlier. The court declared these Bills as passed.""Governor must give assent to a bill when a bill is presented to him after re consultation in state assembly and he can only refuse assent when the bill is different. Action of governor to reserve the 10 bills for the president is illegal and arbitrary, and thus the action is set aside. All actions taken by governor thereto for the 10 bills are set aside. The 10 bills shall be deemed to be clear from the date it was re presented to the governor,"" the Court said.A bench of Justices JB Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said the governor did not act in good faith. They pointed out that the Bills were kept pending by the governor for a long time and then sent to the President shortly after the Supreme Court's judgment in the Punjab governor’s case, which had made it clear that governors cannot withhold assent by simply not taking any action on Bills.The apex court was delivering judgment on petition filed by the Tamil Nadu government against governor RN Ravi's refusal to grant assent to several bills passed by the state legislative assembly, including those concerning the appointment of vice chancellors to state universities.The judgment written by Justice Pardiwala said that the Constitution does not allow for an ""absolute veto"" or ""pocket veto."" According to Article 200 of the Constitution, the governor has three options when a bill is presented—grant assent, withhold assent, or reserve the bill for the President. The Court clarified that a bill can be reserved for the President only the first time it is presented.""Neither pocket veto or absolute veto is there in the constitutional scheme behind article 200.. this article 200 uses ""shall declare"" so that there is no scope of inaction and the governor has to adopt one of three courses available to him. Governor cannot sit on bills and excercise pocket veto over them,"" the SC said.The Supreme Court said the governor’s action of not giving assent to 10 Bills — with some pending since January 2020 — and then sending them to the President after they were passed again by the State Legislature was ""illegal and erroneous"" and should be set aside. Any step taken by the governor after that was also set aside.In its order, the court also fixed time limits for governors to act on Bills:The court said that if a governor does not follow this timeline, their decision can be challenged in court.The court said a governor should follow the Constitution and respect the decision of the state assembly, not act based on political reasons.Quoting B R Ambedkar, the court said, “However good a constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it happen to be a bad lot. However bad a constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it happen to be a good lot.”Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin welcomed the Supreme Court's verdict, hailing it as 'historic'.""The Constitution mandates Governor to approve the bills once adopted for the second time but he didn't...he was also delaying..."" Stalin said, adding that the state government moved the SC against this.The SC accepted the state government's just arguments and ruled ""it has to be considered as the Governor having given his assent and gave the historic verdict,"" Stalin said.","The Supreme Court said the governor acted against the law by not approving 10 Bills that were passed again by the assembly after being returned earlier.

Can’t attach criminality to state cabinet decision: SC on WB teacher posts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-attach-criminality-to-state-cabinet-decision-sc-on-wb-teacher-posts/articleshow/120107851.cms,"SC: HC not justified in asking CBI to probe cabinet note preparation

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday quashed the CBI probe ordered by Calcutta high court against those responsible for preparation of a note based on which the West Bengal cabinet had allowed creation of supernumerary posts for appointment of teachers in May 2022 and said attaching criminality to cabinet decisions would be devastating for the country's federal structure.""How can one attach criminality to a cabinet decision when no appointment has been made pursuant to the decision?"" asked a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar.The CJI said, ""How can a central investigating agency investigate a cabinet decision of a state? Will it not defeat the entire purpose behind federalism? There are clear provisions under Articles 74(2) and 163(3) which bar inquiry into any cabinet decision.""The same bench on April 3 had quashed the recruitment of over 25,000 teachers and teaching staff to govt and aided schools, calling it ""tainted beyond repair"".It said the cabinet note clearly mentioned that certain appointments were made illegally by the WB Schools Services Commission, and it was clarified that the decision to create supernumerary posts for appointment of teachers was subject to the outcome of the litigation challenging the recruitment process, which was pending before the HC.On May 19, 2022, based on the cabinet decision, and after approval from the governor, the state had issued a direction for creation of supernumerary posts. This was not challenged before the HC nor was a prayer made seeking probe by the police or CBI into the creation of supernumerary posts, the bench said.""The May 5, 2022, note records that the power under Section 19 of the WB School Services Act, 1997, is being issued in respect of waitlisted candidates, but the same shall be subject to the outcome of the pending litigation before Calcutta HC.The cabinet decision was taken at a time, which was accepted (by the governor), when there was pending litigation in the HC regarding the possibility of finding tainted candidates,"" it said. The May 5 note mentioned the view expressed by WBSSC that there were wrongly appointed candidates because of various irregularities and nothing was hidden, it said. HC was not justified in directing CBI probe into the preparation of the cabinet note, the bench said and referred to Art 74(2) and 163(3), which specifically bar courts from inquiring into cabinet decisions advising the President/governor.Senior advocates Maninder Singh, Bikas Ranjan Bhattacharyya and Rauf Rahim attempted to show, from the application filed by the state before Calcutta HC stating that supernumerary posts were created with the sole purpose of accommodating candidates who did not figure in either the merit or wait list. The bench said this argument was wrong as the cabinet note did not say this at all. It mentioned that the supernumerary posts would be subject to the outcome of litigation pending before the HC.Singh said the decision was a colourable exercise of power and hence would not be protected by provisions of Art 74(2) and 163(3).

Private firms can specify court for staff dispute in appointment letters: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/private-firms-can-specify-court-for-staff-dispute-in-appointment-letters-sc/articleshow/120107631.cms,"New Delhi: In an important ruling for the private sector, Supreme Court Tuesday said private employers can validly include a clause in appointment letters restricting employees to a court in a particular city/town for raising any legal dispute relating to employment, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra.Differentiating between govt and private employees, a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan said appointments in private companies were essentially contracts involving offer and acceptance and once a person accepted the contract along with the conditions, he/she could not challenge its validity.The question arose in case of two employees - one in HDFC Bank appointed in Patna and the other in Lord Krishna Bank in Delhi. The appointment letters issued by both banks had specified that any dispute between the parties leading to legal action must be resolved before a competent court in Mumbai.When they were terminated in 2016 and 2017 respectively, they challenged their terminations before courts in Patna and Delhi. HCs concerned gave rulings holding that the employees could challenge their terminations before the court where they were posted prior to severance of service.Writing the judgment, Justice Datta said, ""...The right to legal adjudication cannot be taken away from any party through contract but can be relegated to a set of courts for the ease of the parties. In the present dispute, the clause does not take away the right of the employee to pursue a legal claim but only restricts the employee to pursue those claims before the courts in Mumbai alone.""",Supreme Court said private employers can validly include a clause in appointment letters restricting employees to a court in a particular city/town for raising any legal dispute relating to employment.

In the coming years, we are eager to work closely in areas such as defence cooperation, co-production and co-development projects, innovation and technology. Both India and the UAE are committed to work towards peace and prosperity in the region.”The two leaders, who also discussed the current geopolitical developments, expressed “happiness” on the current defence cooperation through institutional mechanisms, military exercises, exchange of training programmes and the like. “They identified training exchanges as one of the key areas of defence cooperation which would enable understanding of each other’s defence ecosystems and accelerate strengthening of bilateral defence ties,” an official said.The two sides decided that close collaboration between their defence industries should be an integral part of the bilateral cooperation and discussed opportunities for enhancing partnerships in defence manufacturing.They welcomed the India-UAE Defence Partnership Forum, which has the potential to result in strategic joint ventures and co-production projects benefiting the two countries. “They also agreed to focus on complementarities in the Make-in-India and Make-in-Emirates initiatives,” the official said.Significantly, apart from bilateral military exercises and initiatives, India and UAE have also teamed up with France to collaborate in a trilateral framework launched in 2022 in several areas including defence, technology, energy and environment, in tune with an ambitious roadmap chalked out by them.In the military arena, the three countries in Dec last year had conducted a major air combat exercise “Desert Knight” over the Arabian Sea to strengthen trilateral defence cooperation and enhance military interoperability amid the ongoing geopolitical churn.The navies of the three countries had also conducted their first-ever maritime partnership exercise to hone their combat skills against traditional as well as non-traditional threats through a wide spectrum of operations on the high seas in June 2023.","The offer for the Akash system, which can intercept hostile aircraft, helicopters, drones and subsonic cruise missiles at a range of 25-km, was made at the delegation-level meeting between defence minister Rajnath Singh and the visiting Dubai crown prince.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday termed the ' Mudra Yojana ' an ""eye-opener"" for any govt, as he interacted with the scheme's beneficiaries - ranging from those who have invested in renewable energy ventures, pet care businesses to opening cafes and restaurants.The interaction at the PM's residence marked 10 years of the scheme that has disbursed over Rs 33 lakh crore through more than 52 crore collateral-free loans - a scale unmatched globally. ""You read in the newspaper that this is a govt of the rich. Even if you add up the total of all the rich, they would not have received Rs 33 lakh crore.

Krishnan said his business continues to bring renewable energy solutions to households and offices while creating job opportunities.Contrasting his govt's approach with previous dispensations, Modi said, ""Most govts launch schemes and forget. We check the results, even 10 years later. Earlier, people needed political letters, collateral or bribes. Now, they walk into banks with just an idea-and walk out with dignity.""While talking to a beneficiary, Modi asked, ""Have you become your own boss now?"" She replied, ""Yes, sir"". ""How much do you earn now? Don't worry, the income tax people won't come after you,"" Modi said in a lighter vein, setting the tone for a candid interaction with Mudra loan beneficiaries, including women who had once struggled to afford basic needs but are now run thriving businesses.For a woman coming to the interaction was a ""big occasion"" - she had taken her first flight. Talking about her pet care venture 'K9 World', she quipped, ""If you're not an animal lover, you can't live in my building"", and shared how her income doubled.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday termed the'Mudra Yojana'an ""eye-opener"" for any govt.

Jeff Bezos purchased a $23 million Kalorama mansion in 2016.

Peter Thiel bought a $13 million beaux-arts residence in 2021.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits.

Faces behind 2013 Dilsukhnagar blasts: The 5 Indian Mujahideen men on death row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/faces-behind-2013-dilsukhnagar-blasts-the-5-indian-mujahideen-men-on-death-row/articleshow/120113544.cms,"(L-R): Zia-ur-Rahman, Asadullah Akhtar, Mohd Tahseen Akhtar, Aijaz Sheikh, Yasin Bhatkal

Profiles of the Convicts

HYDERABAD: The Telangana High Court on Tuesday upheld the death sentence awarded by a National Investigation Agency (NIA) court to five Indian Mujahideen (IM) operatives for the 2013 Dilsukhnagar blasts . The twin blasts, which occurred on February 21, 2013, in the busy Dilsukhnagar area of Hyderabad, claimed 18 lives—including that of an unborn child—and left 133 people injured, some of them permanently disabled.The first explosion occurred at a bus stop, followed by a second blast near a popular eatery, A1 Mirchi Centre, less than a minute later. The NIA took over the investigation in March 2013.On Tuesday, a division bench comprising Justice K Lakshman and Justice P Sree Sudha delivered the judgment in response to a reference made by the special NIA court for confirmation of the death penalty, as well as appeals filed by the five convicts against the sentence.The five men—IM co-founder Mohd Ahmed Sidibapa alias Yasin Bhatkal (from Karnataka), Asadullah Akhtar alias Haddi (Uttar Pradesh), Tahseen Akhtar alias Monu (Bihar), Aijaz Shaikh (Maharashtra), and Pakistani national Zia-ur-Rahman alias Waqas—were sentenced to death on December 13, 2016. The NIA court had found them guilty under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code, the Explosive Substances Act, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).The prime accused and alleged mastermind, Riyaz Bhatkal , remains absconding and was not tried. The trial proceeded against only those five in custody.Challenging the sentence, the convicts argued that the investigation was flawed, citing the absence of eyewitnesses, procedural lapses in the identification parade, and violations of the Evidence Act, UAPA, NIA Act, and CrPC. They also claimed that no dying declarations were recorded.Rejecting these contentions, the High Court noted that the trial court had carefully examined both oral and documentary evidence before delivering its verdict. The bench held that all six accused had acted in concert as part of a criminal conspiracy against the Indian state.The judges concluded there was no possibility of reform or rehabilitation for the convicts and confirmed the trial court’s view that the case fell under the “rarest of the rare” category. “Life imprisonment would be futile as the purpose of reformation is unachievable in this case,” the bench observed, affirming that the death penalty was justified given the gravity of the crime.The court informed the convicts that they may file an appeal before the Supreme Court within 30 days.Yasin Bhatkal | 42Born in 1983 in Karnataka’s Bhatkal district, Yasin co-founded the Indian Mujahideen in 2003 along with Riyaz and Iqbal Bhatkal. He studied up to Class 10 and later moved to Dubai in 2004 to work in a sports equipment store. In 2006, he is believed to have trained with Lashkar-e-Taiba in Karachi. Returning to India in 2007, he married Zahida Irshad Khan from Bihar in 2010 and became actively involved in IM operations.Aijaz Shaikh | 37A native of Ghorpade Peth in Pune, Aijaz held a diploma in computer applications and previously worked at a BPO. He was involved in creating fake ID cards and managing logistics for IM operatives, under Riyaz Bhatkal’s instructions. He was arrested by the Delhi Police in September 2014.Zia-ur-Rahman alias Waqas | 36A Pakistani national, he entered India via Nepal in September 2010 along with co-accused Asadullah Akhtar. A diploma-holder in food technology from Faisalabad, he trained in explosives at LeT and JeM camps. Along with other IM operatives, he planted bombs at Dilsukhnagar. He was arrested in Rajasthan in May 2014.Asadullah Akhtar | 39Hailing from Azamgarh, UP, Asadullah completed his pharmacy degree in 2008. The son of a doctor, he joined IM through another operative linked to the Batla House encounter case. He was associated with several terror attacks including the Chinnaswamy Stadium and Jama Masjid blasts. He was arrested by the NIA at the India-Nepal border in August 2013.Mohd Tahseen Akhtar | 36From Maniyarpur in Bihar, Tahseen was recruited into IM by Yasin Bhatkal. He helped arrange a safe house for the group near Abdullapurmet in Hyderabad and coordinated several activities under a false identity. He was arrested in Rajasthan in March 2014 by the Delhi Police Special Cell.","The Telangana High Court upheld the death sentence awarded by a National Investigation Agency (NIA) court to five Indian Mujahideen (IM) operatives.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

The International Monetary Fund reaches a deal with Argentina on a $20 billion bailout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-international-monetary-fund-reaches-a-deal-with-argentina-on-a-20-billion-bailout/articleshow/120112915.cms,"Javier Milei (AP photo)

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday said it has reached a preliminary agreement with Argentina on a $20 billion bailout, providing a welcome reprieve to President Javier Milei as he seeks to overturn the country's old economic order.As a staff-level agreement, the rescue package still requires final approval from the IMF's executive board, which was expected to meet in the coming days.The fund's long-awaited announcement offered a lifeline to President Milei, who has cut inflation and stabilized Argentina's economy with a free-market austerity agenda. His policies have reversed the reckless borrowing of left-wing populist governments that had brought the country infamy for defaulting on its debts numerous times. Argentina has received more IMF bailouts than any other nation.It came at a critical moment for South America's second-biggest economy. Pressure had been mounting on Argentina's rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves as the government tightened rules on money-printing and spent more of its scarce dollars to prop up the wobbly Argentine peso.Fears grew that if Milei's government failed to secure an IMF loan or tap a major source of foreign currency, its hard-won austerity measures would veer off-track and leave Argentina, once again, unable to service its huge debts or pay its import bills.The fresh cash gives Milei a serious shot at easing Argentina's strict foreign exchange controls, which he says he needs to encourage investment and convince markets that his reforms can be sustained in the notoriously volatile nation.The controls mean that companies can't send profits abroad and ensures the central bank manages the peso, which is pegged to the dollar.With 22 IMF loans handed out since 1958, Argentina owes the IMF more than $40 billion. Most IMF funds are used repay the IMF itself, giving the organization a divisive reputation among Argentines. Many blame the lender for the country's historic economic implosion and debt default in 2001.The IMF, which had been wary of striking yet another deal with its largest debtor, had nonetheless praised Milei's austerity measures - an even harsher version of its own typical prescription - over his first 16 months in office.The former TV personality and self-proclaimed ""anarcho-capitalist"" came to power with the goal of downsizing Argentina's bloated state, ending the country's proclivity for money-printing, opening the economy to international markets and wooing foreign investors after years of isolation.Unlike Argentine politicians in years past who sought to avoid enraging the masses with brutal austerity, Milei has fired tens of thousands of state employees, dissolved ministries, gutted the education sector, cut inflation adjustments for pensions, froze public works projects, lifted price controls and slashed subsidies.Critics note that the poor have paid the highest price for Argentina's macroeconomic stability.But Milei has maintained solid approval ratings, which analysts attribute to his success in driving down inflation. Flipping budget deficits to surpluses has sent Argentina's stock market booming and its country-risk rating, a pivotal barometer of investor confidence, tumbling.""The agreement builds on the authorities' impressive early progress in stabilizing the economy, underpinned by a strong fiscal anchor, that is delivering rapid disinflation and a recovery in activity,"" the IMF said in a statement announcing the agreement on the loan under a 48-month arrangement. ""The program supports the next phase of Argentina's homegrown stabilization and reform agenda.""It remained unclear how much Argentina would receive up-front in the program - a key sticking point in the latest negotiations over the deal. Argentina is seeking a big upfront payment to replenish its reserves, even as IMF loans are usually disbursed over several years.Milei reposted the announcement on social media platform X, with a photo showing him hugging Economy Minister Luis Caputo. ""Vavos!"" he wrote - apparently mispelling ""Vamos"" or ""Let's go!"" in his excitement.",Argentina has received more IMF bailouts than any other nation. Pressure had been mounting on Argentina's rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves as the government tightened rules on money-printing and spent more of its scarce dollars to prop up the wobbly Argentine peso.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120113004,imgsize-19304,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-2025-04-09T084151-146.jpg"

Wall Street's wild ride

Tariffs at the center of economic anxiety

Business leaders hit a wall

Growing warnings from Wall Street

A shift in Trump's approach—or not?

Country by country list of new tariffs announced by Trump

White House defends the policy

Amid mounting criticism over plunging markets and global economic unease, US President Donald Trump has defended his aggressive tariff policy, insisting he ""stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street.""""I’m proud to be the President for the workers, not the outsourcers; the President who stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street; who protects the middle class, not the political class; and who defends America, not trade cheaters all over the globe,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Trump's comments came as US financial markets experienced another day of dramatic swings. The S&P 500, after soaring 4.1 per cent in early trade on Tuesday, quickly lost ground, tumbling to a 3 per cent loss before closing down 1.6 per cent. The index now sits nearly 19 per cent below its February peak.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 320 points lower—down 0.8 per cent—after wiping out an earlier gain of 1,460 points. The Nasdaq Composite slid 2.1 per cent.The extreme volatility echoed across global markets, with indices in Tokyo, Paris, and Shanghai posting morning rallies before analysts warned of further instability. Much of the chaos is tied to investor uncertainty over how far Trump will take his trade war—and for how long.Trump's sweeping tariffs, which are set to intensify, have unsettled investors and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Economists caution that if the trade restrictions linger, they could push the US into recession by raising consumer prices and disrupting global supply chains. A swift de-escalation through negotiations, however, could mitigate the damage.Despite these warnings, Trump has shown no signs of backing down—even as top business leaders and political donors attempt to influence his decisions behind the scenes.In recent days, Wall Street billionaires and corporate CEOs have stepped up efforts to reverse the administration's trade stance, but to little effect. Following Trump's latest tariff announcement, banking executives—including JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon—met with commerce secretary Howard Lutnick in a closed-door session. Sources say Lutnick was unmoved.Elsewhere, GOP megadonors and hedge fund tycoons have tried to sway the White House through calls to senior aides, including chief of staff Susie Wiles and treasury secretary Scott Bessent. These appeals, too, have fallen flat.Some financial heavyweights have now gone public with their frustrations. Billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman took to social media, warning, ""The global economy is being taken down because of bad math,"" and urged the administration to reconsider before ""the President makes a big mistake.""Oil trader Andrew Hall applauded Ackman for speaking out and called on other ""financial titans"" to do the same. ""Where are the other 'financial titans'? Why aren't they speaking up?"" Hall posted.Dimon, in a message to investors, noted that the trade war was already denting consumer sentiment and investor confidence, and could slow economic growth. While he avoided forecasting a full-scale recession, he acknowledged the growing risk.Laurence D Fink, CEO of investment giant BlackRock, was more blunt during an address at the Economic Club of New York.

Vivek Ramaswamy Religion: 'Did you convert': Hindu Vivek Ramaswamy trolled for taking part in Christian prayer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-you-convert-vivek-ramaswamy-trolled-for-taking-part-in-christian-prayer/articleshow/120096870.cms,"Vivek Ramaswamy's faith again came on radar as he posted a photo of taking part in a Christian prayer with pastors in Ohio.

What Vivek Ramaswamy said earlier about his religion



An old controversy caught up with Vivek Ramaswamy as he went to meet the pastors in Ohio as part of his governor election campaign in the state. The former co-chief of the Department of Government Efficiency posted a photo of praying along with the pastors and social media users asked whether he has converted to Christianity.""Who are you praying to, Vivek?"" one asked.""What god we praying to here. I’m confused,"" another wrote.A supporting comment read: ""Vivek is not Christian, he is loyal to his people, he sees America as a piggy bank, nothing more.""""Did you convert?"" one asked.""Wait, now you’re pretending to be a Christian?"" one said.""You’re not Christian. You worship a Hindu deity,"" one comment read.""Every religion has “Praying”, they’re not all praying to the same god. Vivek is not Christian, therefore he’s praying to a false god. Nice to see most people getting it,"" one user wrote.""This may help people understand Hinduism and Hindus better. As an Indian American Hindu like Vivek, I grew up attending Christian schools from kindergarten through high school, just as a lot of Hindus do in India and the US We respect Jesus Christ and celebrated Christmas every year in school. Hinduism does not forbid respect for great figures from other religions, so it's not uncommon for many Hindu families to have a cross or a picture of Jesus Christ displayed respectfully alongside other deities in a prayer area,"" one wrote.This is not the first time that Vivek is facing questions over his faith. He said he is a Hindu and the core of his gfath is that God resides in each of us. “May faith is what gives me my freedom. My faith is what led me to this presidential campaign...I am a Hindu. I believe there is one true God. I believe god put each of us here for a purpose. My faith teaches us that we have a duty, a moral duty to realise that purpose. Those are God's instruments that work through us in different ways, but we are still equal because God resides in each of us.

Optimism laced with caution appears to be the prevailing sentiment across Bangladeshi news media following the landmark meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh , Muhammad Yunus. This comes at a time when there is no-real consensus about what exactly transpired in the meeting. The account provided by Yunus’s press secretary, Shafiqul Alam—particularly regarding Sheikh Hasina—has been contested by Indian sources.Significantly, this was the first summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government. Tensions had escalated in recent months between the neighbours who are bounded by deep historical ties. Most prominent news outlets in Bangladesh described the meeting, held on the sidelines of Bimstec in Bangkok, as a much-needed ice-breaker.went a step further, declaring it a diplomatic victory for Bangladesh. The paper emphasized that for eight months India had avoided high-level interactions with Dhaka and insisted that any talks must exclude discussions on Hasina. Therefore, the fact that a 40-minute meeting occurred in a third country was, in their view, a breakthrough. Another daily,said that getting this meeting done only adds to the aura of Nobel winning economist Muhammad Yunus.The 'sources' in India particularly took exception to remarks made by Yunus' press secretary Alam in a Facebook post, describing the claims made about the Bangkok meeting as 'mischievous' and 'politically motivated'. Alam alleged that Yunus requested Hasina’s extradition and that Modi’s response was 'not negative'. He even claimed Modi said, 'Regardless of what was actually said, the idea that Yunus directly brought up Hasina’s extradition dominated headlines on Saturday and became a recurring theme in Sunday’s editorials. It earned Yunus praise across media outlets of various ideological stripes. However, a caveat was frequently added: Hasina remains a potential stumbling block in the normalization of Indo-Bangla relations.featured a detailed front-page story quoting various foreign policy voices. The article began with the assertion that no real improvement in ties was possible without Hasina’s extradition. Former Dhaka University professor Shahiduzzaman warned of a long-drawn process, predicting that India would not hand over Hasina, while Bangladesh would refuse to honor what he called 'biased treaties' signed by her. He advocated exploring new trade relationships, including with Pakistan.In contrast, former envoy Mashfee Shams struck a more measured tone, expressing hope that relations could move beyond the Hasina factor. M Jashim Uddin, Director of the Centre for Peace Studies at North South University, described the meeting as a diplomatic win, arguing that India was forced to acknowledge Yunus's legitimacy.asserted that India was waiting for the next election to take a definitive stance regarding Bangladesh and that was hampering the normal flow of relationship. Dubbing the meeting as a diplomatic win, it hoped that India treats Bangladesh as an equal and claimed Yunus had clearly conveyed this expectation., the most famous newspaper of the country in its editorial rued the fact that there was no real discussion about pending water agreement and said that constant engagement is the need of the hour and one or two meetings wouldn't break the deadlock. It urged India to prevent ousted PM Hasina , currently living in New Delhi from giving controversial remarks. Fairness, equality and brotherhood need to be the cornerstone of the relationship between two countries, the editorial underlined.On the issue of India’s demand for an 'inclusive election'—a veiled suggestion that Awami League should be part of the process—questioned India’s earlier silence when Hasina allegedly bulldozed the opposition to secure repeated victories. A front-page analysis on Sunday lamented that the visa issue—especially India’s drastic reduction in issuance to Bangladeshis—was overlooked. The article also noted that China had indirectly featured in the talks, with Modi reportedly indicating that he would not welcome a “third wheel” in the relationship.suggested that Yunus’s recent China visit may have paved the way for this summit. During that trip, Yunus reportedly described India’s North East as landlocked and dependent on Bangladesh, calling Bangladesh the “only guardian of the ocean”—remarks that sent shockwaves in India. Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma called the comments 'offensive' and warned against 'longstanding agendas,' emphasizing infrastructure development in the Chicken’s Neck region. In a thinly veiled statement before his Thailand departure, PM Modi described North East India as 'integral to BIMSTEC,' widely interpreted as a message to Yunus.Bangladeshi dailybelieves that India as the bigger partner had the responsibility of creating a working relationship but it was Bangladesh which took the lead. In a laudatory tone, it claims that Mohammad Younus has raised all the contentious issues and has made it clear to India that the days of flexing arm is over. Another newspaper,also harped on the theme of equality and fairness for lasting friendship between two countries.One tangible way to bolster friendship, according to Farid Hossain—former Minister (Press) at the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi—would be for India to resume regular visa services. Speaking to, Hossain said that the Modi-Yunus meeting had generated a positive media buzz and was welcomed by many politicians in Bangladesh. However, he noted that Hasina’s extradition was unlikely in the near term and not something the general public expected soon. Instead, progress on trade normalization and the Teesta water issue would help marginalize hardliners. Farid also played down the possibility of Bangladesh not obeying existing treaties.He concluded by saying that while social media may always lean toward extreme views, calm diplomacy and mutual respect were necessary to restore normalcy in bilateral ties. And in his view, the Modi-Yunus meeting—with its honest exchanges—was just the beginning.","First summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government.

Usha Vance says she's not from a wealthy MAGA background



Second Lady Usha Vance, who was the recently the eye of the storm over her Greenland visit, has spoken out about the attacks that she and Vice President JD Vance receive -- and a majority of it stems from her Indian roots. “Do I think it’s great when people talk about ‘ normalizing Indian hate ’ or something like that? Absolutely not. I think it’s terrible,"" Usha Vance said in an interview with The Free Press. ]But Usha said these racist attacks are nothing new. “I think it’s our relationship to this information”—the technology, the screens, the social media—“that is potentially new.”The recent India hate that surrounded JD ad Usha was DOGE staff Marko Elez, who made multiple racist posts in the past. ""Normalize Indian hate,"" one of his posts read. These racist posts got him fired from DOGE, but JD Vance was in favor of rehiring him, which drew ire from Indian-origin Democratic Rep Ro Khanna, who reminded JD Vance of that his kids share Indian origin because of Usha's roots.""Are you going to tell him (Marko Elez) to apologize for saying 'Normalize Indian hate' before this rehire? Just asking for the sake of both of our kids,"" Ro Khanna took a jibe at JD which rattled the Vice President as he did not like his kids to be brought to the debate.In the interview, Usha said she hadn't seen the back-and-forth between JD Vance and Ro Khanna in its entirety. “There is nothing that he cares more about than how his children grow up and how he relates to them and how we live together as a family. And he is very, very, very concerned, as we both are and I think maybe anyone in our position would be, about how this life impacts them,"" Usha said.The Second Lady said her highest priority right now is to be a normal person. “It’s a very strange life that we lead, where there are lots of people who have just imagined all sorts of narratives about us and what we think and what we do and why we do it and how much planning goes into it and all these sorts of things,"" she said.Usha said she has received a warm reception into the MAGA world though she is not from a wealthy background. “For what it’s worth, my reception into this world—and I’m not from a particularly wealthy background, not from a very fashion-oriented background personally or professionally—has been really positive,” she said. “People don’t seem to care all that much what I look like.”","Usha Vance says she has received a warm reception into the MAGA world though she is not from a wealthy background.

The Department of Commerce announced Tuesday it is pulling $4 million in federal funding from Princeton University, a move that strikes a blow to climate research projects associated with the prestigious institution.According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the funding cuts followed ""a detailed, careful, and thorough review of the Department’s financial assistance programs against the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) current program objectives."" The funding termination takes effect on June 30.The decision specifically impacts research efforts tied to NOAA, a sub-agency within the department, including Princeton’s Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System (CIMES). The department argued these projects no longer align with NOAA’s mission or with President Donald Trump’s administration priorities.The Trump administration emphasized that the cuts are part of its broader effort to ""streamline and reduce the cost and size of the Federal Government,"" consistent with what it called the president’s promise. “The Department of Commerce is delivering on that promise,” the news release stated.In fiscal year 2024, Princeton University had received a total of $455 million in federal funding. The Commerce Department now says some of those funds supported climate modeling and predictions that are no longer in favor with the administration.The CIMES program, as described on its website, has contributed significantly to developing climate and oceanic models and advancing the education of postdocs and graduate students . However, the department criticized the initiative, stating that it ""promotes exaggerated and implausible climate threats, contributing to a phenomenon known as ‘climate anxiety,’ which has increased significantly among America’s youth.""Other agreements impacted include the Climate Risks and Interactive Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Predictability project and the Advancing Prediction agreement. The department claimed the first “suggests that the Earth will have a significant fluctuation in its water availability as a result of global warming,” while the latter focused on assessing climate-related risks such as sea-level rise and altered precipitation patterns. “It also aims to address coastal inundation while other more targeted research efforts are addressing this issue,” the statement added.The Department of Commerce emphasized that future reviews of financial awards will continue “on an individualized basis to avoid wasteful governmental spending — whether they be to Princeton or any other recipient.”This funding cut comes amid a wave of scrutiny directed at academic institutions. Since the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks on Israel, the Trump administration has investigated numerous schools over allegations of antisemitism and has cut funding to several universities accused of allowing anti-Israel demonstrations on their campuses.","The Department of Commerce announced Tuesday it is pulling $4 million in federal funding from Princeton University.
