"Is speaking Bengali a ground for deportation, SC asks Centre to clarify",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-speaking-bengali-a-ground-for-deportation-sc-asks-centre-to-clarify/articleshow/123593818.cms,".

Ask for IDs of those you are deporting, says SC bench

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday sought a clarification from the Centre whether speaking Bengali was being used as one of the grounds for deportation of individuals but agreed with the Union govt that border forces had the right to repulse entry of illegal migrants as they pose a danger to the nation's demography, security and strain its resources.For the West Bengal govt's migrant workers' welfare board, advocate Prashant Bhushan told a bench of Justices Surya Kant, Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that people are being deported just for speaking Bengali, without any verification of their citizenship by authorities or through a tribunal. ""India can't push out anyone out of the country without following due procedure to determine their citizenship. Those pushed out face bullets from both sides, border forces of India and Bangladesh,"" he said.They are caught in a crossfire. This is per se illegal and violative of the right to life,"" he said. The bench said, ""Security forces have a right to repulse illegal migrants. Only if the person is on Indian soil that the procedure is to be followed...We will request the Centre to clarify its stand whether speaking Bengali is a ground for deportation.Is there a bias among officials to treat persons speaking a certain language as foreigners?"" Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, ""Obviously speaking Bengali is not a ground for deportation. """"However, India cannot be the world's capital for illegal migrants. Why is no individual petitioning SC? Why organisations are coming forward. There are states which are promoting illegal migrants to come in and settle in India. It is very disturbing that a systematic racket is going on to facilitate illegal migrants to enter a border state,"" he said and drew the court's attention to massive problems faced by European countries because of the influx of illegal migrants.The bench agreed that illegal migrants are a problem and said, ""They pose threat to the nation's security, integrity and demography as well as a strain on its resources. It is a serious international issue and very complicated too. However, In West Bengal and Punjab, the people on either side of the border speak the same language and share culture. So, language alone could not be the tool to identify foreigners.""The bench said, ""Pushing back illegal migrants is not an issue. But those whom you are deporting, you must ask for their identity proof."" Mehta said those affected by deportation should complain to the court and they could be provided with legal aid to present their case. ""Illegal migrants are facing serious problems in the US. Bhushan should go there to assist them,"" he snidely remarked.Referring to reports of a wall built at the US-Mexico border, the bench asked, ""Are you going to build a wall at the border like America?"" Mehta said India is fencing the border with Bangladesh and the matter was supervised by SC to stop illegal immigration.","Justices Surya Kant, Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi agreed with the Union govt that border forces had the right to repulse entry of illegal migrants.

India, China Can Stabilize Global Economic Order, Call For Peace: PM Modi's BIG MESSAGE From Japan

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi set the stage for his meeting with President Xi on Sunday as he said in Tokyo that given the current volatility in world economy, it is important for India and China, as 2 major economies, to work together to bring stability to the world economic order. He said India is ready to carry forward the relationship based on respect for each other's interests and sensitivities.However, Modi later also joined his Japanese counterpart Shigeru Ishiba in expressing serious concern - in the India-Japan annual summit joint statement - over the situation in East China Sea , where Japan is locked in a territorial dispute with Beijing over the uninhabited Senkaku/ Diaoyu islands, and South China Sea.Coupled with the first India-Philippines joint patrolling in the South China Sea earlier this month, the joint statement suggests India will continue to push back against any aggressive manoeuvring by Beijing in the region, despite the ongoing efforts to narrow differences and normalise the relationship with China. “India and Japan are fully committed towards a free, open, peaceful, prosperous, and rules-based Indo-Pacific,’’ said Modi, addressing the media jointly with Ishiba.India and Japan also adopted a new declaration on security cooperation that is seen as more in sync with current realities and efforts to ensure a coercion-free Indo-Pacific that upholds rules-based international order. Both leaders also backed the Quad summit that India has to host this year.Earlier in the day, in a newspaper interview, Modi underlined the “steady and positive” progress in ties since his last meeting with Xi in October last year. He said India is ready to advance bilateral relations with China from a strategic and long-term perspective on the basis of mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity, and to enhance strategic communication to address our developmental challenges.“Stable, predictable, and amicable bilateral relations between India and China, as two neighbours and the two largest nations on earth, can have a positive impact on regional and global peace and prosperity,” said Modi, adding that this is also crucial for a multi-polar Asia and a multi-polar world.Modi arrives in Tianjin in China on Saturday evening to participate in the SCO summit. His first engagement in China will be in the form of a bilateral meeting with Xi on Sunday morning.Both India and China have sought to stabilise the relationship, saying that they should not allow differences to turn into disputes. It will be interesting to see if China reacts to the concern expressed by Modi and Ishiba over the situation in East China Sea.Modi and his Japanese counterpart in the joint statement also reiterated their strong opposition to any unilateral actions that endanger the safety as well as freedom of navigation and overflight, and attempt to change the status quo by force or coercion. In remarks aimed at China, they shared their serious concern over the militarization of disputed features. “They reaffirmed that maritime disputes must be resolved peacefully and in accordance with international law, in particular the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),” said the India-Japan joint statement.","PM Narendra Modi says it is important for India and China, as 2 major economies, to work together to bring stability to the world economic order.

Amid the global instability wrought by the US tariff policy, PM Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Shigeru Ishiba announced a slew of measures, including a Joint Vision for the Next Decade, to boost ties in areas like trade and investment, AI, energy, critical minerals, human resources and defence and security.Among the highlights was a private-investment target of $ 67 billion from Japan to India over the next 10 years, an economic security initiative that identified semiconductors, critical minerals, pharmaceuticals and clean energy as key areas of collaboration and a renewal of the 2008 security declaration aimed at keeping the Indo-Pacific free of coercion in the face of Chinese assertiveness.Both leaders reaffirmed commitment to deepening the Quad partnership and backed the summit that India has to host in November, even though President Donald Trump’s proposed visit to India remains uncertain because of the strained India-US relationship. India and Japan also announced an action plan for talent mobility that will see an exchange of more than 500,000 personnel in 5 years including, as Modi said, 50,000 skilled personnel and potential talent from India to Japan.“Today, we have laid a strong foundation for a new and golden chapter in our Special Strategic and Global Partnership. We have set a roadmap for the next decade. We will also give special attention to connecting Small and Medium Enterprises and Start-ups from both countries,” said Modi, addressing the media along with Ishiba after the meeting.Speaking about the technology partnership, Modi said semiconductors and rare earth minerals were at the top of the agenda. “Cooperation in high technology is a priority for both of us. In this context, Digital Partnership 2.0 and AI cooperation initiatives are being undertaken,” announced Modi.

Japan PM Ishiba Roots For Make-in-India, Outlines Three Initiatives To Strengthen Delhi-Tokyo Ties

NEW DELHI: India and Japan on Friday signed an implementing arrangement for a joint lunar exploration mission to the south pole of the Moon called Chandrayaan-5, during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Tokyo.The arrangement between Isro and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) concerning the joint lunar polar exploration mission (LUPEX) was inked on the sidelines of Modi's visit and the pact was exchanged by Jaxa vice-president Matsuura Mayumi and India’s ambassador to Japan Sibi George.Addressing a joint press briefing with his Japanese counterpart Shigeru Ishiba, PM Modi said, “We welcome the collaboration between Isro and Jaxa for the Chandrayaan-5 mission. Our active participation has gone beyond the limits of the Earth and will become a symbol of mankind’s progress in space.”Referring to the global praise received by Chandrayaan-3's successful landing near the lunar South Pole in 2023 — when India became the first country to go to the uncharted territory of the Moon — Modi said the next challenge lies in deeper exploration of the lunar surface, particularly areas that may hold critical resources such as water ice.“This will contribute to deepening our understanding of the permanently shadowed regions at the lunar south pole,” Modi said in an interview with The Yomiuri Shimbun.“Our G2G collaboration in the space sector, between Isro and Jaxa, is fostering a culture of cooperation between our industries and startups. This is creating an ecosystem where innovation flows both ways — from labs to launchpads, and from research to real-world applications,” Modi said.The Chandrayaan-5 mission will be launched by Jaxa onboard its H3-24L launch vehicle, carrying the Isro-made lunar lander, which will carry a Japan-made rover.Apart from the lander, Isro is also responsible for developing a few scientific instruments for the mission. The spacecraft will carry seven scientific instruments, including a mass spectrometer by ESA and neutron spectrometers by Nasa.Chandrayaan-5’s mission objectives will be mapping lunar water presence; drilling lunar regolith to analyse water content, quality and composition; and performing in-situ scientific observations using spectrometers and sensors. It is a proposed 100-day mission with possible extension to a year and an attempt to explore the Moon’s far side.The approval for the Chandrayaan-5 was given by the Modi govt on March 10, in the form of financial sanction.During May 13-14, Isro and Jaxa had jointly conducted a third face-to-face technical interface meeting for the mission, at the Bengaluru-based Isro headquarters. The meeting was attended by senior officials, project executives and technical team members from Isro, Jaxa and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan.The two-day meeting deliberated on the various technical interfaces, joint mission implementation plan, as well as the potential landing sites for the mission. During the meeting, M Ganesh Pillai, scientific secretary, Isro, congratulated both the teams for technical achievements so far, and emphasized on the importance of the collaborative endeavour for the scientific and technical aspects of the mission.","The arrangement between Isro and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) concerning the joint lunar polar exploration mission was inked on the sidelines of Modi's visit.

NEW DELHI: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Tokyo on Friday for the India-Japan Economic Forum, Modi Archive, which narrates his life through archival records, recalled his first visit to the country in 2007, when he was Gujarat chief minister In April 2007, PM Modi had embarked on a six-day visit to Japan, leading a 40-member delegation of bureaucrats and industry leaders. His mission: to showcase Gujarat as India’s gateway for investment in industry, infrastructure, and innovation.Traveling through Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima and Kobe, PM Modi courted corporate heavyweights including Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Suzuki, Toshiba, Nippon Steel, and Tsuneshi Shipbuilding. The trip resulted in MoUs between JETRO (Japan External Trade Organization) and Gujarat’s Industries Department.""Ports, logistics, infrastructure and human resource development were on the table at the Japan Chambers of Commerce and Industries and Indo-Japan Friendship Forum, with Gujarat pitching itself as the natural entry point for Japan into India’s growth story,"" wrote Modi Archives on X.A key highlight was PM Modi’s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, where the two leaders discussed the Delhi–Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC).PM Modi presented Abe with a CD on Gujarat’s Buddhist heritage and a handwoven tribal shawl, inviting him to visit the state. In return, Abe assured Japan’s full support for Gujarat’s segment of the DMIC, cementing a foundation for deeper Indo-Japan economic and cultural ties.""Perhaps the most iconic moment of the visit came when he stepped into the cockpit of a Japanese Bullet Train . What if such high-speed rail transformed Indian connectivity? That seed of an idea in 2007 would blossom years later into the Mumbai–Ahmedabad Bullet Train project, the flagship of Indo-Japanese cooperation.In April 2007, PM Modi walked through Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial Park, pausing at the Prayer of the Fountain and the Suzuki Miekichi Literary Monument. Later in Kobe, he joined a cultural programme at The India Club, a historic hub for the Indian diaspora since 1904. That visit planted the seeds of deeper business and cultural ties between Gujarat and Japan.By July 2012, PM Modi returned on a much larger stage. Invited formally by the Government of Japan for a five-day tour (22–27 July), he was accorded a Cabinet-rank reception — an honour rarely extended to a state leader. It was the 60th anniversary of India–Japan diplomatic ties, and PM Modi’s packed itinerary covered 44 engagements across Tokyo, Hamamatsu, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe.PM Modi had met key Japanese ministers — Koichiro Gemba (Foreign Affairs), Yukio Edano (Trade & Industry), Yuchiro Hata (Infrastructure & Transport), and Deputy PM Katsuya Okada — along with governors Hideaki Omura of Aichi and Toshizo Ido of Hyogo. At JETRO’s investment seminars, he pitched Gujarat as an investor-friendly, power-surplus state, emphasizing ports, logistics, and industrial corridors.Business diplomacy was central: PM Modi had held extensive meetings with corporate leaders, including a landmark session with Osamu Suzuki, Chairman of Suzuki Motors. Touring facilities and sharing lunch with him, Modi pitched Gujarat as Asia’s next automotive hub. Round-tables at Mizuho Corporate Bank and the Imperial Hotel deepened corporate ties further.Infrastructure was another highlight. Riding the Shinkansen from Tokyo to Hamamatsu, PM Modi explored possibilities for high-speed rail and metro projects in Gujarat, focusing on Japan’s model of speed, efficiency, and safety. At Kobe Port, he studied maritime systems that could guide Gujarat’s own port expansion, reaffirming the state’s centrality in the Delhi–Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC).Cultural outreach balanced the diplomacy. PM Modi had addressed the Gujarat Samaj of Japan, met members of the India Centre Foundation, and was honoured at a reception hosted by HCCI Chairman Mimuro. At Kobe’s India Club, he engaged with the diaspora and even took a symbolic boat ride at the port.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Tokyo on Friday for the India-Japan Economic Forum.

Indian Army, J&K Police Neutralize 2 Terrorists In Bandipora, Ops Ongoing

NEW DELHI: The Army is now raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers, to enhance swift strike capabilities along the borders with Pakistan and China.The plan is to progressively raise 23 ""agile and lethal"" 'Bhairav' battalions from existing troops to bridge the gap between regular infantry soldiers and the elite Para-Special Forces. ""The aim is to have the first five such units in place by Oct 31, though it can take a little more time,"" a source told TOI.Three of the first five 'Bhairav' units are coming up under the Army's crucial Udhampur-based Northern Command, one each for the 14 Corps at Leh, 15 Corps at Srinagar, and 16 Corps at Nagrota. The fourth unit is in the desert terrain of the western sector and the fifth in the hilly terrain of the eastern sector.The 11.5-lakh strong Army is drawing 'Bhairav' commandos from its regular infantry battalions, which number 415 (each has 800 soldiers), under the ""save and raise"" concept without fresh troop accretions. ""Much smaller and nimble than infantry battalions, the 'Bhairav' units will be equipped with the latest weapons, gadgets and drones.They will be geared for speed, flexibility and high-impact tactical operations,"" source said.These units will be in addition to the Army's 10 Para-Special Forces and five Para (Airborne) battalions, each of which have 620 soldiers selected after arduous training, and are equipped with a wide array of specialised weapons and equipment.Though meant for special clandestine missions in high-risk environments, usually behind enemy lines, these crack units are often used for mere tactical operations. ""The 'Bhairav' battalions, each with seven-eight officers, are also meant to relieve Special Forces, who can then concentrate on their more critical tasks,"" another source said.The 'Bhairav' commandos will undergo specialised training for two-three months in their respective regimental centres and then be attached to the Special Forces units in their respective theatres for another month for advanced training.On July 26, Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi had announced the move to set up new 'Rudra' all-arms brigades, 'Shaktibaan' artillery regiments, with special 'Divyastra' surveillance and loitering munitions batteries, and the 'Bhairav' battalions. He also said all infantry battalions will now have dedicated drone platoons, as was then reported by TOI.A new tri-service joint doctrine for Special Forces operations was, incidentally, released on Wednesday. Apart from the Army's Special Forces, there are 27 'flights' of around 1,600 'Garud' commandos in IAF and over 1,400 marine commandos (Marcos) in Navy.""Special Forces, owing to their agility, strategic reach and mission-specific capabilities, are uniquely suited to generate disproportionate operational effect through precision engagement, deep insertion and unconventional operations,"" said CDS General Anil Chauhan, in the doctrine's foreword.","The Army is raising the first lot of five 'Bhairav' light commando battalions, each with 250 specially trained and equipped soldiers.

NEW DELHI: In a first, the ED has secured an Interpol Purple Notice on trade-based money laundering modus operandi. The notice was published on August 21 and alerts all investigative agencies across Interpol's 196 member countries to keep watch on shell entities engaged in such activities.The enforcement agency has shared an organised network of domestic and foreign shell entities engaged in large-scale laundering of funds under the guise of international trade. ""The conspirators exploited trade mechanisms and banking channels by under-invoicing imports, using sham duty-free imports (such as semiconductors), forging compliance documents, and carrying out circular re-exports through third-country entities to disguise illicit remittances,"" the ED said.The Purple Notice is one of eight types published by Interpol, providing member countries with information on modus operandi, objects, devices and concealment methods used by criminals.""The circular trading created a false narrative of international commerce, masking large-scale laundering of funds. The scheme exhibited hawala-like features but operated through formal banking systems, shell companies, and forged trade documentation to evade regulatory detection,"" the ED said, and added that the publishing of the notice is an attempt at generating awareness and sensitising its global counterparts to these new emerging money laundering trends.The agency said timely and precise gathering of information through informal cooperation is vital to effective domestic investigation. India has been sensitising expert groups and organisations active at international level which may be instrumental in facilitating informal cooperation between jurisdictions.India through ED is utilising platforms like Globe Network and Asset Recovery Interagency Network-Asia Pacific to shape global policies for combating money laundering and preventing safe havens for the proceeds of crime.

NEW DELHI: New Delhi: Kohima, Visakhapatnam and Bhubaneswar are top scorers among seven cities that qualified as safest for women in the 'Index on Women Safety (NARI) 2025' - based on a survey conducted in 31 major cities covering all states. Ranchi and Srinagar have the lowest scores on the index.Among metropolitan cities, Mumbai figures among the top seven cities, while the set of seven cities with the lowest scores also includes capital Delhi and Kolkata.Besides Kohima, the northeastern cities of Aizawl, Gangtok and Itanagar figure among the top cities in the safety rankings, often correlating with higher gender equity, infrastructure, policing or civic participation.Faridabad, Patna and Jaipur are the other cites with the lowest score, correlating with poorer infrastructure, patriarchal norms or weaker institutional responsiveness, according to the survey, which captured perceptions and lived experiences of 12,770 women to generate the index.As far as the national average is concerned, the mean score is 65%, and cities in the index have been categorised as ""much above"", ""above"", ""below"", and ""much below"" this benchmark.The 'National Annual Report & Index on Women's Safety (NARI) 2025' conceived by data science company Pvalue Analytics was released by National Commission for Women chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar at a programme here.The NCW chief said a safe environment was crucial for building a developed and inclusive India and assured that the commission will build on the suggestions in the survey report to bridge the gaps to strengthen women safety.The report highlights that National Crime Records Bureau data presents only the tip of the iceberg -crimes actually registered. NARI shows that two out of three women do not report - meaning NCRB could miss two-thirds of events experienced by women.The report showed that while 60% of women surveyed felt ""safe"", a significant 40% felt ""not so safe"" or ""unsafe"" in their cities. Perceptions of safety drop sharply at night, highlighting ongoing concerns about public infrastructure (lighting, patrolling) and societal factors, it said.However, when it comes to reporting of unsafe incidents, reporting remains low with only 33% of victims reporting their experiences to authorities, while 67% choosing not to report.Prevalence of harassment remains high with 7% women reporting at least one incident of harassment in public spaces in 2024.However, when it comes to reporting of unsafe incidents, reporting remains low with only 33% of victims reporting their experiences to authorities, while 67% choosing not to report.","Kohima, Visakhapatnam and Bhubaneswar are top scorers among seven cities that qualified as safest for women in the 'Index on Women Safety (NARI) 2025' Ranchi and Srinagar have the lowest scores on the index.

India in the crossfire

Tariffs hit hard

China steps in





Former US national security advisor Jake Sullivan has launched a sharp attack on Donald Trump’s latest trade move against India, warning that the “massive trade offensive” risks undoing years of work to bring New Delhi closer to Washington - and instead pushing it into Beijing’s orbit.Speaking on The Bulwark Podcast with Tim Miller, Sullivan accused Trump of turning America into a “big disruptor” in the eyes of its allies. He said that while Washington was once seen as a steady hand, it is now viewed as unreliable, even as China gains credibility.“When I go to these places now and I talk to leaders, they are talking about derisking from the United States,” Sullivan said. “They now see the US as the big disruptor, the country that can’t be counted on. China has moved ahead of the United States in popularity in a whole lot of countries… the American brand globally is in the toilet.”Sullivan singled out India as the clearest example of Trump’s missteps.Washington, he said, had worked on a bipartisan basis to build a strategic partnership with New Delhi, particularly to counter China’s growing influence. But Trump’s sudden tariff hikes have strained those efforts.“Take a look at India,” Sullivan said. “Here’s a country we were trying to build a deeper and more sustainable relationship with. Now you have got President Trump executing a massive trade offensive against them and the Indians are saying, ‘Well, I guess maybe we have to go show up in Beijing and sit with the Chinese because we’ve got to hedge against America.’”The critique comes days after the US imposed a steep 50% tariff on Indian exports, effective August 27. The duties - the highest levied against any country - are set to hit Indian sectors like textiles, jewellery, and mechanical appliances, raising fears of lost jobs and slower growth.Trump defended the decision as retaliation for India’s continued purchase of Russian oil. However, analysts say the trigger may be more personal.A report by investment banking firm Jefferies suggested the escalation stems partly from Trump’s anger over not being allowed to mediate in the India-Pakistan conflict earlier this year. Agricultural disputes between the two nations have also deepened the rift.For Sullivan, the damage goes beyond economics. He argued that Trump’s actions hand China a diplomatic victory, with Beijing now able to present itself as a more responsible player on the global stage.“One year ago, China was on the defensive,” Sullivan noted. “Now, countries are basically saying the US can’t be counted on, and China is looking like the adult in the room.”",Former US national security advisor Jake Sullivan criticizes Donald Trump's latest trade move against India.

New Delhi: The govt will soon rank states on parameters of quality of land records, ease of land acquisition and their active participation for taking up highway development works. Delay in getting land and poor land records are the biggest hindrances in execution of road projects.“We are planning to carry out ranking of states on quality of land records, ease of acquisition and the support that we get for completing land acquisition. Then we can fix timelines for projects based on the assessment of which parameters a state has fulfilled,” said road transport and highways secretary V Umashankar while speaking at a workshop on effective project preparation and robust monitoring by Build India Foundation.The secretary said there have been instances where issues of missing plots (plots not acquired) came to light after getting project approval and during tendering process. “You come to know about this after 7-8 months. So, a part (a stretch of the project) comes to a standstill. We go through another exercise, which has its own set of complications and then leads to a prolongation issue at a later stage...There is a disease of missing plots.There are specific states that have 100% such problems. So, the land plan becomes a very important element in the entire project,” he added.On project preparation, the secretary said it’s not easy.

New Delhi: In the next four years, investment in the urban sector is likely to be around Rs 10 lakh crore, housing and urban affairs secretary Srinivas Katikithala said on Friday while urging real estate developers to take up projects along the major transport corridors and areas with infrastructure facilities rather than launching projects where adequate infrastructure is yet to come up.Addressing realtors at a convention of NAREDCO, a major real estate players organisation, Katikala highlighted how govt has been investing and also continuing huge investment in infrastructure, including roads, metro rail, railways, water supply and sewage. “When this infrastructure expansion is happening, are we aligning our projects along this infrastructure expansion?"" he asked while suggesting that the real estate industry should align their development activities along existing infrastructure.“Please do not wait for infrastructure to chase us. Let us chase the spaces where infrastructure is already there,” the secretary said. He added that India’s urban infrastructure sector has witnessed a Rs 30 lakh crore investment in the last one decade and the pace of investment will continue. The secretary said that the Transit Oriented Development (TOD) policy specifies that there can be intensive development in the 700 metres influence area along the major transport corridors.On the need to align projects with existing infrastructure, urban experts cited the example of Gurgaon where real estate projects came first and then the civic and transport infrastructure were developed. The Millennium City is plagued with congestion, waterlogging and sanitation issues.In his address, Katikala said that it’s no longer enough for urban local bodies to deliver services on their own and they must come together with the private sector and deliver high quality urban services.","In the next four years, investment in the urban sector is likely to be around Rs 10 lakh crore, housing and urban affairs secretary Srinivas Katikithala said.

Earlier in the day, it had been recorded slightly lower at EGP 4,640 ($97.44).The price of the gold pound (weighing approximately 8 grams of 21-karat gold) increased to EGP 37,200 ($781.20), up from EGP 37,120 ($779.58) earlier in the day.The upward movement came in close succession to the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE) decision to reduce interest rates by 200 basis points on Thursday, August 28, 2025, a development that typically channels more demand into non-interest-bearing assets like gold.In global markets, an ounce of gold traded at approximately $3,417.79 during the day. Meanwhile, gold futures for December delivery rose by 0.5%, or $17.5, to settle at $3,466.1 on Thursday, reflecting support from a weakening US dollar ahead of inflation data expected tomorrow.Below is the full breakdown of domestic gold prices in Egypt as of Friday:On Thursday, August 28, 2025, the Central Bank of Egypt implemented a significant monetary policy adjustment, cutting key interest rates by 200 basis points. The overnight deposit rate now stands at 22%, the lending rate at 23%, and the main operation and discount rates both at 22.5%.The decision was made during the Monetary Policy Committee’s scheduled meeting and was attributed to multiple factors, including:Domestically, the CBE cited signs of economic stabilization. Real GDP growth for the 2024/2025 fiscal year is forecasted at 4.5%, a considerable improvement over the 2.4% recorded the previous year. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate showed further recovery, declining to 6.1% in Q2 of 2025, down from 6.3% in Q1.The interest rate cut is expected to boost investment and consumer spending, factors that also tend to drive demand for gold, viewed as both a safe haven and a hedge against currency depreciation and inflation.The CBE's decision aligns with broader global monetary policy trends. The US Federal Reserve recently opted to hold its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.25%–4.50% during its fifth policy meeting of 2025. The decision reflects a cautious stance by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, despite growing pressure from US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly urged for rate cuts since taking office earlier this year.The Federal Reserve’s pause, combined with a weakening dollar, supported gold prices internationally. With US inflation data due tomorrow, global investors have taken defensive positions, increasing demand for precious metals.Different karats of gold hold varying appeal for buyers across Egypt:","Gold prices in Egypt surged on Friday, August 29, 2025, with 21-karat gold reaching EGP 4,650 (approximately $97.65) The price of the gold pound increased to EGP 37,200 ($781.20) on Friday.

US economy: Fed’s inflation gauge steady at 2.6% in July; core prices edge higher to 2.9%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-price-gauge-steady-in-july-core-inflation-ticks-higher-fed-cautious-on-rate-cuts/articleshow/123585849.cms,"



The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge held steady in July even as President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs added pressure on the economy, but a key measure of underlying prices climbed to the highest level in five months.The Commerce Department on Friday said overall prices rose 2.6% in July from a year earlier, unchanged from June, AP reported. Excluding food and energy, core prices increased 2.9% year-on-year, up from 2.8% in June and the sharpest since February.The figures highlight why many Fed officials remain reluctant to ease borrowing costs. Inflation has cooled sharply from its 7% peak three years ago but continues to run above the central bank’s 2% target.The report also offered some signs of resilience in household demand. Consumer spending jumped 0.5% in July, the biggest monthly gain since March, with strong outlays on cars, appliances and furniture. Incomes rose 0.4% over the month, boosted by wage and salary gains.On a monthly basis, overall consumer prices rose 0.2% from June, down from 0.3% in the previous month, while core prices advanced 0.3% for the second consecutive month.The trend closely tracked the consumer price index, which earlier this month showed a 2.7% annual rise, with the core CPI up 3.1% in July.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has signalled that the central bank is likely to cut its key interest rate at its next meeting but stressed that policymakers will proceed cautiously. “It’s not clear how many more rate cuts will happen this year,” he said.When the Fed lowers its benchmark rate, borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans and business lending typically fall, though not always.Trump, meanwhile, has continued to berate Powell and the Fed over monetary policy. Since earlier this year, the president has labelled Powell “Too Late” and a “moron,” insisting there is “no inflation.” On Monday, Trump sought to fire Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed’s board, in what analysts saw as a bid to assert greater control over the central bank.","Consumer prices rose 2.6% in July from a year earlier, unchanged from June.

Canada’s economy shrank at an annualised pace of 1.6% in the second quarter as exports took a hit from tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump, Statistics Canada said on Friday. This marked the country’s first GDP contraction in seven quarters.The agency also revised down its first-quarter growth estimate from 2.2% to 2.0%, underscoring the impact of Washington’s trade actions on the world’s ninth-largest economy, AFP reported.Canadian exports fell sharply by 7.5% in the April-June period after a 1.4% rise in the previous quarter. International shipments of passenger cars and light trucks plunged 24.7%, while exports of industrial machinery and equipment dropped 18.5%. Travel services were also down 11.1%, the data showed.The sharper-than-expected decline has raised expectations that the Bank of Canada may move to cut interest rates when it meets in September. The central bank has left its benchmark rate unchanged at 2.75% in its past three policy meetings.However, robust domestic activity partially offset the external shock. Household consumption jumped 4.5% annualized, residential investment rose 6.3%, and government spending increased 5.1%, leading to overall domestic demand growth of 3.5%, according to Reuters.On a monthly basis, June GDP contracted 0.1%, primarily due to a slowdown in goods-producing industries, which make up around a quarter of the economy. “That weaker-than-expected trend in the monthly figures makes today’s release supportive for our forecast of a September interest rate cut,” said Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.The contraction raised market expectations for a Bank of Canada (BoC) rate cut next month. Money markets now price in a 48% probability of a September 17 rate reduction, up from 40% prior to the GDP release.An advance estimate for July by Reuters suggested a 0.1% month-on-month expansion, indicating that Q3 could show minimal growth. Royce Mendes, managing director at Desjardins, noted, “While the July flash showed the economy largely recovered lost ground from June, early tracking points to a flat-to-slightly-negative estimate for Q3 GDP.”The Canadian dollar traded lower at 1.3771 per US dollar (72.62 US cents), while yields on two-year government bonds declined 2.8 basis points to 2.664%.Economists noted that jobs and inflation data for August would be critical for the BoC’s rate decision.

Indian Economy Dead? PM Modi Gives It Back To Trump Amid U.S. Vs India Trade Fight

Why it matters

The big picture

Sectoral performance:

Agriculture expanded 3.7%, up from 1.5% in the same quarter last year, aided by a solid sowing season.

Manufacturing grew 7.7%, nearly flat compared to last year but well above the 4.8% seen in the prior quarter.

Services led the way with a robust 9.3% expansion, boosted by trade, hotels, transport, and financial services.

Demand drivers:

Private consumption, which accounts for nearly 60% of GDP, rose 7.0% - helped by rural spending, demand for durables, and tax relief.

Government expenditure jumped 9.7% in nominal terms, reversing a contraction in the previous quarter.

Capital formation rose 7.8%, though economists flagged hesitancy among private firms amid tariff uncertainty.

Nominal slowdown: Real GDP may be strong, but nominal GDP (factoring in inflation) slowed to 8.8% from a long-run average near 11%. That could weigh on corporate earnings and tax revenues

What they’re saying:

Aditi Nayar, ICRA: “Amidst continuing tariff-induced uncertainty for exports and private capex, we fear that growth will taper off in the subsequent quarters, notwithstanding the balm offered by GST rationalisation.”

Madhavi Arora, Emkay Financial: “The effective macro hit from the 50% tariff imposition will start to feed through exports and have a domino effect on employment, wages and private consumption. This could further dampen private investment outlook and hinder growth.”

Capital Economics: The “surprise acceleration” means India is still “on course to expand by a world-beating 7% this year, despite the upcoming hit from punitive US tariffs.”

Radhika Rao, DBS Bank: “Markets will switch focus to catalysts for the rest of the year, which faces an interplay of tariff-related impact, GST rationalisation, and government spending trend with an eye on revenues.”

Suja Hajra, Anand Rathi Group: “Risks remain, most notably the recent 50% US tariff on Indian exports. Yet, with reforms gaining traction and inflation staying modest, India continues to stand out as the most compelling macro story in a gloomy world.”

Zoom in: Export front-loading

Between the lines

The tariff dispute stems from India’s continued purchases of discounted Russian oil - which Washington argues helps finance Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Trump responded by doubling duties to 50% this week, placing India alongside Brazil as one of the hardest-hit US partners.

New Delhi has so far refrained from retaliatory measures but is lobbying Washington for a review of the duties. Exporter groups estimate that tariffs could hit 55% of India’s $87 billion in US-bound shipments, giving an edge to rivals such as Vietnam, Bangladesh and China.

The government’s response:

The government has pledged targeted support for affected sectors and tax cuts to cushion domestic demand.

Earlier this month, it slashed consumption taxes, which are expected to take effect in October, just ahead of the festive season. IDFC First Bank estimates the cuts could lift nominal GDP by 0.6 percentage points over 12 months.

Officials are also betting that lower inflation and rationalisation of GST rates will keep consumer demand resilient.

What’s next

Reserve Bank of India: The central bank projects 6.5% growth for FY26 and is expected to hold rates steady in its October review. Analysts say the stronger Q1 print rules out near-term easing.

Exports outlook: Economists fear a significant slowdown once the tariffs hit full force, with knock-on effects on employment, wages, and private consumption.

Global position: Even with tariff headwinds, India’s growth is outpacing China, which posted 5.2% growth in the same quarter. Investors continue to view India as a key alternative to China in supply chains.





The data doesn’t care about Twitter tirades or Truth Social posts. India’s April–June GDP growth data, released Friday by the National Statistics Office (NSO), showed an economy with surprising resilience: fueled by solid farm output, strong private spending, a services boom, and front-loaded government expenditure.Defying Trump’s “dead economy” jibe, India’s GDP expanded 7.8% year-on-year in the April–June quarter - its fastest growth in five quarters, official data showed Friday. The figure outpaced market forecasts of 6.7% and topped the previous quarter’s 7.4%, underscoring India’s status as the world’s fastest-growing major economy.The data underscores the strength of India’s domestic economy, powered by services, manufacturing, and farm output. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is pushing to make India a global manufacturing hub at a time when investors are reassessing supply chain dependence on China.Yet, the Trump's tariff escalation threatens to derail India’s export engine - a key pillar of its growth story - and poses risks to jobs and private investment. According to some analysts, the US duties could shave as much as 0.6–0.8 percentage points off India’s growth over the next year.Here are some comments given to Reuters by experts.Analysts say part of the Q1 boost came from exporters rushing shipments to the US before Trump’s tariff deadlines. Bloomberg reported this “front-loading effect” temporarily padded growth, but the effect will fade as the full brunt of tariffs takes hold in the second half of the fiscal year.(With inputs from agencies)","GDP data underscores the strength of India’s domestic economy, powered by services, manufacturing, and farm output.

The Big Picture







Donald Trump has never disguised his transactional approach to foreign policy. But in 2025, his behaviour toward India has crossed into something far more disruptive. He has claimed credit for ending a May India-Pakistan conflict (a claim Delhi flatly rejects). He has invited Pakistan’s army chief to lunch at the White House, prompting anger in Delhi that Washington is “treating India and Pakistan as equals.” And he has escalated a tariff war, leaving Indian exporters facing what the US Congressional Research Service (CRS) describes as a “50% tariff on India on top of existing tariffs.”These are not Indian government talking points. They are the findings of CRS—a dry, nonpartisan research arm of the US Congress—in a briefing dated August 25, 2025. When CRS puts it in writing, Capitol Hill pays attention.The Congressional Research Service is Washington’s in-house think tank. Its analysts don’t campaign, give TV interviews, or spin headlines. They produce factual, nonpartisan reports that lawmakers rely on when voting on tariffs, arms sales, or oversight of the White House. A critical CRS report means that Congress is on alert—and the alarms are flashing red on India policy.The CRS reminds lawmakers of the long, bipartisan effort since 2000 to build India into a pillar of US Indo-Pacific strategy:But now, CRS bluntly states that “President Trump since May has taken actions that observers say put the partnership at risk.”At the centre of the rupture is economics. Using emergency powers, Trump imposed:For India, which had already reduced tariffs and withdrawn its digital services tax to smooth talks, this is a gut punch. After two decades of being courted as a trade partner, Washington has just doubled the barriers.CRS also revisits the May 2025 four-day war between India and Pakistan. Its finding is damning: “Indian officials… have expressed frustration that the President has treated India and Pakistan as equals—including by hosting Pakistan’s army chief to lunch at the White House—while Delhi holds Pakistan responsible for the terrorist attack that sparked the conflict.”In other words, while Trump claims to be “tough on terror” domestically, his official record is one of legitimising the very military India blames for cross-border terrorism.The fallout isn’t only diplomatic. It risks spilling into the two areas once touted as the “load-bearing pillars” of the partnership:The stakes extend to people, not just policy. CRS highlights:But friction remains: Washington has labelled India “recalcitrant” on deportations, and Congress is split on H-1B reform.Beyond the headlines, the CRS report offers a layered warning. It documents how India’s rise—now the world’s fourth-largest economy—made it a natural partner for successive US administrations, only for Trump’s second term to throw sand in the gears.On trade, the report is explicit: Trump’s dual tariffs could leave India facing a 50% effective duty, an unprecedented escalation that Indian officials consider discriminatory since Europe was spared similar penalties. The report notes that this has already sparked calls in India to boycott American goods, a populist backlash that Modi has countered by doubling down on his “self-reliant India” agenda.On security, CRS points to Indian anger over Trump’s “equal treatment” of Pakistan and his claim to have ended the May conflict, when in Delhi’s telling, the ceasefire owed nothing to Washington.On technology, the report shows how reduced staffing in Trump’s National Security Council threatens to stall implementation of the TRUST roadmap on AI, semiconductors, and quantum. In defense, it flags both momentum—$24 billion in sales, growing interoperability—and fragility, with the 10-year framework expiring this year and still unresolved. And on immigration, it reminds lawmakers that India is not just a policy partner but a people partner: the single biggest source of H-1Bs, green cards, and foreign students.The concluding section distils the dilemma for Congress into a set of choices: whether to loosen export controls, resource the Quad, and keep betting on India’s democratic resilience—or let Trump’s instincts on tariffs and Pakistan dictate the shape of America’s India policy.CRS closes by laying out the dilemmas now before lawmakers:CRS never editorialises. But its message is unmistakable: after two decades of careful bipartisan investment, Trump’s mix of tariffs, boasts, and Pakistan lunches is shredding the credibility of America’s India policy. For Congress, the choice is whether to salvage the partnership or let Trump’s instincts dictate strategy. For India, the warning is even sharper: if this is what friendship looks like, what would betrayal look like?","The US Congress’ own research arm, CRS, warns that Donald Trump’s second term is destabilising a relationship built over 25 years.

Born on 21 August 1909, Caterham has lived through some of the most transformative events in modern history, including the Titanic disaster, the Russian Revolution, and both World Wars. She is also the last surviving subject of King Edward VII, representing a living connection to early 20th-century British monarchy. Recognised by King Charles III with a birthday card in 2024, Caterham’s milestone has captured global attention. Her story highlights the remarkable combination of longevity, resilience, and historical perspective, inspiring people worldwide to reflect on the extraordinary possibilities of human life, the evolution of society, and the enduring spirit of individuals who witness over a century of change.Ethel Caterham was born in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, as the second youngest of eight siblings. Growing up in a large family in early 20th-century England meant learning responsibility, cooperation, and resilience from an early age. Raised in Tidworth, Wiltshire, she witnessed a rural way of life during a time of social change and industrial expansion. Her childhood coincided with technological advances like the spread of electricity and the automobile, shaping the early experiences of a girl who would live through over a century of innovation.These formative years likely influenced her adaptability and endurance—traits that contribute significantly to longevity and reflect an era where perseverance, community values, and resourcefulness were essential for survival in challenging circumstances.As a teenager, Caterham worked as an au pair in India, an experience that not only broadened her cultural understanding but also introduced her to independence and responsibility at a young age. As reported by BBC, later in life, she moved to Hong Kong and Gibraltar, accompanying her husband Norman, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the British Army. These postings exposed her to diverse climates, cuisines, languages, and social customs, fostering mental agility and adaptability—qualities that studies suggest are linked to longer life expectancy. Living abroad during politically and socially dynamic periods also provided her with firsthand knowledge of global events, enriching her personal and historical perspective.Ethel Caterham’s life spans some of the most significant events of the last century. Born three years before the Titanic sank in 1912, she experienced the societal upheaval of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and lived through both World Wars. As reported, she has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, the advent of commercial aviation, the digital revolution, and major advances in medicine. Caterham’s personal story reflects the resilience and adaptability of individuals living through periods of profound uncertainty and change. Being a living archive of these events, she offers a unique perspective on how human society evolves over time.Caterham’s extraordinary longevity has been officially recognized by the British royal family. King Charles III sent her a birthday card to celebrate her 115th birthday in 2024, a gesture highlighting both her personal achievements and her historical significance. Such recognition is rare and symbolic, connecting Caterham to a lineage that stretches back to King Edward VII. The acknowledgment of her life by the monarchy underscores the cultural and historical importance of longevity and demonstrates society’s admiration for those who live exceptionally long lives.Now living in a care home in Lightwater, Surrey, Caterham enjoys her days surrounded by family and close friends. According to her care home, she prefers to celebrate birthdays quietly, at her own pace, reflecting a peaceful and stress-free lifestyle that research shows can support longevity. Her family has expressed gratitude for the outpouring of public interest and kind messages, emphasizing the role of emotional support, social connection, and family bonding in maintaining mental and physical health in extreme old age.While Caterham is the oldest living person today, the record for the verified oldest human remains with Frenchwoman Jeanne Louise Calment, who lived to 122 years and 164 days. Caterham’s age, however, is still remarkable, placing her among the very few documented centenarians to surpass 115. Her life contributes valuable insights into the factors associated with longevity, including genetics, lifestyle, adaptability, and mental resilience. Researchers studying supercentenarians like Caterham aim to understand how humans can live longer, healthier lives, offering inspiration and guidance for aging populations worldwide.","Ethel Caterham, a British centenarian residing in Lightwater, Surrey, has officially become the world’s oldest living person at 116 years old.

Stray dog row in Faridabad society: RWA hires bouncers; feeder woman slapped with Rs 1.3L fine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/40-stray-dogs-left-starving-rwa-deploys-bouncers-fines-woman-rs-1-3l-for-feeding-inside-faridabad-society/articleshow/123575518.cms,"Supreme Court Allows Stray Dogs Back On Streets, But Bans Feeding Them In Public Spaces

Poll Do you believe the current laws regarding stray dogs are effective? Yes, they provide necessary guidelines No, they need to be revised





GURGAON: The residents' welfare association (RWA) of a housing society in Greater Faridabad has fined a dog lover Rs 1.3 lakh over the past three years for feeding strays in unauthorised areas.Divya Nair, a private firm employee known among residents of Princess Park in Sector 86 for her compassion towards stray animals, has been feeding dogs within the society since 2022.According to RWA officials, the fine was levied after Nair repeatedly fed dogs in parks, the basketball court, parking lots, and other public spaces despite the society designating a specific feeding zone in the market area. The RWA alleged her actions had created a mess on the campus and raised safety concerns for other residents.A senior police official clarified that RWAs do not have the authority to levy fines on residents. ""No, they can't. We can initiate action against them only if the woman lodges a complaint,"" the official added.The Princess Park dispute unfolded against the backdrop of recent Supreme Court rulings on the issue of stray dogs. Responding to concerns over rising dog bite incidents and rabies cases in Delhi-NCR, the apex court modified earlier orders that called for strays to be moved to shelter homes.The latest ruling allowed authorities to release strays after sterilisation, but clarified that aggressive or rabid dogs must be kept in shelters. Most importantly, the court banned the feeding of stray dogs in public spaces and instructed authorities to set up dedicated feeding areas.The tussle between the RWA and Nair escalated when she took to social media platform X, alleging that she was assaulted for feeding dogs and her family faced threats from local police. She also claimed that all dog feeding had been banned in the society since the revised Supreme Court order last week, and lady bouncers had been deployed by the RWA to enforce the rule.Nair expressed concern that nearly 40 stray dogs in the area were now starving because of such restrictions.RWA vice-president Ranmeek Chahal insisted that the society's measures were intended at protecting residents - especially children and the elderly - from potential harm.The RWA has now decided to pursue legal action against Nair to recover the outstanding fine.","Divya Nair is known among residents of Princess Park in Sector 86 for her compassion towards stray animals.

examines the problems & solutions

Health minister Mukesh Mahaling

What is the govt’s plan when it comes to revamping the infrastructure at SCB?

The Rs 4,474 crore-redevelopment of SCB Medical College and Hospital is underway and as planned, the new buildings will be linked with the old ones so it will be more convenient for patients to access all departments and facilities. A level-I trauma care facility is also being developed for the patients. To control the crowd at the patient registration counter, we are discussing a plan for an online registration process once the redevelopment process is over. The Ayushman Bharat Health Account registration process will also start.

A helipad will also be constructed so that critical patients, who require immediate treatment outside the state, can be airlifted directly from the hospital premises itself. All of these changes are being done as part of the govt’s plan to develop SCB as an AIIMS-Plus institute.

Besides, we are improving infrastructural facilities for ample parking space, waste management facilities and sewerage treatment plants at the hospital.

How can the govt solve the issue of bed shortage at SCB?

We will increase the bed strength at SCB to more than 4,000 beds.

The Orissa high court has recently taken note of issues related to organ transplant at SCB. What’s your opinion on this?

A Hyderabad-based hospital was roped in for conducting the liver transplantation programme at SCB, but it did not show interest after its agreement was over. We are trying to bring another hospital to resume this service. After the retirement of an expert, the bone marrow transplant slowed down but we are taking initiatives to fix the problem.

We are planning to start a heart transplantation service at the hospital. For this, we are building a team to carry out the programme with the help of an expert hospital. Kidney transplant service is underway as usual. Rejection of transplanted kidneys and health complications among transplant patients are not unusual things. We have a plan to bring all organ transplant services under one roof to coordinate the procedures in a better way.





TOIDespite lofty promises to outshine AIIMS, Cuttack’s SCB Medical College and Hospital remains trapped in decay, crippled by collapsing infrastructure, staff shortages and a trail of unfulfilled commitments.Orissa high court has repeatedly pulled up the authorities over the hospital’s deteriorating condition, raising questions about the pace and sincerity of its much-publicised upgrade.According to a professor of the institution, patient attendance is nearly twice the hospital’s bed strength. The hospital has around 2,700 functional beds, but about 4,000 patients receive treatment at any given time. Many patients are unable to get beds and end up sleeping on the floor, he added.“Many critical patients are treated in general wards instead of the ICU because the number of ICU beds is insufficient to meet demand. The patient-doctor ratio is very poor, resulting in excessive workload for doctors, nurses, and staff,” said another faculty member.Last year, water from an overflowing drain flooded the autopsy room at SCB, making it difficult to conduct post-mortem examinations. Diagnostic facilities are also inadequate to handle the volume of patients.“The govt should add more MRI, ultrasound and CT scan machines to ease the pressure on patients,” said Pradyumna Behera, an attendant of a patient from Jagatsinghpur.In response, SCB superintendent Dr Goutam Satpathy said necessary steps are being taken. “We have already communicated the issues to the health and family welfare department. An increase in bed strength and manpower, along with the completion of redevelopment work, will solve most of the issues of the hospital,” he added.SCB’s redevelopment is divided into two parts: the clinical package and the residential package. Though work on the project began on Jan 10, 2022, construction is progressing at a slow pace.The clinical package comprises four clinical blocks, two utility blocks and a town centre. It was scheduled for completion by July 9, 2024, but the deadline has been extended to Dec 2025, health minister Mukesh Mahaling informed the state assembly last year.The residential package, which includes residential units and hostels for male and female students, was originally slated for completion by Jan 9, 2024, but its deadline has already been revised twice.Dr Sudhansu Sekhar Mishra, former superintendent of SCB, stressed that infrastructure construction and maintenance must be flawless and free of corruption.“The engineers must be brought under the administrative control of the dean-principal or medical superintendent,” said Mishra.He added that procurement of all instruments, equipment, drugs, consumables and disposables should be managed by an expert committee.“The outdated system of L-1 purchase (lowest-cost bidding) should be scrapped to ensure quality,” said Mishra.Orissa high court has recently heard multiple cases related to liver transplants, bone marrow transplants, kidney transplants, shortages of manpower and the arrangement of basic amenities for patients at SCB.On April 3, 2024, SCB became the first govt hospital in the state to conduct a liver transplant. The second procedure was carried out on Sept 9, but the process was stopped thereafter following the lapse of an agreement between the state govt and a Hyderabad-based hospital.On Aug 14, the high court directed the state to conduct an assessment to determine the most suitable institute to partner with SCB for liver transplants. The govt is expected to submit a detailed progress report to the court on Sept 4.On Aug 20, the high court also directed the state to submit an affidavit detailing the steps taken regarding the alleged deaths of 125 patients who underwent kidney transplants at SCB. The directive came during the hearing of a PIL filed by a Bhubaneswar-based trust, which sought a high-level probe and compensation for the victims’ families.The court has also criticised the govt for delays in resuming bone marrow transplant (BMT) services at SCB. The dedicated BMT unit was established in Feb 2014, offering free treatment, from investigations to recovery, with all costs borne by the govt.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.
