We can't allow 31-yr-old to live like this, that's for sure, says SC

NEW DELHI: The choice is between an artificially sustained painful life and peaceful death. As a medical board of four specialised doctors told Supreme Court about the condition of 31-year-old Harish Rana who has been living with 100% disability in a permanent vegetative state for 13 years and stressed the negligible chance of his recovery, the court Thursday decided to set in motion the next stage of the process for passive euthanasia A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan asked the director of AIIMS Delhi to set up a secondary medical board, the second step as per the procedure laid down by the apex court in 2018, and simplified in 2023, on euthanasia pleas. The plea was filed by Harish's father, Ashok Rana.Going through the report of the primary medical board set up by Noida District Hospital, the bench noted there was no hope of recovery. ""The bare reading of the letter would indicate Harish is in a pathetic condition. He was found to be lying on a bed with tracheostomy tube for respiration and gastrostomy for feeding. The photographs attached with the letter would indicate he has suffered huge bed sores. The team of doctors are of the opinion that the chance of his recovery from the present state is negligible. Harish appears to be in this vegetative condition for the past 13 years.In such circumstances...we should now proceed to the next stage in the process,"" the bench said.As per the apex court's guidelines, a secondary medical board comprising one registered medical practitioner nominated by the chief medical officer (CMO) of the district and at least two subject experts with at least five years' experience in the specialty concerned has to be constituted after a primary medical board approves withdrawing artificial life support for a patient in a vegetative state. Though advocate Rashmi Nandakumar, appearing for the petitioner, said that there was no need for a secondary board as the CMO was involved in the primary medical board itself, the bench decided to adhere to the procedure.It said this would be in accordance with the decision of the SC in the 'common cause' case. ""We request the director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi to constitute a secondary board, as referred to above, and give us a report by next Wednesday, ie Dec 17. Let the matter come up for hearing on Thursday,"" the bench said.At the end of the hearing, the court remarked, ""We will have to do something now. We can't allow him to live like this. That's for sure.""Harish's case will be the first to see a court monitor the process on a euthanasia plea since SC framed guidelines and the procedure to allow it. In 2018, the court legalised passive euthanasia by allowing withdrawal of life support for terminally ill patients and ruled that the ""right to die with dignity"" is a part of the fundamental right to life.The court subsequently modified its order in 2023 to simplify the process and put in place two-tier medical board to take the call on a plea for passive euthanasia and also allowed the kin of the patient to move the high court concerned in case of denial of the same.Harish had fallen from the fourth floor of his paying guest accommodation on Aug 20, 2013, while he was pursuing a B Tech degree at Punjab University. He was treated at various hospitals, but his condition did not improve. His father had first moved Delhi HC, which refused his plea to refer the case to a primary medical board.Challenging the HC order, the father said Harish's existence in his current state is a violation of his fundamental right to dignity, and the HC had erred in not adhering to apex court guidelines.","Harish Rana, 31, has been living with 100% disability in a permanent vegetative state for 13 years. A medical board of four specialised doctors told Supreme Court about the condition of Harish. The court Thursday decided to set in motion the next stage of the process for passive euthanasia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125924630,imgsize-113124,width-400,resizemode-4/supreme-court.jpg"

'Warm And Engaging': PM Modi Holds Phone Call With Trump Amid Trade Talks, US-India Ties Discussed

PM-Trump call signals greater India-US willingness to engage

NEW DELHI: Amidst ongoing efforts by India and the US to finalise a bilateral trade deal, PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation while also discussing regional and global issues.The conversation came within a week of Modi's summit with Russian President Putin and in the middle of renewed efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war on the back of Trump's peace plan.The two sides are looking to arrive at a common understanding on issues amid indications that US is still seeking access for its farm products like corn and soybean, among other issues. The two sides have been in talks for a bilateral trade pact since March.""Had very warm and engaging conversation with President Trump. We reviewed progress in our bilateral relations and discussed regional and international developments. India and the US will continue to work together for global peace, stability and prosperity,"" Modi posted on X.PM Modi is learnt to have reiterated India's position that it will support all international efforts for peace.""Modi and Trump reviewed the steady progress in India-US bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments,"" said an Indian readout. This was the first conversation between the two since they had a call days after Diwali.Thursday's telephonic conversation signals a greater willingness on both sides to engage as there has been progress in most areas, barring trade, for which Trump has imposed 50% import duty on Indian products, comprising 25% reciprocal tariff and another 25% secondary tariffs for purchasing Russian oil and defence equipment.The move has hit several Indian exports, including textiles, leather, gems and jewellery and shrimps. While negotiators from the two sides have been engaging in a dialogue to resolve the issue, the Trump administration is yet to ease the tariffs, despite an acknowledgment by US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that the offer on the table is the best received so far.The conversation follows recent efforts by both sides to revive bilateral engagements after the trade-related impasse. US also joined India and other Quad nations in condemning the Red Fort terror incident in a Quad counter-terrorism dialogue. Both sides also separately held their own terrorism dialogue.India and US held foreign office consultations this week with a focus on key bilateral issues, including trade and investment, defence, the TRUST initiative for cooperation in critical technologies, energy, including civil nuclear collaboration, and critical minerals.According to US, the meeting was an opportunity to translate President Trump and PM Modi's vision from their Feb meeting this year into ""concrete progress that enhances US security, jobs and competitiveness, while supporting India's long-term goals"".""The Under Secretary emphasised US' aim to deepen cooperation in defense, energy, technology, space, and trusted supply chains and the value of US-India cooperation that fuels US innovation while supporting India's rise as a global technology leader,"" a US embassy spokesperson said.While the US statement did not mention the Indo-Pacific, an Indian readout said that the discussions also covered regional and global developments of mutual interest, with both sides underscoring their shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.","PM Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump spoke on Thursday, reaffirming their shared commitment to carrying forward bilateral cooperation.

NEW DELHI: Top representatives of airlines, aviation ministry and regulator DGCA will appear on Dec 17 before a parliamentary committee, which is set to question them on the days long ordeal faced by thousands of fliers due to mass-cancellation of flights by IndiGo due to its unpreparedness after a new rule for more rest for pilots kicked in.The meeting of standing committee on transport, tourism & culture headed by JDU MP Sanjay Jha is expected to pose tough questions to not only IndiGo, India's largest airline that commands 63% market share, over the fiasco but also DGCA over its inability to anticipate the crisis that derailed travel plans of people, including Parliamentarians.The committee's deliberations will happen against the backdrop of the widely held suspicion, subject of investigation by directorate general of civil aviation and the ministry, that IndiGo remained resistant to the implementation of guidelines which are consistent with global norms and are aimed at ensuring flyers' safety by allowing pilots enough resting time, and sought the determent of their implementation. It has been acccused of engineering the disruption to force, leveraging its market dominance, the ministry to roll back the Flight Duty Time Limitation regulation as implementing them would have required it to hire more pilots. Faced with chaos caused by the disruption of IndiGo's operations, DGCA had to relax the implementation of the guidelines.Airlines management is reported to have denied the allegation in the meetings with the civil aviation ministry.","The meeting of standing committee on transport, tourism & culture headed by JDU MP Sanjay Jha is expected to pose tough questions to airlines.

There were 26 lakh ineligible beneficiaries in all, of which 1,526 were govt employees who took Rs 14.5 crore. A total of 14,298 men also took money under the scheme, women & child development minister Aditi Tatkare said in a written reply in the legislative council to queries.A decision has been taken to recover the amount from govt employees and men who have availed the benefits, she said, adding the department concerned has been informed to take action under the Maharashtra Civil Service Rules and recover the amount.A total of 14,298 men received money under the Laadki Bahin scheme meant for women and that amount will be recovered from them, women and child development minister Aditi Tatkare said in a written reply in the legislative council to queries raised by MLCs Pradnya Satav, Satej Patil, Ashok Jagtap, Praveen Darekar and Niranjan Davkhare, among others.“No new eligibility norms or terms and conditions have been included under this scheme.If it is found that govt employees as well as men have availed benefits, a decision has been taken to recover the amount from them... Also, a decision has been taken in the cabinet not to forcibly recover the financial benefit amount from beneficiaries who have been excluded voluntarily or for any other reason,” Tatkare said in her reply.In July, Tatkare had said her department had undertaken scrutiny of the scheme by seeking information from all govt departments. The IT department reported that approximately 26.3 lakh beneficiaries availed of benefits despite being ineligible.“It has been found that some beneficiaries were availing benefits of multiple schemes. Some families had more than two beneficiaries. And in some cases, men applied for the scheme,” she had said on X. Since June, the benefits of the 26.3 lakh ineligible beneficiaries have been temporarily suspended. Around 2.2 crore eligible applicants received the stipend for the month of June.The Laadki Bahin scheme provides a stipend of Rs 1,500 per month to married, divorced, widowed, deserted, and destitute women, aged between 21 and 65, whose annual family income is below Rs 2.5 lakh and who are domiciled. One eligible unmarried woman from each family is also considered. The Laadki Bahin scheme was among the factors which powered the Mahayuti to a landslide win in the 2024 assembly polls.Soon after he took charge in Dec 2024, CM Fadnavis announced beneficiaries would be scrutinised. By Feb 2025, the state dropped five lakh ineligible beneficiaries. This included those who had crossed the age of 65 and beneficiaries under the Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Yojana, which also provides a monthly stipend of Rs 1,500. Beneficiaries of Laadki Bahin Yojana can avail of benefits under another govt scheme only if the combined benefit does not exceed Rs 1,500.","There were 26 lakh ineligible beneficiaries in all, of which 1,526 were govt employees who took Rs 14.5 crore.

What are the disadvantages of the Trump Gold Card?



US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) launched the ""Trump Gold Card,"" offering legal status and an eventual pathway to United States citizenship for individuals and corporations willing to make large financial contributions.Announcing the rollout on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""The United States Government’s Trump Gold Card is here today! A direct path to citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. So exciting! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!""A website accepting applications went live soon after, as Trump unveiled the program in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, joined by business leaders.Trump said the funds raised through the initiative would ""go to the US government,"" adding that the program could generate ""billions"" for the Treasury Department ""where we can do positive things for the country.""""Very excitingly for me and for the country, we've just launched the Trump Gold Card. The site goes up in about 30 minutes, and all funds go to the United States government.... It's a gift to get somebody great coming into our country, because we think there will be some tremendous people who otherwise wouldn't have been allowed to stay.They graduate from college, they have to go back to India or China or France... The companies will be very happy. The other thing is it'll take in, we think, probably billions of dollars that will go to the Treasury of the United States... Many billions of dollars, even,"" he told reporters further talking about the initiative.The Trump Gold Card is a new US visa-residency programme that costs $1 million for individual applicants. The Trump Gold Card programme effectively provides a pathway to permanent legal residency, similar to a green card but, as Trump claims, ""with big advantages.""""It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card. Companies will be able to go to any school, buy a card, and keep that person in the United States…"" Trump added.It is intended to replace the existing EB-5 investor visa programme, subject to vetting by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The card resembles a luxury credit card, featuring a gold background along with Donald Trump’s portrait, the Statue of Liberty, and the US flag, with ""Trump Gold Card"" embossed on the left.The Trump Corporate Gold Card allows companies to sponsor one or more foreign employees. Corporations must pay a non-refundable $15,000 DHS fee per employee, and the programme requires a $2 million gift per sponsored employee after vetting is completed.Companies can apply for multiple employees simultaneously.A notable benefit of the corporate version is that companies may stop sponsoring one employee and use the same previously paid $2 million contribution to sponsor a new employee without paying another gift amount.""The Trump Corporate Gold Card is subject to a small, 1% annual maintenance fee and a 5% transfer fee, which includes the cost of a new DHS background check. Small additional fees to the US Department of State may also apply depending on each employee’s circumstances, the website noted.Individual applicants must make a one-time, non-refundable $1 million gift, whereas corporate sponsors pay $2 million per employee. Both require the same DHS processing fee of $15,000.Applicants must first pay a non-refundable $15,000 DHS processing fee. Once the vetting process is complete, the required $1 million ""gift"" from an individual (or $2 million for a corporation per applicant) serves as proof that the applicant will ""substantially benefit the United States.""Additional small fees may be charged by the US Department of State depending on individual circumstances. Once an applicant’s processing fee is received, the process for petition approval and visa adjudication will take place on an expedited basis, assuming applicants submit any additional documents or fees in a timely manner.The $15,000 processing fee can be paid by credit card or ACH (US accounts only). The $1 million or $2 million contribution must be sent via ACH debit or SWIFT wire transfer after vetting.For Visa-related fees - The applicant will receive information directly from the US Department of State on how to submit the visa application fee and payments for the required medical examination.Like other American permanent residents and citizens, Trump Gold Card holders are required to pay US taxes, including on income earned outside the United States.Applicants must be eligible for lawful permanent resident status, admissible to the United States, and have a visa available under the EB-1 or EB-2 categories.Yes. Spouses and unmarried children under 21 can be included in the initial application. Each family member must pay an additional $15,000 DHS fee and a $1 million gift, with the same expedited processing benefits.""This will ensure that these family members receive all of the privileges conferred by the Gold Card Program, including expedited processing,"" the website said.Yes. Since the Trump Gold Card functions as a visa, it can be revoked on grounds of national security concerns or significant criminal activity.Here is the simplified step-by-step process, based on the details provided on the Gold Card website:The programme promises an expedited timeline, with processing expected to take a few weeks, provided applicants respond promptly to interview requests and document submissions, the website said.The upcoming Trump Platinum Card will allow individuals to live in the US for up to 270 days a year without paying US tax on non-US income, eliminating the need for additional travel visas.It is priced at $5 million, plus the $15,000 DHS fee, and has not yet been launched. A waitlist has opened, and applicants are being encouraged to secure their place early.The design for the Trump Platinum Card has not yet been revealed, but the website encourages users to join a waitlist, with applications processed on a first-come, first-served basis.The website warns that the $5 million Platinum Card contribution ""may not remain"" at the current price, leading many to join the waitlist early.""Foreign nationals can sign up now and secure their places on the waiting list for the Trump Platinum Card. When launched, and upon receipt of a $15,000 DHS processing fee and $5 million contribution, they will have the ability to spend up to 270 days in the United States without being subject to US taxes on non-US income,"" the website added.The Platinum Card cannot be obtained by anyone who has previously been subject to US tax on foreign income, such as ""US citizens or resident aliens,"" they said.The Trump Gold Card comes with several limitations that raise questions about its accessibility and long-term impact. Unlike the EB-5 system it replaces, the new programme has no job-creation requirement for investors or employers.Trump’s announcement also made no mention of annual caps, leaving uncertainty around oversight, scalability and how the scheme fits into broader US immigration policy.For businesses, the card does not guarantee lower costs. Each corporate card applies to only one employee, meaning expenses rise with every additional hire. Companies needing to retain multiple foreign-born graduates may end up paying millions.This makes the programme more suitable for wealthy individuals or well-funded corporations, offering little relief to smaller firms facing talent shortages.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) launched the ""Trump Gold Card,"" offering legal status and an eventual pathway to United States citizenship.

Mass visa chaos: H-1B families stranded in India for months after US consulates cancel interviews,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mass-visa-chaos-h-1b-families-stranded-in-india-for-months-after-us-consulates-cancel-interviews/articleshow/125910898.cms,"Trump’s Massive Visa Crackdown: 85,000 Cancellations and Social-Media Scrutiny Hit Indians

Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children — are stranded in India. In some cases, families have been separated with some members in the US and those in India facing an endless delay to fly back.The uproar is loud; the anguish is palpable across social-media posts and WhatsApp groups. Jobs may no longer exist, schools stand disrupted, children have been torn from their parents…As TOI reported in its edition of December 10, US consulates have cancelled interview slots scheduled for mid- to late-Dec 2025. Many appointments have been pushed to March next year, and some even as far back as June 2026. This sweeping disruption followed a new US Department of State (DoS) policy requiring mandatory social-media screening for all H-1B and H-4 applicants from Dec 15. The additional vetting has sharply reduced the number of interviews that can be conducted each day, triggering mass cancellations.The US Embassy in India posted on X: “If you have received an email advising that your visa appointment has been rescheduled, Mission India looks forward to assisting you on your new appointment date. Arriving on your previously scheduled appointment date will result in your being denied.”The responses reflect the crisis families are facing. One user pleaded: “Please consider those who traveled to India before the appointment changes. We are stuck here, facing serious challenges related to employment and our US-citizen kids' education. We humbly request earlier consular appointments.”Another wrote: “Booked my H-1B visa slot in Sept after weeks of trying. My Dec 18 appointment was suddenly moved to Mar 30, 2026. We must return to the US in early Jan and my US-citizen kids need to go back to school. Requesting urgent help.”Rajiv S. Khanna, managing attorney at Immigration.com, describes the situation as “brutal chaos”. He notes that while applicants may reschedule online if they cannot attend the new date, they get only one such opportunity — and fee receipts older than a year are treated as expired.Immigration attorney Ellen Freeman warns that many H-1B workers will now lose their jobs. “We have to plead with employers to let them work from India or take prolonged leave of absence for as many as five months. In this economic environment and with deliverables pressure, many employers will not be able to wait.”She points out to the real-world fallout: “People left their apartment leases, utility bills, car payments in the US. These prolonged delays will have a devastating effect on our communities and economy. There are human stories behind each visa cancellation…”Rahul Reddy, founding partner at Reddy, Neumann, Brown, cautions against holiday travel for anyone who needs visa stamping. In his blog, he warns that travellers risk being stranded abroad for four to six months. “Employers cannot keep an H-1B role vacant for half a year. Many cannot legally allow remote work from outside the US due to export-control, payroll and tax restrictions. This means one thing: if an H-1B worker travels now, they may return not to their job but to unemployment. H-4 spouses and children will face the same delays, leading to extended separations and tremendous stress.”Calling the policy shift “poorly planned” and “poorly implemented”, he adds: “You cannot claim to support legal immigration while blindsiding H-1B families with six-month delays. Labeling this as ‘operational necessity’ does not change the truth: this process reflects a lack of preparation, transparency, and foresight. Enhanced vetting is fine but rolling it out in a way that effectively shuts down consular processing is reckless. Routine visa renewals should not turn into half-year exiles.”","Hundreds of Indians on H-1B visas, along with their H-4 dependent spouses and children — are stranded in India.

NEW DELHI: Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra co‑owners of the Goa nightclub Birch by Romeo Lane, have been detained by Thai authorities in Phuket and are set to be deported to India to face investigation in connection with a deadly fire that killed 25 people last week.Indian law enforcement agencies, working through diplomatic and international policing channels, coordinated the operation after the brothers left India shortly after the blaze. A police team has already reached Thailand as the deportation process is underway.The tragedy occurred late on December 6 at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Arpora, North Goa, where a fire erupted amid a crowded event, killing 25 people, including five tourists and twenty staff. A magisterial inquiry has been ordered to determine the cause and responsibilities in the incident.Within hours of the fire, the Luthra brothers were reported to have booked and boarded an IndiGo flight to Phuket, with ticket records showing they left at about 5:30 am on December 7 - while rescue efforts were still underway.Goa Police quickly expanded the probe beyond India’s borders, issuing a lookout circular and securing an Interpol blue corner notice on December 9 to locate the duo.The ministry of external affairs (MEA) responded by suspending the Luthras’ passports on December 11, preventing further travel, and alerting Thai authorities.On December 10 brothers moved to Delhi’s Rohini court seeking four weeks of transit anticipatory bail, claiming they are willing to return to India and cooperate with the investigation into the nightclub blaze.Despite their initial plea seeking bail and claiming they had travelled to Thailand “for work,” the court declined interim relief on December 11.Police refuting the claims made by brothers told the court the brothers booked their tickets after the fire broke out and left on December 7, contrary to their assertion that they were on a business trip and had left on December 6, an action officials described as “incriminating.”Thai immigration authorities nabbed the brothers on December 11 and released pictures of brothers handcuffed at a resort in Phuket, taken into custody on the basis of requests from Indian agencies. Authorities in Thailand are now processing their deportation back to India under existing legal frameworks. India and Thailand have an extradition treaty, and the offense of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, among other charges they face, meets the criteria for surrender under the treaty terms.The investigation in India has also led to the arrest of six others connected to the nightclub’s operations. Among them is Ajay Gupta, described as an operational partner.Goa Police traced him to a private hospital in Delhi after he reportedly sought to avoid arrest by faking illness; he was subsequently taken into custody.With the Luthra brothers detained and deportation underway, Indian authorities are expected to formally take them into custody on return and proceed with the legal process. The broader inquiry continues into fire safety compliance at the club and potential lapses by operators and regulators.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co‑owners of the Goa nightclub Birch by Romeo Lane, have been detained by Thai authorities in Phuket.

NEW DELHI: Delhi court on Thursday denied transit anticipatory bail plea of Saurabh and Gaurav Luthras, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Goa where a massive fire last week killed at least 25 people.The brothers sought four weeks of transit anticipatory bail on Wednesday, seeking protection from immediate arrest after their return to Delhi from Thailand. The brothers were detained by Thai police early on Thursday at the request of Indian law enforcement agencies. According to officials, their deportation from Thailand has also been initiated.Additional Sessions Judge Vandana reserved the order till 5 pm after hearing the arguments of the advocates who appeared for the Luthras.One of the counsels for the applicants argued that they were willing to return immediately and face the investigation, and urged the court not to “punish them at the threshold”.He said the brothers had approached the Delhi court at the earliest opportunity and undertook to join the probe without delay. “If I land in India tonight and the investigating officer (IO) tells me to appear at midnight, I will be there,” he said.The counsel said that transit bail was not a determination on merits but a limited protection to ensure safe access to the right court.Also Read: Goa nightclub fire: Luthra brothers misled police - what cops told court He cited a Supreme Court order permitting an accused abroad, against whom Blue and Red Corner notices were contemplated, to return to India with temporary protection. “I only seek protection for a few days to reach the court safely.

He said the law does not aid those who refuse to submit to summons or warrants.Referring to judicial observations, the counsel said, ""Once it is shown that a person is attempting to evade the process of law, the court should not come to his aid at all.”He added that anticipatory bail is a discretionary relief and cannot be granted to those who have “created obstacles in the execution of warrants or concealed themselves”","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthras, owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Goa where a massive fire last week killed at least 25 people.

Rahul Gandhi's 'Open Challenge' To Amit Shah In Lok Sabha Over SIR Gets 'I Will Decide' Reply

Amit Shah vs Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Thursday repeated his claim that Amit Shah appeared ‘nervous’ and used ‘foul language’ during the Union home minister's Lok Sabha speech the previous day.“He (Shah) used foul language. His hands were trembling. Mentally, he is under pressure, and it was seen in Parliament. Whatever I had asked, he gave no replies and provided no proof. I challenged him openly to discuss over my press conferences, but nothing happened. Everyone now understands the reality,” Gandhi told reporters.Hitting back, BJP MP Jagdambika Pal asked why Gandhi and the opposition INDIA bloc ""ran away"" when the home minister was speaking.""Then why did he leave? People who flee, abandoning the field, the country watches them. During the two-day discussion, he (Shah) held a mirror against all the questions raised on electoral reforms and SIR... When people went to the Supreme Court against SIR, the Supreme Court also said there is no reason to stop SIR... So how long will they keep blaming the Election Commission, voter list, EVM for their defeat?"" Pal said.During his address on electoral reforms, Shah clashed with Gandhi over the Congress leader’s repeated claims of vote chori’ (theft)” by the Election Commission and the ruling BJP.The Lok Sabha leader of opposition, who has held three press conferences on the issue, challenged the home minister to a debate based on those briefings. In response, Shah remarked that the “House will not function according to his (Gandhi’s) wishes.”The heated exchange erupted when Gandhi interjected during Shah’s address in the Lok Sabha on electoral reforms. Criticising the opposition over the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls, the senior BJP leader argued that he had responses to all their accusations, including those raised in Gandhi’s three press conferences.“In his press conference, the LoP claimed the voter list is flawed and needs correction. That is exactly what SIR is — a process to clean up the rolls. Yet he opposes it. Your defeat is certain; the voter list has nothing to do with it. Double standards won’t work in a democracy. When you win, the EC is great; when you lose, the EC is biased. I have answers to all these allegations — those three press conferences included,” Shah remarked.Gandhi then interrupted and challenged him to a debate. “Yesterday, I asked why Election Commissioners were given full immunity. We want to understand the reasoning behind it. He (Amit Shah) mentioned Haryana, but there are many other examples — including 19 lakh fake voters. Let’s debate my press conferences. Amit Shah ji, I challenge you to a debate on all three,” the Rae Bareli MP asserted.Shah responded that Gandhi could not dictate the order of his speech and should remain patient. “You cannot run Parliament through obstinacy. I will decide the order of my address. The House won’t function like this. He should be patient. I will respond to every point,” he countered.Opposition MPs walked out of the Lok Sabha during Shah’s reply to the discussion on electoral reforms.","The heated exchange erupted when Gandhi interjected during Shah’s address in the Lok Sabha on electoral reforms.

What the Luthras claim

NEW DELHI: Goa Police on Thursday told the court that Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, wanted in the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub fire that killed 25 people - had “misled” investigators and shown “no cooperation” during the probe, according to statements made in court.Gaurav Luthra and Saurabh Luthra, co-owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Goa, had moved Delhi’s Rohini court seeking anticipatory bail, and the hearing continued for the second day.Opposing their anticipatory bail pleas, police said the brothers left for Phuket shortly after the December 6 blaze and inaccurately claimed they had departed India earlier than records show.“There is no cooperation on the part of Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, which disentitled them for extraordinary protection by this court. They have no business in Thailand. They left the country on December 7. Though, they said that they had left on the night of December 6. Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra misled the court, misled the authorities and left the country,” police submitted, as per ANI.Investigators told the court that both brothers, along with partner Ajay Gupta, were signatories of the club’s operations. They added that the Panchayat licence for the venue had lapsed and had not been renewed at the time of the incident.The blaze broke out during a musical night attended by nearly 100 people. Videos from minutes before the incident showed performers dancing as electric firecrackers were set off, a likely trigger. The club’s extensive flammable decor, lack of functional fire-safety equipment and a narrow access road that left fire engines stranded about 400 metres away worsened the situation.Twenty-five people, five tourists and 20 staff members, died, most from inhaling toxic smoke while trapped in the basement.Four staffers were arrested soon after the incident, while the Luthra brothers left for Thailand hours after booking their tickets as the fire was still being extinguished. Their partner Ajay Gupta was arrested in Delhi and later moved to Goa for questioning. Both Saurabh and Gaurav have since been detained in Thailand and are expected to be deported.In their bail petition, the brothers argue they are licensees, not owners, of the building, and insist they travelled to Thailand for a business meeting rather than to evade investigators. They have sought four weeks’ transit anticipatory bail to avoid immediate arrest upon arrival.The court will continue hearing their pleas as the investigation into one of Goa’s deadliest nightclub fires proceeds.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub in Goa, had moved Delhi’s Rohini court seeking anticipatory bail.

NEW DELHI: In a boost to Indo-US space cooperation, Isro will launch its heaviest American commercial communication low-earth orbit satellite, the 6.5-tonne BlueBird-6, from the Sriharikota spaceport on Dec 15. Isro’s ‘Bahubali’ rocket LVM3 will put the US satellite into orbit.AST SpaceMobile, a Texas-based company that has built the space-based cellular broadband network, said, “BlueBird-6, a US licensed satellite, is scheduled to launch on Dec 15. It is the first of AST SpaceMobile’s next-generation satellites. When launched, it will feature the largest commercial phased array in low earth orbit at nearly 2,400 sqft. This represents 3.5 times increase in size over BlueBirds 1-5 and supports ten times the data capacity. ”BlueBird-6 is a “Block-2” satellite and part of a larger plan by AST SpaceMobile to deploy a series of satellites to achieve non-continuous service, with further launches scheduled through 2026. Its aim is to bridge the “digital divide” by offering fast, unhindered direct-to-device mobile broadband service in areas with poor or non-existent terrestrial network coverage.The BlueBird satellites are designed to deliver a high amount of bandwidth, with each unit capable of up to 10,000 MHz. They operate by partnering with existing mobile network carriers to enhance their networks using licensed spectrum.The BlueBird-6 satellite arrived in India from the US on Oct 19. It was later transported by road to Sriharikota for integration with launcher LVM3, fuelling and final checks ahead of its launch.The liftoff is being handled by New Space India Limited (NSIL), Isro’s commercial wing. LVM-3 had recently put India’s heaviest CMS-3 satellite, weighing 4.4 tonnes, into its orbit on Nov 2. A three-stage launch vehicle, LVM3 rocket can carry payloads weighing up to 8,000 kg to low-Earth orbit (LEO) and 4,000 kg to geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). The human-rated version of this vehicle will fly three Indian astronauts to space, as part of the Gaganyaan mission, which is planned for 2027.","Isro will launch its heaviest American commercial communication low-earth orbit satellite, the 6.5-tonne BlueBird-6, from the Sriharikota spaceport on Dec 15.

A lullaby. A video call. A mother flying alone for the first time. Six months later, those final moments haunt Hiren Dayani, one of dozens of Gujaratis whose lives were ripped apart when Air India Flight 171 crashed seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on June 12.The fallout is pulling families back from the UK, leaving them to rebuild amid grief, mounting costs and visa troubles. At least 10 families have already returned.Hiren's mother Kailashben had been talking to him constantly from the airport, asking strangers for help with immigration through the video call. ""She would create halarda (lullaby) for my son and sing them,"" he said. ""All these memories flood back every time I think about that day."" Hiren has moved to Surat with his wife Namrata and their three-year-old son Vaastu, abandoning seven years of life in London. Namrata, a former NHS employee, has opened a clinic.Hiren Dayani, a clinical research scientist, is searching for work. ""I was months away from Indefinite Leave to Remain,"" he says. ""But everything changed.""Mike Andrews, an aviation lawyer with Beasley Allen Law Firm in US, who represents over 130 affected families, met survivors in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat.He recounted how a family in Leicester lost its main earner and could no longer stay in Wembley. The widow and her three children - 17, 18 and 20 - moved to a cheaper neighbourhood. The children quit school to work.""There has been a fundamental shift in their life trajectory,"" Andrews said. ""We've met many who moved to the UK seeking opportunities but are now returning to India because they simply cannot afford to remain.""Among them is Mobbashera Vahora. Her husband Parvez and their four-year-old daughter Zuveriya died in the crash. Parvez held a full-time job with a major e-commerce company and worked part-time with multiple delivery platforms. He supported his parents in India while trying to secure a future for his young family in East London.Mobbashera was pregnant when the crash happened. Her baby is now five months old. ""We migrated for better prospects for our children,"" she said from her brother's home. ""We dreamed of building a life there, but all of that is lost now."" With UK immigration rules tightening, she sees no path back.For Harish Godhaniya from Devbhumi Dwarka, the decision was blunt. ""I have nobody there anymore,"" he said. He lost his wife Riddhi and three-year-old son Kriyansh. ""What would I do there? We emigrated with dreams of a better life. That day took my whole world."" He has not returned to work since coming home.The immigration struggle is sharpest for Mohammadmiya Mohammadasif Shethwala from Vadodara, who lost his wife Sadikabanu - the primary visa holder - and their daughter Fatima, who was born in the UK.

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India Surya Kant on Thursday announced enforcement of a new time distribution regime to equitably allocate judicial time for poor litigants.""From January, there will be a time limit for each advocate to conclude his/her arguments. What is happening is absolutely unfair and unjustified.

CJI Kant said some cases go on for days with unending arguments from (renowned senior) advocates and poor litigants who come to court on the scheduled date of hearing of their cases have to go back home disappointed as the cases are not taken up due to time constraints.The step will redress the long-held lament that the ""rich, powerful and influential"" get ahead of other litigants by engaging high-profile lawyers and can hurt the ""stars"" among the legal fraternity who argue for hours, pushing others farther down "" you are in the queue "" list.The resultant resentment is particularly directed against certain activist lawyers and chronic PIL petitioners who are known for rushing to SC with petitions over all sundry issues. The bar has long watched with dismay the refusal of benches to instantly accommodate such petitions being made a pretext to attack judges for ""insensitivity"".Acknowledging that ""privileged"" treatment, to use the popular bar parlance, for celebrities is creating a disbalance in the justice delivery system, CJI Kant said, ""There must be an equitable distribution of time. From January, every counsel will have to file a written submission and specify the time limit within which he/she must conclude his arguments. No adjournment would be granted by any court in SC in matters posted for final hearing. ""The CJI narrated a poignant story of delayed justice. ""A poor widow fought for 23 years to get compensation for the death of her husband on railway tracks. By the time SC finally granted her Rs 8 lakh compensation, she had lost hope in the system and in frustration vanished into oblivion. It took extra effort from a young counsel to trace her. It was found that she did not have a bank account, which was opened and the money was deposited.

NEW DELHI: A court on Thursday granted 15 days' interim bail to northeast Delhi riots conspiracy accused Umar Khalid, allowing him to attend his sister's wedding later this month.Additional sessions judge Sameer Bajpai noted that Khalid had already spent five years and three months in custody since his arrest in Sept 2020 and that the plea was specifically tied to a personal and significant family occasion. ""Considering the fact that the marriage is of the real sister of the applicant, the application is allowed and the applicant is granted interim bail,"" the court said.It added that the interim relief would remain effective from Dec 16 to 29. The former JNU student will be released on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 20,000 along with two sureties of the same amount. The court also emphasised that the interim bail was being granted within a limited and clearly defined timeframe.The court observed that the temporary release would also allow Khalid to briefly reunite with his parents, besides with his elder sister and her children, who stayed abroad and were expected to attend the wedding.The order, however, imposed several conditions. Khalid has been specifically barred from contacting any witness connected with the case, from using social media in any form and from travelling to any place other than visits to his parents and immediate close relatives.Opposing the plea, the prosecution argued that ""considering the act of the applicant, they do not deserve any relief"". It also pointed out that the actual ceremonies were scheduled only between Dec 25 and 27, lasting ""three days"", and questioned the necessity of granting a 15-day relief. The court, however, proceeded to allow the full period sought by Khalid.This is not the first instance in which the former JNU scholar has received limited-duration bail for family functions. Last Dec, he was granted interim bail for seven days to attend a wedding in his family.

The alleged incident happened in 2023.The court said if the IRS officer's plea is allowed, then it would cause several procedural and psychological barriers for the aggrieved woman, and create a situation where the woman would have to appear before the ICC at an alien workplace to pursue her remedy in law. SC, however, made it clear the action against the erring employee can be taken only by his department as per its rule on the basis of the report prepared by the ICC of the aggrieved woman's workplace.""The taboo around sexual harassment at workplace and the fear of stigma, which may be attached to the aggrieved woman as a consequence of a complaint regarding sexual harassment, already poses a massive psychological barrier for the aggrieved women, which actively dissuades them from pursuing their remedy in law."" ""In such view of the matter also, the intent of the legislature behind giving such a wide meaning to the word 'workplace' to go beyond the bounds of the traditional meaning implying location of office, cannot be brushed aside by narrow construction of other provisions of the POSH Act.

NEW DELHI: Textiles, apparel and hospitality could generate the strongest job growth by 2030, driven by higher investment in these sectors, according to a new report by economic policy think tank NCAER, which also called for measures to remove bottlenecks for faster expansion.Moderate growth in manufacturing and services output could raise jobs in textiles, garments and related industries by 53%, and employment in trade, hotels and similar services by 79% by 2030.

The latest report, released last month, analysed six indicators including fatalities and economic loss due to extreme weather events during 1995-2024, showing that India reported a loss of more than 80,000 lives and nearly $170 billion in 430 extreme weather events in past three decades.""A wide range of estimates exist regarding the economic losses and damages caused by climate impacts to the Indian economy.However, isolating climate component of total losses due to extreme weather events continues to remain a challenge,"" the ministry said.Similarly, in response to a question on India's global position in IQAir World Air Quality Ranking, WHO Global Air Quality Database & others, the ministry dismissed such a ranking saying the ""worldwide ranking of cities for pollution levels is not being conducted by official authority"". Noting that the WHO air quality guidelines serve as ""only a guidance document"", the ministry said the countries prepare their air quality standards based on geography, environmental factors, background levels, socio-economic status and national circumstance. It said the ministry conducts its own 'Swachh Vayu Survekshan' annually and felicitates better performing cities on national clean air day (Sept 7).","Environment ministry made the country's stand over such global ranking clear through written responses to two different questions in RS on Thursday.

'PM Modi Hacks Hearts, Not EVM': Kangana Ranaut Lambasts Rahul Gandhi During SIR Debate In Lok Sabha

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday said SIR of electoral rolls, being carried out after more than two decades, cannot be a copy-paste of earlier voter lists and, logically, the voter enumeration by the Election Commission would include an inquisitorial process to ascertain, not determine, citizenship.Senior advocate Raju Ramachandran, appearing for a petitioner challenging the validity of SIR process, said voter enumeration exercise cannot begin with distrust on part of EC to test citizenship of every voter, especially when the statutory task to determine citizenship, upon receipt of a complaint about a foreigner, is vested with other authorities.A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, ""EC is constitutionally vested with the power of superintendence of elections, which would include ensuring that only Indian citizens are registered as voters. Would it mean that EC must await a complaint, or undertake an inquisitorial exercise to determine who are doubtful voters? It is better to conduct a summary inquiry rather than await a complaint.""Ramachandran said the SIR for Bihar, according to EC, was necessitated for two reasons - mass migration and rapid urbanisation. ""Reason for Bihar SIR cannot be reason for conducting pan-India SIR as different states have different demography and ground situation relating to electoral rolls,"" he said, adding EC failed to provide detailed reasons for conducting such an exercise.This was the second time when SC had justified updation of poll rolls through SIR. The bench said in the June 24 notification, giving the two reasons for conducting SIR, gives out an intention to carry out pan-India SIR with Bihar as the starting point. ""Migration encompasses both inter-state and cross-border movement of population mainly for economic reasons. For some people across the border, Indian cities are economically more viable. While from India, talented people are migrating to other countries. For citing migration as a reason for SIR, no statistics or research is required,"" it said.Ramachandran said that states like Chhattisgarh and MP, which are going to polls in 2028, are included in SIR exercise, while other states where elections are due in future have been excluded. ""Whole process is arbitrary,"" he added. The arguments would continue on Tuesday.","Supreme Court says SIR of electoral rolls cannot be a copy-paste of earlier voter lists.

Supreme Court rejects plea to suspend Sanjiv Bhatt's 20-yr jail term in '96 drug-planting case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-rejects-plea-to-suspend-sanjiv-bhatts-20-yr-jail-term-in-96-drug-planting-case/articleshow/125920839.cms,"The Supreme Court has denied former IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt's plea to suspend his 20-year jail sentence in a 1996 drug planting case. Bhatt, convicted by a Gujarat court, sought bail but the bench declined his request. The case involves allegations of framing a lawyer in Palanpur, with Bhatt accused of planting drugs to settle a property dispute.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday declined to suspend the 20-year jail sentence of former IPS officer Sanjiv Bhatt in a 1996 drug planting case.Bhatt was convicted by a Gujarat court last year under various provisions of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and the IPC. He moved SC for suspension of sentence to get bail, but a bench Justices J K Maheshwari and Vijay Bishnoi declined to entertain his plea.This NDPS Act case pertained to the arrest of a Rajasthan-based lawyer, Sumer Rajpurohit, in 1996 by the Banaskantha Police following alleged recovery of drugs from his hotel room in Palanpur. Bhatt was then serving as DSP of Palanpur.Rajpurohit, who was discharged, later accused Bhatt and other cops of planting drugs to frame him. The same was done only to harass the lawyer with regard to a property dispute, it was alleged.Last year, the former IPS officer had approached SC seeking transfer of trial in the 28-year-old drug case to another sessions court alleging bias. He also sought directions for recording of the trial court proceedings.However, SC dismissed the plea and imposed Rs 3 lakh cost on him for alleging bias against the judge conducting trial in the drug planting case.","Bhatt was convicted by a Gujarat court last year under various provisions of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and the IPC.

Benchmark indices traded in a range with corrective bias and is currently placed around 25,900 levels as domestic markets tracked the global risk-off tone, pressured by persistent FII selling, a softer rupee, and ongoing uncertainty around US–India trade talks. In the short term, market direction will hinge on central bank commentary and clarity on trade-related developments.In the near term, market trajectory is likely to be dictated by currency stabilization dynamics, especially whether the rupee can find a durable floor. Moreover, clarity on evolving India–US trade negotiations could influence sector-specific outlooks, particularly in export-linked and tariff-sensitive industries.Nifty has key support placed at 25,700–25,800, which aligns with the bullish gap from November 12, the 50-day EMA, and a key retracement zone of the prior uptrend. Sustaining this band will be crucial for continuing the positive momentum of the last 3 months.We expect the Nifty to consolidate in the range of 25,700–26,200. A clear breakout or breakdown will determine the next directional move.A close below the key support area of 25,700 will signal extension of the corrective decline towards the 100 days EMA placed around 25400 levels.On the higher side, a move above the recent swing high of 26,200 will signal extension of the rally towards 26,500 levels in the coming weeks.Bank Nifty traded in a range, digesting its recent strong gains. The index consolidated in a 700-points range oscillating in a positive and negative territory.We expect the index to extend consolidation and form a base in the range of 58500-60100 in the coming sessions.A follow-through strength above recent high 60,100 will open further upside towards 61,000 levels in the coming weeks.The entire up move of the last 2 months is well channelled signaling sustained demand at elevated levels. Key support is placed at 58,300-58,600 levels being the confluence of the last two weeks lows and recent breakout area. Holding above the support area will keep the short-term bias positive.Eternal has been in a corrective phase over the past two to three months and is now consolidating around a major demand zone. This technical setup points to a favorable risk-reward profile, suggesting the potential for a bullish reversal and a rebound from its current oversold levels.The current corrective phase seems to be losing momentum, with price action hinting at a possible rebound toward the ₹323 area in the coming months. This zone aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the entire drop from ₹368 to ₹280 and also matches the November 2025 high, strengthening its significance as a major resistance level.The stock is at the cusp of generating a breakout above a falling channel signaling resumption of up move thus offers fresh entry opportunity.The stock has already taken 6 weeks to retrace just 50% of its preceding 5 weeks rally (5636-6904). A shallow retracement signals a higher base formation and an overall positive structure.We expect the stock to head towards 6850 levels being the trendline resistance joining the highs of July and November 2025.","According to Bajaj Broking Research, the top stocks to buy for December 12, 2025 are Eternal, and Divi's Laboratories.

NEW DELHI: Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra — co-owners of the fire-ravaged ‘Birch by Romeo Lane’ nightclub in Goa — were picked up by Thai police from Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, days after they fled India on an IndiGo flight as 25 people lay dead in the blaze at their club.The brothers became 'persona non grata' in Thailand after their passports were suspended by the regional passport office in Delhi. Their travel documents were declared invalid soon after they failed to respond to a notice seeking reasons why action should not be taken against them. The cancellation eased the execution of India’s request for their detention, officials said.A team of Thai police tracked them down using passport and travel details, seized their belongings, and shifted them to the immigration detention centre. Photos released by Phuket police on Thursday showed the duo handcuffed. They are likely to remain in custody until their deportation.Indian agencies hope to bring the brothers back by the end of the week, though the process could slow down if documentation is not completed by Friday due to the approaching weekend and non-working days.An Emergency Travel Certificate will have to be issued by the Indian embassy in Bangkok, and the brothers may be moved to the Thai capital for the paperwork.A team from Goa has already reached Phuket to coordinate the process. Goa DGP Alok Kumar said deportation will take “at least four days”. Goa CM Pramod Sawant said a police escort team will be sent to Thailand and reiterated that the duo will be arrested upon arrival.Since there is no direct flight from Thailand to Goa, the Luthras will first be flown to Delhi and then taken to Goa.According to Goa police, the Luthras purchased tickets for a Phuket-bound flight at 1.17am on December 7, even as firefighters were battling the inferno at their Arpora nightclub. By 5.30am, they were airborne on IndiGo flight 6E-1073.Later that morning, a Goa police team reached Delhi with an arrest warrant and searched the brothers’ residence and offices, but they were missing. Notices were pasted at their home, and by evening, a lookout circular had been issued. Interpol followed with a blue corner notice.The blaze — triggered, investigators believe, when electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling during an event attended by over 150 tourists — broke out around 11.45pm on December 6. While many escaped, several were trapped in the basement after the exit caught fire.So far, police have arrested partner Ajay Gupta (55) and five staff members:India and Thailand’s extradition treaty, in force since 2015, is aiding the process, officials said.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra are co-owners of the fire-ravaged ‘Birch by Romeo Lane’ nightclub in Goa.

Rising combined wealth and how their earnings continue to expand each year

Properties, assets and lifestyle choices that continue drawing attention

The growing interest around John Cena and Shay Shariatzadeh’s financial journey has intensified in 2025 as new reports highlight their rising net worth, expanding properties, and steadily increasing earnings, creating wider curiosity about how their individual careers continue shaping their shared financial path. Together, their lifestyle reflects a balance between high earnings, stable investments, and carefully chosen luxury, allowing them to maintain comfort without relying on constant public display or extravagant change. Let’s take a look at where the power couple stands in today's situation.Fresh evaluations for 2025 suggest that John Cena holds a personal net worth close to $80 million, supported by his long wrestling career, expanding Hollywood roles and multiple commercial partnerships that continue generating consistent income for him across different categories of the entertainment industry.Shay Shariatzadeh, on the other hand, contributes an estimated $2 million, which comes from her engineering work, strategic career moves, and selective investments that reflect a steady approach rather than a public lifestyle focused on expensive displays or high-profile spending choices.Together, their combined worth reaches nearly $82 million, showing how their financial paths complement one another through two very different professional worlds that still manage to work in harmony.Cena’s earnings remain anchored by an annual WWE salary reportedly around $8.5 million, supported by bonuses linked to special appearances and merchandise sales that continue performing strongly across global markets due to his long-standing popularity.John Cena’s well-known Florida property, purchased many years ago for roughly $525,000, has grown significantly in value and now sits near $4 million, featuring spacious interiors, multiple recreational spaces and design upgrades that reflect his preference for calm surroundings rather than extravagant display.The extravagent home includes an indoor pool, outdoor pool, cigar room, extended garage, and a guest area, allowing him a private retreat while balancing entertainment commitments and travel schedules across Hollywood and wrestling venues. Cena also owns a residence in San Diego valued within the high-end category, although he maintains a low-key approach toward detailing the property publicly, which matches the couple’s gradually shifting preference for privacy.Shay Shariatzadeh, while less public about real estate, aligns her lifestyle with practical investments and career growth, showing a contrast to Cena’s entertainment-driven earnings but still contributing meaningfully to their shared financial foundation through consistent professional progress.Also Read: John Cena to still be affiliated with WWE after retirement?

Her name is linked to former coach Sherrone Moore's firing and police detainment due to alleged inappropriate relationship rumors. Shiver's recent significant salary increase and social media silence have fueled speculation amid the ongoing investigation.

Paige Shiver’s rising salary, estimated net worth, and why the timing has fueled public curiosity

The University of Michigan football program is facing its most turbulent moment in years, and at the center of the storm is executive assistant Paige Shiver, an employee who until recently maintained a low public profile. Interest around Shiver has surged after her name became entangled in online speculation connected to the firing and police detainment of former head coach Sherrone Moore.While no university official has identified the staff member involved in the alleged inappropriate relationship, searches such as “Sherrone Moore assistant” and “who did Sherrone Moore have a relationship with” have driven Shiver into the national spotlight. Her sudden social media silence and a significant salary increase have added new layers to a story that continues to unfold.Public payroll filings show that Paige Shiver’s salary held steady at $58,025 for two years before climbing to $90,000 for the 2024–25 fiscal cycle, a 55.11% jump that many observers viewed as unusually steep for an executive assistant role. Based on her salary history, limited public records, and the absence of additional disclosed income streams, Shiver’s estimated net worth likely falls in the $150,000 to $200,000 range.As online rumors intensified, Shiver reportedly “switched her Instagram account to private,” a move that social media users interpreted as a sign of the pressure surrounding her. Yet there is no confirmed link between the pay hike and the university’s investigation, and officials have not named her in any formal capacity. Still, the scrutiny grew louder as Moore’s professional downfall accelerated.Sherrone Moore, who became a rising coaching star after stepping in during Jim Harbaugh’s suspension and later leading Michigan to major wins, was abruptly dismissed after allegations surfaced of an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.His situation escalated further when “Ex-Michigan coach Sherrone Moore was detained by police in Saline, Mich. this evening and turned over to police in Pittsfield Township for investigation into potential charges,” according to ESPN’s Pete Thamel via Dan Wetzel.With Biff Poggi appointed interim head coach and speculation swirling around the future of the Wolverines’ program, Paige Shiver’s name remains tied to one of the most chaotic weeks in Michigan football history, even as the facts remain unsettled and the investigation ongoing.Also Read: Why Sherrone Moore ended up in police custody amid Michigan firing him for alleged ‘inappropriate relationship’ scandal","Paige Shiver is an executive assistant at the University of Michigan.

GOA: The return of Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of Goa’s ‘Birch by Romeo Lane’ nightclub, could face delays primarily because their passports have been cancelled.Detained by Thai police in Phuket on Thursday at the request of Indian authorities after fleeing India following the nightclub fire that claimed 25 lives, the brothers will require an Emergency Travel Certificate from the Indian Embassy to facilitate their deportation.Sources said they may be taken to Bangkok to complete the process, and if the documentation is not completed by Friday, the deportation could be further delayed due to the weekend and non-working days.A team has already been sent to Phuket to coordinate the deportation.Meanwhile, a court on Thursday denied their transit anticipatory bail, noting that the “nature of offence, prima facie, is grave and serious” and highlighting the loss of 25 lives.The court also rejected the brothers’ claims of immediate threat to their lives and dismissed old medical records submitted to show seizure disorder and hypertension, observing that the conditions were not a barrier to travel or business.As pointed out by Goa Police, the nightclub was being operated on a trade licence issued by a panchayat, which expired in 2023.Another factor was the flight tickets booked on Dec 7 at 1.17am, “just five hours after the Goa accident”, despite the claim that the brothers had left India on Dec 6 for “scheduled business meetings”.The court treated this as “concealment of a material fact”. The state submitted that when police reached the Luthras’ Delhi residence with an arrest warrant, their mother refused to disclose their whereabouts.The court said the applicants had also failed to show as in why they didn’t approach “the competent court having territorial jurisdiction in Goa”, despite being admittedly in Thailand’s Phuket for now.Represented by senior advocates Abhinav Mukerji and Atul Srivastav, the state of Goa had argued that the brothers had “deliberately fled India” and could not seek protection while evading investigation. “Once it is shown that a person is attempting to evade the process of law, the court should not come to his aid at all,” the state said.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of Goa’s ‘Birch by Romeo Lane’ nightclub, could face delays primarily because their passports have been cancelled.

Where Metaverse budget cuts may go

Wall Street says: We are with you on this

Meta reportedly delays MR glasses

The day Facebook changed its name to Meta

To build the Metaverse'





Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to have finally realised that one of the company's biggest bets—Metaverse—is not working (or not working as expected). It is also the technology that the company changed its very name after. In 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus changed its name to Meta. Now according to a report from Bloomberg, Meta is likely to slash its Reality Labs budget, shaving off as much as 30%. The proposed metaverse cuts are reportedly part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound in Hawaii last month.For those unaware, Metaverse unit works on virtual reality headsets and a VR-based social network, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community.Analysts see the move reflecting the overall lack of interest in products like Meta’s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware—both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse vision has posted more than $70 billion in losses over the past four years. Little doubt then that Facebook parent's shares rose 4% as the move eased some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars. ""Smart move, just late,"" told Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber to Bloomberg. He added, ""This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought years ago. ""So, what may really be troubling Metaverse? No one can really pinpoint. But as a report in Fortune says, for many people, the problem is that the value proposition is unclear; Metaverse simply doesn’t yet deliver a must-have reason to ditch their smartphones or laptops.Reality Labs is made up of a Metaverse unit and a wearables unit. Within the Metaverse unit, executives are reportedly considering making cuts to VR jobs. As the report says, cuts in resources that high are most likely to include layoffs as early as January.The report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta has committed as much as $72 billion in capital spending this year. The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, with Zuckerberg said to be personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp with million-dollar pay packages. In fact, Meta's big hiring is said to have triggered a talent war in the Silicon Valley.Last month, Meta Platforms said that it will invest $600 billion in the US infrastructure and jobs over the next three years, including artificial intelligence data centers. Meta has doubled down on AI, with a target of achieving superintelligence. Zuckerberg said Meta is building compute because ""it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load capacity so we're prepared for the most optimistic cases,"" on the company's recent earnings call. Meta has forecast ""notably larger"" capital expenses next year thanks to investments in artificial intelligence, including aggressively building data centers to power its AI push.Incidentally, earlier this week, Zuckerberg announced that Alan Dye, a longtime designer at Apple, is joining Meta to lead a new creative studio inside the Reality Labs division that would focus on design, fashion and technology. Dye will report to Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, who leads Reality Labs. “We’re entering a new era where A.I. glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post to Threads. “With this new studio, we’re focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.”Wall Street sent a clear signal to Meta Platforms that it wants the company to reduce spending on Reality Labs.

Meta Platforms shares jumped 3.4% on reports that the company was cutting Metaverse spending in favor of AI and smart glasses.Meta has reportedly delayed the launch of its Mixed Reality Glasses (MR Glasses) from the second half of 2026 to the first half of 2027.

Facebook’s corporate entity became Meta. Mark Zuckerberg announced the change at the company’s AR/VR-focused Connect event, sharing that the new title captured more of the company’s core ambition: '. Analysts saw name change as the right move, as Instagram was -- and continues to be -- more valuable than Facebook. Along with WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, the four apps are known as Meta's Family of Apps. The name change to Meta Platforms is also said to have reflected an increased emphasis on engaging through virtual worlds. Incidentally, the name change to Meta from Facebook was followed by a sharp decline in company's stock price, which fell 64.2% in 2022 compared to a 33.1% decrease in the Nasdaq that year.","Reality Labs, Meta's virtual reality unit, could be cut by as much as 30%.

Jamie Dimon the CEO of America’s biggest banks JPMorgan and Chase has now warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation. This in turn is creating risks not only for the continent but also for the United States. As reported by Bloomberg, speaking at the Reagan National Defence Forum, Dimon said, “Europe has a real problem. They do some wonderful things on their safety nets. But they’ve driven business out, they’ve driven investment out, they’ve driven innovation out. It’s kind of coming back.”Along with this, Dimon has also cautioned that a fragmented Europe is one of the biggest challenges faced by the world. Earlier this year, in his annual shareholders letter, Dimon noted that Europe has “serious issues to fix.” While praising the creation of the euro and Europe’s pursuit of peace, Dimon warned that reduced military efforts and difficulties in reaching consensus within the European Union threaten the continent’s stability.“If they fragment, then you can say that America first will not be around anymore. It will hurt us more than anybody else because they are a major ally in every single way, including common values, which are really important,” he said, urging Washington to adopt a long-term strategy to strengthen Europe.“A weak Europe is bad for us.”The comments made by Dimon clings with recent announcement made by JPMorgan to funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next decade — $500 billion more than previously planned.The initiative will mainly focus on supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence and resilience and also frontier and strategic technologies.Along with this, JPMorgan will also invest up to $10 billion of its own capital to enable combines expand and innovate in strategic manufacturing.Separately, Dimon commended President Trump’s efforts to cut government bureaucracy. “There is no question that this administration is trying to bring an axe to some of the bureaucracy that held back America. That is a good thing and we can do it and still keep the world safe, for safe food and safe banks and all the stuff like that,” he said.","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation.

TCS HR chief Sudeep Kunnumal on layoffs in future





Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar has now informed that the state legislative council that around 376 employees of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were laid off at the company’s Pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year. The disclosure was made via a hand written reply during the Vidhan Parishad session, after concerns were raised by members over reports of widespread layoffs in the IT sector.Fundkar further clarified that the layoffs were not linked to artificial intelligence or automation, addressing speculation that job losses were part of a broader restructuring driven by new technologies. In the Vidhan Parishad, Fundkar revealed that the company fired 376 employees from its Pune campus and the round of layoffs mainly impacted middle and senior-level managers.As reported by new agency PTI, during the Question Hour, the legislators including Uma Khare and Prasad Lad raised questions about increasing job losses in the technology sector and the impact of AI adoption on employment. The reply by the minister is sought to provide transparency by citing official data received directly from TCS.The Maharashtra government also stressed in the fact that while the layoffs have occurred, they are not on the scale suggested by media reports of mass layoffs across multiple cities.The minister further assured the council that the government is monitoring developments in the IT sector closely, given its importance to employment and state’s economy.Recently, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant. Speaking during the company’s Q2 earnings call earlier this month, Kunnumal said that TCS is not “chasing a target” when it comes to job cuts. Instead, the IT firm said it will evaluate “everyone”.During the earnings call, analyst Surendra Goyal from Citi asked: “The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal replied to the question saying: “So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition. So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”",Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) laid off 376 employees from its Pune campus.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Rough November for Elon Musk's Tesla: US sales sink to nearly 4-year low; cheaper EV versions fail to spark demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/rough-november-for-elon-musks-tesla-us-sales-sink-to-nearly-4-year-low-cheaper-ev-versions-fail-to-spark-demand/articleshow/125925496.cms,"‘Standard’ models fail to attract buyers



Dealing with backlash



Tesla’s latest attempt to revive demand in the United States faltered in November, with the company posting its weakest monthly sales in nearly four years, despite rolling out cheaper versions of its most popular electric vehicles. Exclusive figures shared with Cox Automotive, cited by Reuters show that US sales fell to about 39,800 units, a sharp drop from 51,513 a year earlier and the lowest level since January 2022.The decline comes at a critical time for Tesla, which relies on its new budget “Standard” versions of the Model Y and Model 3 to attract customers. Introduced in October, priced roughly $5,000 below the earlier base models, the lower-cost options were expected to soften the blow of the Trump administration’s decision to scrap the $7,500 EV tax credit at the end of September.At the same time, the company is also focusing on robotaxis and humanoid robots, projects that have helped sustain its $1.4 trillion market value.The cheaper models have, however, not delivered the anticipated boost. According to Cox, which tracks industry-wide sales, November’s total fell nearly 23% year-on-year. Analysts say the drop suggests the new variants have not attracted enough incremental buyers.“The drop certainly shows there is not enough demand for the Standard variants that were supposed to boost sales after the tax credit expiry,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox’s director of industry insights.“What’s also happening is Standard sales are cannibalizing into sales of Premium versions, especially the Model 3.”Most electric carmakers saw an even steeper impact from the end of federal credits, with overall US EV sales sliding more than 41% in November. A notable detail is that Tesla, despite its own slump, was able to grow its market share to 56.7% from 43.1% a year earlier.Tesla’s slowdown extends a broader trend: deliveries fell last year for the first time after a run of rapid growth, pressured by high interest rates, subdued consumer sentiment and increasing competition, particularly from cheaper models in China and Europe. Analysts expect another fall this year, with Tesla’s lineup largely limited to older models and minor updates. Its most recent new product, the Cybertruck, has struggled to find a sizeable customer base.“Tesla has a serious challenge on its hands next year when several other automakers are planning to roll out cheaper vehicles that are also full of fun features,” Streaty said. “So the answer is that Tesla needs a completely new vehicle in its fleet. Period.”The company has also been dealing with reputational setbacks linked to CEO Elon Musk’s political activities, including his work for US President Donald Trump and far-right statements that have triggered protests and affected its image.To entice buyers, Tesla has begun offering 0% financing on the Standard Model Y, according to its US website. Both the Standard Model Y and Standard Model 3 were also listed in inventory with reduced prices. Analysts say the move underscores the pressure to stimulate demand.“I think the bottom line is, if the demand was there they wouldn't be offering 0% financing,” Shawn Campbell, an adviser at Camelthorn Investments told Reuters.“The solution for the demand issue ultimately needs to be new, fresh models.”","US sales fell to about 39,800 units, a sharp drop from 51,513 a year earlier. The decline comes at a critical time for Tesla, which relies on its new budget ‘Standard’ versions of the Model Y and Model 3 to attract customers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125925557,imgsize-342112,width-400,resizemode-4/tesla.jpg"
Sperm from donor with cancer-causing gene used to conceive around 200 kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/sperm-from-donor-with-cancer-causing-gene-used-to-conceive-around-200-kids/articleshow/125900798.cms,"-





COPENHAGEN: A sperm donor, who is an asymptomatic carrier of a genetic mutation increasing the risk of cancer, was used to conceive at least 197 children worldwide, Denmark’s public broadcaster DR revealed Wednesday. Between 2006 and 2022, the sperm of anonymous Danish man (using the alias Kjeld) was sold to 67 clinics in 14 countries. In Denmark alone, 99 children were fathered by the donor.According to DR, Denmark’s European Sperm Bank (ESB), one of the largest in the world, was alerted in April 2020 that a child conceived via donation and diagnosed with cancer carried a genetic mutation. ESB then tested a sample of the donor’s sperm, but the screening did not detect the rare TP53 mutation. Sales of the sperm, which had been suspended during the testing period, then resumed.

It then tested several samples, which showed that the donor carried the gene, though he was healthy. The use of his sperm was blocked in 2023. “The specific mutation is a rare and previously non-described TP53 mutation that is only found in a small part of the donor’s sperm cells and not in the rest of the body,” the ESB said.","Sperm of anonymous Danish man sold to 67 clinics in 14 countries.

Being a coercive partner has a cost. And this poster is worth a thousand words,"" she said.""You do not get a Nobel Peace Prize by driving US strategic partners into the arms of our adversaries,"" Dove said in a pointed attack at Trump's demands for the peace prize for what he has repeatedly claimed for having stopped eight wars, including India and Pakistan.""We must move with incredible urgency to mitigate the damage that this administration has done to the US-India partnership and return to the cooperation that is essential to US prosperity, security, and global leadership,"" she added.These comments were delivered during the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on South and Central Asia’s hearing on 'The US-India Strategic Partnership: Securing a Free and Open Indo-Pacific'.Trump has already slapped 50% tariffs on most Indian exports in August 2025 amid wider trade tensions and worries over India’s imports of Russian oil.A US trade delegation was in India on December 10–11 for discussions that have so far made little headway. The talks have been bogged down by disputes over market access and tariff policies, further straining the trade relationship.","A recent carpooling picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin found a place at US Congress discussion on India-US ties.
