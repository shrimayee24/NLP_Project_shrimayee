Operation name and two women send powerful message,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-name-and-two-women-send-powerful-message/articleshow/120979869.cms,"NEW DELHI: The symbols sent as powerful a message as the substance of India's precision strikes.Pahalgam's terrorists thought they were sending a message when they murdered husbands in front of their wives, after selecting victims by their religion.

Pak's military-intelligence-jihadi complex would have been among the first to note the image put out by Indian Army right after GOI's confirmation of the strikes - Operation Sindoor in block letters, with the first 'O' represented by a bowl of vermillion.But even more powerful symbolism was to come. Two women armed forces officers helmed the military side of India's official briefing. One, Colonel Sofiya Qureshi , is a Muslim, the other, Wing Commander Vyomika Singh , a Hindu. Here was GOI's answer to Pahalgam terrorists who murdered only Hindus and thought they were sowing seeds of social strife - Muslims and Hindus fight together for India.Col Qureshi, from Vadodara, is a third-generation Army officer from her family. A decorated officer, her postings include six years in UN peacekeeping ops. Wing Commander Singh, also a decorated officer, is from Lucknow.

Message to world: Strikes were in line with UNSC call to punish terrorists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/message-to-world-strikes-were-in-line-with-unsc-call-to-punish-terrorists/articleshow/120976295.cms,"Message to world: Strikes were in line with UNSC call to punish terrorists

NEW DELHI: Operation Sindoor was in line with the UNSC statement last month underlining the need to bring the perpetrators and the backers of the Pahalgam attack - which was marked by extreme barbarity - to justice and intended to deter more such planned attacks on Indian soil by Pakistan-based terrorist modules , the govt said in a message to the international community.Describing India's military strikes as non-escalatory, responsible, measured and proportionate, foreign secretary Vikram Misri said there was clear evidence to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam attack, including communication nodes of terrorists ""in and to Pakistan"".According to Misri, The Resistance Front (TRF), which claimed responsibility for Pahalgam, was nothing but a front for UN-proscribed Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), and India's intelligence has developed an accurate picture of the planners and backers of this team.""India exercised its right to respond and pre-empt, as well as deter more such cross-border attacks. India's actions focused on dismantling the terrorist infrastructure and disabling terrorists likely to be sent across to India,"" said Misri, briefing the media about India's move to defang Pakistan's terror factory with military strikes on LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) headquarters.Also read: How India-wide civil defence exercise unfolded Misri said even after two weeks of the attack, there was no demonstrable step by Pakistan against its terrorist infrastructure on its territory or in POK. ""Our intelligence monitoring of Pakistan-based terrorist modules indicated that further attacks against India were impending. There was thus a compulsion both to deter and to pre-empt,"" he said.Recalling that TRF had claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack, Misri said India twice last year brought out its role before a UN committee as a cover for Pakistan-based terrorist groups. ""Earlier too, in Dec 2023, India had informed the monitoring team (1267 Sanctions Committee) about LeT and JeM operating through small terror groups such as TRF. Pakistan's pressure to remove references to TRF in the April 25 UN Security Council Press Statement is notable in this regard,"" said Misri. As reported by TOI on April 27, Pakistan had worked with China to water down that statement.Investigations into Pahalgam brought out the communication nodes of terrorists in and to Pakistan, Misri said.""The claims made by TRF and their reposting by known social media handles of LeT speak for themselves. Identification of the attackers, based on eyewitness accounts, as well as other information available to law enforcement agencies, has also progressed,"" said Misri, adding that the motive behind the Pahalgam attack was to undermine the normalcy and tourism returning to Kashmir Valley. ""The calculation, presumably, was that harming growth and development in the Union territory would help keep it backward and create fertile ground for continued cross-border terrorism from Pakistan,"" he said.Misri also said the manner of the Pahalgam attack was driven by an objective of provoking communal discord, both in J&K and the rest of India. ""It is to the credit of govt and the people of India that these designs were foiled,"" he said.Govt also said the features of the Pahalgam attack were in keeping with Pakistan's long track record of perpetrating cross-border terror in India, while underscoring Pakistan's duplicity in its handling of terrorism under pressure from the international community. Misri recalled how Pakistan had misled the FATF to get off its grey list and the Mumbai attacks accused Sajid Mir case in which the accused was declared dead, and then, in response to international pressure, brought back to life, found alive and arrested.""Pakistan also has a well-deserved reputation as a haven for terrorists from around the world, with internationally proscribed terrorists enjoying impunity there. In addition, Pakistan has been known to wilfully mislead the world and international forums,such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), on this issue,"" said the official.","Operation Sindoor was in line with the UNSC statement last month underlining the need to bring the perpetrators and the backers of the Pahalgam attack to justice.

Strikes steel PM Modi's iron man credentials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/strikes-steel-pm-modis-iron-man-credentials/articleshow/120975650.cms,"NEW DELHI: Two days after the Pahalgam terror attack , Narendra Modi gave a speech in Madhubani, Bihar. He vowed to ""identify, track and punish every terrorist and his backer"". In a speech given what turned out to be just hours before Operation Sindoor was launched, he struck a very different note. He touched upon Pakistan's perfidy, but limited himself to talking about pausing the Indus Waters Treaty That's Modi for you. Little did anyone know that before coming to Tuesday's event organised by a TV network, he had greenlighted the operation. With hindsight, his decision to record his speech for the Global Conference on Space Exploration on Wednesday morning showed he had already decided on the date for the retaliation.It's easy to say now for everyone that a PM who greenlighted surgical strikes after Uri and the bombing of Balakot terror camp after Pulwama was always going to give an answer to Pahalgam. But in the two weeks between Pahalgam and Operation Sindoor, there were many, including opposition leaders, who questioned whether he would okay a kinetic response. More so because pretty much every world leader of any consequence was advising 'restraint'.But not for the first time, Modi upended several people's assumptions. This is the third time he's called Pakistan's nuclear bluff, and the third time he's shown that the earlier Indian govt thinking, summed up in the euphemism 'strategic restraint', was never going to constrain his decisions.Modi was undeterred by pundits' concerns that a desperate Pak army chief, Gen Asim Munir, the maulvi in fatigues, could go to any extent to counter a punitive strike. He also proved wrong those who had reckoned that with the Indian armed forces already stretched thin since the Galwan clash with Chinese forces, and given the fear of China's communist bosses coming to the aid of their all-weather ally Pakistan, he would rein in his natural instinct to hit back harder.The precision strikes, while exposing Pakistan's nuclear blackmail for what it is, plain blackmail, helped him fully regain the 'jo kaha so kiya' plank and ' tough on national security ' credentials.The Pahalgam attack, though an aberration considering the successful tackling of terror both within J&K and outside it, had cast a shadow on those credentials. Daily taunts from opposition leaders had demonstrated their willingness to target what they saw as a chink in Modi's armour. The absence of a decisive Indian response would have allowed opposition leaders to take that rhetoric further. The anti-BJP political narrative would have been centered around what the opposition would have termed as Modi's inability to live up to his own belief that India must cross the 'red line' in response to a Pak-sponsored terror outrage.The nine precision strikes have washed away all doubt and with it, the opposition's story. Modi has again ensured that BJP retains the upper hand in security matters. The decision to share videos of the successful strikes involving 'niche' munitions was astute and left little room for quibble.More significantly, Modi also appears to have prepared the country for the longer haul vis-a-vis security threats, boosting its risk appetite: something that was evident in the manner in which people shrugged off Pakistan's claims of losses for IAF and, also, in the way stock markets took the risk of escalation in their stride.This is vital. The task of making India's economy stronger - itself a vital national security advantage - won't be any less urgent even after massively raising Pakistan's cost of terror sponsorship. Modi will helm that job as a PM with even bigger political capital.","Two days after the Pahalgam terror attack, Narendra Modi gave a speech in Madhubani, Bihar.

NEW DELHI: It is rare for PM Narendra Modi to send recorded messages. Equipped with impressive oratorical skills, he prefers to go ""live"". Yet, his decision to record his message for the Global Conference on Space Exploration on Wednesday, which had promised to be a normal day, suggests he had settled on May 6-7 as the date to avenge the mass killings of tourists in J&K's Pahalgam.The address, which was recorded on Tuesday, was played on Wednesday hours after India struck multiple targets in Pakistan and POK, and when the govt and the defence brass were reviewing the success and making preparations for possible retaliation by Pakistan.While recording the speech, Modi dropped no hint of the impending strike. ""India's space journey is not about racing others. It is about reaching higher together. Together, we share a common goal to explore space for the good of humanity,"" the PM said calmly, even when his mind may have been occupied with plans presented to him by the leaders of the armed forces.The PM also spoke about India's strides in the space sector, from launching a small rocket in 1963 to becoming the first nation to land near the south pole of the Moon. ""Our rockets carry more than payloads. They carry the dreams of 1.4 billion Indians. India's achievements are significant scientific milestones.

BENGALURU: SkyStriker suicide drones designed to locate, acquire and strike operator-designated targets with a warhead installed in the fuselage were part of Operation Sindoor early Wednesday, vindicating the Indian Army's decision to add these unmanned aerial vehicles - "" loitering munitions "" in military parlance - to its arsenal post-Balakot.Sources confirmed to TOI that an unspecified number of these suicide drones were manufactured in an industrial estate in western Bengaluru as part of a joint venture involving Bengaluru-headquartered Alpha Design and Israel's Elbit Security Systems. The Army had placed an emergency procurement order in 2021 for 100-odd SkyStrikers.With a range of 100km, each suicide drone is an autonomous system carrying a 5kg or 10kg warhead. Its electric propulsion offers a minimal acoustic signature, allowing covert operations at low altitude.Alpha Design's CMD, Colonel (retd) HS Shankar, declined to comment on reports about SkyStrikers playing a role in Operation Sindoor, targeting terrorist infrastructure at several locations in Pakistan. ""Such queries must only be referred to the govt authorities,"" he added.SkyStriker is touted as a cost-effective loitering munition while being capable of long-range precision strikes. The drone improves performance, situational awareness and survivability by providing direct-fire aerial-precision capabilities to manoeuvrable troops and special forces.Elbit, in a description of the drone, says the SkyStriker flies like a UAS (unmanned aircraft system) and strikes like a missile. ""As a silent, invisible, and surprise attacker, SkyStriker delivers the utmost in precision and reliability, providing a critical advantage in the modern battlefield.""While seek-and-destroy missions remain central to military strategy, but newer technologies like loitering munitions have transformed sensor-to-shooter operations.","Bengaluru-made ‘suicide drones’ make debut with Operation Sindoor.

He was arrested but had to be released as part of the swap of passengers of Indian Airlines plane IC-814, which was hijacked by his younger brother Abdul Rauf Azhar and others.The imprisonment did not dampen his zeal for jihad.

Notorious nine: Why India hit them,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/notorious-nine-why-india-hit-them/articleshow/120977456.cms,"A dozen terror strikes, including Pulwama, plotted at Bahawalpur

NEW DELHI: Of the nine targets struck by India early Wednesday, Lashkar-e-Taiba 's base in Muridke and Jaish-e-Muhammed's Markaz Subhan Allah in Bahawalpur were the most important. Unabashed protection of Pakistan's army and ISI was the reason Muridke and Bahawalpur thrived as terror sanctuaries with seeming impunity for decades.Located in Pakistan's Punjab province, the very base of the country's military-intelligence complex, the two seminaries, inspired by hardline versions of Ahl-e-Hadith and Deoband schools of thought, seemed impregnable. Until Tuesday when the Indian Army and IAF hit them with precision strikes.The Markaz, sprawling over 15 acres, has been JeM's primary hub for training and indoctrination of jihadis. It was where Maulana Masood Azhar, after sliding under the radar for nearly two years following international pressure on ISI, resurfaced on Nov 30, 2024. In his speech to JeM members, he reiterated his unrelenting hostility towards India, vowing revenge for the construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya at the site of Babri Masjid.His comeback event was attended by key figures, including younger brother Maulana Talha Saif and son Mohammad Abdullah Bin Masood.India had dealt the first major blow to a terror seminary in 2019, when it attacked Jaish camps in Balakot - regarded as the ""first launchpad for jihad"" by Syed Ahmed Barelvi - to avenge the killing of 40 CRPF troopers in Pulwama. The fear generated by India's air strikes then appeared to have worn thin, encouraging Jaish to resume its terror campaign. LeT, though chastened for a while after a mysterious terror attack near the residence of its founder Hafiz Saeed , had also stepped up its attacks.Located on NH-5 (Karachi-Torkham Highway) in Bahawalpur (Punjab province), the Markaz served as the operational headquarters of JeM. Over a dozen significant terror strikes, including the 2019 Pulwama attack, were planned here. The perpetrators of the Pulwama attack had even trained at this facility which has been home to over 600 cadres and hosted regular training sessions for JeM members. The intelligence dossier shared with various foreign govts said the Markaz was constructed with the support of Pakistan's provincial and federal govts, supplemented by funds raised by JeM. The complex boasts modern facilities, including a gymnasium and swimming pool for underwater training to terrorists besides a stable.Muridke's Markaz Taiba, LeT's main training hub, was no less important as a strategic objective. Located in Nangal Sahdan, the 82-acre complex houses a madrassa, a market, residential quarters for operatives, sports facilities, a fish farm and fields, making it a self-sustaining terror training facility. Al Qaida chief Osama bin Laden had contributed Pakistani Rs 10 million for construction of a mosque and a guest house within the Markaz Taiba complex.The complex served as a multipurpose facility for LeT, offering training in arms and physical combat, as well as 'dawah' and indoctrination programmes for terrorists from Pakistan and abroad. The perpetrators of the 26/11 attack, including Ajmal Kasab, were imparted 'Daura-e-Ribat' (training in collecting intelligence) at this facility which was even visited by David Coleman Headley. Annually, around 1,000 students enrol in various courses. The facility also hosted periodic training sessions for LeT's top leadership.Another big name on India's target list was JeM's Syedna Bilal Markaz in Muzaffarabad in POK. This facility was used as a transit camp for JeM terrorists before they were launched into J&K. At any point of time, 50-100 cadres resided in this facility. Specialised training was provided by Pakistan's Special Service Group, an elite wing to which former dictator Pervez Musharraf belonged. JeM's operational commander and head of PKK Mufti Asghar Khan Kashmiri is in-charge of the facility that also operates as the base for digging of cross-border tunnels for infiltration of terrorists.Among other targets hit by India, Sarjal and Tehra Kalan served as JeM's primary launchpad in Pakistan's Punjab, operating from inside a primary health centre and facilitating cross-border tunnel digging and drone operations for arms and narcotics smuggling. Mehmoona Joya, a Hizbul Mujahideen facility in Sialkot, was also concealed inside a health unit. It provided weapons training, besides coordinating terrorist infiltration into Jammu under Irfan Tanda.Additionally, an LeT camp in Barnala (PoK), Markaz Ahle Hadith, with a capacity for 100-150 cadres, was reduced to ashes. JeM's Markaz Abbas in Kotli, headed by NIA-wanted Qari Zarar, planned terror strikes and coordinated infiltration into Poonch and Rajouri sectors. Hizbul Mujahideen's Markaz Raheel Shahid in Kotli trained terrorists in Border Action Team operations and sniping attacks.","Of the nine targets struck by India early Wednesday, Lashkar-e-Taiba's base in Muridke and Jaish's Markaz Subhan Allah in Bahawalpur were the most important. The Markaz, sprawling over 15 acres, has been JeM's primary hub for training and indoctrination of jihadis. A dozen significant terror strikes, including the 2019 Pulwama attack, were planned here.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120977532,imgsize-1730141,width-400,resizemode-4/Notorious-nine-Why-India-hit-them.jpg"

Growing up in school, I went through employment news where an advertisement left me sad as it read that only unmarried male candidates could become pilots,"" said Wg Cdr Singh.But that spark in the early 1990s ignited a journey that would see her soar to extraordinary heights.""During my final year of engineering, I got to know that women can become pilots by taking a competitive examination for short service commission via UPSC. I cleared the pilot course in the academy, was awarded the wings, and became a helicopter pilot. After that, I never looked back. It was a rollercoaster experience, especially as being a helicopter pilot I would take on a variety of roles. I've flown from sea level to heights of 18,000 feet,"" she added.""I have done a lot of casualty evacuation and made decisions of leaving one person and taking another and then coming back the next day while negotiating with the weather,"" said Wg Cdr Singh.","Wing Commander Vyomika Singh, ""daughter of the sky"" as her name means, stood tall at a high-profile briefing to national and international media from New Delhi.

The first two lines of service are at the squadron level. The third line of service, requiring a slightly higher degree of repair work, is available at various base repair depots (BRDs). A retired IAF officer said that during peacetime, aircraft needing the fourth or fifth line of service are sent to HAL as there's time to get them back. But in emergency situations, IAF does not have such luxury. And therefore, it is general practice to have back-up staff on their toes.HAL handles the Su-30 and the MiG fleets in Nasik, while all European platforms of fixed wing fighters (Mirage & Jaguar) are handled in Bengaluru. All the choppers are repaired at Helicopter complex in Bengaluru.

(Pic credit: PTI)

NEW DELHI: The civil defence drill on Wednesday - held as per directions of the office of DG, Fire Services, Civil Defence and Home Guards, which comes under the home ministry - received an overwhelming response, with its scope expanding from the earmarked 244 civil defence (CD) districts/towns to nearly 350 districts, and nearly 15 lakh stakeholders including civil administration staff, volunteers, auxiliary forces, NDRF and state/UT police, besides the general public, coming together to test and enforce safety measures like blackouts, air-raid sirens and evacuation amid a simulated warlike setting.A home ministry source said the drill successfully saw the enforcement of blackouts, with people voluntarily putting their lights out or 'blackening' their windows with cloth or paper upon activation of the sirens. ""Reports from Bihar said people stopped their cars on NH-31 and switched off headlights to enforce the blackout,"" an officer said. ""There was total blackout in all areas where the drill was undertaken,"" the officer added, citing videos received from across the country.The original plan was to conduct the civil defence drill in 244 CD districts. However, the coverage was voluntarily expanded by states, with UP, for one, conducting the drill across all its 85 districts. ""What was most heartening is the public enthusiasm to join in the drill. In fact, many members of the public have offered to become civil defence volunteers,"" an officer said and added that state/UT chief secretaries were asked to hire them.There were some gaps that were identified in the civil defence set-up in certain parts; for instance, the air siren could not be sounded in many places. ""This may be as it has been long since the 1971 war, when the sirens were last used. Also, the districts and cities have expanded,"" said an officer, adding that these districts will be mapped and emergency provisions invoked for purchasing the necessary equipment.""We have identified the gaps in the civil defence set-up, thanks to Wednesday's drills,"" said the officer. For instance, a source said, at Delhi airport, which has both civilian and military operations, the coordination could have been better with more participation of senior people. This is crucial as military targets are seen as more prone to being targeted in a hostile aerial action. This will be corrected as part of follow-up action, it was learnt.As regards the civil defence exercise on the western border, particularly as it came hours after Indian forces hit terror targets in PoK and Pakistan, sources said the situation had anyway changed to a real emergency scenario there, particularly with heavy shelling in some border areas.","Nearly 15 lakh stakeholders including civil administration staff, volunteers, auxiliary forces, NDRF and state/UT police, besides the general public, came together to test and enforce safety measures.

How and where to get a REAL ID



In-person applications

REAL ID applications must typically be completed in person. Applicants must bring:

Proof of identity (e.g., birth certificate or passport)

Proof of Social Security number

Two proofs of residency (e.g., utility bill, lease agreement)

As the May 7, 2025, deadline for REAL ID enforcement approaches, millions of Americans are rushing to obtain compliant identification cards. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will soon require travelers to present a REAL ID or other federally accepted identification at airport security checkpoints. However, this urgency has triggered a sharp rise in online scams designed to exploit consumers. From fake websites to phishing texts and misleading social media posts, fraudsters are targeting those who may be unfamiliar with the application process or anxious about the impending deadline. These fraudulent schemes aim to steal personal and financial data under the guise of providing expedited REAL ID services.Cybercriminals have launched a variety of fake websites that mimic state DMV portals. These sites request sensitive personal data under the pretense of processing REAL ID applications. Some also charge illegitimate processing fees or redirect users to malicious links.Spoofed emails often accompany these scams. They may contain official-looking logos and language to appear legitimate, asking recipients to “verify” their identity or “complete” their application with a payment of around $35 for so-called “expedited” processing.Phishing text messages have also emerged, with messages instructing users to click on links to apply for or confirm their REAL ID. These messages typically contain shortened URLs and pressure language like “Immediate Action Required.”On social media platforms, scammers have posted advertisements or comments promoting fake REAL ID services.

This prevents any new credit accounts from being opened in their name.Anyone who believes their identity has been stolen should visit identitytheft.gov. This federal resource walks users through the steps of creating a recovery plan and filing reports with the appropriate agencies.Regularly checking bank and credit card statements can help detect fraudulent activity early. Setting up transaction alerts is also recommended.The REAL ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005 in response to security concerns following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It establishes minimum security standards for the issuance of state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards. A REAL ID-compliant card will be required to:REAL IDs are marked with a star at the top of the card.

A legacy beyond sexual identity

Barry Diller , the media mogul behind the creation of the Fox Broadcasting Company and former CEO of Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox, publicly came out as gay in a deeply personal essay published in New York magazine on May 6, 2025. The announcement arrives after decades of speculation surrounding his sexuality, especially in light of his decades-long relationship—and eventual marriage—with renowned fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg.Now 83 years old, Diller’s revelation marks a significant personal milestone, but also underscores broader historical contexts around sexuality, power, and visibility in the media and fashion industries.His coming out not only clarifies longstanding public curiosity but also contributes to an evolving dialogue about late-in-life LGBTQ+ disclosures among prominent figures who came of age in less accepting eras.Barry Diller was born on February 2, 1942, in San Francisco, California. He began his media career in the mailroom at the William Morris Agency but quickly ascended through the entertainment world. By the 1970s, he had made his mark as chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures, where he greenlit landmark films such as Saturday Night Fever, Grease, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. In the 1980s, he transitioned to 20th Century Fox, where he is credited with launching the Fox network, introducing hit shows like The Simpsons and Married... with Children, and reshaping primetime television.Diller’s visionary leadership earned him immense wealth and prestige. However, despite his public visibility and relationships with industry elites, his personal life remained largely private—fueling persistent speculation about his sexuality.Diller first encountered Diane von Fürstenberg in 1974 at a party at the historic Dakota building in New York City. At the time, Diane was married to Austrian Prince Egon von Fürstenberg, and Diller was already a rising executive at Paramount. Their initial interaction was unremarkable; Diller later recalled that Diane “looked through him like cellophane,” and he left the event expecting never to see her again.Nine months later, their paths crossed again during a dinner party hosted by Diane for a mutual friend, famed Hollywood agent Sue Mengers. By this time, Diane had separated from her husband, and her dynamic with Diller changed significantly. That night, they connected on a personal level, eventually beginning an on-again, off-again relationship that would span decades. Their bond, while unconventional, proved emotionally and romantically meaningful, culminating in their marriage in 2001.In his essay, Diller acknowledges that he has always been attracted to men and had relationships with them, including during his early years. As a teenager in West Hollywood, he experienced his first forays into gay culture, including visiting Fire Island Pines, a known LGBTQ+ haven. However, overwhelmed by the openness and freedom he saw there, he fled in fear—an action emblematic of the internal conflict he experienced for decades.Diller detailed how, during the 1960s and 70s, the fear of professional repercussions kept him from living openly. As his career flourished, he felt compelled to compartmentalize his personal life, stating that he would “dart in and out” of gay bars through side doors and hide his identity behind the protective facade of a public heterosexual relationship. His wealth and status, while granting access to elite spaces, also intensified the pressure to conform.The Diller–von Fürstenberg marriage has long been the subject of public speculation. Critics and gossip columnists have at times dismissed the union as a calculated move to quiet rumors about Diller’s sexuality. However, in his op-ed, Diller refutes this narrative, affirming that their relationship was both romantic and sexually intimate, particularly during its early years.He recalls gifting Diane 29 diamonds for her 29th birthday, delivered humorously in a Band-Aid box. He also recounts a moment of intimacy at music mogul David Geffen’s home, where the couple was inadvertently interrupted. Diller emphasized that while there were “a good many men” in his life, Diane was the only woman he ever truly loved. Their emotional connection, he said, has always been genuine and enduring.Diller’s revelation has drawn comparisons with David Geffen, another prominent entertainment executive who came out as gay in 1992. Like Diller, Geffen dated women in his early life—including Cher—before acknowledging his true orientation. The two men’s trajectories highlight the pressures faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in high-powered, conservative industries, particularly during the pre-AIDS and AIDS-era years when fear and stigma were widespread.Diller’s confession also follows a recent wave of older public figures coming out later in life, offering a lens into generational differences in acceptance and self-perception.Throughout his essay, Diller reflects on the emotional toll of living a double life. While his wealth and career accomplishments afforded him a luxurious lifestyle—with residences in New York, Los Angeles, Aspen, and Connecticut—his internal life, he admitted, often felt “arid.” The inability to fully express his identity left him feeling alienated, even as he enjoyed global acclaim and influence.He did not frame his choice to remain closeted as denial, but rather as a survival tactic in an era where being openly gay could jeopardize one’s professional future. “I wouldn’t do a single thing to make anyone believe I wasn’t living a heterosexual life,” he wrote. This strategic repression, though effective in protecting his career, exacted a significant emotional price.Diller’s announcement has generated widespread media coverage and a flurry of responses from both the entertainment and fashion worlds. While many have applauded his bravery and transparency, others have viewed the timing—coming so late in his life—with mixed curiosity. Nevertheless, the overarching response has been one of support and recognition of the complexities tied to coming out, especially for individuals who lived much of their lives in less accepting environments.Diane von Fürstenberg has not yet publicly commented on the essay, but throughout the years, she has remained by Diller’s side, both personally and professionally. The two have often appeared at galas and charity events together, and their enduring bond remains one of mutual respect and admiration.Though this revelation marks a turning point in Diller’s personal narrative, it does not define his legacy. His contributions to American media are vast—spanning television, film, and digital ventures. He played a key role in launching IAC (InterActiveCorp), an internet company that owns properties like Expedia, Match.com, and Vimeo, further cementing his reputation as a forward-thinking business leader.Diller’s ability to anticipate cultural trends and embrace technological shifts has made him one of the most influential figures in modern media history. His personal story now adds another layer of complexity to a legacy already rich with innovation and resilience.","Barry Diller came out as gay in a deeply personal essay published in New York magazine on May 6, 2025.

Power Moves with Shaquille O'Neal | Official Trailer | Netflix

Shaquille O’Neal and Allen Iverson are teaming up for a new Netflix docuseries. The NBA legends are leading Reebok’s return to relevance, and their bold, behind-the-scenes journey will be front and center in the new Netflix docuseries Power Moves, premiering globally on June 4, 2025. While the trailer already got traction among basketball fans and sneakerheads, the team-up of the duo makes the show highly anticipated.This six-part series, produced by Shaquille O’Neal’s own Jersey Legends (a division of Authentic Studios) in collaboration with The Intellectual Property Corporation, promises to be more than just another sports documentary. It’s a close-up look at the real-time transformation of Reebok, from a fading athletic brand to a revived cultural force. Viewers will follow Shaq and Iverson— now President and Vice President of Reebok Basketball— as they reshape the future of the company from its Boston headquarters, with the goal of making it a staple in sports and streetwear once again.“Power Moves isn’t just about sneakers or titles. It’s about showing the work behind building something meaningful,” said O’Neal. “This series shows the strategy, setbacks, and wins of what it really takes to lead a brand you love. Reebok gave me my start, and now I get to help write its next chapter.”The company signed O’Neal as a rookie in 1992, launching one of the most iconic athlete-brand partnerships in NBA history. Iverson followed in 1996, with his signature ""Question"" and ""Answer"" lines becoming staples of basketball culture. Now, nearly three decades later, both are at the helm as Reebok eyes a serious comeback.“There's a powerful shift happening at Reebok right now, and Power Moves lets the world experience it with us,” said Reebok CEO Todd Krinsky (via Deadline). “This isn't just a comeback, it's a cultural movement, fueled by purpose, passion, and the kind of leadership that inspires real change.”The series will also explore Reebok's new direction in the athlete space, including key moments like signing WNBA star Angel Reese to the brand’s first NIL deal under O’Neal’s leadership. From creative brainstorms and product development to high-stakes pitches and court-side appearances, Power Moves offers viewers unfiltered access to a legacy brand in transition.Executive Producer Colin Smeeton, President of Authentic Studios, described the show as a raw look at what revival really looks like. “This series pulls back the curtain and shows the heart, the chaos, and the creativity behind this comeback. It’s not just about basketball or business— it’s about Shaquille and Allen doing it their way.”Also Read: “DELETE THIS S*IT” — Stephen A Smith’s hilarious reaction while cheering for New York Knicks backfired, as fans turned it into a series of memes With its roots in the '80s and '90s sneaker wars, Reebok was once a serious rival to Nike.

That changed when Authentic Brands Group took over in 2021.","Shaquille O’Neal and Allen Iverson are teaming up for a new Netflix docuseries. The NBA legends are leading Reebok’s return to relevance.

Britain's Indian-origin former home secretary Priti Patel on Wednesday backed India's right to self-defence after Indian armed forces struck nine terrorist sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) under Operation Sindoor as retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack.Speaking in the United Kingdom's House of Commons, Patel also recalled how Osama Bin Laden was found living in Pakistan.""Mr Speaker, this is clearly a precarious moment and we want to see tensions ease between India and Pakistan. We want to avoid a state-on-state military escalation. We're also clear that India has the right to take reasonable and proportionate steps to defend itself and to dismantle the vile terrorist infrastructure that has caused death and continues to threaten them. And we know that terrorists based in Pakistan threaten India and Western interests,"" Patel said.""It (Pakistan) was the country that Osama bin Laden was hiding in. And because of the long history of violence inflicted by terrorists on India, the UK has in place longstanding security cooperation agreements with India. And in fact, last weekend, this House reminded the government of those long-standing security agreements, why they exist and why they should matter to us here in the UK,"" she added.Further, the Conservative MP remarked that Pahalgam had joined the list of Indian cities such as Mumbai and New Delhi, which had been ""scarred by acts of terrorism.""""This was an act of terrorism and we must reflect on the fact that Pahalgam has joined Mumbai, New Delhi and other places in India that will be forever scarred by an act of terror,"" Patel stated.The ex-home secretary also called for more active UK involvement and urged the Labour government to work with allies to counter global terrorism.""Given these links, the UK government should be at the forefront of working with our friends and allies to tackle the terrorist threats that we face collectively. Has the government provided any specific security assistance to India in the aftermath of the terrorist attack in Kashmir? Could Britain offer specific support that might help avert escalation?,"" Patel askedPatel called on the British government to leverage its influence to ease tensions between India and Pakistan. She also asked for an update in the actions that would be taken by the government to prevent the escalation of tensions.Besides Patel, fellow Conservative MP and UK's former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has also expressed support for India's anti-terror strikes, saying its action in striking terror infrastructure is ""justified.""",Former UK home secretary Priti Patel backs India's right to self-defence.

Bank of England may cut interest rates by 0.25% amid tariff tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bank-of-england-may-cut-interest-rates-by-0-25-amid-tariff-tensions/articleshow/120981811.cms,"AP File Photo

The Bank of England is expected to lower its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point on Thursday, bringing it down to 4.25%, amid fears of US President Donald Trump’s planned tariffs hitting global economic growth, including Britain’s.The decision is due at 11:02 GMT, two minutes later than usual to honour a moment of silence for the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. The US Federal Reserve, on Wednesday, opted to hold borrowing costs steady, while the European Central Bank cut rates last month to stimulate the eurozone economy.Markets are already anticipating the rate cut, however, will be closely looking out for any changes in the language used by the central bank’s monetary policy committee, which could indicate further rate reductions later in the year.Enrique Diaz-Alvarez, chief economist at global financial services group Ebury, said, “While the Bank of England is universally expected to cut (on Thursday)... the key to the reaction in the pound will be the bank's accompanying communications.”He also said the bank would likely lower its forecasts for both inflation and economic growth in 2025, and may warn that US tariffs could slow down the UK economy and reduce inflation.Britain is currently bracing for 10% tariffs on most of its goods exported to the US, its second-largest trading partner after the EU. The new levies are part of a broader wave of trade tensions that have already pushed oil prices down, further easing inflation expectations.BoE governor Andrew Bailey has warned that the tariffs could still be a blow to the UK economy even if Britain escapes the harshest duties. London is engaged in talks with Washington over a post-Brexit trade deal that could see tariffs softened in exchange for adjustments to the UK's digital services tax on US tech giants.The Bank of England last altered interest rates in March, when it held steady at 4.5% after three cuts in the previous seven months, as the UK economy continued to wrestle with a weak growth","The Bank of England is expected to lower its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point on Thursday.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Fed holds rates, warns of uncertainty





President Donald Trump has said that he will reveal details of a major new trade deal at a press conference scheduled for 10.00am tomorrow (local time) in the Oval Office. In a post on Truth Social, Trump described the agreement as involving representatives of a “big, and highly respected, country,” and called it “the first of many. ”""Big News Conference tomorrow morning at 10:00 A.M., The Oval Office, concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY,"" Trump said in his post.The timing of the announcement also coincides with the start of US-China talks in Switzerland, the first formal dialogue since the trade war escalated. Yet Trump remains adamant that the US is not seeking talks from a position of weakness. “They said we initiated [the talks]? I think they ought to go back and study their files,” he said in response to Chinese claims.While Trump has not yet disclosed the name of the country involved, the announcement comes amid renewed tensions over trade, particularly with China. “We were losing a trillion dollars a year, now we’re not losing anything,” he said earlier this week, ruling out any reduction in tariffs for now.Uncertainty remains over how any new trade deal might be structured. Trump has suggested that his administration has been approached by nearly all major trading partners with potential agreements, but he insists any final deal must serve American interests first. “We could sign 25 deals tomorrow if we wanted,” he said, adding that tariffs remain a tool he’s willing to keep using to leverage better terms.The US Federal Reserve has held interest rates steady, keeping its benchmark rate between 4.25% and 4.50%, amid rising concerns over inflation and employment pressures. The pause, announced Wednesday, comes as the economic impact of President Donald Trump’s sweeping new tariffs continues to unfold. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited “a great deal of uncertainty” around the administration’s trade policies, which have led to volatility in financial markets and warnings from analysts of higher inflation and unemployment.Trump’s tariffs, including steep levies on Chinese goods and 10% duties on imports from other nations, have shaken investor confidence and raised concerns over future economic growth. While hard data shows the economy has remained resilient, softer indicators point to declining consumer confidence and expectations of rising inflation.The Fed faces a delicate balancing act as it monitors these developments. Despite public criticism from Trump urging rate cuts, Powell insisted the Fed remains focused solely on economic data. Analysts now expect any rate cuts to be delayed, with some predicting the first adjustment in September.Adding to the economic uncertainty is Trump's proposal for 100% tariffs on foreign films. While unlikely to materialise, the idea underscores wider industry turmoil. Hollywood, long anchored in Los Angeles, is losing ground to international production hubs offering generous tax incentives. With filming in LA at historic lows, California officials are pushing to expand state tax credits to keep production local, though competition from abroad continues to grow.","Trump to announce details of major new trade deal at 10.00am tomorrow.

Pakistan to increase defence spending by 18% in budget amid tensions with India over Pahalgam attack: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-increase-defence-spending-by-18-in-budget-amid-tensions-with-india-over-pahalgam-attack-report/articleshow/120929027.cms,"File photo: AP





The Pakistan government is set to increase its defence spending by 18% to over Rs 2.5 trillion in the upcoming budget amid rising tensions with India over Pahalgam terror attack, the Express Tribune reported.The government is slated to present the 2025-26 budget in the first week of next month, ahead of the new fiscal year commencing on July 1. Meanwhile, tensions between the two nations have escalated following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed 26 lives.""However, there was a consensus between the PML-N and the PPP to increase the defense budget due to the recent wave of tensions with India, said the sources. They said that the PPP backed the proposal to increase the defense budget by 18% to over Rs2.5 trillion in the light of the prevailing security threats,"" the Pakistani news website said.Meanwhile, Pakistani troops on Monday night violated the ceasefire for the 12th consecutive time attracting proportionate response from Indian Army. ""During the night of May 5-6, Pakistan Army initiated unprovoked small-arms fire across the LoC in areas opposite Kupwara, Baramulla, Poonch, Rajouri, Mendhar, Naushera, Sunderbani, and Akhnoor.The Indian Army responded promptly and proportionately,"" said a defence spokesperson in Jammu.Following the attack, India on April 23 announced a series of punitive measures against Pakistan, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, closure of the sole operational land border at Attari, and downgrading of diplomatic ties, citing cross-border links to the attack.In retaliation, Pakistan closed its airspace to Indian airlines and suspended all trade with India, including via third countries. Meanwhile, Pakistan carried out back-to-back missile tests, successfully launching the 'Fatah series' surface-to-surface missile with a 120-kilometre range on Monday, following Saturday’s successful training launch of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a 450-kilometre range.","The government is slated to present the 2025-26 budget in the first week of next month, ahead of the new fiscal year commencing on July 1.

Prolonged tension to hurt Pakistan's economy: Moody's,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/prolonged-tension-to-hurt-pak-eco-moodys/articleshow/120913945.cms,"



NEW DELHI: A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability, Moody's Rating warned on Monday. In contrast, it does not expect a significant impact on India, apart from higher defence spending weighing on govt's fiscal consolidation plan.Pakistan was on the brink of bankruptcy until the International Monetary Fund bailed it out once again, provided it met several conditions. Its credit rating, Caa2+ according to Moody's, is speculative grade, signalling its weak fundamentals.""Pakistan's macroeconomic conditions have been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflation declining and foreign-exchange reserves increasing, amid continued progress in the IMF programme. A persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan's access to external financing and pressure its foreign-exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years,"" Moody's said.Apart from assistance from multilateral agencies, including IMF and the World Bank, Pakistan had also managed to roll over debt from Saudi Arabia, China and UAE to tide over the foreign exchange and debt crisis.The weak sentiments are also reflected in stock market indices. Pakistan's benchmark KSE-100 index fell another 635 points on May 5. Since April 23, the index has lost over 7,500 points, or 6% due to fears of a conflict.Indian markets have, however, held up. ""Comparatively, the macroeconomic conditions in India would be stable, bolstered by moderating but still high levels of growth, amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption. In a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India's economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan (less than 0.5% of India's total exports in 2024),"" Moody's said.Moody's is not budgeting for a broad-based military conflict. ""Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses. We assume that flare-ups will occur periodically... but that they will not lead to an outright military conflict.""","A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability.
