J&K headed for winter of discontent? It will depend on Lt Guv’s playbook,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-headed-for-winter-of-discontent-it-will-depend-on-lt-guvs-playbook/articleshow/114061300.cms,"NEW DELHI: The J&K LG will, prima facie, have the same powers as the Delhi LG , and also control prisons, which come under the state govt in Delhi. Observers are not ruling out recurrent strain in working ties between the LG and the elected govt — a common occurrence in Delhi — over several issues.Perhaps the first indication that the Centre was ready for assembly polls in Jammu & Kashmir came when it amended the Transaction of Business of the Govt of Union Territory of J&K on July 12, 2024, to make it mandatory for all decisions relating to postings and transfers of secretary-level officers, appointment of law officers, grant or refusal of prosecution sanction and prison-related matters, to be put up to the lieutenant governor (LG) for approval, through the chief secretary.The amendments — which the Centre had said it was authorised to notify as per provisions of the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019 — enhance LG’s powers by making his approval necessary for postings and transfers of secretaries of all J&K administrative departments and cadre-post officers.While this is a signifi-cant power as the LG can decide the heads of various J&K departments, a source said the transfers and postings of the subordinate staff, which total nearly five lakh, will continue to be in the hands of the J&K govt.The J&K LG will, prima facie, have the same powers as the Delhi LG, in that he shall have the final word on matters relating to J&K police, including its various wings like CID, and SIA as well as the J&K anti-corruption bureau (ACB). Over and above these powers, all files on matters relating to prisons, directorate of prosecution and forensic science laboratories, as well as appointment of law officers, will need to be routed to LG through the chief secretary or the chief minister.The LG also enjoys the sole discretion to appoint the five nominated MLAs in the J&K assembly.Police matters, law and order as well as control of the security grid will remain exclusively with LG, who will continue to head the Unified Headquarters. This means that the LG will be chairing all the counter-terror strategy meetings and sessions with heads of Army, central paramilitary forces, central and state intelligence agencies, and J&K police.This leaves no scope for the incoming elected dispensation to interfere with or tone down the security offensive, which has been focused on pro-active engagements with terrorists, choking terror financing through investigations and actions by the NIA and SIA and dismantling the terror ecosystem by denying benefits like passports and govt jobs to local overground workers (OGWs) and terror supporters/sympathisers.Any opposition by the J&K govt to tough terror actions against locals could make it prone to attacks by BJP. Congress, as the national player in the J&K coalition, may particularly find it tricky to ward off such attacks as it strikes a balance between regional interests of NC, its major partner, and maintaining its nationalist credentials.What observers are not ruling out is the recurrent strain in working ties between the LG and J&K dispensation — a common occurrence in Delhi that follows the same model of governance — over what the latter may project as law and order and counter-terror ‘slip ups’, besides the transfer and postings of preferred bureaucrats. But eventually, both sides may learn to live and govern with disagreements from time to time.","The J&K LG will, prima facie, have the same powers as the Delhi LG, and also control prisons, which come under the state govt in Delhi.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday targeted Congress while hailing the historic mandate in Haryana and noting the increased vote share in Jammu and Kashmir. He also brought back his ""parasite"" analogy to hit out at Congress while accusing it of dividing the nation based on caste.""Guarantee of 'vikas' (development) prevailed over a pack of lies in Haryana, people wrote new history as a government elected for a third term in the state,"" PM Modi told party workers at BJP headquarters in New Delhi.""The mandate will echo across the country,"" he added.Talking about the clear mandate for the third consecutive term in Haryana, PM Modi said, ""Congress wants to weaken the country by weakening the Indian society and spreading anarchy in India, that is why they are instigating different sections. They are constantly trying to ignite a fire. The country saw how attempts were made to instigate farmers, but the farmers of Haryana gave them a befitting reply that they are with the country, they are with the BJP. Many attempts were made to instigate Dalits and OBCs but this society also recognized this conspiracy and said that they are with the country, they are with the BJP.""PM Modi also accused the Congress of being a part of the group that ""hatches plan against India"".""For some time now, many conspiracies have been hatched against India to weaken India's democracy and social fabric. International conspiracies are being hatched. National parties like Congress and their allies are involved in this game,"" he claimed.""Today Haryana has given a befitting reply to every such conspiracy. Every Indian will have to take a pledge that we will not let any such conspiracy succeed. India will not deviate from the path of development,"" PM Modi said.Repeating his ""parasite"" analogy for Congress, PM Modi said, ""In Lok Sabha elections, Congress won most of the seats because of their alliance partners. However, their alliance partners had to suffer because of the trust they showed in Congress. Congress is a party that swallows its alliance partners. It wants to make a country where people hate their own culture,"" he said.PM Modi had earlier used this analogy in the Lok Sabha session after the 2024 general election results. Hitting out at the Congress, PM Modi had in his reply to the Motion of Thanks for the President's speech in the Lok Sabha, said that Congress has become a parasitic party that eats up the votes of its allies.Further, PM Modi said elections were conducted peacefully after decades in Jammu and Kashmir and called it a victory for the constitution and democracy of India.""'Jaha doodh-dahi ka khana, waisa hai apna Haryana'. The people of Haryana have done wonders. Today is the sixth day of Navratri , the day of Maa Katyayani. Maa Katyayani is sitting on a lion with a lotus in her hand. She is blessing all of us. On such a holy day, lotus has bloomed in Haryana for the third time,"" PM Modi said.He also hailed how BJP secured the highest vote percentage in Jammu and Kashmir polls while also extending wishes to the victorious NC alliance in J&K. ""Peaceful elections were held in Jammu and Kashmir, votes were counted and results were declared and this is the victory of the Indian Constitution and democracy. The people of Jammu and Kashmir gave the mandate to the NC alliance, I congratulate them too. If we look at the vote share percentage, BJP has emerged as the biggest party in Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said.The Prime Minister also lauded Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini over the party's victory.The saffron party decisively won 48 seats in Haryana assembly, getting absolute majority in the 90-member House. The party is poised to form its third successive government in the state.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi hails the historic mandate in Haryana.

Around 15 senior doctors joined the demonstration in solidarity, staging a symbolic hunger strike at Dorina Crossing in central Kolkata.Chief Secretary Manoj Pant has called for the medics to resume their duties. However, the junior doctors have made it clear that their priority is justice for their deceased colleague. They are demanding the removal of Health Secretary NS Nigam and accountability for alleged administrative failures.On October 1, the junior doctors resumed a total cease-work in response to an attack on their colleagues at the College of Medicine and Sagore Dutta Medical College. However, they lifted the strike on Friday after issuing a 24-hour ultimatum to the Mamata government.The doctors have presented a 10-point charter of demands focused on enhancing security in hospitals, addressing a culture of intimidation, and improving patient care services. Key demands include the removal of the Health Secretary, an investigation into alleged corruption within the West Bengal Medical Council and Health Recruitment Board, and the establishment of student council elections in all medical colleges.The Bengal Junior Doctors' Front is calling for the installation of CCTV cameras in hospital premises, 24-hour security for healthcare workers , and stricter protocols to safeguard medical professionals from violence. They have voiced concerns about the pervasive culture of fear in state-run hospitals, claiming that the administration has failed to create a safe working environment.The doctors' protest was sparked by the tragic rape and murder of a trainee female doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata on August 9.",50 senior faculty members of RG Kar Medical College tendered resignations in support of the protesting junior doctors.

Man taxed for US income as he spent over half the year in India

MUMBAI: The income tax appellate tribunal (ITAT) recently ruled that income earned in the US would be taxable for an individual residing in India. While the individual initially declared an income of Rs 9,570 for 2012-13, his taxable income surged to Rs 43.5 lakh after the US income was added.Under tax laws, residential status determines tax liability. Non-residents, for example, are not taxed in India on foreign income.However, in this case, the individual was a tax resident of both India and the US, requiring the application of the 'tie-breaker test' under the India-US tax treaty to determine which country he was a resident of.Applying this test, which takes into account certain criteria, ITAT concluded that the individual's ""centre of vital interest"" was closer to India, making his US income taxable in India.Applying the tiebreaker test, ITAT, in the case of a person who is a tax resident of both India and the US, has held that income earned in the US was taxable in India.Tax experts said the tiebreaker test is applied in cases of dual residency.Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head (global mobility services tax) at KPMG India, said a returning Indian, for instance, could be a tax resident of both India (based on the number of days in the country) and the US (based on citizenship). “In determining basic residency under domestic tax laws of each country, the fact that US tax residency (among other conditions) is based on US citizenship/green card status does have its own nuances as such individuals ar e always taxed in the US on their global income.”In this particular case, the individual was a tax resident of India, having spent more than 183 days in the country in 2012-13. He was also a US citizen, one of the criteria for tax residency in America.“The tie-breaker test is sequential, meaning if the tie is broken at one stage, subsequent criteria do not need to be applied. But, these criteria are highly subjective and vary with each individual’s circumstances,” Sirwalla said.The individual argued that his family (wife and three children) were a ll US citizens and one of his daughters was studying in the US. While he earned income from investments in both India and the US, he held larger investments in the US, and hence claimed he was a US resident. Accordingly, he said, his US income should not be taxed in India.The I-T department said the man had spent more than 183 days in India, and his wife and two of his children lived in Mumbai, while only one daughter resided in the US.ITAT noted that determining the ‘centre of vital interest’ requires analysing both personal and economic relationships. It observed that while the man had family ties to the US, his immediate family and business activities were centred in India. His siblings and parents residing in the US were deemed less relevant than his stay in India with his wife and children. ITAT gave more weight to his active business involvement in India over his passive investments in the US.The man had returned to India to run a film distribution company, co-founded with his wife in 2009, and was actively involved in its operations. Thus, ITAT ruled that he was a resident of India, making his US income taxable here.","Man taxed for US income as he spent over half the year in India.

Jason Kelce defends Travis Kelce on his slow start

Jason Kelce , a ESPN analyst, has been a strong supporter of Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce . Travis's slow start since 2013 has raised questions about his ability to perform. Travis had 15 receptions for 158 yards in the first four games of 2024, raising concerns about his off-season activities distracting from football.

""It's almost been like therapy, man.”Travis had a season-high seven receptions for 89 yards in a win over the Chargers in Week 4. He will build on this performance against the Saints in Week 5.

MUMBAI: Applying the tiebreaker test , ITAT , in the case of a person who is a tax resident of both India and the US, has held that income earned in the US was taxable in India.Tax experts said the tiebreaker test is applied in cases of dual residency . Parizad Sirwalla, partner and head (global mobility services tax) at KPMG India , said a returning Indian, for instance, could be a tax resident of both India (based on the number of days in the country) and the US (based on citizenship).“In determining basic residency under domestic tax laws of each country, the fact that US tax residency (among other conditions) is based on US citizenship/green card status does have its own nuances as such individuals ar e always taxed in the US on their global income.”In this particular case, the individual was a tax resident of India, having spent more than 183 days in the country in 2012-13. He was also a US citizen, one of the criteria for tax residency in America.“The tie-breaker test is sequential, meaning if the tie is broken at one stage, subsequent criteria do not need to be applied. But, these criteria are highly subjective and vary with each individual’s circumstances,” Sirwalla said.The individual argued that his family (wife and three children) were a ll US citizens and one of his daughters was studying in the US. While he earned income from investments in both India and the US, he held larger investments in the US, and hence claimed he was a US resident.Accordingly, he said, his US income should not be taxed in India.The I-T department said the man had spent more than 183 days in India, and his wife and two of his children lived in Mumbai, while only one daughter resided in the US.ITAT noted that determining the ‘centre of vital interest’ requires analysing both personal and economic rela tionships. It observed that while the man had family ties to the US, his immediate family and business activities were centred in India.His siblings and parents residing in the US were deemed less relevant than his stay in India with his wife and children. ITAT gave more weight to his active business involvement in India over his passive investments in the US. The man had returned to India to run a film distribution company, co-founded with his wife in 2009, and was actively involved in its operations. Thus, ITAT ruled that he was a resident of India, making his US income taxable here.","ITAT has held that income earned in the US was taxable in India.

Documentary suggests Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto is developer Peter Todd,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/peter-todd-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto/articleshow/114062803.cms,"Who exactly Satoshi Nakamoto is — a person or a group — has been subject of much speculation since Bitcoin’s launch in January 2009.

A new HBO documentary about the origins of Bitcoin suggests that Satoshi Nakamoto , the pseudonymous creator of the original cryptocurrency , is likely Canadian software developer Peter Todd .Called “Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery,” the 100-minute film on Tuesday features interviews with a handful of people who’d been involved with Bitcoin from early on, including long-time Satoshi candidate Adam Back, investor Roger Ver, Bitcoin marketer Samson Mow and Todd.The documentary’s creator, Cullen Hoback, used circumstantial evidence such as postings from an early Bitcoiner forum, to guess that Todd is Satoshi Nakamoto. When confronted, Todd shrugged off the idea, and called the suggestion “ludicrous.” Like several people in the film, Todd said, at one point, “I am Satoshi Nakamoto,” while seemingly laughing the idea off.Who exactly Satoshi Nakamoto is — a person or a group — has been subject of much speculation since Bitcoin’s launch in January 2009. The cryptocurrency has since burst onto the mainstream, ending up on the books of companies like MicroStrategy Inc. and part of US exchange-traded funds, holding billions of dollars worth of the token. Over the years, various publications have suggested a variety of people were Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2014, Newsweek claimed he was physicist Dorian Nakamoto, which he denied. In 2015, the New York Times pointed the finger at computer scientist Nick Szabo. Australian Craig Wright famously proclaimed himself to be Satoshi Nakamoto, until a UK judge ruled he is not Bitcoin’s creator.Todd is listed as an applied cryptography consultant on developer platform GitHub, which says he is based in Toronto. A LinkedIn profile for someone of the same name lists him as “Chief Naysayer” at Bitcoin security provider Coinkite, chief scientist at anonymizing wallet service Dark Wallet and chief scientist at project Mastercoin. He graduated with a Bachelor’s of Arts in Integrated Media from OCAD University in 2011, according to the LinkedIn profile.The whitepaper outlining Bitcoin came out in 2008, while the Bitcoin network came online in 2009. Todd has been discussed as a possible Satoshi Nakamoto for years.Even though Satoshi Nakamoto hasn’t been heard of since 2011, he or they continue to be of importance. Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallets hold around 1 million Bitcoin, worth about $62.4 billion at current prices. Any moves by the Bitcoin creator could crash the price. But the creator’s tokens haven’t moved in many years.The creator’s identity could also have a profound impact on governments’ and corporations’ willingness to continue to adopt the world’s biggest cryptocurrency.","A new HBO documentary suggests that Satoshi Nakamoto is likely Canadian software developer Peter Todd.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

""There's not a thing that comes to mind and I have been part of most of the decisions,"" Kamala Harris said.The reply got picked up by many social media users including the right wingers who asked whether it was Kamala Harris admitting that she has been responsible for all the failures of the past four years.""The best part is that Sunny Hostin thought she was giving Harris a layup question and Harris absolutely undermined the entire premise of her campaign,"" one post on the interview read.""We can’t afford another 4 years of the same failed policies,"" another wrote.At the talk show, Harris unveiled a plan to expand Medicare to cover at-home care for millions of seniors. The proposal, which would probably face stiff resistance among Republicans in Congress, would for the first time provide a Medicare home-care benefit to cover the costs for elderly Americans who need round-the-clock care, such as nurses and home health aides.The appearance was a part of a blitz of media appearances in New York also scheduled to include SiriusXM’s “The Howard Stern Show” and CBS’s “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”Kamala Harris said one difference she would have with Joe Biden as president is that she would tap a Republican to serve in her Cabinet -- something that she already announced.Kamala Harris was shown a clip of comedian Maya Rudolph portraying her on ""Saturday Night Love"". Harris clasped her hands together and laughed, saying she hadn’t seen the clip before. “Maya Rudolph, I mean, she’s so good,” Harris added.","Kamala Harris appeared on The View.

"After Jaishankar rules out bilateral talks during SCO summit, Pakistan follows suit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/after-jaishankar-rules-out-bilateral-talks-during-sco-summit-pakistan-follows-suit/articleshow/114020885.cms,"S Jaishankar

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit , following India's refusal earlier. Last Friday, India confirmed that foreign minister S Jaishankar would lead a delegation to Pakistan for the summit in Islamabad.Responding to a question on Jaishankar's visit and India-Pakistan relations , the spokesperson said that Pakistan had ""officially received notification"" about the visit and is prepared to welcome all participating members.Further on the question of bilateral talks, the spokesperson cited Jaishnakar's refusal and assured to toe the same line.""Regarding your question about bilateral meetings, I would like you to refer to the remarks made by the Indian minister for external affairs on 5th of October, in which he maintained that his visit was meant for a multilateral event and not for discussing Pakistan-India relations. These remarks are self-explanatory,"" she said.The last time an Indian external affairs minister visited Pakistan was when Sushma Swaraj in December 2015 travelled for a forum on the Afghanistan issue. However, Jaishankar's upcoming visit is looked at as a significant move by New Delhi, given the strained bilateral relations between the two countries.Tensions escalated after India carried out airstrikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in Balakot in February 2019, following the Pulwama terror attack. Relations worsened further after India revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status and reorganised the state into two union territories in August 2019, leading Pakistan to downgrade diplomatic ties.India has consistently stated its desire for normal relations with Pakistan, which New Delhi has said will depend on Islamabad creating an environment free of terrorism and hostility.In May 2023, Pakistan's then foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari visited India for an SCO foreign ministers' meeting in Goa, marking the first such visit by a Pakistani foreign minister in nearly 12 years.Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, however, confirmed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will chair the upcoming Council of Heads of Government (CHG) meeting of the SCO.""We expect high-level participation from SCO members; the observer state of Mongolia; Turkmenistan as a special guest; and representatives of the international organisations, including Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and European Economic Community (EEC),"" she said.The spokesperson stated that the CHG meeting will focus on discussions regarding cooperation in areas such as the economy, trade, environment, and socio-cultural connections, while also reviewing the SCO's overall performance.","Pakistan has ruled out the possibility of bilateral talks with India on the sidelines of the upcoming SCO summit.

Reality via research

Same old story

all

Remember that movie,? It opens with a manager of a ritzy London hotel acting snooty to a Singaporean mom and her kids. Why don’t you try Chinatown, the manager tells them, in a fine example of British racist prejudice. Mighty cheesed off, mom calls her husband, who solves the problem – by buying the hotel his family was trying to check into.That scene tells you everything about Singapore’s wealth.It reinforced a certain image of the city-state. Singapore – everything’s shiny, everyone’s happy. This is a country where a popular slogan was built around the idea of material possessions. Called “5Cs”, it defined Singaporeans’ aspirations – cash, country club membership, car, credit card and condo. Plenty of people in other countries want/have these things, too. Only Singapore coined a slogan around this.Plus…This is by no means an exhaustive list of what makes Singapore tick.But…Singapore is not all shiny, happy.A well-heeled visitor driving down a beautiful road from Changi airport to a world class hotel, thence to dine at a world class restaurant (Singapore hosts five of the world’s top 100 restaurants) won’t probably see this, or even know about it – there’s poverty , some of it deep, in Singapore. And it’s a problem likely to sharpen because the city-state, like many rich countries, is ageing.Most countries define a poverty line, a level of income/expenditure that differentiates the poor from the non-poor. There's a good reason for this. A poverty line allows policymakers to better target those who need the most help. India has a poverty line, so does America, and so do most countries. Singapore doesn’t.Why? Singapore govt’s approach, as Arabella Woo wrote in a London School of Economics research paper (“Inequality in Singapore: The Hidden Poor”) is “to reward citizens in alignment with the work that is done”. As for economically vulnerable citizens, govt wants “citizens…to protect themselves…to do it themselves”.If that’s your take on poverty, obviously there’ll be no official poverty line. Naturally, there’s no official count of poor people either.With govt not defining poverty, researchers have had to work with other data. A superbly researched paper (“A handbook on inequality, poverty and unmet social needs in Singapore”), by Catherine J Smith, John A Donaldson, Sanushka Mudaliar, Mumtaz Md Kadir & Lam Keong Yeoh, quotes a separate study by one of the authors, who had used expenditure survey data. Per that study, “there are 110,000 to 140,000 households in Singapore who fit the definition of absolute poverty…these include the working poor, unemployed poor and poor retiree households”.Absolute poverty is defined as an economic situation where a person or a household doesn’t earn enough to cover basic needs.In a small country (population just over 6 million), 140,000 households, that is, around 560,000 people (reasonably assuming 4 people per household), is not a vanishingly small number. You wouldn’t think, visiting Singapore, there are more than 5.5 lakh people living in absolute poverty.Economists also use a concept called relative poverty – a measure that captures living standard relative to that enjoyed by those earning median wage (a median is defined as the middle value of a sequence of numbers, arranged in ascending or descending order).By this measure, per the handbook quoted above, 25% to 30% of Singaporeans live in relative poverty. The same research points out that many Singaporean middle-class families have faced “stagnating wages and an increased cost of living”. This double whammy hits middle-classes, and the poor, who are hit harder, in many countries, including India. But it’s also true for that island of gleaming high-rises.In a report on poverty and inequality in Singapore, BBC said this: “The city-state, which has some of the highest-paid ministers in the world, is a place of sometimes extreme contrasts, with glittering condominiums and towering facades just a stone's throw from one-room rental apartments inhabited by elderly and blue-collar families.”The same BBC report also quoted two local studies that concluded that in multiracial Singapore, it’s not race but class that’s become the deepest social faultline.Poverty, absolute or relative, and sharp income inequality in Singapore can be traced to pretty much the same set of reasons that’s produced similar outcomes in other countries. Policy attention on maintaining high GDP growth, low corporate taxes to attract investment, an emphasis on meritocracy, and the transition from old economy to knowledge economy. Implemented well, as Singapore govt has, this set of policies can produce shining economic performance – but it can also produce an underclass that gets caught in a deprivation trap. And the problem gets worse, as is the case in Singapore, when a society starts ageing. Elderly poor face the worst kind of poverty.None of this invalidates Singapore’s success story. But all of it tells us about a Singapore that most people don’t know exists.To saySingaporeans are crazy, rich is crazy, and full of rich irony.","At $141,500, its per capita income in PPP terms (a fairer measure than nominal dollar figures) ranks second after Luxembourg globally.

Tourism Crunch

The president of the Maldives swept into power a year ago on a campaign to push India out of the island nation’s affairs and draw closer to China. Now, as a debt crisis looms and earlier Chinese loans come due, he is in New Delhi looking to mend some fences.Mohamed Muizzu arrived in New Delhi on Sunday on his first state visit, with the country’s financial crisis likely to be a key feature of discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.Prior to his visit, Muizzu has softened his rhetoric notably, saying he’s never opposed India and New Delhi knows the financial strain his nation is under and was willing to help.That’s a contrast to a year ago when he took office, pushing for the withdrawal of Indian troops from the Maldives and promising new big-ticket projects backed by China. His campaign thrust the Maldives to the center of the rivalry between the two powers, which have been vying for influence over the Indian Ocean nation known for pristine beaches and its strategic location straddling global shipping routes.Both countries — and others — have poured hundreds of millions of dollars worth of loans into the Maldives in recent years, saddling the tourism-dependent nation amid a protracted economic slowdown, a drought of foreign reserves and a slow return of visitors.The country’s debt is estimated at 110% of gross domestic product, and risks are growing it may fail to make payments on its sukuk. If that were to happen, it would be the world’s first default of an Islamic bond.India gave the Maldives a $50 million lifeline last month to help it avoid that outcome, but that was likely only a short-term fix given additional looming payments, according to investors and analysts.Fitch Ratings estimates the country’s total external debt obligations will grow to $557 million in 2025, and exceed $1 billion by 2026. The island nation’s foreign reserves stood at just $437 million as of the end of August, sufficient to cover only around one-and-a-half months of imports.A default event was looking more likely, according to Fitch, while the International Monetary Fund has also warned of a potential debt crisis.“This is a growing concern and the debts are piling up,” said Aditya Gowdara Shivamurthy, an associate fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank. “They’ve been able to repay until now. What will happen next is something we will have to see.”Muizzu met with India’s External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Sunday and is due to meet with Modi on Monday.China and India are the No. 1 and 2 external lenders for Maldivian central government debt, respectively. The Maldives owed about $400 million to the Export-Import Bank of India and about $530 million to the Export-Import Bank of China at the end of last year, according to official figures.The Maldives Monetary Authority has said officials are working on a $400 million foreign-currency swap with India’s central bank, which could provide a key source of funds for future debt payments. China meanwhile has said it’s held discussions with Male over debt relief.“President Muizzu has tried to steer the Maldives away from its traditional reliance on India to a more independent foreign policy, including friendlier relations with China,” said Søren Mørch, head of emerging markets debt at Danske Bank AS. “This recent bailout from India has shown the limits of this approach.”The debt crunch comes as the Maldivian economy has failed to maintain momentum in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. While GDP growth reached 13.9% in 2022, it slowed to 4% last year, with tourists spending at rates below pre-pandemic levels, according to the World Bank.Relations between the Maldives and India took a dive in January after a social-media spat in which a Maldivian deputy minister mocked Modi, prompting a backlash from Indian citizens and several celebrities calling for a tourism boycott of the island.In an interview with the BBC, Muizzu said the Maldives is not facing a sovereign debt default, nor would it join an IMF funding program. Still, India’s backing in any potential debt restructuring is likely to prove invaluable, making a fence-mending with New Delhi all the more important, said Gulbin Sultana, associate fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, a government-backed think tank in New Delhi.“Muizzu is re-balancing ties with India, as is New Delhi trying to reset its ties with the island nation,” she said.",Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu is in New Delhi on his first state visit.

What's on the agenda

Improving ties



NEW DELHI: Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.As per media reports in the Maldives , Muizzu, his wife Sajidha Mohamed, and a high-level delegation of Maldivian government officials traveled on a special flight arranged by the Indian government, a gesture reserved for such visits by Maldivian presidents.Muizzu will receive an official welcome on Monday.During his visit from October 6-10, Muizzu will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi , external affairs minister S Jaishankar and other top ministers to discuss various bilateral, regional, and international issues.The president's upcoming discussions are expected to lead to several agreements that could enhance bilateral cooperation.Muizzu has been criticised for pivoting his island nation sharply towards China, and eyebrows were raised in New Delhi after he decided to break tradition by not making India his first foreign visit after taking office in November last year. Instead, he initially visited Turkey and China - a significant diplomatic shift, particularly given that his administration has been perceived as pro-China and has previously campaigned on an ""India Out"" platform.This change in approach had raised concerns about the future of India-Maldives relations, which had become strained following Muizzu's election.However, ties between the two countries have been warming up with Muizzu publicly acknowledging India's importance, referring to it as ""one of the closest allies and invaluable partners"" of the Maldives. The Maldivian president's acknowledgment of India's role in providing aid during times of need also indicates a willingness to move past contentious rhetoric towards constructive engagement.This shift could pave the way for a more balanced approach that respects Maldivian sovereignty while recognising India's strategic interests in the region.Geopolitically, the Maldives is crucial for India's 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) initiative and its 'Neighbourhood First Policy'. The Maldives serves as a key maritime neighbor in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), making it strategically significant for India's national security interests.The president met EAM Jaishankar on Sunday evening shortly after landing in New Delhi.""Pleased to call on President Muizzu today at the start of his State Visit to India. Appreciate his commitment to enhance 🇮🇳 🇲🇻 relationship. Confident that his talks with PM Modi on Monday will give a new impetus to our friendly ties,"" the external affairs minister posted on X.Official talks and signing of agreements with Indian leadership are scheduled for Monday.President Muizzu will also meet with the Maldivian community living in India, on Sunday.He will also engage in business events in Mumbai and Bengaluru, highlighting the importance of economic ties between the two nations.The delegation accompanying president Muizzu includes foreign minister Dr Abdullah Khaleel, defense minister Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon, minister of homeland security and technology Ali Ihusaan, finance minister Moosa Zameer, health minister Abdulla Nazim Ibrahim, and economic development minister Mohamed Saeed.Other key officials joining the visit are attorney general Ahmed Usham, tourism minister Ibrahim Faisal, transport & civil aviation minister Mohamed Ameen, construction & infrastructure minister Dr Abdulla Muththalib, and chief of staff at the President's Office Abdulla Fayaz, alongside several senior officials.Muizzu last visited India in June to attend the swearing in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During the visit, the two leaders met and discussed strengthening bilateral relations between Maldives and India.The two leaders also met on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai in December last year.Relations between the two countries had deteriorated after two Maldivian deputy ministers made defamatory comments about PM Modi and India on social media, amid ongoing discussions about the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the Maldives.The two officials, Malsha Shareef and Mariyam Shiuna were suspended from their roles in the Ministry of Youth and later resigned on September 10 this year.Withdrawal of Indian military personnel was a key pledge of President Muizzu, and the transition was carried out peacefully, with civilians replacing Indian troops as per the agreement between the two governments.Muizzu's administration has since appeared committed to mending relations with India.","Maldivian president Mohamed Muizzu landed in New Delhi on Sunday for his first State visit to India.

As per inquest, she had written in her diary that she was starving and running out of food. The vulnerable woman’s family had raised concerns about her two months prior she was discovered.According to The Guardian, Laura Winham , who was deaf and had schizophrenia, was discovered in her Woking flat by her brother in May 2021, after her family asked police to break in.Her family, whom she had previously asked not to contact her, claimed she was ""abandoned and left to die"" by social and mental health services .A pathologist told the inquest at Surrey Coroner’s Court this week that determining an exact time of death was impossible. However, the court heard that a calendar in Winham’s flathead dates marked off until 1 November 2017. She was running low on food and money according to extracts from her diary, which were read out by coroner Karen Henderson on Thursday.An entry dated 28 September 2017 read: “My mobile gave up on 7 September. I got a Tesco run in before it died. I have slept weeks away … I haven’t stocked any food for months because I don’t know what’s happening.”Another extract from October 2017 said, “It has been a whole month since my last food shop. I cannot believe I have survived this long.”Other extracts hinted that she had been living off potatoes and cheese and had almost about £5 left on her.An extract from 15 September 2017 said: “Wish I’d bought rice. Dreaming of [food]. Anyway, I’m starving.”It was previously revealed by the inquest that Winham’s family could not stay in contact with her after years of mental health struggles caused her to believe they would harm her.Luke Addams, Surrey Council’s director of practice, assurance, and safeguarding, told the inquest that a council representative should have attempted an in-person visit to Winham rather than relying on letters for communication. A Woking Council official also acknowledged that Winham's vulnerabilities should have been reported to the company managing the council's housing stock at the time.The inquest on Wednesday, heard that she was contacted by the Department for Work and Pensions in February 2016 asking her to claim for the new personal independence payment, which replaced the disability living allowance (DLA).The court heard that Winham was informed she might need to attend a medical assessment. In response, she wrote to the Woking Council, expressing her alarm, stating: ""I have only lived on my savings and DLA benefit.""

LONDON: Historian William Dalrymple has criticised an exhibition at the British Museum featuring over 300 objects from the Silk Roads from CE 500 to CE 1000 for excluding India.Speaking to TOI from London after visiting the show, Dalrymple said he was shocked India was excluded given that India was the “biggest trading partner where East-West trade took place” during this period.The exhibition “Silk Roads”, which opened last week, claims to “challenge the popular concept of the Silk Road as a single trade route, instead showing how the Silk Roads were made up of overlapping networks.”“Hanging from the ceiling in a single corridor are various location names — it covers almost all of Asia, except India, and it seems so bizarre, because India was the largest trading partner of the Roman empire,” the author said.“When you are trying to present the trade routes of the ancient world and do all the minor sites of international trade and miss out the biggest trading partner where east-west trade took place in its greatest quantity, it is bizarre, particularly when you open the exhibition with a Buddha from Swat and end with a purse containing Rajasthani garnets,” he said.“They acknowledge these garnets, but there is no display for India which should be at the heart of the show. It ends up being a bizarre omission, almost inexplicable, to anyone that knows the centrality of India to ancient trade networks,” he added, pointing out not one Roman coin horde has ever been found in China, yet Roman coin hordes are found in India every year.India was the greatest trading partner with Rome of the classical world, while China and Rome had only the very faintest impression of each other’s existence, Dalrymple said.This is a theme of his book, ""The Golden Road”, in which he argues this notion of an East-West overland route linking China with the Mediterranean, the so-called Silk Road, is a myth which grew out of a Sino-centric reframing of history. “Silk was not even the biggest product imported from the East; pepper from India was,” he said.“India has a haunting presence throughout the exhibition,” Dalrymple said.Buddhism is a central feature, even if the exhibition misses out the home of Buddhism, India.“Nalanda doesn’t feature at all,” he said. “Yet this was the period when the Buddhist monks were coming from Japan and China to Nalanda.”A spokesperson for the British Museum said: “We don’t recognise the characterisation made by Dalrymple. The exhibition goes beyond the narrow 19th-century definition of the Silk Road to present a richer, more complex story of the Silk Roads as overlapping networks.”“Maps in the exhibition and accompanying book also refer to sites from India. For instance, a map showing the probable route of the 9th century ship that sank off the coast of Indonesia, near the island of Belitung, recognises that the vessel most likely stopped at ports along the coast of the Indian subcontinent,” the spokesperson said, adding, “Objects featured throughout the exhibition point to the importance of India in the trade of goods and the transmission of knowledge.”“The game of chess is noted as an invention in India probably around 500 CE and is represented by the world’s oldest group of chess pieces, made from elephant ivory probably sourced from India,” the spokesperson said.",Historian William Dalrymple has criticised an exhibition at the British Museum for excluding India. India was the “biggest trading partner where East-West trade took place” during this period.

16-year-old budding photographer Liz Hatton , who was diagnosed with terminal cancer earlier this year, had a deeply emotional and unexpected experience at Windsor Castle this week. Not only did she meet the Princess of Wales but she also received a heartfelt hug from her, a moment Hatton said she will treasure for the rest of her life.""A pleasure to meet with Liz at Windsor today.A talented young photographer whose creativity and strength has inspired us both,"" the royal couple shared on their official social media account.Hatton expressed her gratitude, calling the meeting a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and her mother echoed the sentiment, adding that the day was unforgettable for their family.In January, Hatton’s cancer was discovered after she experienced abdominal pain, leading doctors to find tumours on her ovaries and liver. The illness changed her life in a matter of weeks, just as she and her family had been looking at universities.Diagnosed with desmoplastic small round cell tumour, an extremely rare and aggressive form of cancer, Hatton’s prognosis left her with only six months to three years to live.Hatton’s story reached the Prince and Princess of Wales through William’s involvement with London’s Air Ambulance Charity . The royal couple invited Hatton to Windsor Castle to photograph a private royal award ceremony, where Hatton’s talents as a photographer were not only admired but celebrated.As per the CBS News, the royal invitation came following a social media post from her mother, Vicky Robayna, sharing her daughter's photography bucket list .Her mother, in an effort to fulfil her daughter’s wishes, posted the photography bucket list in May, hoping to create cherished memories for Hatton in the time she had. The list included ambitious goals like photographing a West End musical, London Fashion Week, and famous music festivals.Although photographing a royal event wasn’t on the list, her mother welcomed any photography-related opportunities to help her daughter live a life full of joy in her remaining time.After the event, William and Kate posed with Hatton and her family for a few photographs. Kate, who is an amateur photographer herself, praised Hatton’s work, stating that her creativity and strength were truly inspiring.Following the diagnosis, Hatton’s family has encouraged her to pursue her passions. Since the release of her bucket list, Hatton has received offers to photograph prestigious events, including productions of ""Wicked"" and ""Cabaret"" in London's West End.She has also had the opportunity to visit the set of her favourite TV show, helping her live out her dreams despite her heart-wrenching diagnosis.","16-year-old budding photographer Liz Hatton was diagnosed with terminal cancer earlier this year.

HAMBURG (Germany): The first Hamburg Sustainability Conference (HSC) brings together politics, science and business as well as civil society and international organizations to develop solutions for the challenges of the times. Around 1600 participants from 102 countries discussed a wide scope of issues in more than 60 sessions: from sustainable hydrogen supply chains for global shipping to fair raw material relations for battery production and an international financial architecture that is fair for all.The aim of the conference was to develop concrete initiatives to accelerate the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals jointly agreed by all countries of the world.The Hamburg Sustainability Conference was an initiative of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Michael Otto Foundation and the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. It will continue to take place in the coming years and thus initiate and support long-term change processes, stated the initiators of the conference.The conference was opened by Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Hamburg's First Mayor Peter Tschentscher as well as the Administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) Achim Steiner. Among others, the President of Namibia Nangolo Mbumba, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva, the Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Mottley, heads of the state of nearly a dozen countries, Chadian civil rights activist and representative of the indigenous peoples Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim and Kenyan activist Mercy Mutana participated in the conference. The collaboration of representatives from politics, business, science and civil society from all parts of the world enables new alliances for concrete initiatives.Development Minister Svenja Schulze said “The principle of international cooperation is under enormous pressure worldwide. In many countries, nationalists advocate for isolation and stir up fears about the future. That the global community managed to adopt a pact for the future in September in New York under these circumstances is therefore a victory for multilateralism . We want to build on this and develop concrete answers to questions about the future through new alliances. The major challenges of our time cannot be solved in a national shell but only through international cooperation.First Mayor of Hamburg Peter Tschentscher said “With the international Sustainability Conference, Hamburg is making an important contribution to more sustainable global development. Our city itself is pursuing an ambitious SDG strategy. With Germany's largest seaport and around 100 consulates, we have excellent connections to all continents. We look forward to new concepts and new ideas for implementing the United Nations' SDGs.”UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said “Coming on the heels of world leaders agreeing to the Pact of the Future on the margins of the UN General Assembly, the Hamburg Sustainability Conference is the first next step towards turning these global commitments into tangible action to steer our world to a more sustainable path”.Michael Otto, Chairman of the Supervisory Board Otto Group said “The major challenges of our time can only be addressed through close cooperation and a collaborative effort among politics, business, and society. The global consensus on the Sustainable Development Goals is, therefore, a significant achievement of multilateralism. However, these goals must be pursued with much greater urgency”.Future issues including how shipping corridors can be created and supplied with green hydrogen so that it is possible to travel in a climate-neutral way. How can batteries, which are so important for climate protection, be produced using raw materials that are themselves sustainably sourced. How can the international financial architecture be reformed so that it can support all countries in sustainable development. How can the enormous potential of the private sector and civil society actors be better utilized to achieve the global goals for sustainable development for all and what guidelines can politicians set so that the sustainability pioneers of today set the standards of tomorrow and many more were discussed.",Around 1600 participants from 102 countries discussed a wide scope of issues in more than 60 sessions.

The Alliance on Green Shipping Corridors formed at the HSC is an example for this collaborative effort.Green shipping corridors that is routes on which it is possible to navigate climate neutrally, tank renewable fuels , based on green hydrogen - can make a substantial contribution to achieving climate goals.The shipping industry is responsible for over 80% of CO2-emissions of global trade and emits more greenhouse gas than Germany as a whole - and it will continue to grow.The new Alliance on decarbonizing global shipping can make a substantial contribution to achieving our climate goals by jointly establishing green shipping corridors. The vision is to establish green shipping routes on which it is possible to tank or store renewable fuel that has been produced in a climate-neutral way.This is a global challenge that can only be solved through international cooperation by a variety of actors that need to be on board: fuel producers, companies that can transport these new fuels, ports that offer the renewable fuels, shipping companies that buy them, ship builders that build in motors able to run with the new fuels, banks that support financing the needed investments and governments that provide the necessary environment for it.Development cooperation can and will contribute to the solution: The German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development can point to a long tradition of very good cooperation, especially with countries that are regarded as the frontrunners in the production of green, sustainable fuels.Development cooperation can thus function as a door opener for economic cooperation and sustainable development. In many of these partner countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, the conditions for producing renewable electricity are excellent. There is a special need for many of these countries to become key players in the rapidly growing global market for green hydrogen products. In addition, it is the chance for these countries to simultaneously advance their own energy transition, their local energy supply and domestic industry. For this to happen it is of particular importance to make the global hydrogen market a fairer and more equitable one than the fossil fuel world ever was. This means that from the outset other aspects of sustainable development have to be taken into consideration and be integrated into the new Green Shipping Corridors, such as ensuring that the local population also gets an affordable access to the new clean energy that is being used for hydrogen production, ensuring decent working conditions on hydrogen producing plants and safeguard the sustainable development of cities and communities around the new production sights.If done right, all actors along the value chain can profit from the great coordination effort for a global hydrogen ramp up: production countries in the Global South through development created by new hydrogen value chains, Germany and other European countries through stable and diversified supply relationships and businesses via chances for exporting hydrogen technology.",The shipping industry is responsible for over 80% of CO2-emissions of global trade and emits more greenhouse gas than Germany as a whole.

All about Nobel prize in Physics



From 1901 to 2023, the Nobel Prize in Physics has been awarded 117 times to a total of 225 laureates. Notably, John Bardeen is the only recipient to have won the prize twice, in 1956 and 1972. This brings the total number of individuals who have received the Nobel Prize in Physics to 224.

The youngest Nobel laureate is Lawrence Bragg. He received the prize in 1915 “for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays”

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was assigned to award the Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry, the Karolinska Institutet was chosen for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, the Swedish Academy for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and a committee of five members elected by the Norwegian Parliament (Storting) for the Nobel Peace Prize.

In 1968, Sveriges Riksbank established the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences tasked with selecting the laureates starting in 1969.

The Nobel prize in Physics 2024 has been awarded to John J Hopfield and Geoffrey E Hinton “for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.”The 2024 Nobel Prize laureates in Physics utilized tools from their field to develop methods that have significantly contributed to the foundation of modern machine learning.John Hopfield created a framework capable of storing and reconstructing information, while Geoffrey Hinton developed a technique that enables the independent discovery of properties within data, which is crucial for today’s large artificial neural networks.He developed a network that employs a method for storing and reconstructing patterns, where the nodes can be visualized as pixels. The Hopfield network draws on physics principles related to a material's properties influenced by atomic spin, which allows each atom to act as a tiny magnet.This network is described in terms similar to the energy in a spin system, and it is trained by adjusting the connection values between nodes to ensure that the stored images maintain low energy levels. When presented with a distorted or incomplete image, the Hopfield network systematically updates the values of its nodes, reducing its energy to find the stored image that most closely resembles the input.He built upon the Hopfield network to create a new model known as the Boltzmann machine, which employs a different learning method to recognize key features in specific types of data. Hinton utilized concepts from statistical physics, which studies systems composed of many similar components.The Boltzmann machine is trained by providing it with examples that are highly probable when the machine is executed. It can classify images and generate new instances of the patterns it has learned.","The Nobel Prize in Physics 2024 has been awarded to John J Hopfield and Geoffrey E Hinton.

'Give the product a chance'

PARIS: France 's new Prime Minister Michel Barnier on Tuesday faces a motion of no-confidence brought by the left which is set to underline the fragility of his government even while having little chance of succeeding.Barnier, a right-wing former EU Brexit negotiator, was appointed by centrist President Emmanuel Macron to bring some stability in a potentially testy ""cohabitation"" across the political divide after inconclusive legislative elections earlier this summer.The veteran premier, 73, has since sought to firmly take the reins, warning that France faces a financial crisis if its budget deficit is not narrowed and saying that tax rises could be in order for high earners.Macron, whose term runs until 2027, has in the last weeks taken a noticeable back seat, especially on domestic issues while making uncharacteristically infrequent public comments.The appointment of Barnier, a patrician figure who served stints as a minister and EU commissioner, has also been a contrast for the French.They have seen three premiers who were almost unknown before their appointment come and go in the space of four years.But Barnier and his government, named last month with a conspicuously right-wing tinge, could be toppled at any moment if a no-confidence motion were passed in theNational Assembly lower house of government.The left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) won the most seats of any coalition in the polls, even if the far-right National Rally (RN) emerged as the largest single party and is still livid that Macron failed to appoint a leftist as prime minister.""The existence of this government, in its composition and its orientation, is a negation of the result of the legislative elections,"" states the motion, which is due to be put forward by Socialist Party (PS) leader Olivier Faure.The left has also been angered by the hardline stances of the new Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau , who has said there should be a referendum on immigration, although he admitted this was not possible under the constitution.However, the motion put forward by the NFP, a coalition of Socialists, Communists, hard-leftists and Greens, has little chance of succeeding as the RN's MPs under three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen have made clear they will not back it on this occasion.""I think the situation is serious enough not to bring down this government before it has got going,"" RN MP Laure Lavalette told France 2 television.""We are going to... give the product a chance... We cannot add to the chaos as you (the left) are doing,"" she added.However, the numbers could prove embarrassing for the Barnier government at this early stage, with some backing for the motion coming also from independents and even some dissenting members of Macron's centrist faction unhappy at the prospect of tax rises.Commentators have noted that the fate of Barnier's government risks being at the RN's mercy, vulnerable to a ""sword of Damocles"" wielded by Le Pen, who is expected to run for the presidency in 2027.The prime minister, for his part, is well aware that he is walking on thin ice: ""I know that I am in the hands of parliament,"" he told La Tribune Dimanche.","France's new Prime Minister Michel Barnier faces a motion of no-confidence brought by the left.

The conflicts on the various parts of the world are also increasing the words on achievement of the SDGs.President Ajaypal Singh @ Ajay Banga said the world is far away in finances from achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The world needs 400 trillion dollars to achieve the SDGs but the world bank with multilateral development banks (MDBs) has access to nearly 300 trillion dollars and shortfall is big. To fill the gap the private sector needs to come up, Banga said on Monday while speaking to Times of India on the sidelines of Hamburg Sustainability Conference at Hamburg.Public money is falling short to achieve the goals and in that scenario only the private sector is the option and we have approached the corporate sector. Recently the world bank met 15 top CEOs from the world who have committed to finance and it is time to wait for their pledges to come forth.Banga said the World Bank is making various efforts so that the poor nations from Global South get the finances to achieve their goals which the world desperately needs. Many more meeting are lined up including the serious talks at the upcoming COP 27 at Baku in Azerbaijan.Banga said along with achieving the goals for SDGs, the sincere efforts on sustainability too are badly needed. The world need to sustain its resources without emitting more emissions.In the meanwhile, Achim Steiner, Administrator United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) speaking to TOI said surely we are lagging in achieving the targets of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on various parameters but the world is inching towards achieving that.

May be the world could take more time but the ultimately the goals will be achieved.

Germany stands with you (Israel), calls for ceasefire in Gaza: Olaf Scholz



HAMBURG: Aiming to make collective efforts to achieve sustainability and make progress in achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals including eliminating poverty, energy transition, two days Hamburg Sustainability Conference (HSC) started at Hamburg, the second most populated city of Germany, on Monday. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in his presidential address at the opening of HSC said that “all the nations together can meet challenges of green transition .At a time when we are confronting numerous international crises, we need to tighten up and share responsibilities, means and technologies between civil society institution and the private sector and create new platforms for confrontation between experts from the Global North and the Global South,” the German head of the government said. We need to work together on a global financial architecture to facilitate investments. In fact, without cooperation it will be impossible to achieve climate targets, he added at the event that brings together members of institutions, civil society and business in Germany.“Many nations are falling short to achieve the SDGs targets set up in 2015. Earlier Covid brought financial and social crisis as since then more than 50 nations have had to divert much of their investments on education, from climate and other issues to address the emergency, but we are still making progress on climate. We are working together in a time of milestones and wars and looking at a sustainable future together, said Achim Steiner , Administrator UNDP.Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, Namibia President Nangolo Mbumba, German Federal Minister for economic development Svenja Schulze, World Bank President Ajay Banga while addressing the conference and taking part in a panel discussion stressed the need of finances to achieve the SDGs.UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said many least developed countries have literally been cut off from financial markets. They cannot borrow more because of the risk of default. In this context, for green transition investments we are asking them for a bigger effort than what was originally planned. Figuring out how to mobilize more money and invest in an effective transition will be one of the challenges we will face at COP29 in Azerbaijan in November”, he added.“Meeting the UN climate and development targets will cost LDCs $500 billion by the end of the decade. This is a disgrace for us. As wealthier states we need to mobilize billions to help them”, said Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director, International Monetary Fund. We can't waste a penny with all the challenges the world is facing from the climate crisis to new technologies to conflicts, she added, stressing that it is not enough to rescue states in economic distress, but we must work together and think about how they can grow.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pointing towards conflict between Israel and Palestine showcased the pain with the Israel over its citizens having been abducted and killed over a year ago. “We feel Israel's horror, pain, uncertainty and sadness. We stand with you”, he said while addressing the Hamburg Sustainability Conference, while recalling the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israeli civilians last October 7.The subsequent war has caused enormous suffering in the Gaza Strip. That is why the German Federal government stands for a ceasefire, the release of hostages and a political process, even if it seems further away today than ever before”. The people need hope and prospects if they are to give up terror. This will only be possible by avoiding escalation in the area,” Scholz stressed adding that Iran and Hezbollah must stop their attack on Israel”.","Two days Hamburg Sustainability Conference (HSC) started at Hamburg, the second most populated city of Germany, on Monday.

A total of 114 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded since 1901; over 227 individuals have received the award between 1901-2023. Of the 227 individuals awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 13 are women.

in Physiology or Medicine, 13 are women. The prize was not awarded on nine occasions: in 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1921, 1925, 1940, 1941 and 1942.

Why were the medicine prizes not awarded in those years? In the statutes of the Nobel Foundation it says: ""If none of the works under consideration is found to be of the importance indicated in the first paragraph, the prize money shall be reserved until the following year. If, even then, the prize cannot be awarded, the amount shall be added to the Foundation’s restricted funds."" During World War I and II, fewer Nobel Prizes were awarded.

The youngest recipient of the prize was 31-year old Frederick G. Banting in 1923. He was recognised for the discovery of insulin.

The oldest recipient was 87-year-old Peyton Rous in 1966 for his discovery of tumour-inducing viruses.

No one has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine more than once.

India-born Har Gobind Khorana shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Robert Holley and Marshall W. Nirenberg in 1968 for his role in deciphering genetic code. Khorana was born in Raipur and later became an American citizen.

What is the Nobel prize?

The 2024 Nobel prize in Physiology/Medicine has been awarded to Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for the discovery of microRNA and its role in post-transcriptional gene regulation.""This year's NobelPrize in Physiology or Medicine honours two scientists for their discovery of a fundamental principle governing how gene activity is regulated. They discovered microRNA, a new class of tiny RNA molecules that play a crucial role in gene regulation,"" Sweden's Karolinska Institute said on Monday during the announcement ceremony.Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun’s groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms, including humans.Understanding the regulation of gene activity has been an important goal for many decades. If gene regulation goes awry, it can lead to serious diseases such as cancer, diabetes, or autoimmunity.The information stored within our chromosomes can be likened to an instruction manual for all cells in our body. Every cell contains the same chromosomes, so every cell contains exactly the same set of genes and exactly the same set of instructions. Yet, different cell types, such as muscle and nerve cells, have very distinct characteristics. How do these differences arise? The answer lies in gene regulation, which allows each cell to select only the relevant instructions.
