Budget 2024 Income Tax Expectations : Ahead of the Union Budget 2024 presentation by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the government is currently evaluating a proposal to raise the tax-deductible limit on interest income from savings accounts to Rs 25,000.This suggestion was put forward by banks during a recent meeting with key officials from the finance ministry.Banks have been advocating for deposit incentives due to increasing concerns about the widening credit-deposit ratio.""It (the suggestion) is under review, and there could be some relief for banks, which have demanded incentives to shore up deposits,"" a government official was quoted as saying in an ET report by Dheeraj Tiwari. The final decision on the proposal will be made closer to the budget announcement.Under the old tax regime, interest income up to Rs 10,000 per year from savings accounts is tax-exempt under Section 80TTA of the Income Tax Act . For senior citizens aged 60 and above, this limit is set at Rs 50,000 and includes interest income from fixed deposits under Section 80 TTB. However, these benefits were removed under the new tax regime, when it was introduced in the 2020 budget.""Both issues, including enhancement of the old limit and allowing interest income earned from savings accounts in scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) under existing regulations in the new regime, are being deliberated,"" said the person cited above, noting that banks had previously made a presentation on this matter.Also Read | Budget 2024 income tax expectations: Top 10 things FM Sitharaman should do for salaried taxpayers The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) observed in its latest Financial Stability Report that households are diversifying their financial savings, allocating more to non-banks and the capital market.The report highlighted that the growing gap is reflected in the rising credit-deposit (C-D) ratio, which peaked at 78.8% in December 2023 before moderating to 76.8% at the end of March.Recently, HDFC Bank, the country's largest private sector lender, reported a 5% sequential decline in its current account-savings account (CASA) deposits to Rs 8.63 lakh crore during the first quarter of the current financial year.","The government is evaluating a proposal to raise the tax-deductible limit on interest income from savings accounts to Rs 25,000.

The Prime Minister is appointed by the President but must enjoy the confidence of the majority in the Lok Sabha.India has had 14 Prime Ministers since 1947, starting with Jawaharlal Nehru.Notably, Indira Gandhi was the first female Prime Minister, and the Nehru-Gandhi family has held the position for approximately 38 years. Various political parties have held power, with leaders like Morarji Desai, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and Manmohan Singh shaping India's political landscape.

"July 23 Budget to focus on infrastructure, targeted spending",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/july-23-budget-to-focus-on-infra-targeted-spending/articleshow/111546831.cms,"NEW DELHI: The first Budget of Narendra Modi ’s third term will be presented on July 23 amid indications that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will use the revenue growth and record dividend from Reserve Bank of India to spend not just on capital expenditure for creating infrastructure but also use the resources at its disposal to focus on specific target groups such as the middle class, women and farm sector.While the economy has so far been performing well, govt also wants to use the Budget to announce some reform measures that do not need legislative approval.“Hon’ble President of India, on the recommendation of Govt of India, has approved the proposal for summoning of both the Houses of Parliament for the budget session, 2024 from 22nd July, 2024 to 12 August, 2024 (subject to exigencies of parliamentary business). Union Budget 2024-25 will be presented in Lok Sabha on 23 July, 2024,” parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said in a post on X.The Economic Survey for the last financial year, which is also due, is likely to be tabled in Parliament on the opening day, outlining the Modi govt’s achievements during the first two terms and identifying the focus areas. It remains to be seen if govt releases its much-talked 100 days’ agenda before the Budget is tabled since the elements in the plan will feed into the announcements.Sitharaman, who will present her seventh consecutive Budget — a record that overtakes Morarji Desai’s six, will seek to address critical concerns around inflation, jobs, income inequality and regional imbalances while announcing tax measures and other social security benefits targeted at the middle class.Having posted a better-than-budgeted fiscal deficit thanks to buoyant tax collections, Sitharaman and her team are being watched if govt intends to speed up the move towards a 4.5% fiscal deficit. Against revised estimates of 5.8% of GDP last year, the Centre closed the year with a deficit of 5.6%. For the current fiscal year, the govt had set a target of 5.1% and therevenue mop-up so far is expected to help it achieve the target, especially amid projections that GDP growth may turn out to be higher than the budgeted level.Sitharaman, who has been conservative in her estimates, may, however, use some of the receipts for spending to ensure that the Indian economy , which is expected to grow 7% this year, remains resilient in the medium term by investing in areas that need attention.","The first Budget of Narendra Modi ’s third term will be presented on July 23.

"Eye on China, desi light tank Zorawar to be ready by 2027",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eye-on-china-desi-light-tank-zorawar-to-be-ready-by-2027/articleshow/111544031.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's very own light tank , designed under ' Project Zorawar ' for high-altitude warfare in places like eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh , is expected to be ready for induction into the Army by 2027.The light tank, developed by DRDO and private sector company L&T, will have to undergo a series of summer and winter trials, including in deserts and high-altitude areas, over the next two to three years before the entire acquisition, production and induction process can actually begin.The need for such tanks, each weighing around 25 tonnes with a high power-to-weight ratio as well as superior firepower and protection, has been driven home by the continuing military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh, which is into its fifth year now.Reviewing the first prototype of the light tank at Hazira in Gujarat on Saturday, DRDO chairperson Samir Kamat told journalists it was ""a momentous day"" to see it in action. The prototype, designed and developed in a short period of 24 to 30 months, is an example of what can be achieved when the DRDO and industry work together. The light tank should be ready for induction, after ""developmental and user (Army) trials"", by 2027, he added.The Army's case for 354 such tanks, which will cost an estimated Rs 17,500 crore, was given preliminary approval or ""acceptance of necessity"" by the Rajnath Singh-led Defence Acquisitions Council in Dec 2022.While 59 of these light tanks are reserved for DRDO, which has L&T as the ""lead system integrator"", the rest 295 are to be manufactured under the govt-funded design and development 'Make-1' category, which is open to companies other than L&T as well, as was first reported by TOI.A DRDO official said the agile and versatile light tank will be capable of operations in the ""most challenging environment in the world with minimal logistic support"", including high-altitude areas along the northern borders with China.""Due to its lighter weight, the tank has high strategic mobility. It can be transported by air and is capable of amphibious operations. It can fire at high angles of elevation and perform the role of limited artillery,"" he added.The over 11-lakh strong Army had managed to deploy some of its heavier Russian-origin T-90S and T-72 main-battle tanks (40 to 50 tonne each) in eastern Ladakh after the confrontation with China erupted in May 2020. The PLA also inducted a large number of technologically advanced mix of medium and light tanks, including the new third-generation Type-15 ones.The T-90S and T-72 tanks, however, are geared for operations in plains and deserts, and thereby have limitations in high-altitude areas ranging from 11,000 to almost 17,000-feet. ""Consequently, the need arose for light tanks that are more manoeuvrable and operationally flexible in mountains,"" an officer said.","The light tank, developed by DRDO and private sector company L&T, will have to undergo a series of summer and winter trials, including in deserts and high- altitude areas.

Counselling for NEET-UG to begin after July 3rd week: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/counselling-for-neet-ug-to-begin-after-july-3rd-week-government/articleshow/111547109.cms,"NEW DELHI: NEET-UG counselling , the process for allotment of seats to successful candidates based on their exam score, will start after the third week of July, govt said on Saturday.The clarification came in the wake of allegations that the govt had deferred the counselling process, which was scheduled to commence on Saturday. It said since no date has been fixed, the question of deferment of the process did not arise.As the opposition, including Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, attacked the govt on the issue, govt said that even last year NEET-UG counselling began on July 20.“The counselling schedule for NEET-UG and PG is announced by the Medical Counselling Committee on its website on the basis of completion of the exam process and finalisation of the seat matrix by the National Medical Commission . For the year 2024, NMC has communicated its schedule for finalisation of the seat matrix for UG and PG seats in the last week of June, indicating that it will finalise the UG seat matrix by third week of July and PG seat matrix by mid-August. MCC will accordingly notify the counselling schedules.”The NEET seat matrix provides students with information regarding the state-wise distribution of seats, cutoff scores, and courses each medical institution provides.The NEET-UG exam has been mired in controversy this year due to an alleged paper leak. Several arrests have been made by CBI, which is probing the case.Supreme Court is also seized of the matter as multiple petitions have been filed before it, including those seeking cancellation of the exam and a court-monitored probe. The next hearing on the matter is likely on Monday.Sources said pendency of the case could be one of the reasons behind the delay in announcement of the NEET-UG counselling schedule. Normally, when a matter is sub judice and the case is likely to be taken up in the coming few days, the govt and its authorities prefer to wait for the court’s hearing.There are approximately 1.2 lakh undergraduate medical seats across govt and private medical colleges in the country. This year, more than 23 lakh students appeared for NEET-UG, which was held on May 5. The results were declared on June 4. It was found that as many as 67 students had scored the perfect score of 720, which was suspicious as only a few students were able to get it in previous years – leading to a huge controversy and investigation.","The clarification came in the wake of allegations that the govt had deferred the counselling process, which was scheduled to commence on Saturday.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: The Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) tested out its light battle tank Zorawar in Gujarat's Hazira on Saturday.Zorawar has been developed jointly by the DRDO and Larsen and Toubro . The tank project being developed for the Indian Army was reviewed by DRDO chief Dr Samir V Kamat.""It's indeed a momentous day for all of us to see the light tank in action.It makes me happy and proud. It's indeed an example ... in a short period of two years to two and a half years, we have not only designed this tank but made a first prototype and now the first prototype will undergo development trials over the next six months, and then we will be ready to offer it to our users for user trials .... Zorawar is expected to be inducted into the Indian Army by 2027 after all trials,"" said Kamat.The tank has been developed by the DRDO to meet the Indian Army’s requirements in the eastern Ladakh sector to counter the Chinese deployment across the Line of Actual Control.The tank with its lightweight and amphibious capabilities can travel through steep climbs in mountains and cross rivers and other water bodies much more easily than the heavy-weight T-72 and T-90 tanks. As per the DRDO chief, the tank is expected to be inducted into the Indian Army by 2027.Commenting on the unique features of Zorawar, ⁠DRDO tank lab director Rajesh Kumar said, ""Generally there are three different types of tanks. There are three categories depending on the weight. The heavy tanks, the medium tanks and the light tanks. Each one has its role. One is for protection, one is for offence and these light tanks play a mixed role. What is unique about this tank is the weight as well as the combination of the fundamental parameters of a tank, which is the fire, power, mobility and protection. All three are optimized in such a way that the weight is also maintained. At the same time, you are getting all the parameters.""The Zorawar is a light-tank designed to provide the Indian Army with enhanced capabilities in high-altitude areas like Ladakh. It is named after the 19th century Dogra General Zorawar Singh, who led military expeditions to Ladakh and Western Tibet.The Zorawar is designed to be light, maneuverable, and transportable by air, while still maintaining substantial firepower, protection, surveillance and communication capabilities.It weighs just 25 tons, half the weight of heavier tanks like the T-90, allowing it to operate in difficult mountain terrain that is inaccessible to larger tanks.The Indian Army has placed an initial order for 59 Zorawar tanks, with plans to potentially procure a total of 354 light tanks. The Zorawar will help balance the scales against China's existing fleet of lightweight mountain tanks, like the Type 15, which have a significant advantage in the high altitudes of Ladakh.The induction of the Zorawar light tank will provide the Indian Army with a critical capability to rapidly deploy and maneuver in the high-altitude regions of Ladakh and other border areas. Its combination of mobility, firepower and advanced systems will enhance India's overall military posture against China in these strategically important sectors.","The Zorawar is a light-tank designed to provide the Indian Army with enhanced capabilities in high-altitude areas like Ladakh.

From Lucknow to London and Dumraon to Dubai, connoisseurs of food still talk about the legend of kalanamak rice, named so because of its black husk.Known for its extraordinary fragrance that is said to have drawn herds of deer out of jungle and a lightness that would allow one to gorge on it and yet never feel full, kalanamak rice was once quintessential part of dinner time stories shared at dastarkhwans of Awadh and in the royal kitchens of Banaras. But as decades went by and human greed gave way to guile, the elusive rice variety – known particularly for its health benefits – lost its acreage as much as it lost its famed qualities and gradually confined itself to myths and stories. Efforts of a few dedicated individuals, including scientists, and the Uttar Pradesh government led to the revival of the elusive rice variety in the past two decades.It was awarded the Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2013 which recognized Siddharth Nagar and the adjacent districts as the area where it is grown. Later, under the One District One Product (ODOP) scheme, kalanamak rice was exported from Siddharth Nagar district to Singapore and a few other Asian destinations. The rice variety also earned the Prime Minister’s award for Excellence in Public Administration 2021 and featured in the book ‘Speciality Rice of the World’ by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.It’s heartening to see that a lost rice variety has finally made it to many organic outlets. It is also available on Amazon and other online platforms. And yet, the pricey packs you stumble upon in fancy outlets or online are more likely to leave you wanting. Counterfeit and adulteration are rampant as little is known or understood about kalanamak rice. This writer travelled to the remote locations associated with the cultivation and history of this rice variety and spoke to scientists, academicians and farmers to bring you the truth straight from the farm.Kalanamak, known as kalonunia in Bengal where it is regarded as the ‘prince of rice’ and is often used in veneration, has a history directly connected to Lord Buddha.The history of rice cultivation in India is as old as agriculture itself. While the first evidence of agriculture is found in Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in Pakistan’s Balochistan, where wheat, cotton and barley seeds were conclusively discovered by archaeologists, first variety of wild rice were found closer home in Uttar Pradesh, in the Belan river valley of Prayagraj district. While Mehrgarh is dated approximately 8000-6000BC, carbon dating of rice grains established 7000 BC as the time of rice cultivation in Koldihwa and Mahagara archaeological sites, both on the opposite banks of Belan river, in Prayagraj district. Both sites are earliest examples of oryza sativa (Latin for rice cultivation), a rice variety first domesticated in the Yangtze river basin in China 13,500 to 8,200 years ago.In Harappan culture, the site of Lothal has been associated with rice cultivation. The Rig Veda doesn’t mention rice, but Yajura Veda does, where it is often mentioned as ‘dhannya’. Sayana (14th century, Vijayanagar Empire) in his commentary on the Vedas uses the term ‘tandula’ for rice.The Ramayana has several mentions of rice. In the Mahabharata, Krishna gifts a vessel, called akshay patra, to Draupadi that would always be filled with rice.Kalanamak rice made its debut in Indian history with Gautam Buddha in his own land. When Siddhartha returned to his father’s kingdom, Kapilvastu (between the present-day Piparhawa in Siddharth Nagar and Kapilvastu district of Nepal), he was greeted by villagers at a place. According to the account of Chinese traveller Fa Hien (early 5th century), the people of Mathla village, near Bajaha jungle, asked Gautam Buddha for prasad or holy food, and he gave them grains to grow in marshy areas. According to Fa Hein, Buddha famously said, “The rice will carry a fragrance that will remind you of me.”According to farmers, even today, the kalanamak rice variety grown between Bajaha village and Piparhawa – the place where a portion of Gautam Buddha’s ashes were discovered in a relic casket by British engineer and landowner William Claxton Peppé in 1897 – which is merely a distance of around seven kilometres on the Indo-Nepal border, has a distinctly better fragrance and taste than the rice variety grown elsewhere in the region.Piparhawa is just 15 kilometres from Nepal’s Lumbini where an Ashokan pillar marking the site to be Buddha’s birthplace was discovered in 1896.There is little doubt in the fact that kalanamak rice had a direct connection to both Gautam Buddha and his father’s kingdom. According to the GI registry, grains similar to kalanamak were found from excavation sites at Aligarhwa, located on the Nepal border in Siddharth Nagar – identified as the territory of Buddha’s father, king Shuddodhana. The name, Shuddhodhana, in Sanskrit, stands for ‘pure rice’.The accidental discovery of Buddha’s relics by Peppé in 1897 took the world by storm and all details of the findings and related research were compiled in what is now known as the Piparhawa Project. However, it’s intriguing to note that there are little details of what Peppé, an estate manager and private landowner, was doing in Birdpur for a living.According to the Asian-Agri History Foundation, the first effort at conserving kalanamak was made by the British who built reservoirs in the area to increase its production. Besides William Peppé, J H Humphrey, and Edcan Walker (zamindars of Birdpur, Alidapur and Mohana, respectively during the British Raj) led these conservation efforts.They built ten reservoirs in the area to produce kalanamak in large quantities. They not only produced this variety for themselves but to transport it to many countries from the nearby Uska Bazar mandi, passing through Dhaka (now in Bangladesh) via the sea route.Local farmers still point out to irrigation canals dug by these Britishers to ensure water supply to rice cultivators at all times of the year. According to village elders, they would personally ride through villages and monitor that the canals had proper flow of water to be able to reach the fields where kalanamak rice was being grown. As a result of their efforts, the rice variety had also begun to be grown in the neighbouring Basti and Gorakhpur back then.Of these, Peppés had a larger influence, and their name is still part of the local folklore. Their house in Birdpur area is still referred to as ‘sahib ki kothi’ and a larger market town in the region is named after them. Initially called Peppéganj, it has since become Pipiganj. But the British landowners’ interest in kalanamak rice that also brought Marwari merchants to Uska Bazar in pre-Independent India didn’t go down well with farmers who were at the receiving end of their overenthusiasm.Dinesh Chaudhary, a kalanamak rice grower from Siddharth Nagar’s Majhauli village whose ancestors were contract kalanamak cultivators for the British, said, “The British were brutal in their approach and farmers were reluctant to grow this rice variety for them. They would often beat them up if the harvest wasn’t to their satisfaction. But saying no wasn’t an option in the days of the Raj. As a result, growing kalanamak became a symbol of their slavery, something the farmers here gave up soon after Independence.”A local folk song sung by children here in pre-Independent India, which is still at times crooned by village elders, summarises it all.(Oliver sahib plays golf,Peppé sahib checks grain quality;They chase and beat up contract farmers, And what a damn circus it was!)Agriculture scientist Ram Chet Chaudhary, who taught at Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University in Pusa, Bihar, before joining the United Nations to lead a team of scientists working on rice production, studied rice cultivation in various parts of the world as part of his job.After his retirement, Chaudhary, who worked closely with MS Swaminathan, returned to Gorakhpur, his native town, and got involved in the conservation and development of kalanamak rice. By that time (1990s), the area of its cultivation had fallen to less than 2000 hectares, from 50,000 hectares at the time of Independence.“Growing kalanamak wasn’t an easy job for the farmers here. The rice variety needs marshy land, and the paddy grows up to a height of six feet which makes it lodge. Only those having land in the terai region could grow this variety and the yield was less and far from profitable,” he said.Chaudhary and his team of scientists examined the carbonized rice grains found in the eastern mound at Piparhawa along with Buddha’s relics.“I wanted to determine the qualities of the original kalanamak rice and match it with the ones that farmers were growing at that time,” Chaudhary said. He began to visit villages between Bajaha and Piparhawa in Siddharth Nagar district to collect seed samples from the farmers engaged in growing this rice variety. After 1998, he collected 250 germplasm (rice samples), characterized these, and selected the best ones for testing at the state government’s regional testing facility.Just one of these samples came close to the ancient rice samples found at Piparhawa. Since it was sample number 3, it was named Kalanamak KN3. “The sample came from a farmer named Phoolchand in Ghoswa village, barely 2 km from Mathla village in Bajaha where Buddha is said to have given seeds to farmers as prasad,” Chaudhary said.Phoolchand’s ancestors were engaged in cultivation of this variety. They were also enrolled by the Peppé family to grow rice for them. “Traditionally, our ancestors used seeds from their own harvest and never took seeds from anywhere else. This may have preserved our crop against genetic impurities,” Phoolchand said. After years of research, KN 3 was released by the state govt in 2007 and notified by the Centre for cultivation to the farmers in 2010. “Farmers liked the aroma and the grain quality of KN 3 still avoided growing KN 3 as its long strand was prone to bending which affected its yield,” RC Chaudhary said.Chaudhary started working on it to develop a better variety of KN 3 which could be profitable for the farmers at his organisation, Participatory Rural Development Foundation. He crossed KN 3 with an improved Sambha Masuri, another fragrant rice variety, to develop two other rice varieties – Bauna (dwarf) Kalanamak 101 and Bauna Kalanamak 102.These had shorter plant height but were not on a par with KN 3 in terms of fragrance and texture.In 2019, Chaudhary was successful in the notification and official release of Kalanamak Kiran variety which resulted in three-fold yield. Farmers showed readiness as Kalanamak Kiran was profitable and the state govt’s One District One Product (ODOP) and PKVY schemes helped in branding it better. In 2013, Chaudhary’s efforts led to grant of a Geographical Indications (GI) tag for the ancient rice variety, signifying its association with 11 districts – Bahraich, Balrampur, Basti, Deoria, Gonda, Gorakhpur, Kushinagar, Maharajganj, Sant Kabir Nagar, Siddharthnagar and Shrawasti.By 2023, the kalanamak cultivation had increased to 80,000 hectares in these 11 districts.Chaudhary was recently awarded Padma Shri by President Droupadi Murmu for his efforts to conserve this rare rice variety.In 2022, Indian Agriculture Research Institute successfullydeveloped and tested two new dwarf varieties: Pusa Narendra Kalanamak 1638 and Pusa Narendra Kalanamak 1652, in UP.Kalanamak rice is rich in micronutrients such as iron (four-times the normal rice variety) and zinc (16.97ppm). It has 11% protein, almost double that of common rice varieties. It has a low Glycaemic Index (49% to 52%) making it “sugar-free” and suitable for diabetics. Besides, it has low amylose (21%, against 24% in normal rice varieties) and has beta carotene present in its grain (.42mg), something that’s absent in the grains of other rice varieties (according to analysis done at R-FRAC, dept of horticulture, UP. Chaudhary et al., 2021). The central government came out with its Nutri-Farm scheme in 2013, intending to promote food crops that offer critical micronutrients to improve the nutrition status of the vulnerable section of society. Kalanamak rice was the only rice from north India to be selected as a nutri-crop for this scheme. Under the state govt’s ODOP scheme, kalanamak rice was branded as ‘Buddha Home rice’ and exported to Singapore in 2021.The name caught the fancy of Buddhist nations and this rice variety is now being regularly re-exported to Japan, Malaysia, Cambodia, and a few other Southeast Asian countries.A few other measures were also taken at the grassroots level. To address farmers’ issues, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) that nurture the growth of the farmers in the district by providing forward and backward linkages were formed. Each FPO had seed-providers as members which helped them estimate demand so that they could provide adequate supply. A common facility centre for kalanamak processing was developed and farmers were provided linkages for sale on various platforms, including e-commerce sites like Amazon and Flipkart.But with branding came bad practices. Middlemen began to procure rice from farmers, mix them with other rice varieties of similar grain size and sell them in open markets as well as on online platforms. As a result, out of ten packs of kalanamak rice one purchased online or even in stores, nine turned out to be fake, or heavily adulterated. The govt will have to develop a mechanism to check bad practices in kalanamak trade in due course of time.With the extension of kalanamak rice cultivation in 11 districts of eastern UP, the fragrance and texture of the rice have taken a tumble as compared to original KN 3, the heritage rice variety. RC Chaudhary said, “I have heard about such issues. KN 3 is the heritage rice variety with traces of wild rice qualities. Besides, terrain, soil and climate of the particular area each play a part in rice cultivation. Our research is far from over. The good thing is that people are talking about, growing and getting to eat the kalanamak rice variety.” The French used a word for wine quality, ‘terroir’, which is the complete natural environment in which a particular wine is produced, including factors such as the soil, topography, and climate. Perhaps, ‘terroir’ plays a role in kalanamak rice cultivation too. While agricultural research and govt’s efforts have expanded area of cultivation and brought it out of fables to the food tables, the fragrance of Buddha still pervades the land he once walked.","Kalanamak rice was once quintessential part of dinner time stories shared at dastarkhwans of Awadh and in the royal kitchens of Banaras. But as decades went by and human greed gave way to guile, the elusive rice variety – known particularly for its health benefits – lost its acreage. Efforts of a few dedicated individuals, including scientists, and the Uttar Pradesh government led to the revival of the rice variety in the past two decades.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111547552,imgsize-77284,width-400,resizemode-4/111547552.jpg"

The country at present has more than 8.5 lakh cooperative societies with a member base of nearly 30 crore. The cooperatives are engaged in varied activities like dairying, fisheries, agro-processing, credit, housing, weaving and marketing.Shah said his ministry has taken many important steps for the cooperative sector and the government has set a target that there should not be any state or district in the country where there is not a viable district cooperative bank and a viable district milk producer union.Emphasising on promoting ‘cooperation among cooperative’ institutions, the minister said if all the economic transactions of the cooperative sector were done within the cooperative sector itself, then there won't be any need to bring a single penny from outside the cooperative sector.He urged every PACS and other cooperative institutions to open their account in the District Cooperative Bank or State Cooperative Bank, saying the move will not only strengthen the cooperative sector but also increase capital and confidence.","The new policy will seek to further strengthen cooperative movement in the country by deepening its reach up to the grassroots.

BMRCL: Silk Board Double-Decker Flyover: Commuters Demand Immediate Opening,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/double-decker-flyover-awaits-vip-launch-commuters-irked/articleshow/111443589.cms,"BENGALURU: Commuters facing daily traffic woes at Silk Board junction have one demand: Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd ( BMRCL ) must open to motorists the lower deck of the rail-cum-road double-decker flyover between Ragigudda and Silk Board and three ramps at Silk Board junction without further delay.They argue that if the road infrastructure is ready, there should be no reason for delaying the opening, as formal inauguration by VIPs shouldn’t be a priority.Last year, BMRCL had to drop its plans to formally launch two stations of the Purple Line at Challaghatta and Benniganahalli after public outrage. The stations were operationalised and virtually inaugurated at a later stage.As part of Yellow Line Metro, BMRCL has built a 3km road-cum-rail flyover from Ragigudda to Silk Board. Initially, BMRCL planned to open the road infrastructure to vehicle users by the end of 2023, but the deadline was revised to May 2024 and then pushed to June. It is said the Metro authority is awaiting approval from the central and state govts, both partners in BMRCL, to set a formal opening date.While the lower deck was ready 1.5 years ago, construction of the ramps at Silk Board junction was finished recently. At present, the infrastructure is partially ready to accommodate traffic flow from Ragigudda and BTM Layout side to HSR Layout and Hosur Road. Work to ready the flyover to accommodate traffic flow in the opposite direction will take another year for completion.The alignment of the flyover passes through Jayadeva hospital junction, where the city’s tallest Metro station — providing interchange facilities for the upcoming Yellow and Pink lines — has been built. At Silk Board, BMRCL has built three ramps traversing over a flyover located at the junction. These ramps will allow motorists coming from Ragigudda and BTM Layout to reach HSR Layout (ORR side) and Electronics City (Hosur Road) without stopping at the signal.In 2016-17, BMRCL modified the design of the elevated Metro corridor to accommodate the city’s first double-decker flyover. The road infrastructure has cost Rs 449 crore.Those travelling from Jayanagar and Bannerghatta Road to Silk Board endured daily traffic snarls for years during the construction work. In 2019, BMRCL demolished the Jayadeva flyover to facilitate the work, and traffic diversions were put in place for years.Transport minister Ramalinga Reddy, who also represents BTM Layout assembly constituency, said, “As per the information I have, the road infrastructure is ready. BMRCL is waiting for consent from the ministry of housing and ministry of urban development for its formal inauguration. The road flyover and ramps at Silk Board will ease congestion on this busy corridor. Once the ramps from HSR Layout towards BTM Layout get ready, congestion will drastically come down at the junction.”BMRCL officials remained tight-lipped on the issue. A senior official simply stated, “The date of opening the road infrastructure will be communicated shortly.”","BMRCL has built a 3km road-cum-rail flyover from Ragigudda to Silk Board.

Banks on alert! The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has cautioned banks across the nation to be vigilant against potential cyberattacks , following credible intelligence reports. Banks have been instructed to actively monitor their systems round the clock to detect any threats.In an advisory issued on June 24, the RBI said, ""In the light of credible threat intelligence received regarding potential cyberattacks, regulated entities are advised to put in place enhanced state of surveillance and resilience capabilities to guard against these threats.""According to an ET report, RBI's communication preceded a social media post suggesting that LulzSec , a group notorious for several high-profile attacks, was targeting Indian banks.The group, which was thought to have become inactive, is said to have resurfaced.Banks are required to continuously monitor network activities and server logs to identify any malicious intrusions. Additionally, they must keep a close watch on critical payment systems, including SWIFT (the messaging system for international fund transfers), card networks (facilitating card payments), and domestic real-time fund transfer frameworks such as RTGS, NEFT, and UPI.RBI has issued a reminder to banks, urging them to implement standard controls to safeguard against threats such as DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. These attacks involve hackers launching a coordinated assault on a bank's systems, overwhelming them with a flood of queries that hinder the processing of legitimate customer requests and transactions on the website and online services.In addition to DDoS protection, banks are required to impose restrictions on remote logins and access to critical systems.

Typically, when there is some hint of a possible cyberattack, banks simultaneously test the efficacy of their continuity and contingency plans.

5G rollout resulted in increase in median mobile speed

The government has refuted misleading claims that it allowed Reliance Jio , Airtel and Vodafone Idea to unilaterally announce tariff hikes without any regulation. All three telecom players recently increased the price of their prepaid and postpaid plans that came into effect starting July 3, 2024.In an official press release, the regulatory body said that with three private sector players and one public sector player, the current mobile services market operates through the market forces of demand and supply.The rates of telecommunication services , the release said are decided by market forces, within the regulatory framework notified by the independent regulator ie. TRAI or Telecom Regulatory Authority of India .“The Government does not intervene in the free market decisions as the functionality is under the domain of TRAI and tariffs are under forbearance,” it stated. “Any change in the tariff of mobile services is notified by TSPs to the TRAI, which monitors, that such changes are within the prescribed regulatory framework.”In the official release, the government highlighted how Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have increased the prices of mobile services after more than 2 years.“In last 2 years, some of the TSPs have invested heavily in rolling out the 5G services across the country. This has resulted into a significant increase in median mobile speed to the level of 100 Mbps and jump in the India’s international rank from 111, in October 2022, to 15 today.”“While protecting the interests of subscribers, for the orderly growth of the telecommunication sector, which includes investments in latest technologies like 5G, 6G, IoT/ M2M for Industry 4.0 etc., “the financial viability of the sector is important,” said the TRAI.","Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea recently announced tariff hikes.

Carambolim residents are keeping a close watch on a weak stretch of the Kuvoll-Kator bundh that has partly cracked after the first monsoon showers, as a few low-lying houses appear vulnerable to flooding if it gives way.The bundh repair had been carried out by the soil conservation division of the agriculture department through a contractor at a cost of Rs 5 crore earlier this year.Earth (red mud) had been dumped over an age-old traditional clay bundh and a retaining wall had been built to keep the filling in place.But portions of the bundh started collapsing even during construction, as trucks had to move over the completed portion to transport earth for the extension.“Several houses at Dhado-Dongri, Patto, and Copem (in southeastern Carambolim) are in danger of being flooded as the bundh appears weak,” a villager said.The village’s thickly populated stretches with three-fourths of agricultural land in the biggest Tiswadi khazan have habitations on the edge of fields. “Though 70% of Carambolim’s land is agricultural, most of it has been submerged for nearly two decades,” a farmer said.No agricultural activities have been possible due to breaches and fragile condition of the main bundh — a protective barrier between the Cumbharjua canal and the khazan lands from Agasaim to Banastarim and beyond.“The Kuvoll-Kator bundh is part of the network of sluice gates and waterbodies called Panch Manos,” the farmer said. “If it rains heavily for days, the bundh with cracks may collapse and the flood level may rise in low areas.”The collapse of a bundh stretch in mid-June sparked a debate among locals over the quality and methodology of repairs. “The mud was not properly compacted before building a retaining wall, which could have had a deeper foundation,” another resident said.The agriculture department has taken note of the villagers’ concerns. “The contractor has carried out preventive measures on our direction,” an official said.Trucks carrying mud during repairs also caused the flattening of the bundh. “The contractor could have waited to build the retaining wall. However, he tried to keep to the deadline,” the official said.But he said that the contractor is tied by a two-year maintenance clause to carry out repairs at his own cost.Both construction material and construction technique need special attention in the context of sustainable practices, Elsa Fernandes, an environmental architect said. “These should be made options in standard designs for khazan areas or the arbitrary approach currently used will drain resources — of finance and biodiversity,” she said.",Carambolim residents are keeping a close watch on a weak stretch of the Kuvoll- Kator bundh that has partly cracked after the first monsoon showers.

However, one superstar, Solo Sikoa , took it a step further by challenging Roman Reigns and vying for the Tribal Chief position. In Roman's absence, Sikoa has been managing the Bloodline , and he recently issued a direct challenge to the former WWE Champion with some harsh words.Check out Solo's message to Roman Reigns below.Here's what Solo Sikoa said:""This...is an Ula Fala. This makes me the Tribal Chief.” ""This is not what I wanted, but this is what my family needed. Roman Reigns was not man enough to defend our Title at WrestleMania. He was not man enough to defend our legacy against Cody Rhodes and his legacy. Therefore he shall no longer call himself the Tribal Chief because I'm the Tribal Chief now. And I'm going to take back our WWE Undisputed Title from Cody Rhodes.""Sikoa then addressed Roman directly, stating that if Roman ever returns and wants the Title back, he will face a fierce challenge. Sikoa said, ""And if Roman Reigns wants that back, he can try and take it from me, because I am going to show everyone in the Money in the Bank six-man tag match. Cody Rhodes, I am coming for you, and you will acknowledge me."" Then the Ula Fala is placed around Sikoa's neck and the video ends.Solo Sikoa has openly challenged both Roman and Cody, expressing confidence in taking the WWE title from Cody. This marks the beginning of a war between Roman and Solo, as Roman will not tolerate such disrespect. After what Solo did to Paul Heyman, Roman will not spare him. Additionally, questions about Roman's contributions to his family's legacy will further trigger him.The entire WWE Universe recognizes Roman's significant contributions to his family's legacy, far surpassing Solo's. This tension could lead to a Civil War between The Bloodline and The Bloodline 2.0. Roman has always credited his family's accomplishments, including legendary wrestlers like Rikishi and Sika. By questioning Roman's efforts, Sikoa has made a grave mistake. Now, the conflict between Solo and Roman is personal, and anything could happen. These men will clash for the position of Tribal Chief and their family's legacy.","Solo Sikoa has openly challenged both Roman and Cody, expressing confidence in taking the WWE title from Cody.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
105-year-old woman graduates from Stanford University after 83-year hiatus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/105-year-old-woman-graduates-from-stanford-university-after-83-year-hiatus/articleshow/111548001.cms,"Virginia Hislop, a 105-year-old woman , recently returned to Stanford University after an 83-year hiatus to receive her master's degree in education . She first enrolled at Stanford in 1936 as an undergraduate student. Hislop continued her studies at Stanford to pursue a graduate degree while teaching, but her plans were interrupted when her future husband was called to serve during World War II in 1941, Fox news reported.She left campus before graduating to get married and moved around the country as an Army wife before settling in Yakima, Washington, with her family.Although Hislop did not return to teaching, she utilized her teaching certificate to serve on committees and boards, striving to enhance educational opportunities whenever possible. She became a member of the local school board when she was dissatisfied with the suggestion of a home economics course for her daughter Anne instead of advanced English.Hislop went on to serve as a founding board member for Yakima Valley Community College and helped raise funds for Heritage University in Toppenish, Washington. In 2017, she even established the Virginia Hislop Emergency Fund scholarship at Pacific Northwest University of Health Sciences.During the recent graduation ceremony, Daniel Schwartz, dean of Stanford's Graduate School of Education, praised Hislop as a ""fierce advocate for equality"" and expressed his pride in conferring her Master of Arts in education degree. Schwartz revealed that Hislop's participation in the ceremony might not have been possible without her son-in-law's inquiry about bestowing her with an honorary degree. Upon discovering Hislop's original transcripts from 1941, Schwartz realized that her completed coursework satisfied the current requirements for a master's degree, making an honorary degree unnecessary.The moment Hislop received her degree was cherished by her, her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, as she remarked, ""I've waited a long time for this.""Since her graduation, people online have been expressing their admiration for her achievements, praising her sharp mind at her age and offering congratulations and blessings for many more years to come.","Virginia Hislop, a 105-year-old woman, recently returned to Stanford University after an 83-year hiatus to receive her master's degree in education.

Last year, she managed a winning 39-and-a-half hot dogs in 10 minutes.Sudo’s previous personal best came in 2020 when she chowed down on a whopping 48.5 dogs in the beef-eating competition.With the event's biggest star —- Joey “Jaws” Chestnut — out of the contest this year, Sudo’s result set up a possible scenario in which the women’s champ out-eats the men’s winner. Geoffrey Esper, who came second last year, also has a personal best of 51, but only ate 49 last year.Chestnut, who won 16 out of the previous 17 contests, isn't attending the competition over a sponsorship tiff. Instead, he'll compete against soldiers at a U.S. Army base in El Paso later in the day.

ESPN is broadcasting the contest live. The men’s will begin at approximately 12:20 p.m.Competitors are coming from over a dozen states and five continents, with prospects from Brazil, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Australia and the Czech Republic vying for the coveted title and $10,000 prize money.“There's going to be a new champion,” Australian James Webb, who holds a world record for eating 70 doughnuts in eight minutes, said at a preview event in New York on Wednesday.Last year Chestnut, of Indiana, chewed his way to the title by downing 62 dogs and buns in 10 minutes.

Canada Police believes that the gold stolen last year in Canada's biggest-ever gold heist must have gone to India and Dubai gold markets. Over 6,500 gold bars disappeared overseas after being stolen from an airport, the department believes. ""We believe a large portion has gone overseas to markets that are flush with gold,"" lead investigator Det. Sgt. Mike Mavity said.""That would be Dubai, or India, where you can take gold with serial numbers on it, and they will still honor it and melt it down,"" the investigator said.Nine individuals were arrested in connection with the meticulously planned heist including a former Air Canada manager and a jewelry store owner. The suspects used a completed bill for a seafood pick-up to forge paperwork that was given to a warehouse attendant. A small amount of precious metal was probably melted down in the basement of a Mississauga jewelry store immediately after the heist. Only 90,000 Canadian dollars were recovered from the heist.Canada cops described the heist as Netflix material as a lot of daring planning went behind it. The robbery was staged in an Air Canada cargo facility within the Toronto Pearson International Airport.A man gained entry to an Air Canada cargo terminal with a duplicate waybill for a shipment of seafood and then drove off with a palette full of gold bars. The heist was busted a year later. India-origin men Parmpal Sidhu, Archit Grover, Amit Jalota were among the arrested.The gold container arrived on the Air Canada flight from Switzerland to Toronto. It had 22 million Canadian dollars in gold bars and foreign currency. A day after the cargo arrived, it was reported missing. Police said at least two former Air Canada employees assisted the theft.Parmpal Sidhu was working at the Air Canada Cargo terminal during the heist; Archit Grover is a longtime friend of Sidhu and Amit Jalota is Grover's cousin.","Over 6,500 gold bars disappeared overseas after being stolen from an airport.

That compares with $1.29 in Amsterdam, $1.23 in Paris, and $1.08 in Melbourne, according to data collected by Bloomberg.An 18% tax was applied to packaged milk as part of taxation changes approved in the national budget last week. Previously, it was tax-exempt.Before the impost, which resulted in retail prices increasing by as much as 25%, milk costs were comparable with developing countries such as Vietnam and Nigeria, said Muhammad Nasir, a spokesman for the local unit of Dutch dairy producer Royal FrieslandCampina NV.Costlier milk will add to rising inflation in the South Asian country, where wages have stagnated, eroding spending power. The increase may also worsen child health. About 40% of the nation lives in poverty.“It will deny nutrition from a population that is already suffering from malnutrition,” Nasir said in a text message. About 60% of Pakistani children under 5 years suffer anemia and 40% suffer from stunting.Pakistan raised taxes by 40%, the highest on record, in last week’s budget aimed at meeting conditions set by the International Monetary Fund for a new bailout.","Ultra-high temperature, or UHT, milk now costs 370 rupees ($1.33) a liter in supermarkets in Karachi.
