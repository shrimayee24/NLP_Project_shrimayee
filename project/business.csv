NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Wednesday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft until September 23, prolonging the restrictions for another month amid continuing tensions between the two countries.The Pakistan Airports Authority confirmed the move in a fresh Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), stating, “All aircraft operated by Indian airlines will not be allowed to use Pakistani airspace. The ban also remains in place for military and civilian aircraft that are Indian-owned or leased.”The restrictions were first imposed on April 23 for one month following the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India retaliated on April 30 by announcing a reciprocal closure of its airspace to Pakistani aircraft and airlines.Since then, both sides have repeatedly extended the curbs. On May 23, Pakistan prolonged its ban after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. Another NOTAM later extended the closure from June 23 to July 24, stating, “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators including military flights.”The tit-for-tat measures have left carriers from both countries barred from flying over each other’s territory, with every extension keeping the restrictions in place.",Pakistan extends its airspace ban on Indian aircraft until September 23.

SC frowns on governments hiring temp staffers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-frowns-on-governments-hiring-temp-staffers/articleshow/123420796.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Deprecating the practice of Centre and states not appointing permanent employees and getting their work done by temporary and daily-wage staff, Supreme Court on Tuesday said governments should behave like a ""constitutional employer"" and not like a mere market player.It directed the UP government to regularise from 2002 the services of class 3 and 4 employees who have been working for the state Education Services Selection Commission, reports AmitAnand ChoudharyA bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said govts should not invoke budgetary constraints to justify ad-hocism. The state, as a constitutional employer, should maintain a higher standard.The state, as a constitutional employer, deal with perennial work on a sanctioned footing, creating a budget for the purpose, Supreme Court held.""We think it necessary to recall the state (here referring to both the Union and the State govts) is not a mere market participant but a constitutional employer. It cannot balance budgets on backs of those who perform most basic and recurring public functions. Where work recurs day after day and year after year, the establishment must reflect that reality in its sanctioned strength and engagement practices. The long-term extraction of regular labour under temporary labels corrodes confidence in public administration and offends the promise of equal protection.Financial stringency certainly has a place in public policy, but it is not a talisman that overrides fairness, reason and the duty to organise work on lawful lines,"" the bench said.SC passed the order on a petition seeking regularisation of jobs of people who had been performing peon/attendant duties for the commission since 1989. Allowing their plea, SC directed that their services be regularised from 2002, with arrears being paid until the date of regularisation/retirement/death, as the case may be.""It must necessarily be noted ad-hocism thrives where administration is opaque. The state departments must keep and produce accurate establishment registers, muster rolls and outsourcing arrangements, and they must explain, with evidence, why they prefer precarious engagement over sanctioned posts where the work is perennial. If constraint is invoked, the record should show what alternatives were considered, why similarly placed workers were treated differently, and how the chosen course aligns with Articles 14, 16 and 21 of the Constitution of India,"" the bench said.","Supreme Court criticises practice of Centre and states not appointing permanent employees.

NEW DELHI: Barely hours after its introduction on Wednesday, Lok Sabha passed a bill to not only prohibit online games played with money but also regulate, promote and encourage the sector to ensure a ""developed, safe and responsible"" digital environment for all citizens.The proposed legislation - Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 - was passed without a debate by a voice vote amid din as opposition members raised slogans demanding a discussion on Bihar SIR.Once the legislation becomes a law after being passed by RS and receiving presidential assent, offering or facilitating online money gaming will be punishable by jail of up to 3 years and/or a fine of up to Rs 1 crore.Moving the bill, Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said govt seeks to encourage e-sports and online social gaming that do not involve money and will set up an authority for the purpose. Vaishnaw introduced the bill amid sloganeering by opposition members during the first half, when the House assembled after the first adjournment.He said online money gaming has become a matter of concern as such platforms have led to addiction among youth and have also been used for fraud and cheating.Justifying the govt's move to ban online money gaming, the minister, in the statement of object and reasons of the bill, said the unchecked and widespread proliferation of such games, which are readily accessible through mobile devices and computers, and offer monetary returns in exchange for deposited funds has led to ""grave social, economic, and psychological consequences across the country"". tnn","The proposed legislation - Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 - was passed without a debate by a voice vote.

India must keep tight vigil along LAC: Army officials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-must-keep-tight-vigil-along-lac-army-officials/articleshow/123420651.cms,"Many PLA arms brigades still remain forward deployed



New Delhi: India will militarily have to be extremely alert on the ground if long-drawn de-escalation process with China kicks off in the coming months amid the ongoing Sino -Indian detente, against the backdrop of PLA having the requisite infrastructure in place to return swiftly to forward locations along the frontier.""The way China has built roads, bridges, tunnels and habitats along the entire LAC, from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal, over the last five years, PLA troops can easily afford to pull back 100-150km and then come back again in 2-3 hours,"" a senior Army officer told TOI.Our forces cannot. This huge time differential in mobilisation between the rival forces will have to be factored in during any de-escalation talks,a senior Army officer said.To be sure, India and China have as yet only decided to “discuss de-escalation, beginning with the principles and modalities thereof” during Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi’s visit this week. On the ground, the trust deficit between the rival armies, which have remained forward deployed with heavy weapons all along the 3,488-km LAC after multiple PLA incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020, remains “quite high”, though the situation is no longer on hair-trigger alert as before.The situation has stabilised after troop disengagement at the two remaining face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok last Oct. “There is no disruption in the coordinated patrolling by the rival soldiers there. But we cannot let our guard down since there has been no let-up in the PLA’s military preparedness and infrastructure build-up,” another officer said.While some of the PLA’s combined arms brigades have pulled back around 100 km from the LAC over the last few months, many still remain forward deployed along with its border defence regiments. Each CAB has around 4,500-5,000 soldiers with tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery and surface-to-air missile systems, among other weapon systems.De-escalation and de-induction of troops along the LAC will entail the return of all additional troops to their permanent peacetime locations. The two countries, meanwhile, are using existing border management mechanisms at the diplomatic and military levels to maintain peace along the LAC, stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. To this end, the two sides have now also decided to set up “general-level mechanisms” in the eastern (Sikkim, Arunachal) and middle (Uttarakhand, Himachal) sectors of the LAC, to add to the existing talks mechanism between the Indian 14 Corps commander and the South Xinjiang Military District chief in western (Ladakh) one.From the Indian side, it is likely to be the Lt-General commanding the Uttar Bharat (UB) Area based in Bareilly, which has been “combatised”, in the middle sector. Similarly, in the eastern one, it could be the Lt-Generals commanding the Dimapur-based 3 Corps or the Tezpur-based 4 Corps.In eastern Ladakh, the immediate priority would be the restoration of patrolling rights in areas where “no patrol buffer zones” were established to India’s disadvantage after previous rounds of disengagement till Sept 2022.There was supposed to be only “a temporary moratorium” on patrolling in these buffer zones at Galwan, north bank of Pangong Tso, Kailash Range and larger Gogra-Hot Springs area, varying from 3 km to 10 km, which came up on what India considers to be its own territory. But there has been no movement on the issue since then.","China has built roads, bridges, tunnels and habitats along the entire LAC.

Rain fury in Mumbai

NEW DELHI: IndiGo on Wednesday issued a travel advisory in the wake of heavy rain expected in Mumbai, which the airline said could ""lead to air traffic congestion and impact flight operations"".""While we want your journey to be as hassle-free as possible, Mother Nature has her own plans. With heavy rains expected again in Mumbai, there’s a chance this could lead to air traffic congestion and impact flight operations,"" the issue said.The IndiGo assured that any changes to the flight schedule will be shared with the passengers and urged them to spare extra time for the commute.""While we continue doing our best to keep operations smooth, we recommend planning ahead. Any changes to your flight schedule will be shared via your registered contact details, so do ensure they’re up to date. Check your flight status on our website or app before heading to the airport. And with waterlogging and slow-moving traffic likely, allow some extra time for your commute,"" the release by the airline said.On Tuesday, flight operations suffered partially in the city amid the heavy rains. From Monday midnight to 7 pm Tuesday, 11 flights were diverted to other airports, while 24 arriving flights were forced to abort landing and climb to make a second attempt at touchdown.The cascading delays hit flight schedules through the day, and worst hit were passengers booked on evening flights, with arrivals and departures delayed by an hour.Just like Monday, auto and taxi refusals were rampant. Power outages were witnessed in the suburbs. Kurla suffered as two substations of Adani Electricity shut down, affecting 1,000 families. Andheri, Jogeshwari, Kandivli, Ghatkopar, Vile Parle and Mira Road also saw power cuts.In one of the record number of diversions by BEST in recent years, 135 bus routes were diverted due to waterlogging on roads as heavy rain crippled Mumbai on Tuesday.The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) red alert for Tuesday proved spot-on as the city endured another day of intense rainfall, making this the wettest Aug in five years. So far, 891 mm of rain has been recorded, well above the average monthly rainfall of 560.8 mm. The last time Mumbai saw higher Aug rainfall was in the year 2020, when 1,240.1 mm was recorded.The monsoon season total has also crossed expectations, reaching 2,193.2 mm, surpassing the average of 2,101.8 mm.Rainfall data further indicates that this has been one of Mumbai’s longest intense rain spells in recent years. In the past 108 hours (Aug 15–19), the city received 837.3 mm, with three of the five days logging close to or over 200 mm. This exceeds the total rainfall of June (512.7 mm) and July (797.3 mm); July is normally considered the year’s wettest month.Tuesday’s downpour was clearly much more intense than Monday’s. The IMD Santacruz observatory recorded 163.4 mm rain in a nine-hour period between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm — more than Monday’s tally of 129.1 mm for the same period. Vikhroli too saw a sharp spike at 161.5 mm, up from 139.5 mm, while Juhu, Byculla and Bandra logged marginal increases. Colaba weather station also recorded 63 mm of rain in the same period compared to 55.4 mm the previous day.The 24-hour period ending 8.30 am on Aug 19 also saw some extremely heavy rain being recorded of over 300 mm in some pockets. Chincholi in Malad reported a staggering 361 mm, one of the highest across the city.Tuesday’s spell added to a rare pattern — Mumbai inching towards yet another 200 mm-plus rain day within less than a week, after logging 244 mm between Aug 15-16 and 238 mm on Aug 18–19. In the 12 hours ending 8.30 pm on Tuesday, the IMD Santacruz observatory had already recorded 171.2 mm of rain.The rain fury also spilled into the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, with Thane, Kalyan, Vasai and Virar reporting triple-digit showers. In the 24 hours ending 8.30 am on Aug 19, Vasai recorded 219 mm of rain while Navi Mumbai logged in 185 mm.The rain fury is expected to continue till Wednesday under an orange alert for Mumbai, with the IMD indicating some relief only from Thursday, when a yellow alert has been issued signalling reduced intensity.","IndiGo issues a travel advisory in the wake of heavy rain expected in Mumbai.

Russia Humiliates Trump With 5% Oil Discount To India Amid Fierce Sanctions Battle And Tariff War

Sanctions are hitting those who are imposing them: Babushkin

NEW DELHI: As external affairs minister S Jaishankar visited Moscow Wednesday for bilateral talks on trade and economic issues, Russian diplomats here defended energy ties with India and expressed confidence that both countries would handle challenges arising out of the US sanctions against India that they described as unjustified and extremely unfortunate.""It is a challenging situation for India. We enjoy trust in our partnership with India and are committed to addressing challenges in our energy ties,"" said Babushkin, adding Russia has a ""special mechanism"" to deal with any challenge on the sanction issue.Bloomberg quoted the Russian deputy trade representative here as saying that Moscow sells oil to India at about a 5% discount.The Russian embassy later said “regarding oil import prices amid tariffs, a 5% swing is possible subject to negotiation”.The Trump administration has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India to penalise it for oil purchase from Russia. The tariff comes into effect on Aug 27 and despite hopes of a peace agreement emerging from the Putin-Trump Alaska summit, India continues to be targeted by US officials for “profiteering” from Russian oil.“Russia is the biggest supplier to India of crude oil and India’s demands are growing. Certainly, this is a perfect case of mutual accommodation and complementarity of our economies,” said Babushkin.Last week, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent warned that the Trump administration may increase secondary tariffs on India if it continues to procure Russian crude oil. This week, he accused Indian companies of profiteering from Russian oil trade.“The sanctions are hitting those who are imposing them. We are confident that India-Russia energy cooperation will continue notwithstanding the external pressure,” Babushkin said, accusing the West of behaving like neo-colonial powers.“If hypothetically speaking, India refuses to procure Russian oil, it will not lead to mutually beneficial cooperation with the West,” the Russian diplomat said, adding bilateral trade is likely to reach $100 billion by 2030.Asked about American tariffs on Indian goods, he said the Russian market will welcome Indian exports. He also said the role of Brics as a stabilising force will increase amid the ongoing global turbulence.In terms of GDP, the size of the economy of Brics is about USD 77 trillion while it is USD 57 trillion for Group of Seven (G7) nations, he said, arguing that the Brics is emerging as a major economic power.","Russia sells oil to India at about a 5% discount.

Bill is in violation of presumption of innocence, says oppn in Lok Sabha



NEW DELHI: The ongoing acrimony between the opposition and the treasury, witnessed throughout the monsoon session of Parliament, reached a flashpoint in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday when Union home minister Amit Shah introduced the three bills that provide a legal framework for removing the Prime Minister, Union ministers, chief ministers, and ministers in states and Union territories arrested and detained on serious criminal charges.Shah said that the three legislations will be referred to a joint parliamentary committee for detailed scrutiny even as opposition MPs, essentially from Trinamool Congress and Congress, launched into aggressive protests and tore copies of the bills. They trooped into the well of the House, near Shah's front-row seat.Opposition MPs said the bills violated constitutional principles, undermined federalism, and inverted the principle of ""innocent until proven guilty."" They warned of potential misuse for political purposes and the risk of transforming India into a police state.Pandemonium broke out as soon as home minister Amit Shah sought to move the three bills — the Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill, 2025; the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025; and Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2025 — which propose that if the PM, ministers or CMs are arrested and detained for 30 days for offences carrying a jail term of at least five years, they will lose their positions on the 31st day.Shah justified the legislations, “We cannot be so shameless (ham itne nirlajj nahi ho sakte) as to occupy constitutional positions while facing charges,” home minister said.Initially, only Trinamool MPs, led by Kalyan Banerjee, stormed the well. After Congress netas K C Venugopal and Manish Tewari spoke, Venugopal tore a copy of the bill, and Congress MPs joined TMC in protest. Venugopal questioned Shah’s claim of upholding public morality, referring to Shah’s 2010 arrest as Gujarat’s home minister.Shah countered, stating he had resigned on moral grounds before his arrest on “false” allegations and refrained from holding constitutional positions until cleared by courts. “I want to remind Congress that I had already resigned before being arrested, and even after being released on bail, I did not take any constitutional position until I was proven innocent by the court.” He added, “The court dismissed the false case against me, stating that it was motivated by political vendetta. ”Three opposition MPs — Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM), N K Premachandran (RSP) and Manish Tewari (Congress) — opposed the bill saying that it is in violation of presumption of innocence, which is the bedrock of administration and a marked assualt on the basic structure of the Constitution. Tewari called the bills “squarely destructive” to the Constitution’s basic structure, arguing they bypassed due process and made investigating officers the “boss of the Prime Minister”.Owaisi accused the govt of enabling executive agencies to act as judge, jury, and executioner based on flimsy allegations, likening the proposed system to Nazi Germany’s Gestapo. Venugopal claimed the bills aimed to sabotage India’s federal structure.Shah rejected Premachandran’s contention that the bills were brought in haste, saying they will be sent to a joint panel, where members of both Houses would get an opportunity to give their suggestions.The constitutional amendment bill requires two-thirds support in both Houses — a majority that the governing alliance currently lacks.One opposition MP twisted Shah’s mic, while others continued throwing bits of paper at him, prompting treasury MPs to rush into the well. MPs from both sides stood face-to-face, exchanging threats, and even after the House was adjourned, opposition MPs continued shouting slogans.BJP MPs, including ministers Kiren Rijiju and Ravneet Bittu, moved to block opposition MPs from approaching Shah. The home minister, however, asked his colleagues to return to their seats. Congress MP Deepender Hooda also intervened, preventing opposition MPs from entering the aisle. Normalcy returned only after Shah and other ministers left the House as the opposition members jeered.When House resumed an hour later, the bills were referred to JPC, but proceedings occurred under tight security, with marshals present. Shah, instead of taking his front row seat, sat in the third row as opposition MPs again occupied the well. Govt sources said that their focus was on getting the legislations passed.","Three bills provide legal framework for removing the Prime Minister, Union ministers, chief ministers, and ministers in states and Union territories arrested and detained on serious criminal charges.

Amit Shah’s Red Line On Jailed PMs, CMs, Ministers | Oppn Slam 'Draconian' Bill | Political Showdown

NEW DELHI: It was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had the draft of Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 2025 reworked to include himself in its ambit, home minister Amit Shah shared in a post on X on Wednesday.Sources in the government said Modi added the provision requiring a prime minister who spends 30 consecutive days under arrest or detention for an alleged offence punishable with a prison term extending up to five years or more, to resign on the 31st day, based on the reasoning that moral standards in politics must apply as much to prime ministers as they do to any chief minister or minister at the Centre and in states or Union Territories.The original draft of the 130th Constitutional amendment Bill had proposed to cover only chief ministers and ministers at the Centre and in the states.As per the Bill, introduced by Shah on Wednesday, in case the prime minister does not tender his resignation on the 31st day of his arrest, ""he shall cease to hold office from the day falling thereafter"".The Bill was on Wednesday referred to a joint parliamentary committee for thorough scrutiny.Dismissing the opposition's charge that the Bill was a ploy by the Modi regime to dislodge state govts by having their chief ministers and ministers removed through arrest in ""motivated"" cases, a senior govt functionary said that the same provisions apply to the prime minister and Union ministers.The functionary said it was high time that the PM, CM and ministers display character and conduct that aligns with constitutional morality and principles of good governance, and cited the example of govt employees who are deemed suspended if detained in custody for only 48 hours.""Why should bureaucrats/govt personnel alone bear moral responsibility in the event of detention or arrest? Ministers are also public servants and must withdraw from office if arrested for 30 days. They can always rejoin the same post after release,"" underlined the functionary. He added that the 30-day timeframe is enough for the affected PM/CM/minister to apply for bail and have it heard and decided, right till the last court of appeal.","PM Narendra Modi had draft of Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 2025 reworked to include himself in its ambit, home minister Amit Shah shared in a post on X on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: The Centre has proposed exempting life and health insurance policies for individuals from the ambit of GST, the head of a panel of ministers set up by the GST council said on Wednesday, a move that is expected to provide relief to large sections of consumers.Bihar deputy chief minister and convenor of the panel of ministers on health and insurance Samrat Choudhary said the Centre's proposal is clear that individual insurance policies should be exempt from GST.""This has been discussed and the GoM report will be presented to the council,"" Choudhary was quoted as saying. He also said all members have given their approval for lowering rates and some states have given their own views. He said a final call issue would be taken by the GST council when it meets.Telangana deputy CM Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, a member of the GoM , said it was made clear that the benefit of GST should go to policyholders and not companies and a mechanism needs to be worked on to ensure this. He also pointed to the fact nearly Rs 9,700 crore annual revenue loss is estimated due to the GST exemption to individual insurance policies.The 13-member panel on health and insurance was set up in Sept to draw up a roadmap on the issue and it is expected to submit its report by October.The panel includes ministers from UP, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Meghalaya, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.""The proposed reduction of GST on health and life insurance from 18% to nil (exempt) shows how GST has evolved from just a way to collect revenue to a tool for advancing national goals.

Indian Soldiers Get Big Legal Lifeline: Historic Scheme to Protect Families of Defence Personnel

NEW DELHI: Presenting the stark realities of litigation, Justice Surya Kant Wednesday said the doors of temples of justice in the country continue to be too narrow for most of the citizens whose total monthly income is not enough to engage a seasoned advocate and pay their appearance fee.Delivering a lecture organised by SC Bar Association on 'Justice for all - Legal Aid and Mediation', Justice Kant said professional fees of lawyers exceed the monthly income of most citizens, and court procedures demand literacy, while court corridors are more intimidating than welcoming.""We have built temples of justice with doors too narrow for the very people they were meant to serve. The scales of justice cannot balance when only one side can afford to place their grievances upon them,"" he said. Justice Kant, who will succeed CJI B R Gavai on November 24, said that as a judge he often feels like a student when seasoned senior advocates give a nuanced presentation of law and facts in the courtroom, only for the thought to cross his mind - how many can afford these brilliant lawyers?Legal aid is thus the empowering tool for litigants who often go unheard and unrepresented in litigation, he said.",Supreme Court Justice Surya Kant delivers a lecture on 'Justice for all - Legal Aid and Mediation' Justice Kant said professional fees of lawyers exceed the monthly income of most citizens.

‘Dissolve Lok Sabha Immediately’: INDIA Bloc Leaders Tear Into Election Commission At Joint Presser

NEW DELHI: In a twin blow, the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) on Wednesday issued a show cause notice to the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), asking it to disclose the source of funding for its studies on the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise and the Maharashtra Assembly polls. The council accused the institute of “deliberately… indulging in data manipulation with a deliberate and malicious action to create a narrative with intention of undermining the sanctity of the constitutional authority such as the Election Commission of India .”The action coincided with FIRs filed by Nagpur and Nashik police against Sanjay Kumar, psephologist and CSDS faculty member. Nagpur Rural Police booked him for allegedly spreading false claims of steep voter declines — 38.45% in Ramtek and 36.82% in Deolali — through now-deleted posts. SP (Rural) Harssh A Poddar said the case followed a complaint by the tehsildar, prompted by a letter from the district returning officer. Kumar has been charged under Sections 175, 353(1)(b) and 212 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and is expected to be summoned soon.In its notice, ICSSR also pressed CSDS for explanations on a string of alleged irregularities. “CSDS, Delhi has continuously been involved in various irregularities in the past and such irregularities were also reported to ICSSR in the form of multiple complaints through various channels,” it said.The violations cited include “appointment of faculty in violation of mandatory UGC regulations,” “non-holding of election of the chairman of the governing body,” “opaque method followed for appointment of director,” and “non-submission of the details of FCRA funds and its utilisation. ”The council further noted that annual accounts were not audited by CAG/AG and flagged “payment of House Rent Allowances (HRA) to employees who were staying in the government accommodation allocated to their spouses.” It said such administrative and financial lapses, combined with the controversial studies, amounted to a “gross violation of ICSSR Grant-in-Aid Rules for Societies and Institutions doing Research in the Field of Social Sciences. ”CSDS has been given seven days to respond, failing which ICSSR warned it would be “free to take appropriate action… including cancellation and withdrawal” of its grant-in-aid.Sanjay Kumar didn’t respond to messages and calls for his comments on the matter.With the police probe targeting a senior faculty member and ICSSR threatening to cut off funding, the dispute has now escalated into a high-stakes battle over credibility, accountability, and the integrity of India’s electoral processes.",The Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) issued a show cause notice to the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) ICSSR asked CSDS to disclose the source of funding for its studies on the Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise and the Maharashtra Assembly polls.

MUMBAI: Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told TOI.She was airlifted from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday and is under the care of doctor Farokh Udwadia.Simone, 95, is fighting several symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, the same illness that her stepson and former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata passed away from last October.“She and Noel arrived in Mumbai from Dubai on a medical plane at Terminal 8,” the sources said.Simone is most famous for turning the Lakmé cosmetic brand into a well-known household name in India. The name Lakmé comes from the French word for Lakshmi, a goddess known for her beauty in Hindu mythology.The Tata Group was urged by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to launch a makeup brand after learning that Indian women were spending the country’s foreign reserves on Western makeup brands. Lakmé was established by the Tata Group in 1952.Originally from Geneva, Switzerland, Simone first visited India as a tourist in the summer of 1953 at the age of 23. During her visit, she met Naval Tata, who was 26 years her senior and divorced from his first wife Soonoo.They fell in love, got married in 1955, and she decided to make Mumbai her permanent home.In 1996, the Tata Group sold Lakmé to Hindustan Unilever as part of a restructuring strategy. Simone used the proceeds from the sale to create Westside, a popular department store where many Indians shop.She managed the Tata Group’s consumer-facing businesses including Lakme and Trent (which owns Westside and Star India Bazaar stores) for over four decades until her retirement in 2006. She also served on the board of Tata Industries, an important investment company within the Tata Group.After her retirement, Simone made fewer public appearances. In October 2019, she was seen in a wheelchair at the opening of the renovated flagship Westside store in South Mumbai. In September 2022, she attended the funeral of former Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry (Noel is married to Cyrus’s sister Aloo Mistry), and in October 2024, she was present at Ratan’s funeral.Following Ratan’s passing, Noel took over his position at Tata Trusts, the driving force behind the $180-billion Tata Group.","Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital.

Benin’s citizenship program seeks to heal history and strengthen ties with the Black diaspora

From memorial tourism to a personal journey of heritage

Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin through a groundbreaking initiative aimed at reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral homeland. The ceremony took place on July 26 in Cotonou, marking a symbolic moment for both the artist and the West African nation.Justice Minister Yvon Détchénou described the program as a step toward repairing deep historical wounds. “By legally recognizing these children of Africa, Benin is healing a historical wound. It is an act of justice, but also one of belonging and hope,” he said during the event.In September, Benin passed a law granting citizenship to people over 18 who can prove their lineage to victims of the transatlantic slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa, provided they do not already hold citizenship from another African nation. Applicants can submit DNA reports, authenticated testimonies, or historical family records.To streamline the process, the government launched a digital platform, My Afro Origins, allowing descendants worldwide to apply. While other African nations have opened similar pathways, Benin’s efforts carry profound weight due to its significant role in the slave trade. An estimated 1.5 million people were taken from the Bight of Benin region—modern-day Benin, Togo, and parts of Nigeria—by European traders, often with the involvement of local kingdoms.Benin has openly acknowledged its part in the slave trade, hosting conferences since the 1990s and issuing formal apologies. Today, the country invests heavily in “memorial tourism,” with historical sites like the Slave Route and the haunting Door of No Return in Ouidah serving as powerful reminders of the past.After receiving her citizenship, Ciara walked these historic paths, reflecting on their significance. “Between emotion, reflection and heritage, I experienced a profound return to what truly matters,” she shared.Benin’s coastline, once part of the historic “Slave Coast,” was a major hub in the transatlantic slave trade. From 1580 to 1727, the Kingdom of Whydah, located along today’s Benin coast, exported over a million enslaved Africans to the Americas, including the U.S., the Caribbean, and Brazil.Also Read: “Rhyme with betrayal”: Blake Lively fears friendship fallout with Taylor Swift could go public as Travis Kelce gets dragged into the drama Best known for hits like “Goodies” and “Level Up”, Ciara’s journey is more than a personal milestone—it’s a symbol of reconnection between Africa and its diaspora, inspiring others to explore their roots while acknowledging the complex history that shaped them.Russell Wilson's wife Ciara has also been credited with elevating the standard of dance, choreography, and visual art in her respective generation, and is regarded as an icon within the fields of dance, entertainment, and R&B for her contributions.On the other side, Wilson was named the Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2020 and was the recipient of the Bart Starr Award in 2022. Wilson is also part owner of the Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). After he purchased his minority stake, the Sounders won MLS Cup 2019 and the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League.Russell Wilson and Ciara exchanged vows during a secret, secluded wedding ceremony at Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England on July 6, 2016. Attendees consisted of their closest family and friends, including Kelly Rowland, Jennifer Hudson, and La La Anthony. Both Ciara and Russell Wilson know just how to keep the love alive.The power couple, Russell Wilson and Ciara has been married for nearly a decade now, but they have some rules and traditions that keep their relationship going strong.The New York Giants made some big moves at the quarterback position this offseason. Brian Dabboll and the front office brought in former Super Bowl champion Russell Wilson to replace Daniel Jones.","Russell Wilson's wife and Grammy-winning singer Ciara has made history as one of the first high-profile individuals to receive citizenship from Benin.

'Prized free and democratic partner': Nikki Haley calls India key to counter China; presses Trump to reset relations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/reverse-the-downward-spiral-nikki-haley-urges-us-to-strengthen-ties-with-india-to-counter-china-warns-of-strategic-disaster/articleshow/123420370.cms,"File photo: Former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley (Picture credit: ANI)





Former US Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has called on Washington to strengthen its partnership with India, warning that undermining decades of progress in relations would be a “strategic disaster. ”In an opinion piece for Newsweek, Haley described India as a “prized free and democratic partner” and argued that its rise should be seen as a benefit to the free world, unlike Communist-controlled China, which she said poses a threat.“Partnership between the US and India to counter China should be a no-brainer,” she wrote.Haley underlined that India alone has the capacity to produce goods at a scale comparable to China, making it vital for shifting critical supply chains away from Beijing.“In the short term, India is essential in helping the United States move its critical supply chains away from China. While the Trump administration works to bring manufacturing back to our shores, India stands alone in its potential to manufacture at a China-like scale for products that can’t be quickly or efficiently produced here, like textiles, inexpensive phones, and solar panels,” she wrote in Newsweek.She also pointed to India’s increasing defence capabilities, deeper security ties in the Middle East, and its strategic location along China’s trade and energy routes as key advantages for Washington.“India’s growing clout and security involvement in the Middle East could prove essential in helping to stabilise the region as America seeks to send fewer troops and dollars there,” she added.Haley stressed that India’s economic rise is reshaping the global balance. As the world’s fastest-growing major economy, soon set to overtake Japan, India represents “the greatest obstacle to China’s goal of reshaping the global order. Simply put, China’s ambitions will have to shrink as India’s power grows,” she wrote.Citing the 2020 Galwan Valley clash and ongoing border disputes, Haley said the US should help New Delhi stand firm against Beijing both militarily and economically. She also warned that letting a trade dispute escalate into lasting damage could play into China’s hands.The former envoy urged US President Donald Trump to “reverse the downward spiral” in ties with India by holding direct talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The sooner the better,” she wrote, while advising India to take Trump’s concerns over Russian oil purchases seriously and work with Washington to find solutions.As per news agency ANI, Haley concluded that the US must not lose sight of its “shared goals” with New Delhi. “To face China, the United States must have a friend in India,” she said.The remarks come amid recent tensions after Washington imposed a 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, with an additional 25 per cent levy set to take effect on August 27, raising the total duty to 50 per cent.","Former US Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has called on Washington to strengthen its partnership with India. Haley described India as a “prized free and democratic partner’ and argued that its rise should be seen as a benefit to the free world, unlike Communist-controlled China.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123420465,imgsize-787359,width-400,resizemode-4/123420465.jpg"

Nayara Energy navigates EU sanctions: Dark-fleet tankers keep operations flowing; government steps in to protect India’s oil supply,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/nayara-energy-navigates-eu-sanctions-dark-fleet-tankers-keep-operations-flowing-government-steps-in-to-protect-indias-oil-supply/articleshow/123422336.cms,"Image used for representative purposes

About Nayara Energy

India's Nayara Energy Ltd., facing EU sanctions, has adapted by utilizing dark-fleet tankers for transport and limiting its crude import options to maintain operations.Indian government has expressed concern about potential disruptions to oil flows affecting national energy security. They have authorised at least one coastal tanker recently to assist the company with domestic cargo movement, according to informed sources, cited by Bloomberg.The Rosneft PJSC-affiliated refiner plays a crucial role in India's market, operating 8% of the country's refining capacity with its 400,000 barrels-a-day facility and managing 7% of fuel stations. Operating capacity has decreased after business partners withdrew following EU measures against Moscow's oil revenues.In a relief measure, the government has approved several sanctioned vessels for Nayara's operations. The Leruo, a dark-fleet vessel, has conducted at least three domestic operations for Nayara with governmental approval, as confirmed by shipping data and an unnamed shipowner.The EU blacklisted the medium-range tanker Leruo on July 18 as part of broader Russian oil export sanctions affecting Nayara. Key Marvel Ltd.appears as the vessel's owner in S&P Global Inc.'s maritime records.The Next, another EU and UK-sanctioned long-range tanker, is scheduled to collect diesel from Nayara's Vadinar terminal on Wednesday, according to port records and tracking data. Next Maritime & Trading Ltd. in Istanbul is listed as the owner.These vessels are replacing local shipowners who have ceased operations with Nayara to protect their European port access and insurance arrangements. Vessels with Russian or Iranian insurance, approved by New Delhi, can service Nayara.Currently, Nayara has refined products exceeding 1.2 million barrels stored on four sanctioned vessels near Vadinar, according to shipping records.The Tempest Dream, after transferring Nayara-produced gasoline via ship-to-ship transfer, has returned to Vadinar for additional cargo. The recipient vessel, Wu Tai, remains holding its cargo.Since late July, Nayara has exclusively imported Urals oil from Russia. Two Aframax tankers, Mars 6 and Tiger 6, are expected to deliver approximately 1.4 million barrels of Urals this week.Meanwhile, the Greek-owned supertanker Evgenia I, intended to deliver Middle Eastern crude to Nayara last week, remains in the Persian Gulf.Evgeny Griva, Moscow's deputy trade representative in India, confirmed stable Russian crude supply to Nayara during a New Delhi briefing on Wednesday. He indicated that Indian imports of Russian oil should maintain current levels, citing limited alternatives despite geopolitical challenges.""There are special mechanisms to get around sanctions and tariffs,"" Griva said, quoted by Bloomberg.In August 2017, Essar Oil's 20-million-ton-per-annum Vadinar refinery in Gujarat underwent a significant transformation when it was acquired by a consortium led by Rosneft. This acquisition led to the rebranding of the entity as Nayara Energy, a name that signifies a ""new era"" in Hindi, reflecting the consortium's vision for the refinery's future growth and development.The launch of Nayara Energy coincided with pivotal changes in India's petroleum sector, particularly the government's decision to deregulate fuel retail prices. This move leveled the playing field, allowing private retailers like Nayara to expand their networks, as reported by the Economic Times.The liberalization of the market stirred concerns among state-run oil marketing companies, which had long dominated fuel retailing. They feared losing market share to private competitors such as Nayara and Reliance Industries.Nayara Energy experienced steady growth until it faced challenges due to sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. These sanctions targeted Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine, making Nayara's oil and energy revenue particularly susceptible to geopolitical tensions.The acquisition of the Essar facility by Rosneft, along with international investors Trafigura and UCP Investment Group, was valued at $12.9 billion. This marked Rosneft's largest overseas investment in India's refining sector, granting it access to one of the world's fastest-growing markets.",Rosneft PJSC-affiliated refiner plays a crucial role in India's market. Nayara Energy operates 8% of the country's refining capacity and 7% of fuel stations.

Megan Thee Stallion’s accuser, Daystar Peterson’s attorney, brings in a new angle to the infamous 2020 shooting case



Megan Thee Stallion and Klay Thompson remain publicly silent about the legal mess related to the infamous 2020 shooting incident



Megan Thee Stallion’s romance with the NBA star player, Klay Thompson, continues to turn heads as the two seem to be really happy together. While the two are busy with their new romance, the rapper is also dealing with a legal mess related her being shot in 2020 by a man named Tory Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson. Even though Daystar Peterson is serving a 10 year prison sentence, his lawyers have brought in a new twist to the story.A few days ago, both of Daystar Peterson’s appeals were rejected by the judge. Now, on 18th August, Daystar Peterson’s attorney Crystal Morgan, was busy arguing about the DNA evidence found on the gun, as per Billboard.Daystar Peterson’s lawyer, Crystal Morgan, said, ""It is actually marginally more likely that another member of the African American population touched this gun over Mr. Peterson.""According to Billboard, Daystar Peterson’s lawyer Crystal Morgan added, “If our jury had heard that Mr. Peterson maybe one in a million touched the gun, I believe that would have been enough to tip that scale and show reasonable doubt.""Back in 2020, the DNA found on the gun which was used to shoot Megan Thee Stallion was reported to be inconclusive.However, there was enough evidence, including controversial text messages that pointed the suspicions towards Daystar Peterson’s involvement.As for Megan Thee Stallion, the popular rapper has remained silent. Her boyfriend, Klay Thompson has also maintained silence about the legal mess and has remained distant from it.Last month, Megan Thee Stallion spoke to Page Six about their relationship and said, “This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy…”As soon as the power couple opened up about their relationship, fans were shocked by it but are now excited about their future together.Also Read: ""Thought he’d just be a hometown hero"": LeBron James' wife Savannah James recalled her early expectations of the NBA icon","Megan Thee Stallion was shot in 2020 by a man named Tory Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson.

NEW DELHI: Delhi schools faced another wave of panic on Thursday after at least five institutions, including BGS International Public School in Dwarka Sector 5, reported receiving bomb threats.According to officials, Delhi Police and Fire Department teams rushed to the spots immediately, cordoning off the premises and launching thorough searches with bomb disposal squads, sniffer dogs and advanced detection equipment.Ambulances and fire tenders were stationed outside the schools as a precautionary measure.The fresh alerts come barely a day after over 60 schools in the capital received near-identical hoax threats that forced emergency evacuations and widespread checks.Officials said the latest threat emails bore a resemblance to Wednesday’s messages, which were traced to a sender using a VPN to mask identity.Police sources revealed that the original email, received late Tuesday night by over 380 IDs, had demanded $2,000 in cryptocurrency (Ethereum) and claimed bombs were planted across schools.The sender, identifying as “Terrorizers 111 group,” threatened to trigger high-yield explosives if the payment was not made.Investigators are working with the Cyber Crime Unit and intelligence agencies to track the origin of the threats. Authorities, however, stressed that all schools targeted so far have been declared safe.“Though these seem to be hoax threats, we cannot take chances when children’s safety is involved. All response protocols have been activated again today,” a senior police officer said.This marks the third major bomb scare in Delhi schools within a week, raising questions over cybersecurity and the psychological impact on students and parents.Earlier on Monday, similar threats were sent to around 32 schools, which were later confirmed to be hoaxes.","Delhi schools face another wave of panic on Thursday after bomb threats.

Elon Musk to back JD Vance in 2028 Presidential elections: Report

Redmi 15 5G Unboxing and First Look: What's New and Key Specifications

A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report recently said that Elon Musk is quietly “pumping the brakes” on his plans to launch a new political party. The tech billionaire announced ‘ America Party ’ in July after a fallout with President Donald Trump on the spending bill and tax cuts. Elon Musk, as per the report, has stayed in touch with Vice President JD Vance in recent weeks. Quoting people with knowledge of his plans, it adds that the Tesla CEO has “acknowledged to associates that if he goes ahead with forming a political party, he would damage his relationship with the vice president”.Responding to the WSJ report, Elon Musk wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter): “Nothing@WSJ says should ever be thought of as true”.In the 2024 presidential election, Elon Musk supported Republican candidate Donald Trump. He spent close to $300 million to support Trump and other Republicans in the 2024 election. Soon after his win, Musk and Trump became strong allies with the tech billionaire leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) – task force set up by the Trump administration to cut federal spending.The WSJ report states that the tech CEO hasn’t “formally ruled out creating a new party and could change his mind as the midterm elections near”. It further adds that Elon Musk plans to use “some of his vast financial resources to back Vance if he decides to run for president in 2028”.As per the report, any decision by Elon Musk to abandon plans of launching a third party would work in favor of Republicans ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Third parties in the US have historically played the role of spoilers by pulling votes away from the two dominant parties.","Elon Musk is quietly “pumping the brakes” on his plans to launch a new political party.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

The Online Gaming Bill 2025 brings A new era for India’s gamers

India is making big moves in the world of online gaming. On Tuesday, the Cabinet approved the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025, officially giving e-sports a stronger place in the country while also drawing hard lines around money-driven platforms. The bill, now headed to Parliament, is being seen as a game-changer for competitive gaming, players, and the industry at large.E-sports have been defined as competitive skill-based games played in virtual arenas with recognized rules and standards. The government is now considering professional tournaments, organized competitions, and gaming as a sport.This definition separates e-sports from online gambling-style games, which the bill calls “money games,” which are titles where cash or valuables are at stake. Those, unlike e-sports, fall under a completely different category and face strict restrictions.The government had already recognized e-sports in 2022 as a multisport event under the Youth Affairs and Sports Ministry, but the new bill aims to take that recognition further with structured promotion and regulation.A major highlight of the Online Gaming Bill 2025 is the creation of a National e-Sports Authority. This central body will:Officials say this will also open doors for foreign investment, job creation, and international tournaments hosted in India.The Online Gaming Bill 2025 doesn’t just promote e-sports; it also cracks down on harmful gaming practices. Anyone caught promoting or betting within e-sports or social games could face fines or even jail time. Lawmakers argue the move is about protecting players from exploitation while supporting a healthy gaming culture.From the ESL India Premiership to the Commonwealth Esports Championship, Indian teams have already proven their potential. With government support now locked in, the bill could open doors for more sponsorships, global tournaments, and professional pathways for gamers.","The Cabinet approved the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 on Tuesday.

Despite teachers advising against distributing the soiled food, SHG members ignored the directive and served it to students.The Chief Medical and Health Officer reported that all affected students received three doses of anti-rabies vaccine by August 8. The students were found medically fit after health check-ups and continued attending school regularly.As a precautionary measure, Primary Health Centre personnel at Lachchhanpur are keeping the children under continuous observation.The authorities took disciplinary action by removing the SHG from mid-day meal preparation duties and barring them from future government benefits. Several school officials, including the in-charge Principal, Cluster Principal, and teachers, were suspended on August 6.Following the incident, the Balodabazar-Bhatapara collector issued new directives for mid-day meal preparation and distribution to school education department officials.The Directorate of School Education also implemented new guidelines for District Education Officers to ensure cleanliness, hygiene, and regular quality checks under the Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman Yojana.The state government defended its position by stating no compensation was necessary as the students were medically fit after examination.""Considering the fact that it was an institution of the government and SHG was assigned to provide mid-day meal, but the said mid-day meal was soiled by a dog and it was unfit for consumption for the students of the school. And though three doses of anti-rabies has been administered to 84 children of the school, it was negligent on the part of the state to take care that the food which was being offered in the mid-day meal by the SHG to the children of middle school, we deem it proper that Rs 25,000 be paid by the state to each of the student of the concerned middle school, who had consumed the said meal, within a period of one month from today (August 19),"" the bench noted.The High Court concluded with an observation: ""We hope and trust that the state would be more vigilant and careful in providing mid-day meal to the children studying in government schools.""The order was delivered by a division bench comprising Chief Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Bibhu Datta Guru on Tuesday.","Chhattisgarh High Court has ordered the state government to compensate 84 students with Rs 25,000 each.

Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi has become the first hospital in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to deploy the Artisse Intrasaccular Flow Modulator, a cutting-edge device for treating wide-necked brain aneurysms. As a designated Centre of Excellence for stroke by the Department of Health – Abu Dhabi, the hospital continues its commitment to advancing minimally invasive neurological care while offering safer, more effective alternatives to traditional brain surgery.Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi has introduced a novel advancement in neurovascular care with the adoption of the Artisse Intrasaccular Flow Modulator, a specialized implant designed to treat wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. This technology represents a new standard in stroke treatment across the MENA region.Cerebral aneurysms, often referred to in broader terms as strokes, develop when a weakened section of a brain blood vessel expands or balloons. If left untreated, they pose a high risk of rupture and can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage, a life-threatening form of brain bleeding. Traditionally, treatment involved invasive open brain surgery.However, new approaches are shifting towards minimally invasive techniques, significantly reducing patient risk and improving long-term outcomes.The Artisse device, unlike older methods which typically require multiple coils or filaments, uses a single intricately designed mesh structure that is deployed directly into the aneurysm. This device fills the aneurysmal sac, blocking blood flow into it and permanently sealing it off from the brain’s circulation. It remains in place for life, eliminating the need for follow-up surgeries.The procedure begins with catheter-based access, typically through the groin or arm, to reach the affected vessel in the brain. Using advanced 3D imaging and angiography, physicians position the device with precision. Depending on the complexity, the procedure can take between two and eight hours. Post-operative follow-ups are critical; imaging is usually conducted at three and six months to ensure full occlusion of the aneurysm.The first patient treated with the Artisse device at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi showed successful aneurysm occlusion in their three-month follow-up, affirming the device’s therapeutic potential.Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi’s Neurological Institute has long adopted a multidisciplinary model of care, combining the expertise of specialists in neurosurgery, interventional neuroradiology, and neurology. This approach ensures that patients receive personalized treatment plans, guided by the latest imaging and catheter-based innovations.According to Dr. Khalil Zahra, Staff Physician of Neurosurgery at the Neurological Institute:Dr. Zahra also emphasized the long-term potential:The Department of Health – Abu Dhabi (DoH) has formally recognized Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi as a Centre of Excellence for stroke care, further reinforcing the hospital’s regional leadership in specialized treatment pathways.Dr. Fayeza Al Yafie, Executive Director of the Healthcare Quality Sector at DoH, commented on the significance of this development:This milestone reflects not only a technological breakthrough but also the outcome of sustained collaboration between Cleveland Clinic and Mubadala Investment Company. Their long-term partnership has enabled a level of care within the UAE that reduces the need for patients to seek complex treatment abroad.Established through a partnership agreement in 2006, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi was envisioned as a transformative step in healthcare delivery for the region. The facility officially opened its doors in May 2015, after nearly a decade of meticulous planning. More than 300 physicians and clinical staff worked in collaboration with architects, designers, and planners from around the world to shape the hospital’s advanced care environment.Backed by a bold initiative from the Government of Abu Dhabi, the hospital was designed to expand access to critical and complex care services that were previously unavailable locally.Today, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi operates as part of a global institution that spans:The official inauguration took place on December 3, 2015, led by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, then Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.By introducing the Artisse Intrasaccular Flow Modulator, Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi has taken another decisive step toward redefining neurological care in the MENA region, combining cutting-edge science, collaborative care, and a vision for long-term innovation.","Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi has become the first hospital in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to deploy the Artisse Intrasaccular Flow Modulator.

Radioactive shrimps found?

What is Cesium-137, why is it harmful?





The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Monday warned consumers not to eat certain frozen shrimp products sold at Walmart after tests revealed possible contamination with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope.Federal officials said three lots of Great Value brand frozen shrimp were pulled from Walmart stores after the isotope was detected in shipping containers and a sample of breaded shrimp imported from Indonesia. “If you have recently purchased raw frozen shrimp from Walmart that matches this description, throw it away,” FDA officials said in a statement.Walmart has recalled frozen, raw shrimp sold in 13 states following the warning, the Associated Press reported.Cesium-137, also known as Cs-137, is a byproduct of nuclear reactions, including nuclear weapons testing, reactor operations and nuclear accidents. It is the most common radioactive isotope of cesium, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Cs-137 is also used in medical devices, gauges, and radiation therapy to treat cancer, while in some cases, it emerges as a waste product of nuclear reactors.According to the agency, exposure to low levels of Cesium-137 over time could pose a “potential health concern.”Trace amounts of the isotope are found globally in soil, air and food. While the levels detected in the shrimp were far below FDA intervention thresholds, officials said avoiding potentially contaminated products could help reduce unnecessary exposure to radiation.",FDA warns against consuming certain frozen shrips; cites potential Cesium-137 contamination.

“Anti-American activity will be an overwhelmingly negative factor in any discretionary analysis,” according to a recent policy announcement by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the country’s immigration agency.In other words, if you want a visa of any kind – be it a student visa, or a work visa; or wish to apply for a green card or US citizenship – the outcome of your application will depend on whether the concerned official perceives you as having pro-American ideologies“America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies. USCIS is committed to implementing policies and procedures that root out anti-Americanism and supporting the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the fullest extent possible,” said USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser. “Immigration benefits—including to live and work in the United States—remain a privilege, not a right,” he added.As per this recent policy, USCIS officials will also scrutinise whether applicants have endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused the views of a terrorist organization or group, or whether they support or promote anti-American ideologies or activities, antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic ideologies and antisemitic terrorist organizations.This latest announcement follows similar announcements and policy changes made in earlier months by the Trump administration. For instance, as reported by TOI, in early April USCIS announced that social media accounts would be monitored and international students, those applying for green card status, and those seeking non-immigrant work visas (including H-1B) for jobs affiliated with educational institutions will have their visa applications denied if such individuals are perceived as being antisemitic.Later, in mid-June, USCIS announced reopening of visa interviews for international students (those seeking a F-visa or M-visa) and those aspiring to visit US on an exchange visa (J visa) but stated that such applicants must ensure that their social media accounts are public and not set to private settings. More recently, the definition of ‘good moral character’ – an essential requirement for acquiring American citizenship was revised. USCIS stated it would consider the totality of circumstances, weighing both negative conduct (misdemeanours like driving under influence, or non payment of tax dues) and positive attributes (like educational qualifications, lawful employment history) in determining eligibility for citizenship.Immigration attorneys cite that policies that can grant an individual immigration benefits – be it a US visa, green card or even citizenship are becoming subjective – much is left to the discretion of the official assessing the applications.As regards the latest policy guideline that anti-American activities would be a serious negative discretionary factor, voices on social media were aghast. “Is this the 1950s?”, posted an individual.New York based immigration attorney, Cyrus D. Mehta said, “How does the USCIS define ‘anti-American’. Being critical of the Trump administration or for that matter any administration should not be deemed as anti-American. Indeed, it should be considered a virtuous activity to be critical of America or its administration as it is through criticism and dissent that we can reflect on all points of view, self correct, grow and evolve. ” Another immigration attorney resorted to sarcasm, by posting on a social media platform, “USCIS to deny green cards, if applicants don’t calp loud enough for the national anthem; The Trump Administration has issued a new rule requiring immigrants to pretend they like ranch dressing...""","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the country’s immigration agency, has announced that anti-American activity will be an overwhelmingly negative factor in any discretionary analysis. USCIS officials will also scrutinise whether applicants have endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused the views of a terrorist organization.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123414265,imgsize-954551,width-400,resizemode-4/123414265.jpg"
