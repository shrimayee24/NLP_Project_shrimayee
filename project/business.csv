Other South Asian countries are also expected to experience a decline in inflation rates in 2024, ranging from 2.2% in the Maldives to 33.6% in Iran. Despite some moderation, food prices remained high in the first quarter of 2024, particularly in Bangladesh and India.India's labour market indicators have shown improvement, supported by strong growth and increased labour force participation. The government remains committed to gradually reducing the fiscal deficit while aiming to increase capital investment.India's economic growth has been characterized as 'very robust' by a UN expert, who also noted that the country is attracting more foreign investment as Western companies shift their focus away from China.""India is also benefiting from more investments coming into India from other western sources as less and less foreign investment is going into China, western investment is going into China. India has become an alternative investment source or destination for many western companies. I think that is also benefiting India,"" said Hamid Rashid, chief of the global economic monitoring branch at the UN department of economic and social affairs.",India's economy is forecast to expand by 6.9% in 2024 and 6.6% in 2025.

Land acquisition valid only if it passes constitutional test: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/land-acquisition-valid-only-if-it-passes-constitutional-test-sc/articleshow/110187549.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a landmark verdict to protect the interests of landowners against acquisition of their property by govt, Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that all acquisitions would have to pass the test of Article 300A which grants people constitutional right to property and said acquisition can be done only for public purpose, under authority of law and after following a due procedure.Observing that under the current constitutional scheme, the right to property is protected as a constitutional right and has even been interpreted to be a human right, a bench of Justices Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Aravind Kumar propounded seven basic procedural rights of landowners which must be followed and fulfilled for any valid acquisition.Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Narasimha said Article 300A confers seven rights to landowners and commensurate duties to state, which are: i) Duty of State to inform the owners that it intends to acquire his property - right to notice; ii) Duty of State to hear objections - right to be heard; iii) Duty of State to inform its decision on acquisition - right to a reasoned decision; iv) Duty of State to demonstrate that acquisition is for public cause - acquisition only for public purpose; v) Duty of State to restitute and rehabilitate - right to fair compensation; vi) Duty of State to conduct the process of acquisition efficiently and within prescribed timelines - right to an efficient conduct; and vii) Final conclusion of the proceedings leading to vesting - the right of conclusion.""In various decisions interpreting Article 300A, this court has also held that a person can be deprived of his right to property only through the procedure established by law. The State must mandatorily comply with the procedure which has been provided under the statute for an acquisition to be valid under Article 300A. Therefore, a valid acquisition of property is premised on the law providing a procedure for such acquisition and the State complying with this statutory procedure. Procedural justice is therefore a significant mandate of Article 300A. The existence of and adherence to procedural safeguards is crucial for the protection of the right to property as they ensure fairness, transparency, natural justice, and non-arbitrary exercise of power in the process of acquisition,"" he said.The court said a reasonable and just procedure enables the person affected by the decision to transcend his personal interest and accept the larger public purpose that the acquisition seeks to subserve. ""The seven steps may be procedures, but they do constitute the real content of the right to property under Article 300A, non-compliance of these procedures will amount to violation of the right. An action of acquiring property without following due procedure would be outside the authority of law,"" the court said.SC quashed the decision of Kolkata Municipal Corporation to acquire private land at Narkeldanga North Road to build a public park. It said the law does not authorise the body to acquire the land and the acquisition was illegal.",Supreme Court rules that all acquisitions would have to pass the test of Article 300A which grants people constitutional right to property.

We repeatedly told them that this land, neither Pakistan nor China claims it as theirs. If there's any sovereign claimant, it's India. You're occupying, you're building there, but the legal title is mine.""Referring to the 1963 agreement between Pakistan and China, Jaishankar pointed out that Pakistan had transferred a significant portion of the Pakistan-occupied territory to China as a gesture of friendship.However, the agreement stipulates that China will ultimately respect the territorial claims of either Pakistan or India.Jaishankar explained, ""In 1963, Pakistan and China agreed to take their friendship forward, and to keep China close, Pakistan handed over about 5,000km of the Pakistan-occupied territory to China. It's written in that agreement that eventually, China will respect whether this territory belongs to Pakistan or India. Sometimes people just grab territory, and then it's about how to resolve it.""Jaishankar stressed the importance of India maintaining a strong position regarding PoJK, given the changing dynamics in the region. He said, ""I think we need to keep our position very strong, we need to have confidence in ourselves. Ten years ago, none of you would talk like this, it's a change... even the Indian public has confidence in this.""BJP leaders have been consistently criticizing previous Congress governments under Pandit Nehru and Indira Gandhi for ceding the island of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka and for the situation in PoJK.","S Jaishankar took a veiled jibe at former prime minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress party.

I am investing everything, I am taking all the risk but Centre is taking away entire profit of mine.

Now we have to pay everything by cheque. So my bank balance is purely after paying all taxes to government of India again when I am buying a house, I have to pay stamp duty, I have to pay GST, it amounts to 11%.

A big Indian community of students doesn’t come with a “homely” feeling.""Explaining her stance, Pattar highlighted what she referred to as 'toxic Indian patterns' within the community, such as excessive drama, unprofessionalism, lack of positive role models, absence of leadership or mentorship for juniors, self-centered behavior, cliques, gossiping, and a lack of seriousness about the future.Pattar further emphasized, ""If you plan to move out of the country, make sure you are also staying away from that mindset, attitude, and nature of people.

NEW DELHI: In a timely rescue operation , Anant Ambani ’s Vantara mobilised from Gujarat a large convoy of vehicles, including ambulances, feed vehicles, and a team of personnel, to rehabilitate an ailing elephant and her calf in Tripura 's Unakoti district.An online video showing the rescue and rehabilitation effort has gone viral.In the video, a woman -- later identified as 'Go Green and Help Stray Animals' organisation general secretary Kuntala Sinha -- can be heard thanking Anant Ambani and Vantara's team of doctors for their prompt action and saving the elephants.She said the Vantara team reached Unakoti within a day of her approaching them for help in treating the elephant.The convoy made the remarkable 3,500-km journey from Jamnagar to Tripura in a mere 24 hours to provide essential care for Pratima and her calf Maniklal.After the initial treatment, the elephants were kept in Tripura's Kailashahar for several weeks before being transported to Vantara in Gujarat for further care.A veterinary surgeon from Vantara found several wounds and lacerations on Pratima, as well as severe stiffness in the limbs, and blindness in one eye. Pratima was emaciated while her calf was also suffering from lack of nutrition.According to a release by PETA, Pratima and her calf were being unlawfully held without an ownership certificate, violating wildlife protection laws.Meaning 'Star of The Forest', Vantara is a wildlife preservation initiative founded by Anant Ambani and backed by Reliance Industries and Reliance Foundation.Situated within the expansive Jamnagar Refinery Complex, spanning a vast 3,000 acres, Vantara serves as a sanctuary for animals enduring abuse, injury, or facing extinction.Vantara was started with a mission to extend compassionate care and cutting-edge medical support to animals in distress. With a holistic approach to rehabilitation, it provides a natural and nurturing environment for its residents, fostering their physical and emotional well-being. Vantara is poised to spearhead global efforts in wildlife rehabilitation.","Anant Ambani's Vantara mobilised from Gujarat a large convoy of vehicles, including ambulances, feed vehicles, and a team of personnel.

"No exception made for CM Arvind Kejriwal: SC on interim bail, arrest plea",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-exception-made-for-cm-arvind-kejriwal-sc-on-interim-bail-arrest-plea/articleshow/110187484.cms,"NEW DELHI: As Enforcement Directorate contended that Arvind Kejriwal should not be given special treatment by entertaining his plea challenging his arrest, Supreme Court on Thursday said no exception was made for the Delhi chief minister in hearing his petition and granting him interim bail and added that it had refused to hear him when he first approached immediately after his arrest.A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta said the court normally maintains judicial restraint until the case is very grave and there have been cases when the top court entertained pleas under Article 32. ""He filed the case here but we did not open the gate. We refused to entertain his plea,"" the bench said after solicitor general Tushar Mehta argued that allowing accused to challenge their arrest directly in high courts and the SC would be ""disastrous"" as everyone would rush to higher courts.Coming a day after home minister Amit Shah's statement that many people believed the bench of Justices Khanna and Datta favoured Kejriwal by giving him interim bail, the hearing saw interesting exchanges between Mehta and Kejriwal's counsel, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi.Alleging that the Delhi CM was misusing the liberty granted by the court, Mehta said Kejriwal's campaign pitch was that he would not have to go back to jail on June 2 if people voted for AAP. The SG said his statement was ""a slap on the face of the system"", leading the bench to say that it was his (Kejriwal's) ""mere presumption"" and he had to surrender on the date fixed by the court.Singhvi took exception to Mehta's contention and told the court that he would file an affidavit regarding a statement made by ""a highest minister of the country"" about the SC's order granting interim bail, a not-so-subtle reference to Shah's comment.Asking the lawyers to focus on legal issues, the bench said, ""As far as critical analysis or even criticism of the judgment is concerned, it is welcome. There is no difficulty. You may have different viewpoints.""During the hearing, the court said an ED officer had to take a holistic and balanced view before arresting a person and he could not consider only inculpatory evidence while ignoring material pointing to the person's innocence.""If one set of material collected by an investigating officer points toward guilt and can be arrested on that basis, but if there is another set of material showing that he is not guilty then the officer has to be fair and he has to consider both sets of material. But if he ignores another set of material, then would it not be a ground for the court to interfere? The decision of the officer would be subjective but it must be based on objective material,"" the bench said.","Supreme Court said no exception was made for the Delhi chief minister in hearing his petition and granting him interim bail.

In spite of the surge, unavailability of visa interview slots tripped many Indians' travel plans.Russia and China have had a story of fluctuating fortunes. While China, which started opening its borders for international travel only last year and had huge pent-up demand, leapt to the top of table from rank 22 in 2022. It saw the highest increase at 1,104% - over 10 times - in 2023 over the 2022 application numbers. (See box).Russia, on the other hand, slipped from rank 2 in 2022 to rank 5 in 2023 mainly due to the war on Ukraine, and the ensuing sanctions. Russians' Schengen visa applications fell 25% in this two-year span.For India, travel veterans believe the actual demand is even higher than official figures. But the unavailability of visa interview slots meant many Indians who wanted to travel could not even get a chance to apply for Schengen visas. ""Appointments are simply not available with a majority of Schengen countries. If you want to travel to Europe this summer, the earliest appointment date for Germany and Italy is in July.

According to the revised Schengen Visa Code, effective Feb 2, 2020, you can apply for a Schengen visa up to 6 months before your date of travel.""

2-judge bench recalls another 2-judge bench’s 3-yr-old order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-judge-bench-recalls-another-2-judge-benchs-3-yr-old-order/articleshow/110186641.cms,"NEW DELHI: A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Thursday recalled a three-year-old verdict of another two-judge bench, faulting it for breaching the elementary yet sacrosanct 'stare decisis' judicial discipline under which a larger bench's rulings are binding on a bench with fewer number of judges.A bench of Justices B R Gavai and Sandeep Mehta criticised the judgment of a bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian (both have since retired) for ignoring the 1967 judgment of a five-judge SC bench in Bhagat Ram case , which ruled that unused portion of land pooled by villagers for community usage would be redistributed among the original owners.The bench of Justices Gupta and Ramasubramanian had ruled on April 7, 2022, ""The entire land reserved for common purposes by applying pro-rata cut had to be utilised by the gram panchayat for the present and future needs of the village community and no part of the land can be re-partitioned amongst proprietors.""Writing the judgment and allowing a review petition to restore an appeal filed by individual landowners for fresh hearing on Aug 7, Justice Gavai said, ""With great respect, we may state that when the HC judgment rested on the law laid down by the constitution bench of SC in Bhagat Ram, the least that was expected of (the two-judge bench) SC in the judgment under review was to explain as to why the HC was wrong in relying on Bhagat Ram. Leave aside a cursory reference in the judgment in paragraph 11, there is no reference in the entire judgment to Bhagat Ram.""Accepting arguments of senior advocate Narender Hooda, Justices Gavai and Mehta said, ""The finding of this court in the judgment under review that the vesting in the panchayat is complete on mere assignment under Section 18(c) of the Consolidation Act is totally contrary to the findings recorded in paragraph 5 of the constitution bench judgment in Bhagat Ram.""In Bhagat Ram case, the five-judge bench of the SC had ruled, ""Upon reading of Sections 23A and 24 of the Consolidation Act, it was clear that till possession has changed under Section 24, the management and control does not vest in the panchayat under Section 23A of the Consolidation Act.""It had further said that rights of the holders were not modified or extinguished till people had changed possession and entered into possession of the holdings allotted to them under the scheme. Justice Gavai said, ""No law is required to state that a judgment of the constitution bench would be binding on benches of lesser strength. When Bhagat Ram has been decided by a strength of five judges, a bench of this court having strength of two judges could not have ignored the law laid down by the constitution bench in Bhagat Ram.""We find that ignoring the law laid down by the constitution bench of this court in Bhagat Ram and taking a view totally contrary to the same itself would amount to a material error, manifest on the face of the order.

PUNE: The Maharashtra government has detected 91 instances of the novel Covid-19 Omicron subvariant KP.2 , which has surpassed the previously dominant JN.1 variant and is currently the primary driver of cases in several nations. Pune reported the highest number of KP.2 cases at 51, followed by Thane with 20 cases.Maharashtra first recognized KP.2 cases in January, and by March and April, it had become the predominant strain in the region.Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, the state's genome sequencing coordinator, noted that despite the rise in cases, there has been no corresponding increase in hospitalizations or severe cases. The slight surge in cases witnessed by the state in March, with an average of around 250 detections, is likely due to the spread of the KP.2 variant , which evolved from JN.1, the dominant Covid strain at the end of 2023.Apart from Pune and Thane, seven cases each were reported in Amravati and Aurangabad, while Solapur had two cases and Ahmednagar, Nashik, Latur, and Sangli had one case each of the KP.2 variant. Notably, no cases were reported from Mumbai.The recently identified group of variants, collectively known as ""FLiRT"", primarily consists of the KP.1.1 and KP.2 strains. The nomenclature of these strains is derived from the specific mutations they possess, with one strain containing mutations represented by the letters ""F"" and ""L"", while the other strain features mutations denoted by the letters ""R"" and ""T"". This subvariant was first identified globally in January and is now the dominant strain in the United States .A recent study conducted by Japanese researchers has revealed that the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, which is a descendant of JN.1, possesses three distinct substitutions in the S protein, including S:R346T and S:F456L, as well as an additional substitution in a non-S protein. These genetic changes have resulted in a notable difference in the reproduction number of KP.2 compared to its predecessor, JN.1.The findings indicate that the reproduction number of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively."" This suggests that KP.2 has a higher transmission rate than JN.1 in these countries. Surprisingly, despite its increased reproduction number, the study also found that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly lower than that of JN.1, with a 10.5-fold difference.The KP.2 variant of COVID-19 is spreading more rapidly compared to the KP.1.1 variant, which is another FLiRT variant. According to the most recent information from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), KP.2 accounts for 28% of COVID cases in the United States, while KP.1.1 cases make up only 7.1% of the total cases.Currently, the variants JN.1, JN.1.7, JN.1.16, and JN.1.13.1 are widely circulating throughout the United States.According to experts, individuals who have previously been infected with the JN.1 variant of COVID-19 may still be susceptible to reinfection with the KP.2 variant, especially if a significant amount of time has passed since their last infection.The most recent vaccine, which targets the XBB.1.5 variant, may not provide complete protection against KP.2 due to the notable differences between JN.1 and its descendants. A preliminary study by Japanese researchers, which has not yet undergone peer review or publication, suggests that KP.2 might be more effective at infecting individuals who have received the latest COVID vaccine.Despite these concerns, doctors emphasize that the vaccine still offers some level of protection, particularly against severe disease, as do previous infections. The CDC spokesperson stated that there is currently no evidence to suggest that KP.2 causes more severe illness compared to other strains. However, certain groups, such as those aged 65 and older, pregnant women, and individuals with compromised immune systems, remain at a higher risk of experiencing serious complications from COVID-19. The CDC has advised individuals aged 65 and older who have already received one dose of the updated vaccine to get an additional shot at least four months later.The most recent information regarding COVID symptoms and long-term effects suggests that the KP.2 and JN.1 variants, which currently account for approximately 16% of cases, likely cause symptoms similar to those associated with other variants. These symptoms include sore throat, runny nose, coughing, head and body aches, fever, congestion, fatigue and, in severe cases, shortness of breath. However, compared to the early stages of the pandemic, fewer people now experience loss of taste and smell. Patients who are often caught off guard by the fact that COVID can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which are sometimes mistaken for signs of norovirus.For individuals who have previously contracted COVID, subsequent infections tend to be as mild or milder than their initial case. Although the incidence of long COVID is lower now compared to the beginning of the pandemic, Fikadu Tafesse, a virus expert at Oregon Health & Science University, cautions that repeated infections increase the risk of developing long COVID.To stay safe from COVID-19, it is essential to adopt preventive measures such as wearing masks in crowded spaces, maintaining hand hygiene, practicing physical distancing, avoiding large gatherings and poorly ventilated areas, disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, staying home when feeling unwell, staying informed about local guidelines and supporting community vaccination efforts.By adhering to these practices, individuals can significantly reduce the risk of contracting and spreading the virus, contributing to the collective effort in mitigating the impact of the pandemic.","Pune reported the highest number of KP.2 cases at 51, followed by Thane with 20 cases.

Guru's stock tips Scam: How Telegram channels turned dreams into nightmares for 200 investors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/gravity-of-scam-hope-lifted-brought-down-to-earth/articleshow/110161976.cms,"NEW DELHI: When a 32-year-old woman was added to a Telegram channel in Jan this year, she was impressed with the content. The members of the group regularly posted about their 'daily returns'. There was a 'guru' who shared stock tips, besides study material and booklets to 'study' the share market.Inspired, the woman also began investing - or at least thought she was.From a sum of a few hundred rupees, her 'portfolio' soon touched six figures and the dashboard showed healthy returns. Her deposits were touching about Rs 25 lakh when, suddenly, her 'investments' tanked. The woman was ghosted by her 'advisors' and left in the lurch. She finally had to approach cops in March.The 32-year-old was not alone; there were at least 200 other unsuspecting members in the group. Most were looking to invest, but became victims of the latest in a series of 'pig-butchering' scams that have hit the city and are being carried out through Telegram, Instagram and WhatsApp .The modus operandi is quite simple - scammers draw in potential targets with promises of returns, lift their hopes and then empty out their accounts. In the past one year, Delhi Police have arrested over 100 such ' investment scammers' employing ingenious tactics to lure victims. The cases, however, continue to rise.From fake websites, dubious groups and a bogus stock investment app, the scams seem to be organised with a lot of infrastructure involved. The operations have technical resources to build and run spoofed websites and apps, as well as rooms of people blasting out messages to lists of contacts purchased on the dark web.""The crooks, with the help of marketing tools, track people interested in the stock market and contact them, posing as representatives of reputed firms. To start with, they offer free stock recommendations and advice on how to venture into the market for quick and high returns,"" said a senior cop from the cyber cell.Several tactics are used, such as offering free training, presenting a fake foolproof trading system, pressuring beginners into making more significant investments, or promising unrealistic returns. To gain the victim's trust, there is often a reference to 'personal experience' with messages such as ""We observed stocks recommended by him reached 10-20% profit in a very short period"", ""I started making profit with every trade"", ""The predictions were almost true every time"", or ""At discounted rates, I made double the profits"".""Each gang member has a role, whether it is a 'fund advisor', 'technical expert' or 'stock manager'. In many cases, the agents impersonate as advisors of reputed banks like HDFC, SBI and ICICI,"" said an officer.According to police, the investment request usually goes up in stages. The figures in the 'investment' reflect healthy returns and the orchestrators often showcase success stories in the group, offering public congratulations for their 'massive winnings'. But once the money is in and the victim asks for a withdrawal, the crooks start providing false trading records or signals.Using high-pressure sales tactics, they coerce investors into depositing more money or making larger trades. Moreover, they create withdrawal hurdles or cite technical hurdles, making it challenging for people to access their funds. The gangs operate on unregulated platforms, enabling manipulation to generate false profits or losses, before finally ghosting the investors.Telegram and Instagram are flooded with such channels, where fraudsters lay traps to entice users. Hoping to make a quick buck, homemakers and retired people are the easiest targets.Warning against joining unverified channels, police have urged people to rely on trusted names instead of random entities. ""The key is in establishing the identity of the person who approaches and being certain about where their office is located,"" said the officer.The verification should be done before even a single rupee is deposited, he said, ""because that's how the pig is fattened"".","The latest in a series of 'pig-butchering' scams that have hit the city.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

EU opens investigation into Meta over addictive social media effects on kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/eu-opens-investigation-into-meta-over-addictive-social-media-effects-on-kids/articleshow/110187929.cms,"EU regulators on Thursday opened investigations into the American tech giant Meta for the potentially addictive effects Instagram and Facebook have on children , an action with far-reaching implications because it cuts to the core of how the company's products are designed.Meta's products may ""exploit the weaknesses and inexperience of minors"" to create behavioral dependencies that threaten their mental well-being, the European Commission, the executive branch of the 27-member bloc, said in a statement.EU regulators could ultimately fine Meta up to 6% of its global revenue, which was $135 billion last year, as well force other product changes.The investigations are part of a growing effort by govts around the world to rein in services like Instagram and TikTok to protect minors. Meta has for years faced criticism that its products and recommendation algorithms are fine-tuned to hook children.EU regulators said they had been in touch with US counterparts about the investigations announced on Thursday. The regulators said Meta could be in violation of the Digital Services Act, a law approved in 2022 that requires large online services to more aggressively police their platforms for illicit content and have policies in place to mitigate risks toward children. ""We will now investigate in-depth the potential addictive and 'rabbit hole' effects of the platforms, the effectiveness of their age verification tools, and the level of privacy afforded to minors in the functioning of recommender systems,"" Thierry Breton, the EU's internal markets commissioner, who is overseeing the investigations, said in a statement. ""We are sparing no effort to protect our children.""On Thursday, Meta said its social media services were safe for young people, noting features that let parents and children set time limits on how much they use Instagram or Facebook. Teenagers are also defaulted into more restrictive content and recommendation settings.

'Is he bathing in blood?': Netizens see red after Charles' portrait unveiled,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/is-he-bathing-in-blood-netizens-see-red-after-charles-portrait-unveiled/articleshow/110187925.cms,"Royal portraits, as a rule, tend to be fairly staid, predictable affairs. Full of symbolism, sure, but generally symbolism of the traditional, establishment kind: symbols of state, of office, of pomp and lineage. Which is why the new official portrait of King Charles III by Jonathan Yeo, the first since the king's coronation, has created such a controversy.A larger-than-life (7.5 feet by 5.5 feet) canvas, the portrait shows the king standing in his Welsh Guards uniform, hands on the hilt of his sword, a half-smile on his face, with a butterfly hovering just over his right shoulder.His entire body is bathed in a sea of crimson, so his face appears to be floating.Although the butterfly was apparently the key piece of semiology - meant, Yeo told the BBC, to represent Charles' metamorphosis from prince to sovereign and his long-standing love of the environment - it was the painting's primary colour that almost instantaneously gave new meaning to the idea of ""seeing red."" It was practically begging for interpretation. ""To me it gives the message the monarchy is going up in flames or the king is burning in hell,"" one commentator wrote under the royal family's Instagram post when the portrait was unveiled. ""It looks like he's bathing in blood ,"" another wrote. Someone else raised the idea of ""colonial bloodshed."" There were comparisons to the devil. And so on. There was even a mention of the Tampax affair, a reference to an infamous comment by Charles revealed when his phone was hacked during the demise of his marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales.In his interview with the BBC, Yeo noted that when the king first saw the painting, he was ""initially mildly surprised by the strong colour"". Yeo said his goal was to produce a more modern royal portrait , reflecting Charles' desire to be a more modern monarch. Still, the choice of shade seems particularly fraught given the firestorm the king has endured since his ascension to the throne. Consider, for example, the continued falling out with his second son, Prince Harry, and the publication of Harry's memoir, with its allegations of royal racism; the related calls for an end to the monarchy; Charles' cancer diagnosis; and the furore over the mystery about Catherine, Princess of Wales, whose own cancer diagnosis was revealed only after increasingly unhinged speculation about her disappearance from public life.It's hard to imagine Yeo didn't anticipate some of the reaction to the portrait. Indeed, the last time a royal portraitist attempted a more abstract, contemporary interpretation of their subject - a 1998 portrait of Queen Elizabeth II by Justin Mortimer, which depicted the queen against a neon yellow background with a splash of yellow bisecting her neck - it produced a similar public outcry. The Daily Mail, at the time, had accused the artist of cutting off the queen's head. NYT","Jonathan Yeo's portrait of King Charles III is the first since the king's coronation.

Lawrence Wong: Singapore gets a new PM after 20 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/singapore-gets-a-new-pm-after-20-years-in-leadership-change-lawrence-wong/articleshow/110152432.cms,"NEW DELHI: Lawrence Wong was sworn in on Wednesday as Singapore 's new prime minister, marking the first leadership change in 20 years and becoming only the fourth leader since the nation's Independence. Wong, 51, is part of the ""4G"" leaders, a new generation of politicians selected by the long-dominant People's Action Party (PAP) to maintain stability and continuity in the city-state.The oath to Wong was administered by President Tharman Shanmugaratnam , 67, in what was described by local media as a low-key leadership transition.He will retain his position as finance minister while taking over from Lee Hsien Loong, the 72-year-old son of Singapore's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Lee Hsien Loong led Singapore for two decades and will stay in Wong's cabinet as senior minister, continuing a tradition of former prime ministers maintaining roles in subsequent administrations.Wong, a government scholar, began his career as an economist at Singapore's trade ministry. He has held significant roles in the bureaucracy, including CEO of the Energy Market Authority and Principal Private Secretary to the prime minister. Entering politics in 2011, Wong joined the Monetary Authority of Singapore's board and later led the culture, national development, and education ministries. He gained prominence in 2020 as co-chair of the Covid-19 taskforce , earning praise for his calm communication of pandemic restrictions. Appointed finance minister in 2021, Wong became deputy prime minister and Lee's designated successor in 2022, earning the ""first among equals"" title. He has chaired the central bank board since 2023. Wong is the first Singaporean leader born after the country's independence in 1965.Wong's succession follows a carefully managed process that saw some delays, including the Covid-19 pandemic and the unexpected withdrawal of Lee's initially chosen successor in 2021. Wong, who emerged as a prominent figure during the pandemic as co-chair of the taskforce, was named Lee's successor in April 2022 after extensive consultations within the PAP leadership and his peers. He was then promoted to deputy prime minister and spearheaded a major public consultation on social issues such as sustainability, inequality, and employment.In his new role, Wong emphasized his commitment to serving Singapore with ""with humility and a deep sense of duty"", vowing to devote all his energy to the nation and its 5.9 million people. On Monday, he made a minor cabinet reshuffle , elevating the trade minister to deputy prime minister, and promised a more significant reshuffle after the next general election, which is due by 2025. Addressing the crowd he said, ""I feel a sense of satisfaction and completeness.""Outgoing prime minister Lee Hsien Loong, in his final major speech on May 1, urged Singaporeans to support Wong, highlighting that the country's stable political environment has enabled effective long-term planning. Lee expressed a sense of fulfillment as he prepared to step down.Opposition leader Pritam Singh acknowledged the challenging circumstances under which Wong is assuming leadership, pointing to an unpredictable global environment and significant domestic generational changes. ""Under Prime Minister Wong's leadership, the Workers' Party will continue to play our legislative role to advance the interests of Singapore and Singaporeans,"" said Singh exuding confidence in Wong's rule.(With inputs from agencies)","Lawrence Wong sworn in as Singapore's new prime minister.

Kamala Harris: Number of Indian Americans in elected offices not reflective of their population: Kamala Harris,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/number-of-indian-americans-in-elected-offices-not-reflective-of-their-population-kamala-harris/articleshow/110165460.cms,"US Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized the need for greater representation of Indian Americans in elected offices , underscoring the disparity between the community's population growth and political presence. Speaking at the annual "" Desis Decide "" summit organized by Indian American Impact , a democratic party think tank, Harris urged members of the minority ethnic group to pursue political careers actively.Harris, the first-ever Indian American, African American, and woman elected as Vice President of the US, addressed a gathering of Indian Americans in the national capital, highlighting the insufficient number of Indian Americans in elected positions relative to their increasing population.“Over the years, we've had so much more participation by Indian Americans in the electoral process running for office. But the numbers are still not reflective of the size of the growing population,” Harris said.Currently, there are five Indian American members of Congress , with Impact projecting this number to double by 2024. Impact emphasized the significant electoral influence of Indian American voters, stating they could sway key races across the country.Harris commended the work of Indian American Impact in electing community members and senators, stressing the importance of political engagement. She encouraged aspiring candidates to run for office, assuring them of support and solidarity.“It really is extraordinary. I wanted to stop by to thank of course the organisation for everything and for all that it represents, but also to say especially to those who have run for office or aspire to run for office, that you must run,” Harris said.“You must know that you are not alone. There is so much that we still have to do as a country and a lot of the work that we each do, which is why we are here together, is born out of a belief in the promise of America. And dare I say that, I am empirical evidence of the promise of America,” said the vice president.“This election coming up in six months, I think is presenting a question to each of us. Which is, what kind of world do we want to live in and what kind of country do we want to live in? And one of the ways that we answer that question is to seek office and to participate in elections knowing that the outcome of those elections matter in fundamental ways,” Harris said as she asked the members of the audience to raise their hands if they were running for office or planning to do so.“What will happen, invariably it's happened to all of us, is you are going to find yourself invariably in rooms where you are the only one who looks like you, the only one who has had your life experience. What I then say to you each, look around this room and hold onto this image. And remember then when you walk into those rooms, when you walk into those situations, you remember, you are not alone. We are all there with you. You must remember that,” she said.Reflecting on her own journey, Harris emphasized the importance of diversity in political representation and encouraged individuals to persevere despite facing challenges. She urged attendees to draw strength from their community and heritage when navigating unfamiliar spaces.Deepak Raj, co-founder and treasurer of Impact, praised Harris's leadership and role as a trailblazer for women, immigrants, and minorities. He hailed her as an inspiration for the community and expressed confidence in a brighter future with increased political participation.During the event, some attendees chanted ""Four more years"" in support of Harris, while one person voiced dissent, prompting their removal from the room.

"Pelican Island Causeway: Barge hits bridge in Texas, causing partial collapse and oil spill",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pelican-island-causeway-barge-hits-bridge-in-texas-causing-partial-collapse-and-oil-spill/articleshow/110163256.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: A barge collided with the Pelican Island bridge pillar in Galveston , Texas , on Wednesday at approximately 10 am, causing oil to spill into the waters near busy shipping channels and shutting down the only road connecting to the small neighboring island.According to Galveston County Sheriff's Office Maj. Ray Nolen, the collision caused fragments of the bridge linking Galveston to Pelican Island to collapse onto the barge, prompting the closure of a section of the waterway for cleanup operations, one man was thrown into the water from the vessel during the incident, but he was quickly rescued with no reported injuries.A bridge superintendent with the Galveston County Navigation District, David Flores said that the accident happened just before 10 am when a tugboat operator lost control of the two barges he was pushing due to strong currents and high tide.""The current was very bad, and the tide was high,"" Flores said. ""He lost it.""The collision occurred in a lesser-used waterway, and experts believe said the collision was unlikely to cause any economic disruptions to the ports along the Texas coast, which are important hubs for international trade. Pelican Island is situated on the opposite side of Galveston Island's popular beaches, which attract millions of tourists annually.Pelican Island, a small island spanning only a few miles, is home to Texas A&M University at Galveston, a large shipyard, and various industrial facilities. At the time of the collision, fewer than 200 people were on the university campus, and all were eventually allowed to leave via the bridge. The marine and maritime research institute announced its plan to remain closed until at least Friday.Students residing on campus were permitted to stay, but university officials cautioned that those who leave ""should be prepared to remain off campus for an unknown period of time.""The tugboat involved in the Texas accident was pushing bunker barges, which are fuel barges for ships, David Flores said.According to Galveston County spokesperson Spencer Lewis, the barge, owned by Martin Petroleum, has a capacity of 30,000 gallons, but the amount of oil that leaked into the bay remains unclear. About 6.5 miles (10.5 kilometers) of the waterway were closed due to the spill, he added.The area located miles away from major shipping channels the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and the bustling Houston Ship Channel, typically experiences frequent barge traffic and serves as a vital route for ocean-going vessels.A maritime transportation expert at the University of Houston, Marcia Burns, said that despite the environmental repercussions of the spill, the incident is unlikely to cause any economic disruption in the area.""Because Pelican Island is a smaller location, which is not in the heart of commercial events, then the impact is not as devastating,"" Burns said.""It's a relatively smaller impact,"" she added.The bridge, which opened in 1960, was rated as ""Poor"" according to the Federal Highway Administration's 2023 National Bridge Inventory as of last June. The rating is based on the condition of individual components, with the deck, superstructure, substructure or culvert absorbing live traffic load being rated as ""Poor.""This rating assesses various components' conditions, with the deck deemed to be in ""Satisfactory Condition,"" the substructure in ""Fair Condition,"" and the superstructure, responsible for bearing live traffic loads, rated as ""Poor"" for the Pelican Island Causeway Bridge.The Texas Department of Transportation had planned to replace the bridge in the summer of 2025, with an estimated project cost of $194 million. The agency acknowledged that the bridge had reached the end of its design lifespan and required replacement, having spent over $12 million on maintenance and repairs in the past decade.In documents provided during a virtual public meeting last year, the department said the bridge has ""reached the end of its design lifespan, and needs to be replaced.""The bridge's main steel span measures 164 feet (50 meters) and was last inspected in December 2021, according to federal data. It is unclear if a state inspection took place after the Federal Highway Administration compiled the data.The bridge had an average daily traffic of approximately 9,100 cars and trucks, based on a 2011 estimate.The incident occurred just weeks after a cargo ship collided with a support column of the Francis Key Bridge in Baltimore on March 26, resulting in the death of six construction workers.","A tugboat operator lost control of the two barges he was pushing due to strong currents and high tide.

BEIJING: China's measured response to the US move to hike tariffs on $18 billion of Chinese goods from syringes to batteries suggests relations between the world's two largest economies face more frost rather than a fresh firefight over trade.China denounced the Biden administration 's action and vowed ""resolute measures"" to protect its interests.But Beijing's response also suggests a new dynamic - and confidence - compared with 2018 when Trump-era tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese goods touched off an escalating trade war , analysts said.Among the differences between then and now: the Biden White House flagged potential measures to Chinese officials in advance and the tariffs target industries, including EVs and batteries, where the economic impact is limited and Chinese companies' dominance appears unassailable.In response to the tariffs, Chinese state media have shot back, accusing the United States of subverting its own free trade principles and taking action that threatens climate goals and will push up costs for American consumers.In essence, the argument goes, you are hurting yourself.That marks a break from the tone in 2018, when a Chinese negotiator said Washington was putting ""a knife to China's neck"" and state media had suggested extreme counter-measures like a boycott of US food imports or a sell-off of US bonds.""China can take the moral high ground,"" said Wang Huiyao, founder and president of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization, a think tank. ""It doesn't play around with those who break international standards and norms.""In the starkest language of its response, the Chinese commerce ministry said the White House had broken the spirit of an agreement to steady bilateral relations reached by Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden late last year in San Francisco.Biden has said he wants to win this era of competition with China but not to launch a trade war, and US officials have looked to engage Beijing on limited areas of cooperation, including climate change.China has time to punch back with targeted actions of its own before the tariffs go into effect, analysts said. But a lot has changed since the trade throwdown in 2018.In that year, Chinese automakers built just under 800,000 electric vehicles. By 2023, EV output had jumped by a factor of eight times, China had surpassed Japan as the world's biggest auto exporter and Chinese carmakers were cranking up expansion plans from Southeast Asia to Europe.Huawei, which had been crippled by US sanctions in 2019, has bounced back, spearheading demand for China-made chips and challenging Apple in the China smartphone business and Tesla for EVs.""What does not kill you makes you stronger,"" Xinhua said in a commentary on the US tariffs. ""It seems the famous quote applies to China's technology companies.""Beijing knew this round of tariffs was coming. In recent visits to China, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and others had drove home a message that China's industrial capacity to make more EVs, solar panels and batteries than its economy can absorb was a risk to American jobs and business.Chinese officials and state media have rejected that argument, saying the country's EV makers dominate because of innovation and supply chain advantages, not subsidies.The United States imported $427 billion in goods from China last year and exported $148 billion to the world's No 2 economy, a trade gap that has persisted for decades and become an ever more sensitive subject in Washington.Both 2024 presidential candidates are taking a tough line on China ahead of November's election, context Chinese officials understand, analysts said.""Does China really want to go to the mat fighting over these tariffs?"" said Sean Stein, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, who said the announced action was at the ""far low end"" of expectations.""The US rollout was restrained,"" he added.Beijing will also be considering who it would prefer to work with once the election is over.""The thing about this Biden initiative is that it is election driven,"" said Wang. ""It is different to what Trump did, as he had already been president for one year and so was pursuing a trade war, rather than election.""","China's measured response to the US move to hike tariffs on $18 billion of Chinese goods suggests relations face more frost rather than a fresh firefight over trade.

The MQM-P leader also said citing a report that there are 70 lakh children in Karachi and over 2.6 crore children in Pakistan, who are not able to go to schools.""Karachi is the revenue engine of Pakistan. The two seaports operational in Pakistan since its inception, are both in Karachi. We (Karachi) are the gateway to the entire Pakistan, Central Asia to Afghanistan...For 15 years, Karachi was not given even a bit of fresh water.

He condemned the failure to provide basic amenities such as fresh water, which has exacerbated the city's challenges.Meanwhile, Pakistan is grappling with economic hardships, including high inflation and mounting debt. The government has sought a new loan program from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to address these pressing issues. Talks between Pakistan and the IMF are underway, with the IMF urging Islamabad to implement comprehensive reforms in the energy sector and tax system.Last month, Pakistan completed a short-term $3 billion program, that helped stave off sovereign default, however, the government has highlighted the need for a fresh, longer-term program, according to Dawn.","Pakistani lawmaker drew a stark disparity between India's space achievements and the pressing issues faced by Karachi.

The combined value of these properties is around $11 billion.“Dubai Unlocked”, an investigative project by over 70 media outlets around the globe, has revealed ownership of hundreds of properties of prominent global figures, including corrupt politicians,money launderers and drug lords, in Dubai.The data covers records of residential properties from 2020 till 2022.Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaksowning 23,000 properties in Dubaiare President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly, former PM Nawaz Sharif’s son Hussain Nawaz, home (interior) minister Mohsin Naqvi’s wife, and several national and provincial lawmakers.While Zardari’s elder daughter, Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari, is a Dubai resident, his son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and daughter, Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, were listed as owners of four properties. Through her lawyers, Aseefa said that all assets owned by her in Dubai have been duly declared to the relevant authorities in Pakistan, including the electoral watchdog.The Pakistani list also features the late former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, former PM Shaukat Aziz, ex-army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa’s son, and more than a dozen retired army generals as well as a police chief, an ambassador and a scientist, all of whom owned properties either directly or through their spouses and children.The Altaf Khanani network, which was sanctioned by the US for involvement in money laundering, has also surfaced in the leaks. Moving illicit funds for organised crime groups, including drug cartels and violent terrorist organisations, the network raked in an estimated turnover of between $14 billion and $16 billion annually. Altaf Khanani, the international face of the organisation, was ultimately convicted and spent nearly six years in a US prison; he was blacklisted by the US on money-laundering charges along with his son, Obaid Khanani, and nephew, Hozaifa Khanani. In Dubai, a country where, reportedly, investing in real estate with bags of cash raises few questions, the Khananis are listed owners of a massive real estate portfolio. Obaid himself is linked to around 30 properties, while the family as a whole were listed owners of 85 properties in early 2020, including around a dozen villas.Notably, several Pakistani families involved in politics and business were absent from the data, despite it being well known that they have bases and family residences in Dubai. This underscores that although the data is solid, it is neither a historical record of property ownership nor a comprehensive representation of all properties purchased by Pakistanis in Dubai . Many owners, according to data, still remain undetected, especially those who purchased property via a third party, or lesser-known company.","Among an estimated 17,000 Pakistanis listed in the leaks are President Asif Ali Zardari’s three children, two of whom are members of the National Assembly.

According to Dawn.com, the leaked data provides a detailed overview of hundreds of thousands of properties in Dubai and information about their ownership or usage, largely from 2020 and 2022.It was obtained by the Centre for Advanced Defence Studies (C4ADS), a non-profit organisation based in Washington, DC, that researches international crime and conflict.The data was then shared with Norwegian financial outlet E24 and the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which coordinated an investigative project with media outlets from around the world. Titled 'Dubai Unlocked', the collaboration includes 74 partners from 58 countries.The website reported that the details of ""an astounding volume of leaked property data that includes over 17,000 properties listed as belonging to Pakistani nationals up to the spring of 2022"" were known to journalists from scores of media outlets around the world.It stated that while 17,000 Pakistani citizens are listed owners in the 2022 leak, academics using the data and additional sources put the actual number of Pakistani owners of residential property in Dubai at 22,000.They further estimate that the apartments and villas may have been worth more than USD 10 billion at the start of 2022, but with the more than 25 per cent increase in property prices over the last two years, the real worth of Pakistanis' residential properties in Dubai could now be well above USD 12.5 billion.""If we have the data you are talking about, as well as the information on residence status, we will make sure those who are eligible to pay tax in Pakistan on rental income or capital value are doing so,"" Malik Amjed Zubair Tiwana, chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), was quoted as saying by the news portal.""It may be a sensitive matter, and perhaps the law will have to change, but with political will we will go all out against tax evaders.

In fact, several of those approached for comment on their properties said they were declared to the tax authorities.""But it does paint an astonishing picture of contrasts.

""On the morning of May 9, 2023, my illegal abduction from the High Court was part of the London Plan (to topple the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government and impose a hybrid system led by the Sharif family on the country), for which General Asim Munir should apologize to me,"" Khan said on X.It is believed that his family is running his social media account.Criticising Gen Munir, Khan said: ""It is the misfortune of this country that a self-proclaimed King (Gen Munir) has taken hold of all the decision-making. I am currently in prison because if I am free, it will challenge the power of that one person.""Khan said the Director General of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) - the media wing of the armed forces - and the Chief of Army Staff are making threatening political statements and involving the army in politics which is tarnishing the image of the army.The powerful Army, which has ruled the coup-prone country for more than half of its 75-plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in matters of security and foreign policy.ISPR DG Maj-Gen Ahmed Sharif last week said that any dialogue with the PTI could happen only if it ""earnestly apologizes publicly in front of the nation, promises to adopt constructive politics, and forgoes politics of anarchy"".Khan said when political statements and press conferences are held, political parties have the right to respond to them.""When the government is given to people lacking democratic mandate, the country becomes an epicenter of corruption and chaos. The chaos that is seen in (Pakistan-occupied) Kashmir today is likely to spread across Pakistan. Form 47 (fake result) non-democratic governments have been established in the entire country.""When a government is elected democratically, it is backed by the people. People value their elected government and if any issues arise, it is resolved through dialogue,"" he said, adding that people place no trust in the imposed governments in Gilgit-Baltistan, PoK, Punjab, and Pakistan; hence the widespread unrest and frustration.He said further backlash will ensue against Form 47 governments when the budget is announced.He further said an artificial set-up has been imposed on the people in the country.""This government has absolutely no authority. An unconstitutional institution like SIFC (Special Investment Facilitation Council, an initiative of the army) has been imposed on Pakistan and no one dares to question it. It was established with the sole purpose of bringing investments, while the Pakistan Business Council has openly stated that investors are withdrawing their investments instead of investing in the country.""On the one hand, the nation was misled with the false hopes of the agricultural revolution and on the other hand, wheat importation to embezzle billions of rupees, has devastated the wheat farmer economically,"" he added.Khan said in this bogus setup, the government is given to those who have all their wealth lying outside in the form of dollars.""A leader has to make sacrifices and this group of Nawaz and Zardari will not sacrifice under any circumstances nor will they bring their money back to the country. General Musharraf and later ISI provided details to everyone including me on their looted money and today they have been imposed on us and their corruption charges are being cleared. The purpose of imposing this fake system on the nation is only to increase the power of this one man (Gen Munir) who has destroyed the entire country for his personal power,"" he said and vowed not to cut a deal with the military.""This country is my country and I will never leave it. Moreover, any deal is also out of the question. Pakistan is being run in a dictatorial manner. Our total revenue is 13.9 trillion rupees, while we have to pay 9.8 trillion rupees annually as interest. The country can never progress with such a punitive use of coercive measures,"" Khan said.","Imran Khan has been in jail since August last in different cases.

Pakistan's Gwadar port exposes China's Belt and Road failure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-gwadar-port-exposes-chinas-belt-and-road-failure/articleshow/110100113.cms,"'Investors thought Gwadar would become Dubai'

China investing heavily in its Belt and Road network

Gwadar performs worse than other new ports

CPEC hampered by political, economic instability

China learning from its mistakes in Pakistan

Unsustainable investment pushes countries into debt

In November 2016, Gwadar port symbolized stability, peace and prosperity for Pakistan — at least according to then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.""This day is the dawn of a new era,"" he told the opening ceremony crowd, which had gathered to witness a row of Chinese trucks arriving to load cargo onto the first-ever container ship to pass through the port.It was the official launch of the port's operations nearly a decade after its completion. The ceremony also marked the start of the prestigious China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), part of China's global collection of infrastructure projects and trade networks known as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Yet today, nearly eight years later, this new era has yet to dawn. A DW analysis shows what went wrong.The idea behind the CPEC was to connect China's western Xinjiang province with the sea via Pakistan. This would shorten trade routes for China and help avoid the contentious Malacca Strait choke point, a narrow waterway between Malaysia and Sumatra that links the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Pakistan, meanwhile, would benefit from increases in trade, infrastructure and industry along the 2,000-kilometer corridor (1,240 miles), all financed by China.In addition to the already established port of Karachi, Gwadar was chosen to connect the corridor to the global shipping network. The small fishing city lies near the Iranian border, some 500 kilometers away from Karachi.Gwadar's recently built deep-sea port, completed in 2007 and handed over to a Chinese operating company in 2013, was to become the heart of the CPEC. It would be integrated into a new special economic zone that would transform Gwardar into a bustling port city.The port has potential, said Azeem Khalid, an assistant professor of international relations at COMSATS University Islamabad who studies Chinese investments in Pakistan. ""It is a natural deep-sea port which can host bigger ships than Karachi. It sits at the crossroads of the global oil trade. And it would consolidate China's regional interests,"" he told DW.At home, China has already proven it can transform sleepy fishing villages into economic powerhouses. Shenzhen, China's first special economic zone, is the best example. In just four decades, the city's population grew from around 60,000 inhabitants to more than 17 million today.""Back then, investors thought Gwadar would become the next Dubai,"" said Khalid.Pakistan is not alone in pursuing this vision. All over the world, governments are hoping to boost their economies through new and expanded ports and other infrastructure projects — and Chinese banks are more than willing to provide financing. Chinese companies often build and operate the ports as well.DW has collated information on at least 38 ports that have been built with Chinese investment since 2000; an additional 43 ports are planned or in construction. Seventy-eight existing ports also have Chinese stakeholders, DW found.These deals are lucrative for China, said Jacob Mardell, a former analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a German think tank, and a journalist covering the BRI.""This model almost kind of acts as a subsidy for Chinese companies,"" he told DW. He explained that Chinese banks loan money to governments that then give that money to Chinese construction companies and pay the loan back to the bank over time. This means the money essentially never leaves China, ""while the bill is ultimately footed by taxpayers in other countries.""One common pattern appears to be building new ports relatively close to already established ones, as is the case with Gwadar and Karachi. The new ports are often meant to supplement or replace the older, less efficient ones over time.This is also the case in Cameroon and Nigeria, for instance. In Cameroon, the newly built port of Kribi is set to replace the congested and far too shallow port of Douala, while in Nigeria, the port of Lagos is supplemented by the just-opened Lekki deep-sea port, less than 100 kilometers away. Both ports were financed and built by Chinese state-owned companies.Similarly, in 2017, the government of Sri Lanka granted China a 99-year lease and majority stake in its relatively new Hambantota port, which was originally intended to supplement the country's main port of Colombo.Lekki port received 26 ships in 2023, its first year of operation, according to ship tracking and maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic. It's a modest number compared to bigger ports — but Gwadar, despite being completed in 2007, has only logged 22 ships in its best year to date. It has also failed to attract any regularly scheduled deep-sea shipping lines.This means Gwadar processes almost no cargo that could generate income for Pakistan — or, for that matter, for the Chinese operating company. And it's no wonder: Gwadar is operating at very limited capacity. The port's three berths, where loading and unloading takes place, can handle 137,000 standard 20-foot shipping containers per year. In contrast, Karachi and its 33 berths can handle the equivalent of 4.2 million 20-foot containers per year.While ports like Kribi or Lekki are comparatively small, they outshine Gwadar, the supposed new centerpiece of trade for South and Central Asia.Khalid told DW that although Gwadar has the potential to eventually surpass Karachi, a lack of investment is holding it back. A $1.6 billion (€1.5 billion) expansion was promised in 2015, but little progress appears to have been made at the port since then. Much of the supporting infrastructure, including roads and railways needed to transport cargo to and from Gwadar, is also missing.Publicly, investors like the China Pakistan Investment Corporation still claim Gwadar port is ""becoming a focal point for trade and investment in the region."" But the empty port site suggests the opposite.Mardell and Khalid said that behind the scenes, both Pakistan and China have become disillusioned with the project.""Jobs promises were not met. Industrial promises were not met. The business opportunities for Pakistanis were not met,"" said Khalid. ""They [China] promised nine special economic zones. Not one is fully functional to date.""The of development in Gwadar broadly mirrors the situation in the rest of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. ""CPEC has had problems since its inception,"" said Mardell.Some of these problems are specific to the border region of Balochistan, where Gwadar is situated. It is among the poorest regions of Pakistan and has strong separatist militias that commonly carry out attacks, including some that have specifically targeted Chinese nationals. In turn, the militias have been violently suppressed by the Pakistani military.At the national level, Pakistan has been experiencing a severe economic crisis in recent years, and the country is still struggling to stabilize politically after the ousting of former Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022.""Since the political and security situation in Pakistan has deteriorated more recently, that's hampered CPEC even more,"" said Mardell.On the Chinese side, Mardell thinks decision-makers might have miscalculated.""When it comes to investment decisions, the Chinese are famously not risk-averse,"" he told DW. He says ""basically unlimited"" state backing for state-owned investment and construction companies, coupled with the political will to rapidly step up competition with Western economies, has led China to fund even very risky projects in less stable countries worldwide.""I just don't think they fully understood the situation in Pakistan going in,"" said Mardell, though he believes this might change for other projects going forward. ""I think they've learned from their mistakes with the BRI and with CPEC, and they're probably more reluctant to commit capital nowadays.""In the last few years, and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, China's spending on BRI projects has slowed. But while the country may now be more selective in which projects it funds, it is starting to invest more again, with total BRI investment amounts having reached pre-pandemic levels.Still, countries like Pakistan are now stuck paying back large amounts of debt to Chinese lenders. ""Pakistan has to pay billions of dollars back in loans, because of reckless investments in the name of CPEC,"" said Khalid.Similar cases have previously led to criticism that China is conducting debt-trap diplomacy, allowing partner countries to go into unsustainable amounts of debt to gain political influence.Moreover, part of the revenue from the newly built projects also goes back to China.""China gets the lion's share of everything,"" Khalid said, referring to CPEC investments. With Gwadar port, for instance, 90% of the quite limited revenue goes to the Chinese operating company. The Pakistani government receives 10%, while nothing goes to the Balochi regional government.Mardell said that the CPEC and Gwadar port with it will likely continue despite all its issues.""There's no way that China will lose face and admit that it's a disaster. And pulling out of CPEC and abandoning Pakistan isn't an option now. They're in too deep, and Pakistan is too important an ally,"" he said.Instead, he thinks it's likely China will continue to drag its feet on large investments in Pakistan, but still show token amounts of effort to keep the project going.Yet, he said, there's still a chance for Gwadar.

In a statement, the High Commission of India in the Maldives asserted that Indian aviation platforms in the Maldives have always operated according to the ""agreed procedures and with due authorization.""The clarification came days after India completed the withdrawal of 76 military personnel from the Maldives following a demand by President Mohamed Muizzu .Relations between India and Maldives deteriorated since Muizzu, a pro-China leader, came to power in November last year.Muizzu had set May 10 as the deadline for the withdrawal of the Indian military troops from his country.Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, defence minister Ghassan said he knew of one of the aviation platforms undertaking an unauthorized sortie.He narrated an incident where one of the two helicopters operated by Indian military personnel in the Maldives landed in Thimarafushi, allegedly without permission - a case, which he said, was reviewed by the Parliament's Committee on National Security Services (241 Committee), when he was a lawmaker.However, the Indian mission dismissed the allegation.""Indian aviation platforms in the Maldives have always operated as per agreed procedures and with due authorization from the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF),"" the High Commission of India said.Referring to the remarks by the Maldivian defence minister, the High Commission said the particular incident which saw an emergency landing at Thimarafushi on October 9, 2019, was ""necessitated due to an unforeseen exigency.""""The specific sortie on 09 October 2019 referred to at the press conference was also undertaken with the approval of MNDF.The emergency landing at Thimarafushi was necessitated due to an unforeseen exigency, which was carried out after taking necessary on-ground approvals from the Air Traffic Control (ATC) to ensure the safety and security of the platform and crew,"" the High Commission asserted.According to local media reports, on May 11, the MNDF revealed that the Indian military personnel who were previously operating the helicopters gifted to the Maldives by the Indian government had made a trip on the helicopter without notifying the Maldivian military during the administration of former President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih.Incidentally, at the same press conference, defence minister Ghassan also confessed that the Maldives military still does not have pilots capable of operating three aircraft donated by India.The Indian military personnel were stationed in the Maldives to operate two helicopters and a Dornier aircraft gifted by India.

The announcement to privatize state-run enterprises barring strategic ones comes a day after Pakistan started negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a new long-term Extended Fund Facility (EFF).Sharif announced this while chairing a review meeting on the privatization process of loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs), according to media reports.During the meeting, he said that apart from strategic state-owned firms, all other enterprises - profitable or loss-making - will be privatized, Geo News reported.Asserting that the government's job is not to do business but to ensure a business and investment-friendly environment, Sharif directed all ministries to take action and cooperate with the privatization commission.Underscoring the need for the privatization process to be transparent, he ordered the privatization process of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) to be televised, including the bidding and other important steps. The PIA's privatization is in its final stage, the report said.Pakistan's ailing national flag carrier stood as the country's third-highest public sector loss-making entity, requiring Pakistani Rs 11.5 billion per month solely for servicing its debts.The process of privatization of other institutions will also be broadcast live, the report said.A roadmap of the Privatization Programmed 2024-2029 was also presented during the meeting, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.Ministers were informed that loss-making SOEs were to be privatized on a priority basis and that a pre-qualified panel of experts was being appointed in the Privatization Commission to speed up the sell-off process, the report said.Prime Minister Sharif-led government has pushed for the privatization of several state-owned enterprises to tackle the burden on the exchequer and the prevailing financial crunchPreviously, debt-struck Pakistan had plans to privatise only loss-making state-owned enterprises, the Dawn newspaper repoted.On Sunday, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that privatisation is necessary to achieve economic stability in the country.""You have to move towards privatisation if you want economic stability in the country,"" Aurangzeb said while speaking at the Pre-Budget Conference 2024-25 here.Last week, Deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar said the government would limit its business only to strategic and essential SOEs under its domain and their number would be reduced from 40 after scrutiny.Privatisation has long been on the Washington-based IMF's list of recommendations for Pakistan, which is struggling with a high fiscal shortfall, the report said.Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high of 38 per cent last May.The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall, and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around 2 per cent this year compared to negative growth last year.","Cash-strapped Pakistan will privatize all state-owned enterprises (SOEs), inclu ding the loss-making Pakistan International Airlines.

‘Like he’s bathing in blood’: King Charles portrait speaks diverse reactions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/like-hes-bathing-in-blood-king-charles-portrait-speaks-diverse-reactions/articleshow/110176539.cms,"(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: A newly unveiled portrait of King Charles III has drawn vivid and varied reactions, with some viewers suggesting the depiction looks as though ""he’s bathing in blood."" The large-scale painting , measuring 2.6 by 2 meters, was commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Drapers and will be displayed in the Drapers’ Hall gallery in downtown London .The portrait, created by a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery who has previously painted prominent royal figures, including Queen Camilla and the late Prince Philip, reflects a more controversial image of the monarch. The artist, Jonathan Yeo, mentioned that King Charles participated actively in the portrait's conceptual phase, even suggesting the inclusion of a butterfly on his shoulder to symbolize his environmental advocacy and his transformative journey to the throne, a South China Morning Post report said.""Much like the butterfly I've painted hovering over his shoulder, this portrait has evolved as the subject's role in our public life has transformed,"" Yeo, 53, who has previously painted Charles' late father Prince Philip, said in a statement.""My aim was also to make reference to the traditions of Royal portraiture but in a way that reflects a 21st Century Monarchy and, above all else, to communicate the subject's deep humanity.""Despite King Charles's involvement, he was ""initially surprised by the strong color,"" Yeo revealed to the BBC. When the portrait was unveiled, the king appeared to react sharply to the vivid portrayal. The piece has also stirred online discussions, drawing references to the royal family’s controversial historical actions and personal scandals.Some social media users drew humorous comparisons to the ""Ghostbusters"" villain, Vigo the Carpathian. Critical comments on platforms like Instagram included descriptions of the portrait as making Charles appear ""like he's in hell"" or ""bathing in blood.""Queen Camilla, however, had a positive view of the portrayal, reportedly saying, “Yes, you’ve got him,” upon seeing the painting for the first time.The portrait was commissioned to celebrate Charles' 50 years as a member of the Drapers’ Company, which was set up more than 600 years ago as a trade association for wool merchants.Philanthropy came to be part of their mission and the company is now a grant-giving body.","A portrait of King Charles III has been unveiled in London.
