New NPS Budget 2024 Benefits Explained: In the Budget 2024, the government has announced significant changes to the National Pension System (NPS) contributions, allowing for greater tax savings. The contribution limit for employers in the private sector has been raised from 10% to 14% of the employee's basic salary. This new limit applies to both private and public sector employees, exclusively under the new tax regime.Shalini Jain, Tax Partner, People Advisory Services at EY India, emphasises that this increase will enable employees opting for the new tax regime to save more taxes and build a larger pension pool for social security.According to an ET report, the Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, highlighted in her Budget 2024 speech that the deduction for employers' contributions towards NPS will be increased from 10% to 14% of the employee’s salary. This deduction applies to employees in the private sector, public sector banks, and undertakings who opt for the new tax regime.The tax benefits on investing in NPS depend on the tax regime chosen by the taxpayer in the relevant financial year. Under the current income tax laws, the old tax regime allows for three deductions under the Income-tax Act, 1961, while the new tax regime allows only one deduction.Under the old tax regime, an individual can claim up to Rs 9.5 lakh in deductions through three routes:Under the new tax regime, an individual can claim a deduction of up to Rs 7.5 lakh under Section 80CCD (2).Upon withdrawal, an individual must use at least 40% of the NPS corpus to purchase an annuity plan from an insurance company. The remaining 60% can be withdrawn as a lump sum.On October 27, 2023, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) announced that NPS subscribers can withdraw up to 60% of their pension corpus via a systematic lump sum withdrawal (SLW) method. Subscribers can withdraw the lump sum in a phased manner (monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, or annually) up to the age of 75 years.However, there is still a lack of clarity among tax experts regarding the tax-free status of money withdrawn via the SLW method.On January 12, 2024, the PFRDA issued a master circular on partial withdrawals from the NPS Tier-I account. Partial withdrawals are allowed for specific reasons such as:Other conditions for partial withdrawal include:","Tax benefits on investing in NPS depend on the tax regime chosen by the taxpayer in the relevant financial year.

Budget 2024: How TCS is set to become less TDS for salaried class,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2024-how-tcs-is-set-to-become-less-tds-for-salaried-class/articleshow/111970089.cms,"Top Picks For You Budget 2024: Out with old, new makes news

Individuals miffed at tax collection at source ( TCS ) proposals have now been offered a small relief - provided they have salary income .At present, a salaried employee may declare income, such as bank interest and rent, to their employer, who factors this and, accordingly, deducts a higher tax against the monthly salary. The employee then does not have to worry about paying advance tax as adequate tax has already been withheld.A similar norm comes into effect from Oct 1.The salaried employee will be able to declare TCS and the employer will factor this in, resulting in a lower TDS against salary income. Thus, it will avoid cash-flow issues. Further, if a refund was due, owing to TCS, the individual taxpayer will no longer have to wait for it as it is adjusted against TDS on salary income.TCS applies to a wide range of remittances made under Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of Reserve Bank of India. It permits an individual to remit up to $2.5 lakh per year, without seeking prior approval.Thus far, purchase of an overseas tour package pinched the pocket - it meant a 5% TCS for a remittance of up to Rs 7 lakh; if the expenditure was higher, TCS was 20%. Or for that matter, sending a child overseas meant that TCS at 5% was deducted for any remittance above Rs 7 lakh (the rate was lower for remittances via education loans).In short, the Budget has added a sweetener to TCS provisions for salaried individuals.","The salaried employee will be able to declare TCS and the employer will factor this in, resulting in a lower TDS against salary income.

'Rescued economy from bankruptcy': Congress remembers Manmohan Singh on 33rd anniversary of 1991 economic reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rescued-economy-from-bankruptcy-congress-remembers-manmohan-singh-on-33rd-anniversary-of-1991-economic-reforms/articleshow/111975670.cms,"'No power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come'



NEW DELHI: With a looming international debt crisis fueled by instable political situation and Gulf crisis at the time, India had foreign exchange reserves that could ""suffice to finance imports for a mere fortnight.""

This came in the light of announcing financial packages for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh in an effort to ""Appease Allies: Hollow promises to them at the cost of other states.""Concluding his Budget speech with Victor Hugo's words -- “no power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come”-- Manmohan Singh bequeathed India an economy that initiated the privatization of public sector enterprises, liberalized airspace, catalyzed the emergence of new industries, and significantly boosted disposable incomes for the middle class, thereby fueling consumerism.Under his leadership, export/import regulations were relaxed, and significant strides were made in improving the business environment, fostering a surge in entrepreneurship and a influx of international goods.Further, the establishment of NSE, India’s largest stock exchange, in 1992 underscored his tenure. Manmohan Singh played a pivotal role in steering the country away from financial crisis, revitalizing the economy, and propelling it towards substantial growth.","The budget dedicated to former PM Rajiv Gandhi marked a significant shift towards a market-oriented economy.

"India tests ballistic missile defence system to intercept 5,000-km class enemy missiles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-tests-ballistic-missile-defence-system-to-intercept-5000-km-class-enemy-missiles/articleshow/111996217.cms,"NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of its two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD) system, with the defence ministry promptly proclaiming it demonstrated the indigenous capability to defend against hostile nuclear-capable missiles in the 5000-km range class.In the test, the “target missile” mimicking an enemy’s long-range ballistic missile was first launched from the Dhamra missile launch complex in Odisha at 4.20 pm.Swiftly “detected” by radars deployed on land and sea, the BMD system then kicked into action to launch the “AD (advanced area defence) endo-atmospheric interceptor missile” from the integrated test at Chandipur at 4.24 pm.“The interceptor destroyed the target. The flight-test fully met all the trial objectives, validating the complete network-centric warfare weapon system consisting of long-range sensors, low latency communication system and advanced interceptor missiles,” a DRDO official said.The solid-fuelled, two-stage interceptor missile system is meant for “neutralising many types of enemy ballistic missile threats in the altitude bracket of endo to low exo-atmospheric regions”, he added. Congratulating the DRDO for the successful flight test, defence minister Rajnath Singh said it has again demonstrated the country’s BMD capability.India, unlike countries like the US, Russia, China and Israel, however still has a long way to go before it can operationally deploy an effective BMD system, with an overlapping network of early-warning and tracking sensors, reliable command and control posts, land and sea-based batteries of advanced interceptor missiles.The DRDO has successfully completed a series of tests for the Phase-1 of the BMD system, which is designed to track and destroy enemy ballistic missiles in the 2,000-km range class, both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere at altitudes from 15-25 km to 80-100 km for “a higher kill probability”, as was earlier reported by TOI.Even as the Phase-I of the BMD system, with the interceptor missiles flying at Mach 4.5 supersonic speeds, is yet to be deployed, DRDO had tested a new long-range flexible interceptor missile called AD-1under the Phase-II in November 2022.Then, DRDO also conducted the maiden flight trial of a sea-based endo-atmospheric interceptor missile from a warship in April last year. Apart from a land-based BMD system, a mobile sea-based version is also required to build an operationally effective missile shield. “Sea-based version gives you distributive capability,” an officer said.The US, incidentally, has around 50 ship-borne Aegis BMD systems that provide layered air and missile defence against all sorts of missiles, from short-range ones to ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles).India till now has refrained from sanctioning the full-scale operational deployment of the Phase-1 of the BMD system at any vital location. This could be due to the high costs involved, or even strategic calculations that it may provoke Pakistan to go in for a larger nuclear arsenal and countermeasures to defeat the BMD system, as reported by TOI earlier.India’s BMD programme has been in the works since the late-1990s, with its first interceptor missile being tested in November 2006. Having conducted over a dozen tests of the BMD system since then, a few of which have failed, DRDO in the past has said that it has a “kill probability of 99.8%” with the mix of exo and endo-interceptor missiles.The IAF, of course, has inducted the Russian S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile systems that can detect, track and destroy incoming strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, drones and even some intermediate-range ballistic missiles at a range of 380-km.",India on Wednesday successfully flight-tested an endo-atmospheric interceptor missile under Phase-II of its two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD) system.

'Judicial impropriety': 2 Supreme Court benches hearing same tree felling issue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judicial-impropriety-2-supreme-court-benches-hearing-same-tree-felling-issue/articleshow/111997199.cms,"NEW DELHI: A case of illegal felling of hundreds of trees in south Delhi’s Ridge area , in which the CM and LG had been pulled up for their allegedly unlawful acts, took a sudden twist on Wednesday. A Supreme Court bench, which had passed a slew of stinging orders over the issue, faced charges of “judicial impropriety” for taking up the case while it was already pending before another bench.The two SC benches —one headed by Justice B R Gavai and the other by Justice Abhay S Oka — have been dealing with a case pertaining to widening of a road in the Ridge.On Wednesday, Gavai, after discovering that the matter had also been heard by Oka, said his bench had first initiated contempt proceedings against DDA in the case and Oka should’ve sought clarification from CJI before going ahead with the hearing. “The other bench has not adhered to judicial propriety,” Gavai said, put the proceedings before his bench on hold and referred the matter to “master of roster” CJI.Perhaps the case landed up before the two benches because of the overlap of their briefs — the bench headed by Justice Gavai deals in forest matters, while the one headed by Justice Oka adjudicates issues pertaining to environment, including the pollution crisis in NCR and protection of green cover around Taj Mahal and Taj Trapezium Zone. Going by the domain, permission for cutting of trees has to be sought from the Justice Oka-led bench.The bench headed by Justice Gavai had passed an order restraining DDA from allotting land in the Ridge area to anyone without the court's permission and issued a contempt notice to the DDA vice-chairman in April when it was brought to its notice that certain parcels had been given for widening of a road in violation of its order.In the meantime, another petition was filed in the SC highlighting that hundreds of trees were cut in violation of the law for widening of roads, and was listed before a bench headed by Justice Oka, which too issued a contempt notice to the DDA vice-chairman on illegal cutting of trees. Hearing in the case has reached an advanced stage in the last one month and the court, after examining the records, found that there was violation of law on behalf of all authorities concerned.As the case came up for hearing on Wednesday before Justices Gavai, Prashant Kumar Mishra and K V Viswanathan, they noted that another bench was also hearing the matter and said it was not proper that parallel proceedings be conducted in the case.Advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for the petitioner who had brought to the court's notice the felling of trees, said it was not a case of impropriety by the Justice Oka bench as separate applications were filed. Opposing the submission made by senior advocate Vikas Singh on behalf of DDA seeking the court's permission for widening of roads, he said DDA had assured the other bench that it would withdraw the notification and it could not be allowed to do a U-turn. He further said it did not make any difference to him which bench heard the case but he was concerned about the court’s order.Advocate K Parameshwar, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, told the bench that the contempt proceedings initiated by the Justice Oka-led bench have ""substantially travelled"".The court, after a brief hearing, passed an order referring the case to the CJI. ""In order to avoid conflicting orders, it is appropriate that matters of Ridge area be heard by the same bench. We direct the registrar judicial to place it before the CJI to obtain necessary instructions and clarifications,"" it said.On the last hearing in the case before a bench of Justices Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan, the court found fault with all authorities — DDA, Delhi govt, CM, LG — for allowing felling of trees and had said they should have accepted their mistake on day one instead of trying to “cover up”.It had said Delhi govt had permitted felling of trees when it did not have the power to do so and there was complete non-application of mind by LG V K Saxena in approving the Delhi govt’s proposal.",A Supreme Court bench faced charges of “judicial impropriety’ for taking up the case while it was already pending before another bench.

Lammy is also learnt to have assured India that the new government will be tough on terrorism, while recalling Starmer’s remark earlier that there is no place for Hinduphobia in Britain.According to the UK, Lammy, seeking greater growth for both countries, pushed for a reset of the UK-India partnership including through reinforcing the UK’s commitment to securing a Free Trade Agreement that will benefit both economies.Ahead of his arrival, the British high commission quoted Lammy as saying in a statement, “Our Free Trade Agreement negotiations is the floor not the ceiling of our ambitions to unlock our shared potential and deliver growth, from Bengaluru to Birmingham''.``We have shared interests on the green transition, new technologies, economic security and global security,’’ said Lammy, who as a opposition leader had criticised the Conservative government for failing to close the trade deal with India.According to the high commission, Lammy galvanised support for accelerated action on the climate crisis with India as an indispensable partner – driving forward the clean energy transition and creating opportunities for British and Indian businesses. ``He will discuss partnering on Indian-led global initiatives to build clean power access, climate resilience in the global south and small island states,’’ it said.``The Foreign Secretary will underscore the importance of the Living Bridge between the UK and India. It represents the 1.7 million people with Indian heritage that have made their home in the UK and make an exceptional contribution to British life,’’ added the high commission in its statement.","The 2 sides launched a technology security initiative (TSI), along the lines of India-US iCET, to further elevate the strategic partnership. The initiative will strengthen cooperation in critical and emerging technologies, including AI, quantum and telecoms.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111997561,imgsize-24860,width-400,resizemode-4/111997561.jpg"

Supreme Court stays Madras HC order for valuation of LVB equity shares,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-stays-madras-hc-order-for-valuation-of-lvb-equity-shares/articleshow/111997241.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed a Madras high court order directing Reserve Bank of India to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of shares and bonds of the distressed Laxmi Vilas Bank ( LVB ), prior to its amalgamation with Singapore's DBS Bank India in 2020. RBI and DBS Bank had questioned the legality of the HC's April 26 order.Appearing for RBI, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra that to revive LVB, RBI had persuaded Singapore's DBS Bank to take it over to protect small depositors' interest.He said the HC decision off-tracks the entire scheme which was based on an agreement between RBI and DBS for taking over of LVB. For DBS, senior advocate Shyam Divan said writing off the equities and bonds was part of DBS's pre-condition to take over LVB and any variation would adversely impact the amalgamation that took place in Nov 2020.Countering their contention, senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Arvind Datar said that the scheme for amalgamation can go on, but surely 92,000 ordinary equity holders could not be told one fine day that the value of their shares in LVB was zero even without a valuation being carried out. Both said they do not advocate the case of LVB bond holders.When the bench during the hearing mulled allowing valuation of equities, the SG said it would lead to unscrambling of the egg as the scheme was based on certain pre-conditions put by DBS. Divan said when the bank had negative value in 2020, the equities could not be said to carry any value and that was the reason the DBS had put a pre-condition that the equities and bonds are required to be written off.Brushing aside protests of Singhvi and Datar, the SC stayed the evaluation of equities and said, ""Valuation of shares four years down the line completely vitiates the scheme of amalgamation. The HC order is at complete variance of the scheme. If the HC order is upheld, then investors' confidence in the regulatory mechanism would be shaken affecting investments.""""We are in a completely different economy... Courts must be very very careful in interfering with such matters,"" the bench said, but agreed to adjudicate the issue raised by equity holdersThe HC had noted that a review of RBI's decision should consider the grievances of shareholders and bondholders and seek to mitigate any hardships caused by the compulsory amalgamation.

""Ordering removal of a judgment is an extreme step that goes against the universal right to information,"" the bench said.Moreover, since judgment of trial courts and high courts get published in book form, SC, while adjudicating the complex issue, would find itself confronting another dimension of it - can these books containing the judgments be also barred from being perused by the public?

Another test of nerves for students: CUET exam held in May but results not out yet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/another-test-of-nerves-for-students-cuet-exam-held-in-may-but-results-not-out-yet/articleshow/111997234.cms,"TOI

Another NTA-administered exam . Another lot of students who don’t know what’s happening. Even as NEET grabs headlines for all the wrong reasons, CUET — NTA’s test for college/university admissions — seems headed for bad news as well.A Mumbai-based private university, Somaiya Vidyavihar, that signed up for taking students basis their undergraduate CUET scores is holding induction programmes for freshmen.The university’s seats are all filled, and admissions have closed.Just one problem —CUET UG exams happened in May, results aren’t out yet. For universities and students, this is déjà vu. Last year, too, CUET results were delayed. Some universities pulled out of CUET as a result.This time, 1.4 million students took UG CUET, and, again, they don’t know what’s happening. Naturally, there are multiple anxieties.Anxiety No. 1: Most private universities accept CUET scores and hold their own entrance exams. Should everyone wait for CUET results and postpone the academic calendar? This will have knock on effects. Not just delayed start, but extra classes to finish the first part of the curriculum, shortening university holidays.Anxiety No. 2: Students are worried how long universities will wait for CUET scores. So, those who can, are arranging fallbacks. Ekta Jain, who wants to study psychology and is waiting for her CUET score, has secured a spot in another college as back-up.Anxiety No. 3: Will students lose money? UGC had said tuition paid by students should be refunded by September if admission is cancelled. But many students stand to lose what they paid as hostel fee. There’s also the additional spend from securing a backup admission. Nyasa Gautam, from Indore, says the backup admission has been an extra cost, which has added to the stress.Universities have started accepting students basis their own admission exams or other test scores, without waiting for CUET. Neelakanttan T A, from Thiruvananthapuram, says his preferred option was a central university, not a private one. But since Azim Premji university admissions are open, he’s decided to enrol there.Some institutions are resigned to the fact that the academic calendar will be messed up. All universities in Hyderabad are waiting for CUET results. “We are hoping that the results will be declared in a day or two so that we won’t lose much,” said Ishtiaque Ahmed, registrar, Maulana Azad National Urdu University.Visva Bharati’s acting public relations officer Atig Ghosh said extra classes or curtailing vacations will have to be considered. Other universities that have not started admissions expressed similar sentiments.Kanhaiya Ahuja, CUET admissions coordinator at Indore’s DAVV, said, “The delay leaves us with only three and a half months to complete the syllabus for the first semester, which needs to be over by Dec.”The CUET delay has pushed back the calendar by at least a fortnight for Central University of Gujarat (CUG), the only university in the state admitting students through the central test.Darshan Maru, controller of examination at CUG, toldthat the PG admissions are already done for 300-odd students, whereas admissions are pending for UG courses. “We have 100-odd seats in three disciplines where admissions take place through CUET. Last year too, these admissions had started in August,” he said."," CUET UG exams happened in May, results aren’t out yet. For universities and students, this is déjà vu.

The district horticulture department of Gorakhpur is also contributing to the efforts.T Damodaran, Director, CISH, said that the institute aims to enhance the yield and quality of Paniyala.Additionally, gardeners will receive canopy management training, facilitating orchard maintenance.Paniyala has grown abundantly in Purvanchal till six decades ago. However, today, it is found only in Gorakhpur, Deoria, and Maharajganj districts. The fruit is known for its unique flavour, which is sour, sweet, and slightly astringent. Besides its distinctive flavor, Paniyala is valued for its medicinal properties.In order to enhance the production and quality of Paniyala, scientists from CISH surveyed Paniyala-dominant areas of Gorakhpur and nearby districts last year.The fruits will undergo physical and chemical analysis in the institute's laboratory to assess their diversity. The best trees will be selected for preservation, and new plants will be produced through grafting to make them available to farmers and gardeners.This year, around Dussehra, when Paniyala is in peak season, the team will return to collect high-quality fruits for evaluation. The best specimens will be used to establish nurseries, which will then be supplied to farmers.""The organization will assist farmers with technology and market access,"" said the director.Paniyala is known for its antibacterial properties, which are found in its leaves, bark, roots, and fruits. These properties make it beneficial for various stomach ailments, dental issues, bleeding gums, coughs, pneumonia, and itching. Additionally, the fruit is helpful for liver diseases and contains several antioxidants.During the Chhath festival in eastern UP, the fruit is sold at a high price of up to Rs 400 per kg. In recognition of its value, the centre is working to designate it as a geographical indicator of Gorakhpur. Paniyala can also be preserved as jam, jelly, or juice, extending its shelf life. It is valuable for wood, fuel, and agricultural uses.GI tagging is poised to be a game-changer for Paniyala, a fruit that is a treasure trove of medicinal properties. This designation is expected to ignite a surge in its demand, potentially catapulting it to the status of a distinguished product of Gorakhpur, akin to the revered Terracotta.SP Singh, senior horticulture scientist at Krishi Vigyan Kendra Belipar (Gorakhpur), said that the benefits of GI tagging would extend beyond Gorakhpur and benefit farmers from Deoria, Kushinagar, Maharajganj, Siddharthnagar, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Bahraich, Gonda, and Shravasti, the districts which share the same agroclimatic zone, resulting in similar agricultural product qualities.The GI tag legally protects regional agricultural products, preventing unauthorized use and enhancing their significance. It also acts as a trademark on the international stage, boosting exports and increasing local income.Paniyala farming yields higher profits compared to traditional crops. The trees grow to about nine meters in height, making them relatively easy to maintain.","Paniyala has grown abundantly in Purvanchal till six decades ago.

What are the new income tax slabs under the new tax regime?

As per the changes announced by FM Sitharaman, following are the new income tax slabs for the new or simplified tax regime:

No tax for income up to Rs 3 lakh 5% tax rate for income between Rs 3 lakh to Rs 7 lakh 10% tax rate for income between Rs 7 lakh and Rs 10 lakh 15% tax rate for income between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 12 lakh 20% tax rate for income between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 15 lakh 30% tax rate for income above Rs 15 lakh

Budget 2024 income tax changes explained: Salaried taxpayers have reason to cheer! Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced major changes in the new income tax regime during her Union Budget 2024 speech. These changes will give many salaried taxpayers a benefit of Rs 17,500 - provided that they are opting for the new income tax regime!“Coming to Personal Income Tax Rates, I have two announcements to make for those opting for the new tax regime…as a result of these changes, a salaried employee in the new tax regime stands to save up to Rs 17,500/- in income tax,” Sitharaman said.The standard deduction under the new income tax regime has been hiked from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Also the income tax slabs have been adjusted for FY 2024-25 so that the 5% tax rate is now applicable for income up to Rs 7 lakh. Some other changes have also been introduced.As is evident from the table above, at various income levels, the benefits will vary. The base income tax benefit of Rs 17,500 announced by FM Sitharaman does not include the cess. It also doesn't include surcharge at higher income levels. As per the analysis by EY, you will now have to pay zero tax of income up to Rs 7.75 lakh. For income up to Rs 10 lakh, you will annually save Rs 10,000 (without cess). If one were to include cess then the benefit will go up.Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner at EY India explains, “The changes in the new tax regime will benefit taxpayers. For instance, under Scenario 3, where the gross salary is Rs 20,00,000, the total tax payable under the current new tax regime amounts to Rs 2,96,400, whereas under the proposed new tax regime, the tax payable is reduced to Rs 2,78,200.”“This translates to a direct saving of Rs 17,500 (excluding cess), thereby, highlighting the government's commitment to providing a more simplified and beneficial tax structure for taxpayers,” she tells TOI.","The income tax slab and standard deduction changes under the new income tax regime will benefit salaried individuals at what income level. The new tax regime has been announced by the Sitharaman government. The changes will take effect from January 1, 2015.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111958639,imgsize-77076,width-400,resizemode-4/111958639.jpg"

For food lovers, vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods altogether make for a wholesome experience that is what they look for in any new city they travel. While some pay more attention to vegetarian food, there are people who prefer non-vegetarian food. But, there exists a city, where there is only vegetarian food, and sale, purchase, and consumption of non-vegetarian food is completely banned.Scroll down to read the details.The Palitana town in Gujarat's Bhavnagar district has become the world's first city to completely ban non-vegetarian food, including the sale and consumption of meat and eggs. As per reports, it all started after a massive protest by Jain monks including a 2014 hunger strike by nearly 200 monks demanding the closure of around 250 butcher shops. As a result, respecting the sentiments of the Jain community, the government implemented the ban, prohibiting the sale of meat, eggs, and the slaughtering of animals, with penalties for violations.Also known as the City of Temples, with 800 intricately carved Jain temples built over 900 year, the food in Palitana is inspired by Jain cuisine, which is strictly vegetarian and excludes root vegetables. As Jain cuisine is based on the philosophy of non-violence, vegetables growing under the soil are also not consumed to avoid harming microorganisms. Also, as some Jains also avoid milk and milk-based products, so finding milk-based foods is also a daunting task. However, there are many pure vegetarian and vegan restaurants that serve non-Jain vegetarian foods too.The popular foods here include Gujarati dishes like Dhokla, Khandvi, Gathiya and Kadhi. You can try the simple and subtle Rotlo, a flatbread made using millets, topped with jaggery and ghee, often served alongside Sev Tameta nu Shaak (a tomato-based gravy with sev). One of the must-try dishes in Palitana is the flavourful and wholesome Dal Dhokli, a lentil soup with flour dumplings topped with spicy tadka, and another popular dish here is Khichdi.Palitana is renowned for its significance in Jainism. It is considered one of the most important pilgrimage sites for Jains and is home to the Shatrunjaya Hills, which feature over 800 Jain temples. Here, the Shatrunjaya Hill temples are a major attraction, with devotees often climbing more than 3,500 steps to reach the top. The temples are made of marble and are noted for their exquisite architecture and intricate carvings. Founded in the 11th century, Palitana has evolved into a vital center for Jainism, drawing pilgrims and tourists worldwide to its sacred temples and rich cultural heritage. Palitana attracts both pilgrims and tourists for its spiritual ambiance and scenic beauty. The panoramic view from the top of Shatrunjaya Hill is a major draw. Palitana is well-connected by road and is approximately 50 kilometers southwest of Bhavnagar city. The nearest airport is Bhavnagar Airport, and the nearest major railway station is in Bhavnagar. The town is also known for its local art and craft, including marble carvings and traditional textiles. The primary economic activity in Palitana is tourism, driven by the influx of pilgrims and visitors to the temples. As per historians, Palitana was once the capital of the princely state of Palitana and the construction and maintenance of the temples were often supported by the royal families and wealthy merchants. Beyond its religious importance, Palitana is a cultural hub with a rich history. The city's temples and heritage sites attract historians, architects, and tourists interested in India's cultural and religious diversity. The city promotes eco-friendly practices, including waste management and water conservation, to preserve its natural and cultural heritage.Why should you avoid non-vegeterian food?Avoiding non-vegetarian food is often recommended for a healthy body due to several reasons. Firstly, excessive consumption of red and processed meats has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, certain cancers, and other chronic illnesses. Secondly, some meats are high in saturated fats and cholesterol, which can contribute to cardiovascular problems if consumed in large amounts. Additionally, there are concerns about antibiotics and hormones used in meat production, which may have health implications if consumed regularly.","Palitana town in Gujarat's Bhavnagar district has become the world's first city to completely ban non-vegetarian food, including the sale and consumption of meat and eggs.

Cody himself felt discouraged at one point in his career.In a recent interview with DDP Yoga, Cody Rhodes discussed his career and the impact of his sudden departure on WWE's approach to talent exits. He explained, ""Because of how I left, they don't let abrupt departures happen this way. So sorry. I literally put a post out before my release papers were done, like I'm done. That's it. Because I needed to put it in the air and put it in writing so that I was held to it. Go ahead, sue me if you want. ... I cannot function in this spot.""

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

This career shift brought her significant income and numerous gifts from her fans.Despite her family's concerns about the impact of her profession on her health, Pan continued to push herself to extreme limits. She rented a separate studio for her streaming sessions to ensure a more professional setup. However, her dedication came at a high cost. She often consumed up to 10 kg of food in a single session and spent up to 10 hours a day eating. These extreme eating habits led to multiple hospitalisations, including one due to gastric bleeding.At the time of her death, Pan weighed 300 kg. Although the official cause of death was not disclosed, reports indicate that her stomach was filled with undigested food, and the lower part was deformed. An autopsy confirmed the severe damage caused by her excessive eating.According to Creaders.net, her parents were concerned about her dangerous eating habits, urging her to stop.

I revere this office, but I love my country more.

It’s been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of

democracy

, which is at stake, I think it’s more important than any title.

I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people, but this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me. It’s about you, your families, your futures. It’s about we the people, and we can never forget that. And I never have.

I’ve made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine our fate of our nation and the world for decades to come.

America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide, do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy? In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. Can we do that? Does character in public life still matter?

I believe you know the answer to these questions because I know you, the American people, and I know this, we are a great nation because we are a good people.

When you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. And the truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us, and those of us who cherish that cause cherish it so much, a cause of American democracy itself must unite to protect it.

You know, in recent weeks it’s become clear to me that I needed to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America’s future all merited a second term, but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy, and that includes personal ambition.

So I’ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That’s the best way to unite our nation. I know there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life, but there’s also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices, and that time and place is now.

Over the next six months, I’ll be focused on doing my job as president. That means I’ll continue to lower costs for hard-working families, grow our economy. I’ll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose. I’ll keep calling out hate and extremism, make it clear there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence ever, period. I’m going to keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, our planet from climate crisis, is the existential threat.

And I will keep fighting for my for my cancer moonshot, so we can end cancer as we know it because we can do it. And I’m going to call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to our democracy, Supreme Court reform. You know, I will keep working to ensure America remains strong and secure and the leader of the free world.

I’m the first president in this century to report to the American people that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world. We’ll keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage. We’ll keep NATO stronger, and I’ll make it more powerful and more united than at any time in all of our history. I’ll keep doing the same for allies in the Pacific.

You know, when I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably surpass the United States. That’s not the case anymore. And I’m going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war.

We’re also working around the clock to bring home Americans being unjustly detained all around the world. You know, we’ve come so far since my inauguration. On that day, I told you as I stood in that winter — we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of possibilities, peril and possibilities. We were in the grip of the worst pandemic in the century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War, but we came together as Americans, and we got through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous and more secure.

Today, we have the strongest economy in the world, creating nearly 16 million new jobs — a record. Wages are up, inflation continues to come down, the racial wealth gap is the lowest it’s been in 20 years. We’re literally rebuilding our entire nation, urban, suburban, rural and tribal communities. Manufacturing has come back to America.

We’re leading the world again in chips and science and innovation. We finally beat Big Pharma after all these years, to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, and I’m going to keep fighting to make sure we lower the cost for everyone, not just seniors.

More people have health care today in America than ever before. And I signed one of the most significant laws helping millions of veterans and their families who were exposed to toxic materials. You know, the most significant climate law ever, ever in the history of the world, the first major gun safety law in 30 years. And today, violent crime rate is at a 50-year low.

We’re also securing our border. Border crossings are lower today than when the previous administration left office. And I’ve kept my commitment to appoint the first Black woman to the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I also kept my commitment to have an administration that looks like America and be a president for all Americans.

That’s what I’ve done. I ran for president four years ago because I believed, and still do, that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake and that’s still the case. America is an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant.

It’s the most powerful idea in the history of the world. That idea is that we hold these truths to be self-evident. We’re all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. We’ve never fully lived up to it, to this sacred idea, but we’ve never walked away from it either and I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.

In just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America’s future. I made my choice. I made my views known. I would like to thank our great Vice President Kamala Harris. She’s experienced, she’s tough, she’s capable. She’s been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.

When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin. It’s hanging on my wall here in the Oval Office, alongside the bust of Dr. King and Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez. When Ben Franklin was asked as he emerged from the convention going on, whether the founders have given America a monarchy or republic, Franklin’s response was “a republic, if you can keep it.” A republic if you can keep it. Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands.

My fellow Americans, it’s been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States, but here I am. That’s what’s so special about America.

We are a nation of promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. I’ve given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others. I’ve been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.

The great thing about America is here kings and dictators do not rule, the people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. We just have to keep faith, keep the faith and remember who we are. We’re the United States of America and there’s simply nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we do it together.

So let’s act together, preserve our democracy. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you.
