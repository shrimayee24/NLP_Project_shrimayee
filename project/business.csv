Operation Sindoor: Armed forces used Isro, Maxar imagery for precision planning

India authorizes kinetic counteraction after Pakistan violates truce hours later

Virat Kohli calls time on stellar 14-year test career, rejects farewell series

Air India cancels May 13 flights at 8 locations over safety concerns

'The sky remains ours': Air defence thwarts multi-national threats

India employed satellite intelligence from Isro and Maxar for precision planning during Operation Sindoor , showcasing its advanced military capabilities. After Pakistan breached a ceasefire with drone incursions, the Army was given full authority for kinetic counteraction , with officials vowing a fierce response. Over three days of hostilities, India’s multi-layered air defence system successfully repelled threats from Turkish drones, Chinese missiles, and possibly Pakistani aircraft. In a related precaution, Air India suspended flights to and from eight cities on May 13 citing safety concerns. Separately, Virat Kohli ended his illustrious 14-year Test career, having scored 9,230 runs and 30 centuries, while choosing to forgo a farewell match.Multiple sources have confirmed to TOI that the Indian armed forces utilized a wide range of space-based assets, including both domestic and international commercial sources, for Operation Sindoor. In addition to the 9–11 military satellites directly accessible to the armed forces, Isro facilitated access to ""repeatable"" data from a global commercial provider. A senior official said that while imagery from Indian satellites such as those in the Cartosat series was used for planning, satellite images were also procured from Maxar.

How AI is reshaping the doctor’s role,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-ai-is-reshaping-the-doctors-role/articleshow/121113979.cms,"Digestive Disease Week (DDW) held in San Diego, California

ASGE president Prateek Sharma and Microsoft leader Eric Horvitz discuss the impact of AI in healthcare

Both speakers underscored the importance of thoughtful, clinically grounded progress.

During Digestive Disease Week (DDW) held in San Diego, California and attended by more than 12,000 physicians, Dr. Prateek Sharma, President of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), and Dr. Eric Horvitz, Chief Scientific Officer at Microsoft, explored the rapidly evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare.Their conversation highlighted how AI is shaping patient care, improving efficiency in the physician's office, and redefining the role of the clinician. Both their fireside chat and individual lectures at the Presidential Plenary Session drew a large and engaged audience, which reflects the increased interest of integrating AI in healthcare.Dr. Sharma shared real-world examples of how AI is already transforming gastroenterology, from computer-aided detection (CADe) and diagnosis (CADx) in endoscopy to workflow optimisation and predictive modelling. He emphasised that the speciality is entering a point where AI reduces documentation burden, scheduling tools improve clinic flow, and how digital twins may one day enable real-time coaching during procedures.Dr. Horvitz, who leads Microsoft’s health and AI initiatives, discussed broader trends in the field, highlighting AI’s growing role in early disease detection and clinical decision support. He emphasised that AI systems should assist rather than replace human intelligence, serving as tools that support, not override, clinical judgment.He also touched on the need for explainable AI, stating that systems must be transparent and trustworthy if they are to be safely adopted into practice. Both speakers acknowledged that as AI capabilities accelerate, so do challenges facing their integration into clinical practice. Dr. Sharma emphasised the importance of clinical validation, integration across platforms, and policy reform. Dr. Horvitz echoed his concerns, along with the need for ethical guardrails that evolve alongside the technology. Dr. Sharma emphasized that tomorrow’s clinicians must be fluent in AI.“AI won’t replace you, but a gastroenterologist who knows how to use AI might”, he said. Both leaders agreed that training must include interdisciplinary learning to responsibly evaluate and deploy AI tools. Dr. Horvitz added that doctors must be involved from day one in AI development to ensure these tools are clinically relevant and usable for patient needs.As AI continues to advance, both speakers underscored the importance of thoughtful, clinically grounded progress. They encouraged healthcare professionals to stay informed, engage with new technologies, and contribute their perspectives to ensure AI evolves in ways that serve patients, providers, and the healthcare system. The conversation made clear that shaping the future of AI in medicine is not just a technical challenge, but a clinical responsibility.","During Digestive Disease Week (DDW) held in San Diego, California, Dr. Prateek Sharma and Dr. Eric Horvitz explored the rapidly evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare.

ISRO Deploys 10 Satellites To Assist Indian Military In Anti-Pakistan Mission; ‘At The Border…’

BENGALURU: Indian armed forces used a wide range of space assets - domestic and international commercial - to carry out Operation Sindoor , multiple sources have confirmed to TOI.“All of our strategic assets were put to use in different ways by our armed forces for Operation Sindoor. Our teams have been working round the clock and we are proud that Isro could help our forces in missions important for the country,” a senior official from Isro told TOI.Another official said that aside from domestic assets directly available with the armed forces (India has 9-11 military satellites ), Isro also facilitated “repeatable” data from a commercial global operator. “While data from our satellites from the Cartosat series and others were also used for planning, images were procured from Maxar ,” the senior official said.Maxar, the US-based satellite imagery provider supplies images to multiple governments and non-government entities across the world, while it remains unclear if Pakistan used its services for any of its operations during the current conflict. It is noteworthy that Pakistan also has access to the extensive military space assets of China.Indian armed forces also have access to other satellite data from Sentinel from Europe and another commercial operator from the US.“Indian satellites provide periodic data - with downloads of specific areas possible about once in 14 days. This data was made use of, while they used commercial data that’s available once a day too,” the official said.The Cartosat family of satellites, with high-resolution imagery and dual-use (image & video) capabilities, has been a key asset in India’s military intelligence toolkit. Launched for the first time in 2005, and progressively upgraded with satellites like the Cartosat-2C (for military), these satellites have provided crucial imagery for operations.Cartosat-2C, for example, delivers images with a resolution of 0.65 metres- an improvement over previous models- and has been vital in reconnaissance and surveillance operations. The high-resolution images from Cartosat can capture areas of interest (AOI) with incredible clarity, enabling commanders to make precise decisions based on intelligence from space. These were used for the 2016 Surgical Strike.Aside from Cartosat, the Risat family of satellites would have provided radar images useful to track movement, while the Gsat family of satellites were used for communications. “In all, a variety of Indian space assets have been useful and efforts are on to increase support to the armed forces in the years to come,” the official said. India’s NavIC combined with other global GPS systems also aided in operations.Indian Space Association (ISpA) director-general Lt Gen (retd) AK Bhat, said: “There would have been extensive use of space assets for imagery, sat-com (satellite communication) and PNT (positioning, navigation and timing). Space technology is an integral part of modern warfare.”Isro chairman V Narayanan, who said Sunday that 10 satellites are working round the clock for the armed forces, did not specifically comment on Operation Sindoor. He, however, told TOI: “We will be launching another important satellite on May 18, the EOS-09 or Risat-1B, which will add teeth to our armed forces.”“The satellite features an advanced C-band synthetic aperture radar system that delivers high-resolution Earth surface imagery in all weather conditions. This capability significantly enhances India’s surveillance capabilities,” he added. Unlike conventional optical satellites limited by cloud cover or darkness, Risat-1B’s radar technology penetrates these obstacles effectively.Earlier this month, Narayanan had said that India would launch 100-150 satellites in the next five years. Among these would be the 52 satellites part of the Space-Based Surveillance-3 (SBS-3) programme. Thirty-one of these will be developed by the private sector.","Indian armed forces used a wide range of space assets - domestic and international commercial - to carry out Operation Sindoor, multiple sources have confirmed to TOI.

India's AKASH Defence System Outfoxes Pakistan, Nips Drone Attacks In The Bud | 'My Baby Worked'

NEW DELHI: It took 15 years, a thousand scientists and combined effort of several defence labs situated across the country to develop the indigenous Akash missile defence system that successfully passed its first battlefield test along the western borders with Pakistan, said a proud Prahlada Ramarao , the then project director of the totally-indigenous missile shield programme of Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ).The Akash missile defence system proved its mettle when it successfully countered waves of drone and missile attacks from Pakistan during the night of May 8 and 9. Indian military officials have confirmed the effectiveness of India’s missile defence systems like Akash and S400 Triumf when IAF DGMO Air Marshal AK Bharti on Monday asserted that India’s defence systems “stood like a wall”, preventing enemy breaches.On Akash clearing its first ‘agni-pariksha’ and boosting India’s ‘Atmanirbharta’ in defence production, Ramarao, a Padma Shri recipient, told TOI, “My eyes welled up when my baby worked so well. It is the happiest day of my life. This is bigger than my Padma award.”Ramarao was handpicked by India’s ‘Missile Man’ Dr APJ Abdul Kalam as the youngest project director at the age of 35 to head the Akash programme in early 1990s. Kalam was then head of DRDO’s defence laboratory Defence Research Laboratory (DRL) in Hyderabad, before he became scientific adviser to the defence minister and subsequently the President of India. “A leader brings team spirit and inspires all to work towards a common goal. Kalam was a true leader in that sense. The country now requires 10 Abdul Kalams to grow and develop in various fields like the way the aerospace and defence sectors grew under him,” he said.Though Akash had undergone numerous test trials and later user trials by the Army and IAF, this was the first time the missile defence witnessed a real battlefield condition when Pakistan attacked India with missiles and drones. Both Indian Army and IAF have strategically deployed this missile system alongside the western border as Akash has the capability to neutralise aerial targets like fighter jets, cruise missiles and air-to-surface missiles and even drones. The real time multi-sensor data processing and threat evaluation enables simultaneous engagement of multiple targets from any direction.“We started work on this project in 1994 with an initial budget of Rs 300 crore. When you invent something, you fail several times. We also failed. But we learnt from our mistakes. Developing Rajendra, a complex multi-function electronically scanned phased array radar, was the biggest challenge. But we overcame that challenge after several hits and trials. Later, the project budget was raised to Rs 500 crore,” Ramarao said.“I guarantee you, nowhere in the world a missile defence system could have been invented in just Rs 500 crore. Our Akash is the cheapest but most effective missile shield. It can detect a hostile missile from a distance of 70km and kill it at a 30km range,” the DRDO veteran, now 78 years old, said.After its development in 2009, Akash has since undergone continuous evolution, resulting in the development of several variants, each with enhanced capabilities tailored to address specific operational requirements. These variants include initial Mark-I, upgraded Akash-1S with an indigenous seeker, high-accuracy Akash Prime designed for high-altitude and low-temperature operations, and advanced next-generation Akash-NG, which boasts significantly extended range and sophisticated features.As per an estimate, IAF has inducted a substantial number of Akash systems, with reports indicating the induction of 15 squadrons. Army operates four regiments of Aakash, with plans for further acquisitions to augment its air defence capabilities.Impressed with its efficient working, Armenia became the first country to ink a deal with India in 2022 to procure 15 Akash missile systems worth around Rs 6,000 crore. Last year, India had dispatched the first batch of the missile systems to the central Asian country to protect its borders.",The Akash missile defence system proved its mettle when it successfully countered waves of drone and missile attacks from Pakistan during the night of May 8 and 9.

NEW DELHI: India did not strike Kirana Hills in Pakistan’s Punjab province, a fortified complex with underground nuclear infrastructure and storage facilities, though some strategic messaging was certainly done by hitting the Nur Khan and Sargodha airbases.IAF fighter jets like Sukhoi-30MKIs, armed with BrahMos missiles and other weapons, did target nine airbases in Pakistan and PoK as well as some radar sites, but Kirana Hills wasn’t among the targets.On whether IAF hit Kirana Hills nuclear storage facility, director general of air operations Air Marshal A K Bharti first said in a lighter vein, “Thank you for telling us Kirana Hills houses nuclear installations. We did not know it.”IAF's categorical denial that it had bombed Kirana Hills in Pakistan's Punjab province effectively junks reports of "" radioactive leakage "" at the site due to a missile hit, which had found some traction in international circles.""We have not hit Kirana Hills, whatever is there. I did not brief about it in my briefing on Operation Sindoor yesterday,"" Air Marshal A K Bharti said at the tri-services presser on Monday.IAF, of course, did hit the Sargodha airbase , which is home to F-16 and JF-17 fighters, and just around 20km from Kirana Hills. The hills are around 75km away from Pakistan's crucial Khushab nuclear complex , which has four heavy water reactors to produce weapons-grade plutonium.Another big hit took place at the Nur Khan-Chaklala airbase at Rawalpindi, located close to the headquarters of Pakistan's Strategic Plans Division, which handles Pak's N-arsenal like the Indian Strategic Forces Command, and is barely 10km from Islamabad.

NEW DELHI: In a hard-hitting speech that clearly signalled a paradigm shift, PM Narendra Modi on Monday evening unveiled India's new doctrine towards Pakistan-backed terror , saying India would give a fitting reply to future attacks, which will not be constrained by geography or Islamabad's 'nuclear blackmail'. India would no longer differentiate between terror masterminds and their state sponsors, he added in no uncertain terms, doing away with a vital distinction that had been made till now.Addressing the nation, PM Modi made it clear that Operation Sindoor has only been suspended and India could resume military action if Pakistan does not abide by the commitments it made to get India to agree to the pause. ""In the coming days, we will measure every step of Pakistan on the criterion of what sort of attitude Pakistan will adopt ahead,"" the PM said.""Now, Operation Sindoor is India's policy against terrorism. It has carved out a new benchmark and has set up a new parameter and new normal,"" said the PM as he complimented the three services, security forces and paramilitary troops, the intelligence community and scientists for the precision strikes that damaged airbases in the heart of Pakistan.Modi made it clear that India would not relent on its stand of suspending the Indus Waters Treaty as part of its response to Pakistan-sponsored terror, ruled out any effort towards resumption of bilateral trade and asserted that India would not discuss anything other than terror and Pakistan's forcible occupation of parts of J&K.""India's stand is very clear... terror and talks cannot go together.. terror and trade cannot go together... water and blood cannot flow together,"" he asserted.",PM Narendra Modi unveils India's new doctrine towards Pakistan-backed terror.

NEW DELHI: Max Haot , chief executive officer of US-based company Vast , which is planning to launch the world’s first commercial space station , has evinced interest in using Indian rockets to transport crew members to its upcoming orbital laboratory.In an interview to, Haot, who recently visited India to attend an international space conference GLEX-2025, said, “There is a possibility of using Gaganyaan rockets as a transport service for our space station.”The space-habitation company, which has 750+ team members, is in the race to build a space station called Haven-2 that will be the successor to the International Space Station, which will be retired by 2031.The CEO said, “We want to work with all nations that are engaged in human spaceflight missions and see that India is about to be a leader in human spaceflight, which is really a great thing. We look forward to collaborating with India. We are open to many levels of collaboration. In space stations, we are open to technology exchange within the confines of the export control (regime).”Haot said, “We are very impressed with Isro and the Indian govt in achieving new capabilities, especially in regard to their upcoming Gaganyaan programme and Axiom-4 mission to the ISS that will make India the fourth country in the world to achieve the capability to send an astronaut to space.”Before Haven-2, the California-based company plans to launch Haven-1, a single-module space station, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in May 2026. The Haven-1 spacecraft has a 45-metre-cubed volume and is designed to support up to four crew members for missions of an average of two weeks in length.The first module of Haven-2, a much larger space station, is expected to be launched in 2028. Vast is planning to have the first operational module in 2028 and a fully built and functional space station in 2032. This will be designed for both govt and commercial use. It will have nine modules, 500 cubic metre of habitable volume and 86KW of total power. “We are seeking Nasa aid for the Haven-2 project, which will be managed by VAST. Once operational, this commercial space station will be open to all.”Isro is going to launch its crewed Gaganyaan mission in 2027 and if the mission is successful, more such crewed missions will be launched to space. Though India is making its own Bharatiya Antariksh Station, the collaboration with VAST for its commercial space station is likely to be beneficial to India as Isro will gain from the company’s expertise in setting up a space station.","The space-habitation company, which has 750+ team members, is in the race to build a space station called Haven-2 that will be the successor to the International Space Station.

NEW DELHI: An IndiGo Delhi-Amritsar flight on Monday evening returned to Delhi. A few other commercial flights also rerouted to avoid overflying that area.

Gold Card offers Permanent Residency, Not Citizenship

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given an update on President Donald Trump ’s Gold Card visa program. In a post on Twitter, Elon Musk wrote that the Gold Card Visa programme is quietly being tested to ensure the system works properly. ""We’re doing a quiet trial to make sure the system works properly. Once it is fully tested, it will be rolled out to the public with an announcement by the President,"" Elon Musk wrote in a post on Twitter in response to a tweet from MarioNawfal.A task force under Elon Musk is reportedly working on the new US immigration initiative offering ""Gold Card"" residency visas for $5 million each. Engineers from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are working with the State Department, Department of Homeland Security , and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to create a streamlined application system and website. According to a report in New York Times, the project is led by DOGE engineers Marko Elez and Edward Coristine, who are integrating federal vetting processes into the new system. Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia has joined, initially tasked with digitizing federal retirement systems. Elez resigned in February after controversy over a pseudonymous social media account linked to racist posts and eugenics-based immigration views, but he has since collaborated with federal agencies. Coristine, a 19-year-old known online as “Big Balls,” was previously fired from a 2022 internship at Path due to a data leak.The Gold Card program aims to fast-track residency for high-net-worth individuals, bypassing the lengthy traditional visa process with expedited background checks and interviews, targeting approval within two weeks. Unlike the EB-5 visa program, which offers green cards for $800,000-$1.05 million investments creating 10 U.S. jobs, the Gold Card focuses on revenue generation, replacing the EB-5’s $4 billion annual contribution.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed 1,000 Gold Cards have been sold, granting permanent residency to vetted individuals who pay $5 million and abide by U.S. laws. Musk is reportedly developing the software, with a launch expected soon. Former President Trump, who first proposed the Gold Cards in February as a pathway for “very high-level people,” recently showcased a mock-up featuring his image, the Statue of Liberty, and a bald eagle, projecting a debut within weeks.","Gold Card Visa programme is quietly being tested to ensure the system works properly.

Nintendo balances pricing against adoption goals

Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa expressed concerns that the company may need to increase the price of the upcoming Switch 2 console in the United States due to recently implemented tariffs on Chinese imports. The revelation came during Nintendo's May 8 earnings call, just weeks before the console's scheduled June 5 launch.""If the assumptions regarding tariffs change significantly, we would like to consider what price adjustments we should make and implement them after considering various aspects,"" Furukawa stated, addressing the potential impact on the already premium-priced $449.99 console.Nintendo's forecast assumes tariffs of 10% on products from Japan, Vietnam, and Cambodia, while Chinese imports face a staggering 145% tariff (as of now, US and China are renegotiating the trade terms, which possibly could lower the tariff). The company expects these trade measures to impact profits by ""tens of billions of yen.""Furukawa highlighted broader economic concerns beyond direct manufacturing costs. ""If prices of daily necessities like food increase (because of the tariffs), then people will have less money to spend on game consoles. If we were to adjust the price of the Switch 2, this could decrease demand.""While Nintendo primarily manufactures Switch hardware for North America in Vietnam, certain accessories and amiibo figures come from China, subjecting them to higher tariff rates.Despite these challenges, Nintendo forecasts selling 15 million Switch 2 units in its first year – matching the original Switch's debut performance – though analysts describe this projection as ""conservative"" given the tariff uncertainties.The company faces a delicate balancing act between covering increased costs and maintaining consumer interest. ""Nintendo will carefully consider various factors when changing any pricing, including its acceptability to customers,"" Furukawa emphasized.The Switch 2 isn't alone in facing potential price hikes. Microsoft has already increased Xbox Series S prices by $80 and Series X by $100, while some smaller gaming hardware companies have suspended U.S. shipments entirely due to prohibitive tariff costs.Pre-orders for the Switch 2 opened on April 24 following a brief delay related to tariff concerns, with Nintendo warning that release-day delivery cannot be guaranteed due to overwhelming d","Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa expressed concerns that the company may need to increase the price of the upcoming Switch 2 console.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Delhi Results 2025: 'LinkedIn Lessons' from Brand BJP's win and Brand AAP's loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-results-2025-linkedin-lessons-from-brand-bjps-win-and-brand-aaps-loss/articleshow/118066797.cms,"AAP: From Disruptor to Establishment to Decline



AAP was the ultimate political startup—the kind that raises Series A, B, and C funding at record speed, becomes a unicorn, and then implodes under its own weight. It was supposed to be the alternative to traditional politics, the fresh face in a crowded market, a party that rejected caste, religion, and dynasty-driven politics.

But somewhere along the way, it stopped being a startup and started behaving like an old-school corporate giant—bloated, bureaucratic, and overconfident.

1) From Lean & Agile to Bureaucratic & Slow

AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach—the political equivalent of a D2C brand shaking up a legacy market.

Over time, it became centralized and top-heavy, with decision-making confined to a handful of leaders. MLAs became inaccessible, the leadership became distant, and ground-level mobilization weakened. No succession planning. Kejriwal remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force.

remained the sole face of the party, and there was no second-rung leadership strong enough to carry the brand forward. It failed to expand beyond Delhi and Punjab—despite trying in Goa, Gujarat, and Karnataka. The inability to scale beyond its original USP made it a regional player rather than a national force. The result? Voters saw it as just another party, not the disruptor it once was.

2) A Reputation Built on Ethics, Lost to Scandals

AAP built its brand on fighting corruption—but its own leadership got embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of its time, the liquor policy scam.

Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and even Kejriwal himself faced corruption allegations, undoing years of anti-corruption positioning.

The Sheesh Mahal controversy—where Kejriwal’s residence was allegedly renovated with ₹45 crore of taxpayer money—completely shattered the “humble leader” narrative.

AAP’s response? Defensive, aggressive, and dismissive. Instead of damage control, it doubled down on denial—a classic PR blunder.

The perception shift was swift and brutal—from “anti-corruption warriors” to just another power-hungry political entity.

3) Ignoring the Middle-Class Voter That Built Its Base

AAP was originally the party of the middle class—frustrated taxpayers who wanted clean governance and economic relief.

Over time, its focus shifted to freebies and populist policies, leaving the middle class feeling ignored.

BJP stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters.

stepped in at the right time—offering tax reliefs, infrastructure promises, and a governance model that reassured middle-class voters. Kejriwal’s pre-election outreach to the middle class felt forced and last-minute—while BJP had already solidified its positioning.

Takeaway ? A business (or party) that forgets its core customer will eventually lose them.

4) Blaming External Factors Instead of Owning Failures

For 10 years, AAP blamed the Centre, the LG, and opposition parties for everything.

The “victim card” was effective in the early years but wore thin by 2025—voters expected governance, not excuses.

BJP flipped this weakness into an advantage, promising that with a BJP-led government, there would be no Centre-state conflicts, leading to “seamless governance.”

The narrative changed from “AAP vs. BJP” to “AAP vs. Results.” Lesson? Leaders who constantly shift blame instead of delivering solutions lose credibility.

5) Strategic Missteps and Lack of Political Alliances

AAP contested separately from Congress, which led to a split in the anti-BJP vote.

Rahul Gandhi’s direct attacks on Kejriwal made matters worse—AAP was getting hit from both sides.

Internal conflicts weakened the party further. Atishi and Saurabh Bharadwaj were seen as Kejriwal’s successors, but there was no clear transition strategy.

BJP: A Masterclass in Strategic Adaptation

BJP’s 2025 win in Delhi was not a Modi-centric sweep but a well-calibrated organizational comeback. After a lackluster 2024 Lok Sabha performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader.

performance (by their standards), the party realized it had become too dependent on a single leader. Unlike AAP, BJP adapted, restructured, and executed flawlessly.

1) Moving Beyond Modi Dependency

BJP understood that Delhi’s electorate needed a more localized approach.

Instead of making the election about Modi, it focused on governance, urban issues, and direct voter engagement.

No CM face? It didn’t matter. The party projected collective leadership instead of relying on one individual.

By decentralizing its campaign, BJP looked more stable and future-ready.

2) Adopting AAP’s Own Strategies Against It

BJP neutralized AAP’s welfare advantage—promising free electricity, continued subsidies, and additional financial support for women.

Middle-class tax reliefs were announced just before the elections, ensuring they won over voters that AAP had neglected.

The manifesto focused on real urban issues—pollution control, traffic congestion, and infrastructure—exactly what AAP had failed to address convincingly.

Lesson? The best way to beat a competitor is to adopt their strengths while exposing their weaknesses.

3) Letting Congress Do The Attacking



BJP didn’t need to attack AAP aggressively—Rahul Gandhi and Congress did that for them.

By letting AAP and Congress fight it out, BJP consolidated its voter base while the opposition split.

AAP’s credibility suffered more because the attacks came from within the anti-BJP camp.

A strategic win, without unnecessary effort.

4) A Disciplined, Focused, and Well-Executed Campaign

BJP stayed on message, focusing on corruption, governance, and economic stability.

The campaign was structured and well-planned, unlike AAP’s which seemed reactive and disorganized.

The promise to investigate AAP’s corruption cases resonated with voters, reinforcing BJP’s stance on accountability.

In business terms? BJP had a clear marketing strategy, strong brand positioning, and flawless execution.

5) Final Takeaways

Adaptability is key. BJP recalibrated after its 2024 Lok Sabha setbacks, while AAP remained stagnant.

Brand trust is fragile. AAP built its image on honesty but lost credibility due to scandals and mismanagement.

Execution matters more than rhetoric. BJP delivered a disciplined, well-structured campaign.

Leadership succession planning is critical. AAP failed to build second-line leadership, while BJP showcased organizational depth.

Voters reward governance, not excuses. After a decade in power, AAP’s blame game no longer worked.

Politics, like business, rewards those who adapt, execute, and deliver.

Ah, another election, another flood of LinkedIn wisdom posts—where every poll result is a ""case study,"" every political leader is a ""CEO,"" and every campaign is an ""MBA-level lesson in leadership."" Some call it democracy, but on LinkedIn, it’s all about business jargon and corporate analogies.So, let’s break this down the LinkedIn way.BJP, on the other hand, had a structured, disciplined campaign with clear messaging and no internal rifts. In politics and business, a divided team rarely wins.","AAP started with hyperlocal engagement, grassroots activism, and direct voter outreach.

Ten years of incumbency

Liquor scam, Sheesh Mahal dent Kejriwal's 'imandaar' image

No tie-up, Congress did strategic campaigning

Flood of freebies but no next-level of development

BJP focuses on Kejriwal, Hindutva takes back seat

BJP's latent vote

Rahul roasted Kejriwal as payback for Haryana

MCD with AAP: No excuses

Steady exodus of AAP leaders

AAP goes negative

The BJP on Saturday pulled off a major political upset by unseating the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) from Delhi after over 10 years. As per the latest Election Commission data, the BJP may win around 48 seats and the Kejriwal-led party may secure around 22 seats in the 70-seat Assembly.BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a fierce contest from the New Delhi seat by a margin of 4,089 votes. Verma, 47, bagged 30,088 votes, while Kejriwal and Congress' Sandeep Dikshit got 25,999 votes and 4,568 votes.Kejriwal conceded his defeat and hoped that the BJP will fulfill all its promises.""We accept the mandate of the people with great humility. I congratulate the BJP for this victory and I hope they will fulfil all the promises for which people have voted for them,"" Kejriwal said in a video address posted on X.In the evening as the results were decalred, PM Modi kicked off his victory speech with a powerful chant of ""Yamuna Maiya ki Jai"". PM Modi declared that the people of Delhi were experiencing both relief and joy -- relief from the ""disaster"" (AAP-da governance) and joy in embracing a new era under BJP rule. ""I had written a letter to every Delhi resident, urging them to give the BJP a chance to serve in the 21st century...Today, I bow my head in gratitude to every family in Delhi for trusting us. You have given us love with an open heart, and I assure you that we will return it manifold through rapid development,"" PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also attacked the AAP over allegations of corruption against its leaders, saying that all links of such charges will be probed and those who ""looted"" money will have to return it.With the BJP set to regain control of Delhi after 27 years, what went wrong for the Aam Aadmi Party?After governing Delhi for a decade, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) faced significant anti-incumbency.While AAP achieved impressive results in health and education during its first two terms, and kept voters happy with power and water subsidies, unfulfilled promises, such as improved air quality, became major poll issues.The AAP's assertion that the BJP government at the Centre was creating roadblocks in its functioning began to be increasingly seen by voters as excuses, especially after ten years in power.The BJP's ""double engine"" promise, suggesting seamless governance between the central and state levels, appealed to voters against the backdrop of AAP's constant conflicts with the Centre. Furthermore, internal disarray within the AAP, with senior leaders facing jail time, added to the challenges of incumbency .The image of Arvind Kejriwal as an anti-corruption crusader suffered a setback due to several factors, most notably the controversy surrounding the now-scrapped liquor policy.The BJP accused the AAP government of turning Delhi into a ""city of drunkards"" with the new policy, and receiving crores in kickbacks from those who opened the vends.Probes by central agencies led to the arrest of top AAP leaders, including Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia, and Sanjay Singh. These arrests forced Sisodia to step down as deputy chief minister and kept the AAP in ""firefighting mode"", distracting from fulfilling its 2020 poll promises.Additionally, the ""Sheesh Mahal"" controversy, referring to the renovated residence of the chief minister, further dented Kejriwal's image. The BJP further highlighted a Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report that indicated the renovation cost had increased from an initial estimate of Rs 7.91 crore to Rs 33.66 crore by completion.AAP has been synonymous with Arvind Kejriwal since its inception. Kejriwal, initially seen as an agent of change with his untucked shirt and no-nonsense demeanor, resonated with the common person.However, the anti-corruption image of Kejriwal and his party suffered irreparable damage, specially after the AAP leader's arrest in March 2024 on corruption allegations and his subsequent resignation as CM.While he was later granted bail, the leadership transition to Atishi and the circumstances surrounding Kejriwal's arrest damaged the party's image and cohesion.The absence of an alliance with the Congress party and the Congress's strategic campaigning likely contributed to the AAP's loss.In previous elections, the AAP had significantly reduced the Congress's presence in the Delhi assembly.Attempts to convince Congress workers to collaborate with AAP volunteers reportedly led to an ""existential crisis"" among them.The Congress decided to campaign aggressively against the AAP, sensing ""anger building up against the AAP"". Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the AAP in the final days of the Delhi campaign.The Congress further claimed the AAP did not want an alliance, with Kejriwal announcing all 70 candidates early on.The rise of AAP in Delhi has been congruous with the decline of the Congress. In 2013, AAP won 28 seats with a 29.49% vote share, while the Congress tally decreased to 8 seats from 43 in 2008. In 2015, Congress suffered a 15% decline in its vote share, while the AAP saw its support base rise by around 15%.While AAP's welfare schemes, such as free electricity and bus travel for women, initially garnered support, a lack of focus on infrastructure development and maintenance became a significant issue.The poor condition of roads and sewers across Delhi angered voters.Overflowing drains, potholed roads, and irregular garbage collection contributed to the party's unpopularity.The AAP's control over the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) meant it could not deflect blame for these issues onto the BJP. Voters in middle- and upper-middle-class areas were particularly affected by the deteriorating infrastructure.AAP's origins trace back to Anna Hazare’s anti-corruption movement, positioning the party as an alternative to the Congress in 2013.While AAP secured mandates in 2015 and 2020, their repeated promises and ""freebies"" seem to have lost their appeal.The promise of piped water connections for all in 2015 remains unfulfilled, as does the promise of full statehood for Delhi and the ""Rozgar Budget"" aimed at creating 20 lakh jobs.Kejriwal himself admitted that he had failed to fulfill three promises: cleaning the Yamuna, providing clean drinking water, and upgrading Delhi's roads. This acknowledgment gave the BJP an opportunity to attack the AAP, with Amit Shah mocking Kejriwal's promise to purify the Yamuna.The BJP's campaign strategy focused primarily on targeting Arvind Kejriwal and his government, rather than emphasising Hindutva, as it has often done during campainging in other state elections as well as previous Delhi polls.This approach likely resonated with a broader segment of the population, including those who may not have been inclined to support a religiously charged campaign. By focusing on issues such as corruption and governance, the BJP effectively undermined AAP's credibility and appealed to a wider range of voters.The BJP also focused on hyper-local issues such as air pollution, traffic, and public safety, and engaged with local Resident Welfare Associations. They also promoted central government schemes.The BJP also targeted specific demographics, including Purvanchalis and slum dwellers, and utilised an aggressive digital campaign with AI-enhanced content and memes targeting AAP.The BJP's consistent performance in the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi indicated a latent voter base that the party successfully mobilised this time around for the assembly elections.Despite AAP's strong performance in the assembly elections, the BJP had consistently swept Lok Sabha elections in the national capital, winning all seven seats.This pre-existing support base provided a foundation for the BJP's campaign and likely contributed to their victory.The BJP also strategically fielded Parvesh Verma, a strong Jat leader, in the New Delhi constituency, signaling their intention to win back the confidence of the Jat community, which had previously favoured AAP in Delhi elections.During the Delhi Assembly elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched strong criticisms against Arvind Kejriwal, which may have been payback for events in Haryana. Gandhi's attacks covered a range of issues, including alleged corruption, unfulfilled promises, and inaction on key issues.Like the BJP, Gandhi attacked Kejriwal over the alleged liquor scam and accused him of living in a ""Sheesh Mahal"" while engaging in corrupt practices.Gandhi said that Kejriwal made false promises, ""similar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", particularly regarding cleaning the Yamuna River. He also challenged Kejriwal to drink Delhi's tap water, implying it was still polluted despite promises to clean it.The Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) win in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in 2022 proved to be a double-edged sword, ultimately hurting the party instead of helping it. AAP had promised a cleaner city with world-class roads, but it fell short on both accounts. The MCD House was in limbo, and the Standing Committee, which controls all financial powers, was never formed. The AAP repeatedly accused the Centre of creating hurdles through the Lieutenant Governor and stalling projects.This time around, voters held the AAP accountable for the deteriorating civic infrastructure across Delhi.AAP's performance in the MCD was a letdown for the people of Delhi. The party failed to address critical issues such as clearing garbage, repairing roads, and cleaning clogged sewers. Erratic water supply and overflowing sewers that were never repaired because Rs 4,000 crore for the Delhi Jal Board was not released further hurt the party.Senior party leaders stated that the MCD functioning had collapsed under the AAP, and no work was being done, leading to frustration among councillors.The steady departure of senior leaders from AAP over time might have also weakened the party's organisational structure and public image.The exit of prominent figures like Prashant Bhushan, Yogendra Yadav, Mayank Gandhi, and Kumar Vishwas, who had dared to disagree with Arvind Kejriwal, and repeatedly accused Kejriwal of having an ""autocratic"" style of leadership.Resignation of senior leaders like Kailash Gahlot, who cited the party's focus on political agenda over fulfilling promises, along with internal challenges, signalled internal discord.The BJP had termed Gahlot's resignation a ""courageous move"".Negative campaigning by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) centered on issues like Yamuna River pollution, the Delhi Police, and the Election Commission (EC) may have affected public perception of the AAP government.In the lead up to the polls, Kejriwal accused the BJP-led Haryana government of poisoning the Yamuna River, which supplies drinking water to Delhi. He claimed that the Haryana government deliberately sent polluted waters to Delhi to create an artificial water scarcity and blame the AAP.The AAP also repeatedly levelled accusations of voter fraud and irregularities against the BJP as well as the EC.AAP alleged that the Election Commission and Delhi Police were shielding BJP workers and accused them of ""hooliganism"". Kejriwal wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner, expressing concern over the intimidation and harassment of AAP volunteers by BJP workers. The EC responded that no written complaints could be traced in most cases but assured that all registered complaints are investigated.Kejriwal further criticised the Election Commission for allegedly refusing to make Form 17C public, a document detailing the number of votes polled at each booth. AAP then launched a website, transparentelections.in, claiming to upload Form 17C data for all constituencies to present the data in an accessible format.The EC dismissed Kejriwal's claims regarding Form 17C, stating that copies had already been provided to polling agents at each booth after voting, as per Rule 49S of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.","BJP's Parvesh Verma emerged as a giant-slayer with his victory against AAP supremo and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.

Citing this incident, the DHS said her student visa should be revoked though her visa is not scheduled to expire until 2027.Saxena's graduation ceremony in which she was conferred with the title 'Dr' was called the ultimate revenge because Kristo Noem, too, received an honorary degree from Dakota itself, but there were no cheers for her, unlike Dr Saxena. Instead, she faced protests when she accepted the degree on stage in South Dakota.Saxena and her attorney Jim Leach sued Kristi Noem and won a temporary restraining order until Saxena's graduation.Her attorney argued in court that she did not commit a deportable offence. They also said that Priya declared the misdemeanor charge before applying for her next visa. Her next hearing is tomorrow.Kristi Noem was conferred with an honorary doctorate in public service by Dakota State University which is Noem' alma mater. Noem studied political science at this university. A vote was held to decide whether Noem should be given an honorary doctorate. The student senate and the general faculty voted against it claiming that it would be a highly politicized action that would antagonize international students as Noem's DHS has been cracking down on international students.But the university spokesperson said the decision was taken in favor as Noem is still the Governor of South Dakota and she has supported the university all along.","28-year-old doctoral student from India Priya Saxena received two degrees from South Dakota School of Mines & Technology.

"Chaos at Newark and Atlanta airports, over 450 flights delayed, dozens cancelled",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chaos-at-newark-and-atlanta-airports-over-450-flights-delayed-dozens-cancelled/articleshow/121124670.cms,"



Travellers faced major disruption at two of America’s busiest airports on Monday, with more than 450 flights delayed and dozens cancelled due to ongoing air traffic control issues and staff shortages. Newark Liberty International and Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International were both plunged into fresh chaos, as federal authorities warned of continuing disruption in the days ahead.Atlanta’s airport, the nation’s busiest, recorded over 370 delays by Monday afternoon, according to FlightAware, following a Sunday ground stop caused by equipment outages and thunderstorms. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cautioned that another halt could not be ruled out. Most of the delays affected Delta Air Lines, which uses Atlanta as its main hub.Meanwhile, Newark Airport saw 82 cancellations and another 85 delays on Monday, compounding a weekend of mounting technical failures. A 45-minute ground stop on Sunday, triggered by an outage at an FAA air traffic control facility, set off the wave of disruptions. By Monday evening, delays were averaging more than 90 minutes, with some flights reportedly held up for nearly seven hours.The FAA blamed staffing shortages, revealing that only three air traffic controllers were scheduled during critical hours at a Philadelphia-based facility that now handles Newark’s flight operations.According to the New York Times, the number of certified controllers at times dropped to just one or two—far below the FAA’s target of 14. The staffing crisis has been exacerbated by trauma leave taken by controllers after a recent radar outage, forcing the agency to limit traffic into Newark to ensure safety.US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that traffic into Newark would be reduced for several weeks. Speaking at a press briefing, Duffy accused the Biden administration and former Secretary Pete Buttigieg of failing to address longstanding infrastructure vulnerabilities, particularly the controversial move last year to shift Newark’s air traffic operations from New York to Philadelphia. Duffy said that insufficient safeguards had been installed in the telecommunications lines, calling the system “error-prone. ”A software update installed Friday reportedly prevented a third radar failure over the weekend, but concerns remain. Duffy confirmed that while Sunday’s system stayed online, operations were halted for 45 minutes out of caution due to two previous outages. He called for a formal investigation into the FAA’s decisions and revealed a plan to overhaul the nation’s air traffic control infrastructure, including thousands of high-speed data connections and radar replacements. However, no budget details were disclosed.","More than 450 flights delayed and dozens cancelled due to air traffic control issues and staff shortages.

Whoever is paying the lowest price, that is the price we're going to get."" 30-Day compliance window: Pharmaceutical companies have 30 days to voluntarily reduce drug prices. Failure to comply may result in regulatory actions, including the implementation of the MFN pricing model.

Targeting middlemen: The order addresses the role of intermediaries like pharmacy benefit managers, whom Trump accuses of inflating drug costs. He emphasized the need to eliminate these ""middlemen"" to reduce prices.

Drug importation: The administration plans to facilitate the importation of safe, lower-cost prescription drugs from countries like Canada, aiming to increase competition and drive down prices.

'Bad deal for American patients and workers'





President Donald Trump has signed a sweeping executive order aimed at slashing prescription drug prices in the United States by up to 80%. The order introduces a ""most-favoured-nation"" (MFN) pricing model, ensuring that Americans pay no more for medications than the lowest price available in comparable developed countries.Trump said the move was necessary to end the long-standing practice of American consumers subsidising both foreign healthcare systems and drug companies’ profit margins. “Starting today, the United States will no longer subsidise the healthcare of foreign countries... and we’ll no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from Big Pharma,” he said.The White House executive order laid out the rationale starkly: with less than 5% of the global population, the United States funds nearly 75% of global pharmaceutical profits. The order directs officials to take “immediate steps to end global freeloading” and ensure that Americans are no longer forced to pay triple for the same medicines produced in the same factories abroad. Americans, Trump said, “deserve low-cost pharmaceuticals on the same terms as other developed nations. ”The order also calls for enabling direct-to-consumer drug sales at the most-favoured-nation price and directs federal officials to pressure foreign governments and drugmakers to stop suppressing drug prices below fair market value.“We are going to do the right thing,” Trump insisted.The pharmaceutical industry pushed back swiftly. Stephen J. Ubl, CEO of the powerful lobbying group PhRMA, called the plan a “bad deal” for American patients. “Importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for American patients and workers,” he said, warning it could result in fewer new treatments and job losses.“It really does seem the plan is to ask manufacturers to voluntarily lower their prices to some point, which is not known,” said Rachel Sachs, a health law professor at Washington University. If they don’t comply, further government action may take years to yield results.Trump’s plan revives a controversial idea first floated in his previous term, when a similar order tying U.S. drug prices to international benchmarks was blocked in court. While Republicans have historically been wary of government intervention in drug pricing, Trump appears determined to push forward. “For years, pharmaceutical and drug companies have said that research and development costs were ‘what they are’. .. And for no reason whatsoever, they had to be borne by America alone — not anymore they don’t,” he said.","President Donald Trump has signed a sweeping executive order aimed at slashing prescription drug prices in the United States by up to 80%.

The Pakistan army has never made any bones of its Islamic underpinnings, proudly bearing the motto ‘Iman, Taqwa, Jihad fiSabilillah’ (faith, piety, struggle in the name of God) as it goes about its business.So, it was hardly a surprise when Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG-ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif said at a press briefing on Sunday that Islam was not just integral to the faith of individual soldiers but was part of the army’s training. He was responding to a question whether the name of Pakistan army’s operation, ‘ Bunyanum Marsoos ’, and early morning attacks on Indian civilians and military establishments were guided by the path shown by Allah.His clear admission of Islamabad’s remorseless support for jihad literally eliminates any difference between the jihadis in uniform and those without, like Lashkare-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammed which have been waging a war against India for decades by infiltrating terrorists into Kashmir and elsewhere, targeting civilians and armed forces. “Islam is part of not only the belief of each one of us but part of our training.It is part of our faith, it is what drives us,” Lt Gen Sharif said.Elaborating on the army’s motto, he said, “We have an army chief who has a strong belief in it. The leadership and his belief and commitment translates into different operations.” On Pakistan army naming its operation ‘Bunyanum Marsoos’, he said those who fight for Allah are like a “steel wall”.Lt Gen Sharif was recently in the news for more than his professional duty.

5.7 magnitude earthquake strikes Tibet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/5-7-magnitude-earthquake-strikes-tibet/articleshow/121092396.cms,"Representative Image





A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Tibet in the early hours of Monday, according to National Center for Seismology (NCS). The tremor was recorded at a depth of just 10km.The NCS posted the seismic details on X, stating the quake occurred at 2:41am IST, with coordinates at latitude 29.02°N and longitude 87.48°E. Just days earlier, on May 8, the region experienced a smaller 3.7 magnitude quake at a similar depth.Experts warn that shallow earthquakes often have more severe effects, as energy is released closer to the surface, leading to stronger ground shaking and a higher potential for destruction.The Tibetan Plateau lies along a major fault line where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide, making the area highly prone to seismic activity.These tectonic shifts continue to shape the Himalayas.Speaking to *Al Jazeera*, geophysicist Marianne Karplus said that while earthquakes cannot be predicted, scientific research and investment in resilient infrastructure are essential to minimise risk and improve safety in vulnerable regions.","A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Tibet in the early hours of Monday.

LONDON: The UK government announced on Monday wide-ranging reforms to restrict legal immigration to Britain, which will have a severe impact on Indian citizens.Announcing his immigration white paper, UK PM Keir Starmer said Britain’s one-nation experiment in open borders was “over”, the UK “risked becoming an island of strangers” and the damage the explosion in immigration “has done to our country is incalculable”.The paper noted a surge in lower-skilled migration by non-EU nationals and a surge in international students studying at lower-ranked universities in recent years. It said the UK wants to reduce overseas recruitment in favour of training UK workers.Henceforth only people with degrees will be eligible for skilled worker visas, earlier it was an A -level equivalent; the graduate visa which allows students to work after they graduate will be reduced from 24 months to 18 months; the health and care worker visa, which allows foreign nationals to work in the care sector, is to be abolished. Foreign nationals will not be eligible for settlement or citizenship until they have lived in the UK 10 years, up from five years, and there will be tough new English language requirements on all visa routes.The Immigration Skills Charge, imposed on employers who sponsor skilled workers, will be increased by 32% and salary thresholds will be increased for all skilled worker visas wishing to bring dependants.Indians were granted last year the highest number of skilled and health and care worker visas, and the second highest number of study visas.Those already on skilled worker visas will not be impacted unless they switch to another route. However, the UK will only permit visa extensions and in-country switching for those already in the country on the health and care worker visa until 2028. The white paper blamed the route closure on exploitation and abuse of workers by care companies recruiting from overseas.“We have seen misuse and exploitation of student visas, where visas are used as an entry point for living and working in the UK without any intention to complete the course, and increasing numbers of asylum claims from students at the end of their course. In addition too many graduates allowed to stay in the UK following the successful completion of their studies are not moving into the graduate level roles for which the graduate visa route was created,” it said.The UK instead wants to attract more people on its high talent routes, such as the Global Talent visa and High Potential Individual route, the paper added.","UK PM Keir Starmer said Britain’s one-nation experiment in open borders was ‘over’ Only people with degrees will be eligible for skilled worker visas.

Indian students organisation in the UK relieved over retention of graduate route for post-study work,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/indian-students-organisation-in-the-uk-relieved-over-retention-of-graduate-route-for-post-study-work/articleshow/121117608.cms,"AI image for representation





The National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK ( NISAU ), an apex organisation in the UK representing students, alumni, and young professionals of Indian origin, has welcomed the UK government’s decision to retain the graduate route for international students in its white paper on immigration announced on Monday. The graduate route is open to international students in the UK who have completed a course of study in the country at the bachelor’s degree level or above. Students on the graduate route are currently allowed to work or look for work after their studies for a maximum period of two years, or three years for doctoral students. The immigration policy white paper proposes to reduce the graduate route to 18 months.“We deeply welcome the UK government’s decision to retain the graduate route — a critical element of the UK’s global education offer. While we are saddened by the six-month reduction, alternatives under consideration would have been significantly worse,” Sanam Arora, founder & chair, NISAU, said. She added that the most important task now is to ensure the implementation of changes is urgent, fair, clearly communicated, and student-first. “We are pleased to see recognition of our long-standing calls for better alignment between immigration and skills, and we strongly support the push for greater transparency and accountability in education agent practices, for which we have laid out very clear asks,” Arora said.NISAU has worked extensively over the past decade — and particularly intensively in the last year — with policymakers across all major political parties, including many now in government, to advocate for the continuation of the graduate route, a press release from the organisation said.“International students are a distinct, high-contribution, temporary category of migration. They fund their own education, power innovation in universities, sustain local economies, and build enduring bilateral ties between the UK and countries around the world,” the NISAU press release said.The organisation has expressed concern about the impact of the new rule on Indian students, the largest users of the graduate route. “For 70% of Indian students, a strong post-study work offer is the single most important factor in deciding where to study abroad. The ability to gain significant international work experience is critical. Our statement to the Migration Advisory Committee was duly noted in last year’s review of the graduate route,” the press release added.NISAU has also welcomed the UK government’s policy initiative towards stricter rules for education agents. “We recommend a sector-wide cap on agent commission to ensure that student interests are prioritised over volume incentives and mandatory publication by universities of agent appointment processes and the fees paid to each agent, after every intake,” the press release said.

Poll Should the Bank of England adopt a more proactive approach to monetary policy? Yes, absolutely No, they should be cautious





LONDON: The Bank of England is widely expected to look past near-term inflationary pressures in the British economy and opt to cut interest rates on Thursday as a result of the potential shock to growth emanating from the tariff policies of the Trump administration.Most economists believe it's a near-certainty that the nine-member monetary policy committee will sanction a quarter-point reduction in the bank's main interest rate, to 4.25%. The decision is to be announced at 12:02 p.m., two minutes later than usual as a result of the two-minute silence for Victory in Europe Day. There's some speculation that some members may opt for an even bigger half-point cut.Economists are going to be particularly interested in the bank's accompanying economic forecasts as they will be the first since US President Donald Trump made his tariff announcement in early April.Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10% baseline tariff applied to UK goods entering the United States, the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain.""With US trade policy presenting a new demand shock, there have been early signs that the MPC is willing to adopt a more proactive approach to loosening policy,"" said Edward Allenby, UK economist at Oxford Economics.The forecasts, particularly those regarding growth and inflation, will provide a steer as to whether a more proactive approach is likely. Since it started cutting interest rates in August 2024 from the 16-year high of 5.25%, the MPC has been consistent in lowering borrowing costs every three months.The imposition of US tariffs on British goods, and the potential for a wider global trade war, has the potential to weigh on growth as well as oil prices, which would consequently depress price pressures by lowering demand.Though UK inflation stands at 2.6% and could well hit double the bank's target rate of 2% in coming months as a result of a raft of price increases in April, such as domestic energy and water bills, economists think rate-setters will opt for a cut, given the anticipated slowdown.Unlike the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, which last month cut interest rates too, the US Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday as its policymakers wait to see how Trump's tariffs affect the US economy before making any moves.Inflation rates around the world are way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from the near zero rates during the coronavirus pandemic. Prices then began to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and later because of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed energy costs higher.As inflation rates have declined from multidecade highs, central banks, including the Fed, have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 and during the pandemic.","Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates on Thursday.
