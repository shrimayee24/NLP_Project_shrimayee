Indian startup commissions world's first commercial space surveillance sat; SCOT captures image of South America,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-startup-commissions-worlds-first-commercial-space-surveillance-sat-scot-captures-image-of-south-america/articleshow/118811058.cms,"SCOT capturing the first image of the city of Buenos Aires in South America glowing against the planet's curvature.

New Delhi: The world's first commercial space surveillance satellite of an Indian startup, capable of tracking objects as small as 5 cm orbiting the Earth, was commissioned on Saturday as it captured images over South America.“Space just ran out of hiding spots,” Bengaluru start-up Digantara said in a post on X as its satellite SCOT (Space Camera for Object Tracking) started operations. Digantara had launched SCOT on Jan 14 aboard Elon Musk-owned SpaceX's Transporter-12 rocket.In a statement, the company said the SCOT satellite achieved first light on Saturday and its inaugural image while passing over South America — a breathtaking view of Earth's limb, with the city of Buenos Aires glowing against the planet's curvature.On the satellite’s first show, Digantara CEO Anirudh Sharma posted on X, “A Picture of Possibility, Future of Space based SSA. When we started, doubt was our first companion. Was it even possible for us to achieve what we had set out to do? Space doesn’t reward hesitation. It demands precision, resilience, and belief especially when the odds seem impossible. And yet, here we are. The first raw image from SCOT-1 clicked above South America!”The CEO further said, “SCOT's first image is more than a technical milestone; it's a symbol of our team's resilience and unwavering commitment to safeguarding Earth's orbits for generations to come.”Soon after the SCOT satellite launch in January, PM Narendra Modi had then congratulated the startup and posted on X, “Kudos to Indian space startup @Digantarahq on the success of Mission SCOT. This is an important contribution of the growing Indian space industry towards enhancing space situational awareness .”The satellite is designed to track and monitor objects as small as 5 cm, with a high revisit rate for frequent and precise observations of orbital activity. As space becomes more and more congested, this advanced capability is essential for mitigating collision risks and promoting sustainable space operations by providing accurate and dependable data to satellite operators and regulatory bodies.Former Isro chairman S Somanath congratulated “Digantarahq for making a dream come true. Having our own Space based SSA capability demonstrated by SCOT-1”.SCOT has been deployed in a sun-synchronous orbit that allows it to track objects in low earth orbit with more efficiency than existing sensors, which are restricted by fields of view, weather conditions and geographic limitations.","Digantara launched SCOT (Space Camera for Object Tracking) on Jan 14 aboard SpaceX's Transporter-12 rocket.

"ITAT rules in Shah Rukh favour, quashes reassessment process",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/itat-rules-in-shah-rukh-favour-quashes-reassessment-process/articleshow/118810677.cms,"Shahrukh Khan

MUMBAI: Superstar Shah Rukh Khan secured a significant victory as the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) ruled in his favour, quashing reassessment proceedings and order initiated by the tax authorities for the 2011-12 financial year.Against an income of Rs 83.42 crore declared by the actor in his income-tax (I-T) return, the tax officer denied his claims for foreign tax credit (for taxes paid in the UK) and reassessed the income as Rs 84.17 crore. Such reassessment was done beyond four years from the end of the relevant assessment year (2012-13).The ITAT bench held that reassessment of the case by the income-tax department was not legally justified, marking a crucial win for the actor in his prolonged battle over foreign tax credit claims.The litigation related to taxation of Khan's remuneration for the movie 'RA One.' As per the agreement between the actor and Red Chillies Entertainments (a film production and distribution company founded by Khan), 70% of the film's shooting was to take place in the UK and therefore 70% of the income would accrue overseas (which would be subject to UK tax including withholding tax). The actor's remuneration, in this regard, was routed through Winford Production, a UK entity. Tax authorities contended that such an arrangement of payment, caused a revenue loss to India. The I-T officer denied the actor's claim for foreign tax credit, that was made in his original I-T return.An Indian resident taxpayer is subject to tax in India on his/her global income. In simple terms, foreign tax credit provisions contained in tax treaties, enable an Indian taxpayer to deduct tax paid in the foreign country from his India tax liability. This prevents double taxation of the same income.In a detailed order, the ITAT bench composed of Sandeep Singh Karhail and Girish Agrawal, ruled that the reassessment proceedings were invalid. The tribunal noted that the assessing officer had failed to demonstrate any fresh tangible material warranting a reassessment beyond the four-year statutory period. It further observed that the disputed issue had already been examined during the initial scrutiny assessment of the case.Citing multiple judicial precedents, the tribunal emphasised that reassessment under Section 147 can be done after the expiry of four years from the end of the relevant assessment year, only if certain conditions were met. For instance, if the income had escaped assessment due to taxpayer's failure to file an I-T return, or respond to a notice. Or, if the tax taxpayer had failed to fully and truly disclose all material facts during the original assessment. The tribunal found no evidence of such failure on Khan's part.The ITAT bench concluded that the re-assessment proceedings were bad in law on more than one count and were not in conformity with the provisions of Section 147, and quashed the same. Tax experts believe that the judgment strengthens the position of Indian taxpayers with overseas earnings, reaffirming that reassessments cannot be arbitrarily initiated without sufficient grounds.","The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) ruled in his favour, quashing reassessment proceedings and order initiated by the tax authorities.

His remark Friday that India has agreed to ""cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done"" drew criticism from opposition which accused Modi govt of acting under pressure from Trump.Govt sources recalled that, during the first Trump administration, discussions took place about a limited trade deal between the two nations. ""For various reasons, it did not produce an outcome. Since discussions have just begun, it would be premature to talk about its details,"" said a source, adding there's also a context for each dimension, that would reflect the interests of both sides.""It would be recalled that India has reduced its average applied tariffs significantly for key developed countries like Australia, UAE, Switzerland, Norway, etc, under the recently concluded mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreements.

Officials confirmed on Saturday that the agency is working closely with the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to dismantle these operations, PTI reported.The move comes after the recent arrest of Kannada actress Ranya Rao, who was caught carrying 14.2 kg of gold worth Rs 12.56 crore at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport . Two CBI teams have been dispatched to Mumbai and Bengaluru airports to collect further information.Ranya Rao, known for her roles in Kannada films like Maanikya and Pataki, was detained by the DRI upon her arrival from Dubai on March 3. Authorities allege that she was attempting to smuggle 17 gold bars, weighing 14.8 kg, into the country. She was produced before a special court for financial offences on March 4 and has been remanded in judicial custody until March 18. The court has permitted her to meet her lawyer for half an hour each day and has instructed officials to ensure she is provided with basic necessities.Following her arrest, an image of Ranya with swollen eyes and bruises circulated on social media, sparking speculation of possible assault during custody, as per news agency PTI. Karnataka State Commission for Women Chairperson Nagalakshmi Chaudhary addressed the concerns but stated that the commission could not investigate unless a formal complaint was filed. She condemned any potential mistreatment, adding that no one has the right to take the law into their own hands.The case has also brought renewed scrutiny to the misuse of airport protocol services. Reports suggest that certain privileges meant for high-ranking officials were exploited to facilitate gold smuggling. In response, the Karnataka government has decided to revise standard operating procedures, restricting protocol services strictly to officials themselves, rather than their family members or associates. Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Umashankar SR confirmed the decision, stating that security measures would no longer extend to relatives of senior bureaucrats.Meanwhile, sources indicate that a protocol staffer at Kempegowda International Airport was briefly detained by the DRI after Ranya’s arrest. However, he was later released after stating that he had been instructed to receive a senior officer’s daughter and was unaware of the smuggling attempt.In a voluntary statement to the DRI, Ranya admitted to possession of the gold, acknowledging that 17 gold bars were recovered from her.

India hints at tariff liberalisation



April 2 deadline

Ongoing talks

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump have agreed to advance negotiations on the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), ANI reported on Saturday citing sources. The development comes on the same day when foreign secretary Vikram Misri hinted that New Delhi might be considering liberalising tariffs.This mutually beneficial agreement, finalised in February 2025, aims to boost market access, reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and enhance supply chain integration.To achieve the goals of the agreement, both leaders have decided to appoint senior representatives to accelerate negotiations, enhance trade relations and foster economic cooperation, the sources revealed.The BTA is expected to impact various sectors, including goods and services. By increasing market access and reducing barriers, the agreement will facilitate smoother trade flows and create new opportunities for businesses on both sides.A day after Trump claimed that India had agreed to bring down tariffs, foreign secretary Vikram Misri refused to comment on the US president's remark. He, however, added that India in recent years had signed several trade pacts with partners based on tariff liberalisation.""There’s a lot of interest in statements coming out of the United States. I will not get into that at this point of time because these are ongoing discussions… But I would only point you towards the fact that we have in recent times entered into bilateral trade agreements which are based on tariff liberalisation with several partners,"" he said.""There are ongoing discussions with several other partners on these issues now. I think the ongoing discussions should be seen in that context. That is our general approach and it applies to any such engagement we have,” he added.Sources indicate that India is optimistic about resolving the tariff issue with the US in the coming weeks, ideally before the April 2 deadline.This was reflected in the MEA's response on the same, which said, ""Our objective through the BTA is to strengthen and deepen India-US two-way trade across the goods and services sector, increase market access, reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers, and deepen supply chain integration between the two countries.""India has already lowered its average applied tariffs for major developed nations, including Australia, UAE, Switzerland, and Norway, under recently concluded trade agreements.A delegation, led by commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal , had visited Washington from March 3 to 6, for discussions with the US counterpart on the trade agreement.

""Indian market for agriculture has to open up... How you do that and the scale by which you do that, may be, do quotas, may be do limits. You can be smarter when you have your most important trading partner on the other side of the table,"" he said, indicating that the US acknowledged that an open-ended liberalisation may not be feasible.While suggesting that India should ""step out of the model"" he repeatedly called for a bilateral deal , arguing that a pact ""with the largest consuming economy in the world"" would be beneficial.Speaking at the India Today Conclave, Lutnick sought a ""grand deal"": ""Let's bring India's tariff policy towards America down, and America will invite India to have really an extraordinary opportunity and relationship with us.""Responding to a question on the larger India-US ties amid too much emphasis on trade and tariffs during Trump's second term, he said: ""there are plenty of levers that govts can pull while doing business with each other...

We think that is something that needs to end.""He then went on to say that India was the 'I' in BRICS, the group that also includes Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa, where Beijing had proposed a common currency, something that Trump is unhappy with, seeing it as an attempt reduce importance of the dollar.

BJP hits back

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said that the party needs to filter out leaders and workers in Gujarat who are allegedly aligned with the BJP and gave warning of strict action with the possibility of removal from the party.Addressing party workers in Ahmedabad during his two-day visit to the state, he hinted at a major overhaul ahead of the 2027 assembly elections and assured a strong strategy to challenge the ruling BJP.Gandhi said, “There are two types of people in the Gujarat Congress leadership and among workers. Those who are honest with people, fight for them, respect them and have the ideology of the Congress in their heart. And the others who are cut off from the people, sit far away, do not respect them and half of whom are with the BJP.”He said that the party’s first task should be to differentiate between these two groups. “Until these groups are separated, the people of Gujarat will not believe in the party,” he asserted, adding that even strict action, including expelling certain individuals, might be necessary.Gandhi pointed out that Congress has been out of power in Gujarat for over 30 years and said regaining public trust should take priority over election victories. “The question is not about elections. Unless we fulfill our responsibilities, the people of Gujarat will not let us win,” he said, adding that once the party reconnects with the public, electoral success will follow.During his address, Gandhi also criticised the state of Gujarat’s industries, particularly the diamond, textile, and ceramic sectors, which he claimed were struggling. “Look at the farmers of Gujarat. They are screaming for a new vision. The vision of the last 20-25 years has failed, and Congress can provide this vision easily,” he said.Gandhi also acknowledged the historical role of Gujarat in shaping Congress and India’s freedom movement. He reminded party workers that Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel, two of the Congress’s most influential leaders, hailed from the state. “Without Gandhi, Congress would not have been able to get independence for the country,” he said.Gandhi noted internal challenges within the party, asserting that some Congress leaders were “chained” and needed to re-establish their connection with the people. He encouraged party members to engage with citizens and understand their concerns. “We are here to listen to you,” he told the gathering.He further stated that Congress could return to power in Gujarat with a small increase in vote share. “The opposition already holds 40 per cent of the vote in Gujarat. If we can increase our vote share by just 5 per cent, the entire political equation will change,” he explained, citing Telangana as an example where the party increased its vote share by 22 per cent.BJP spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla criticised Rahul Gandhi, calling him the ""BJP's biggest asset"" and mocking his remarks about Congress workers. “He has trolled himself and his party. He tried to show the mirror to himself. Such an honest reaction... Rahul Gandhi admits he is unable to win in Gujarat, unable to show the way,” Poonawalla said.Referring to Gandhi’s analogy comparing some Congress workers to racehorses forced to dance at weddings, Poonawalla questioned his choice of words. “Are your party workers animals? At least please call your party workers humans. You are calling them horses,” he said.Taking to social media platform X, Poonawalla further attacked Gandhi, calling his remarks ""bizarre"" and listing a series of questions. “Rahul Gandhi has once again proven he is the OG when it comes to bizarre comments... Mr Entitled Dynast, stop calling Congress workers ‘ghoda’—they are humans. Stop blaming others for your failures—first EVMs, now party workers, who next? The public?” he wrote. He also took a dig at Gandhi’s electoral record, saying, “If half of Congress is ‘gaddar,’ what are you for making Congress lose 90+ times?”BJP Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi also slammed Gandhi, stating, “From alleging his party, people, constitutional institutions, and media—he has now started blaming his own people. I’ll suggest he do self-introspection instead of blaming others.”On the first day of his visit, Gandhi had met with party leaders and district and block-level presidents to discuss strategies. His visit comes ahead of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) session, scheduled to be held in Ahmedabad on April 8-9, the first such session in the state in 64 years.In the 2022 Gujarat Assembly elections, Congress secured only 17 out of 182 seats, and its strength later dropped to 12 after five MLAs resigned. Gandhi admitted that the party had failed to meet Gujarat’s expectations over the past 30 years and promised corrective measures.He concluded his address with a mix of determination and humour, remarking on Gujarat’s hospitality. “Every time I come here, no matter how much I try to control my weight, you take me to restaurants and serve delicious snacks, and I end up gaining a kilo!” he joked, drawing laughter from the audience.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi says party needs to filter out 'BJP-influenced' workers. He warns of strict action with the possibility of removal from the party. BJP hits back at Gandhi, calling him the ""BJP's biggest asset"" and mocking his remarks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118804701,imgsize-1042296,width-400,resizemode-4/118804701.jpg"

We are not ideologically driven but focused on what is best for the country"". On talks for a trade deal with US, he said that India will come out strong as the trade relationship with the U.S. is largely complementary. ""We conducted a study of all Harmonized System (HS) code lines and found significant synergies,"" he said.Vaishnaw urged industry leaders to invest in development of 25-30 products. ""For example, in consumer products such as mobile manufacturing, companies are designing and manufacturing capital goods domestically. Can IT firms invest in foundational AI models or develop our own mobile operating system? If industry takes one step forward, the govt will take ten steps to support them,"" he said.He laid out the agenda across the five key layers of AI-chips, foundational models, applications, data center & hyperscaler layer, and talent. By the end of the year, the country will have three indigenous AI models, while a domestically developed GPU is expected within the next three to four years. India has also launched a 14,000-GPU common compute facility, exceeding its initial target of 10,000 and ensuring wider access to AI resources through a public-private partnership. Unlike other regions where computing power is concentrated among a few players, India aims for inclusivity. ""The future of AI must be democratised, and India is leading the way,"" he said.Vaishnaw said the country was seeing a reversal of brain drain. ""Professionals like Dr. Randhir Thakur (Tata Electronics MD & CEO) have returned to lead our semiconductor initiatives. The startup ecosystem has transformed-India is now among the top three startup nations. A decade ago, startups were a rarity. Today, entrepreneurs take risks, and we see innovation thriving,"" he said. On climate protection, he said the country has already secured 4,000 megawatts of green power, with 7,000 megawatts in the pipeline. ""We are on track to meet our sustainability goals,"" he said.On the railways, Vaishnaw said the govt has invested Rs 1.14 lakh cr annually. ""Ten years ago, India recorded 171 railway accidents per year; today, that number has dropped to 30. While this is progress, we continue to improve,"" he said. The railways are integrating technology for track inspections, scheduling maintenance more efficiently, and working with startups to develop innovative solutions. The fourth version of the Kavach automatic train protection system was approved and certified and is being rolled out.Vaishnaw said India's railways have undergone a major transformation over the past decade, with 45,000 km of tracks electrified-more than twice the progress made in the first 60 years of independence. He noted that 34,000 km of new tracks have been laid, exceeding Germany's entire network, and that India now produces 1,500 locomotives annually.","Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw spoke at the Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence.

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: An 82-year-old woman suffered a fall at Delhi's IGI Airport, allegedly after Air India failed to provide a pre-booked wheelchair, and is undergoing treatment in ICU at Command Hospital Air Force in Bengaluru.Raj Pasricha , wife of a decorated Lt-General, had arrived at Delhi airport to board a flight to Bengaluru on March 4, when she was forced to walk with support of a family member due to non-availability of a wheelchair, but collapsed near the Air India counter, her granddaughter Parul Kanwar shared in a post on X. She also alleged the airline staff refused to help her grandmother.The airline refuted the claims, and said the passenger arrived to board the flight much later than the recommended two hours prior to departure.

This, she said, is one of the reasons for lower participation of women in the workforce, not just in India but across the world.Reflecting on lower participation of women in workforce, Murmu said a mother's role is crucial to nation-building and, if she takes leave from work for the welfare of her children, it needs to be seen positively. Murmu was speaking at the inaugural session of a day-long conference on the theme ' Nari Shakti Se Viksit Bharat ' organised by women and child development ministry to mark 'Women's Day'.""We will have to ask ourselves this question that do we have no responsibility as a society toward the children who will form the future society,"" Murmu said.

Sources said govt’s moves aim at ensuring availability of pulses at affordable prices and send a positive signal to farmers as well.Govt had allowed the import of yellow peas at 0% duty in Dec 2023 to boost availability. This is used as a substitute for chana, and the prices are also much lower. The Centre had extended the free import multiple times amid prospects of lower chana output. In 2017, govt had imposed a 50% duty on import of yellow peas to encourage domestic production of chana.As per official data, the import of yellow peas was around 30 lakh tonnes out of the total import of 67 lakh tonnes of pulses in 2024. Despite being the biggest producer of pulses, India, to bridge the gap, depends on imports of about 15-18% to meet the annual pulses demand of around 290 lakh tonnes.The main reason behind free import of yellow peas is its price. While at present the landed cost of yellow peas is at around Rs 32-35 per kg, the retail price is around Rs 40 a kg. This is much cheaper compared to prices of all other pulses which are in the range of Rs 90-160 per kg.Govt continuing free import of yellow peas has stumped traders considering that mandi prices of chana in Maharashtra and Karnataka are less than the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,650 a quintal for the 2024-25 marketing season.In the case of masur, govt had reduced the basic import duty to zero in July 2021 and subsequently, the exemption from 10% agri-infrastructure cess was given in Feb 2022. Since then, this was extended multiple times and was valid till March 2024.Sources said masur would now attract basic customs duty (5%) and agriculture infrastructure and development cess (5%).","Govt had allowed the import of yellow peas at 0% duty in Dec 2023 to boost availability.

NEW DELHI: Nearly three decades ago, in a groundbreaking move that defied social norms and shattered gender barriers, Sulochana Devi, Kusuma Om Prakash, A Masthanamma, P Sridevi and Savitha Manjula took on roles traditionally reserved for men. As the first batch of women conductors in state-run buses, they paved the way for future generations, challenging societal stigma. On International Women’s Day, these trailblazers, along with 44 other female conductors and drivers, were honoured by ASRTU, the apex body of state transport undertakings under the ministry of road transport, for their inspiring contributions.Some of the first-generation women conductors and drivers TOI spoke with shared the challenges they faced when starting their jobs, including managing a diverse range of passengers and the lack of proper public facilities for women. While they mentioned that male drivers have never been an issue, they believe deploying more female drivers would be a positive step forward.There are only 300 drivers and around 19,000 women conductors working in state transport undertakings. While a majority of these drivers are in Delhi Transport Corporation and Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation, nearly 7,500 women conductors are employed with Andhra Pradesh and Telangana SRTCs.Giving away the awards, first woman IPS Kiran Bedi threw a challenge to state transport undertakings and women drivers and conductors to deploy only female staff in buses operated late at night in urban areas, considering that women feel unsafe to take buses after dark.Single parent Sulochana Devi, who works with Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), said, “Since I was a child, I was keen to learn driving; my brother taught me car driving. I had some family problems, and I needed to take care of my children. I joined KSRTC where I was trained to drive bus as well. I have been a driver-cum-conductor since 1999.” Her son works as a software engineer in a foreign farm in Bengaluru. Sulochana said, she faced several challenges initially, but could overcome them with her determination to stick to the job.Sitting with her, two other women achievers, Kusuma and Savitha, said they have been trained to deal with passengers and the introduction of CCTV cameras in buses has made the situation better. “We urge the state transport undertakings to give rest to women drivers and conductors during their periods,” they added.P Sridevi, who was among the first few women conductors to join ASRTU after her father, a bus driver, passed away during service, shared that the job was considered a social stigma , as many believed it was meant only for men. “We faced difficulties due to the lack of proper resting areas. My mother would wait at the gate if I was late. Managing a child was also a tough task, but thanks to my mother, I was able to manage. At times, we had to firmly tell male passengers to behave properly in public transport,” she said.Sridevi was accompanied by her family members when she received the reward. Her daughter, P Madhuri, who is aspiring for civil services, said, “My mother leaves home before sunrise and returns after sunset. It’s a tough job, and she has done all this only for us. I want her to take a rest now, but she enjoys her job.”The experience is no different for Sujata Bhujbal, the first woman driver with the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply & Transport Undertaking (BEST). “When I took up this job, many questioned it because they didn’t want women in this role. But I have proven them wrong. When I’m in uniform, I feel empowered, and people show me respect. Every SRTU must have a uniform,” she said. “Though my daughter, who is pursuing electrical engineering, wants me to retire once she completes her studies and gets a job, I won’t leave. BEST has given me so much,” she added.","Sulochana Devi, Kusuma Om Prakash, A Masthanamma, P Sridevi and Savitha Manjula took on roles traditionally reserved for men.

BJP slams Telangana government’s handling of crisis

NEW DELHI: Telangana minister for irrigation and civil supplies Uttam Kumar Reddy announced on Saturday that robotic technology is being used to speed up the rescue operations at the SLBC tunnel in Nagarkurnool district, where eight workers remain trapped.Calling the incident a ""national disaster,"" he assured that the state government is using the best global technology to address the challenges in the final stretch of the 14-kilometre tunnel.During his visit to the site, the minister reviewed the situation with officials from multiple national agencies, including state disaster management secretary Arvind Kumar and army commandant Parikshit Mehra. District collector Badavath Santosh, SP Vaibhav Gaikwad Raghunath,and senior officials from the NDRF, SDRF, Railways, and Singareni were also present.Reddy explained that rescue teams have managed to clear 13.95 kilometres of the tunnel, but the last 50 meters remain highly unstable due to oxygen depletion, water seepage, and metal debris from the collapsed Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM). To navigate these hazards, robots equipped with high-resolution cameras, infrared sensors, and robotic arms have been deployed for assessment and extraction.As per the minister, cadaver dogs from Kerala detected a strong odour at a specific location, suggesting the presence of three individuals. He assured that the government would fully support the families of the missing workers. Despite ongoing dewatering and desilting efforts, the final stretch remains a significant challenge, with global tunnel rescue experts being consulted to find a solution.The BJP criticised the Telangana government’s response, accusing it of negligence. BJP leader and Union minister G Kishan Reddy alleged that the state authorities failed to conduct proper safety inspections before the tunnel work began. ""This tragedy is a result of the state government's inefficiency. Why were safety measures ignored? Why was there no proper emergency plan?"" he questioned.BJP MLA Etala Rajender also hit out at the Congress-led Telangana government, stating that despite repeated warnings from experts, the administration did not act in time. ""This is a man-made disaster. The government should take responsibility,"" he said.Meanwhile, the opposition has demanded a judicial inquiry into the accident. ""Deploying robots now is fine, but this should have been done much earlier. The government wasted crucial time,"" said BJP spokesperson K Krishna Sagar Rao.As rescue efforts continue, Uttam Kumar Reddy reiterated that all necessary resources, including an additional Rs 4 crore for robotic systems, have been allocated to ensure the operation's success. He promised to return to the site in the next few days to assess the progress.",Telangana minister for irrigation and civil supplies Uttam Kumar Reddy announced on Saturday that robotic technology is being used to speed up the rescue operations.

NEW DELHI: India on Friday inked a $248 million contract with Russia’s state-owned Rosoboronexport (RoE) for procurement of 1,000 HP (horsepower) engines for its fleet of T-72 Tanks in “fully formed, completely knocked down and semi knocked down” conditions.“The deal also includes transfer of technology (ToT) from M/s RoE to M/s Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited (or the Heavy Vehicles Factory) at Avadi, Chennai, for integration and subsequent licensed production of engines to boost the `Make in India' initiative,” a defence ministry official said.“The Russian-origin T-72s are the mainstay of the Army tank fleet, which at present are fitted with a 780 HP engine. Equipping the fleet of T-72 Tanks with 1,000 HP engines will enhance the battlefield mobility and offensive capability of the Army,” he added.Along with a fleet of 2,400 T-72 tanks, the Army has so far inducted 1,300 T-90S `Bhishma’ tanks of the 1,657 being produced by the Heavy Vehicles Factory under licence from Russia.The Army force is now also inducting 118 indigenous Arjun Mark-1A tanks , with 14 major and 57 minor “upgrades” to enhance firepower, mobility, endurance and protection, ordered for Rs 7,523 crore in Sept 2021. These 118 `improved’ tanks will add to the first 124 Arjun tanks inducted well over a decade ago.Then, there are the 354 indigenous light tanks for high-altitude warfare to be inducted under Project Zorawar for around Rs 17,500 crore. The need for such tanks, each weighing less than 25 tonnes with a high power-to-weight ratio as well as superior firepower and protection, has been driven home by the continuing almost four-year-long military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh.","India inked a $248 million contract with Russia’s state-owned Rosoboronexport (RoE) for procurement of 1,000 HP (horsepower) engines for its fleet of T-72 Tanks.

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam on Friday claimed that the state unit of Congress is going through a severe monetary crunch leading to nonpayment of rent and electricity bill of the party office. Former state president of the grand-old-party, who joined Eknath Shinde months before the assembly elections said that the incompetence of the state and the national leadership of the party led to this situation.""The Mumbai Congress is just one step away from being shut down. The current ineffective and incompetent leaders of the Mumbai Congress are to blame for this situation. The office, which operates in the premises of the Maharashtra government's PWD department, has not paid rent for several years, resulting in an outstanding bill of 18 lakh rupees. The electricity bill has reached nearly 5 lakh rupees, and the electricity supply company eventually removed the meter and disconnected the power,"" Nirupam said.""This situation reflects the lack of leadership and capability among the leaders. For about 9 to 10 months, Mumbai Congress employees have not received their salaries. The party is in a silent mode with no events being organized, mainly because the leadership has completely failed,"" he added.Further, taking a jibe at Rahul Gandhi, Nirupam said that leaders seldom meet party workers in the state and make a video for YouTube and leave. He blamed the Congress' alliance with Thackeray’s party, Shiv Sena (UBT), for its decline.""Rahul Gandhi yesterday came to Mumbai not as a Congress leader but as a YouTuber to make a video in Dharavi. While the Mumbai Congress' condition is getting worse, their leaders are more busy making videos,"" Nirupam said""This is the result of effective leadership. In 2019, when the alliance between Shiv Sena and Congress was forming, I advised against it, warning that the Congress party would gradually weaken. Five to six years later, this prediction is coming true, with only three MLAs remaining, who rely heavily on Muslim votes. Currently, in Mumbai, Uddhav Thackeray's party is the first choice because they appear strong. The Mumbai Congress and the Congress party have become subordinate to Uddhav Thackeray's party, and the incompetence of Delhi's leaders is evident. They have accepted that they cannot stand on their own and rely on allies, leading to the party's downfall. In the coming days, the Congress party in Maharashtra will face a similar fate as it did in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar,"" he added.This comes days after Harshwardhan Sapkal became the new chief of the party's Maharashtra unit. Sapkal takes over from Nana Patole, who had resigned following the party's poor performance in the Maharashtra Assembly elections.In the 2024 assembly elections, the Mahayuti coalition of BJP, Shiv Sena and NCP won 235 of the 288 seats, with BJP securing 132 alone. Shinde's Sena secured 57 seats and Ajit Pawar's NCP got 41 seats.On the other hand, it was a disappointing show by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) which was hoping for a grand comeback. Uddhav's Sena got 20 seats, Congress 16 and Sharad Pawar's NCP secured 10 seats.","Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam on Friday claimed that the state unit of Congress is going through a severe monetary crunch leading to nonpayment of rent and electricity bill.

NEW DELHI: Is Nitish Kumar losing his cool way too often these days? On Friday, the Bihar chief minister lost his temper inside the state legislative council and surprised many with his choice of words to refer to former chief ministers Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi .""Jab iske husband doob gaye to apni wife ko bana diya (When her husband began to sink, he installed his wife (in the CM's post))"", Nitish said referring to Lalu Prasad's move to make Rabri Devi the chief minister after he was forced to resign from the post following an arrest warrant in a fodder scam case.It all started after RJD MLC Urmila Thakur, citing the example of her Begusarai district said ""in many villages, girls are deprived of education as reaching the nearest school requires them to walk four to five kilometers"".This irked Nitish Kumar, who lashed out at the opposition and said: ""Do you people even know what we have done for girls' education? Village girls hardly went to schools in Bihar until we came to power.""When Urmila Thakur objected, Nitish stepped up his attack.""The education system had collapsed during the RJD government. It was I who revived it,” the CM said. ""What did the RJD government do for women? Where did women study earlier? They barely had access to primary education,” he added.Then the Bihar chief minister went on to launch a frontal attack on Rabri Devi and mocked at the way she was made the chief minister by her husband Lalu Prasad.Also read: 'Mahila has no problems': Bihar CM Nitish Kumar's remark sparks spat with opposition women lawmakers - watch Leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav strongly objected to the language used by Nitish Kumar for his parents and once again raised questions over Bihar chief minister's health. ""I pity the condition of chief minister and I don't want to comment any more on this aspect. His falling health has proved that he is not fit to run Bihar anymore,"" Tejashwi said.""There should be some decency in language when you are holding the post of chief minister. Rabri Devi became the chief minister before him and that too of undivided Bihar and he is referring to her as ""re"" and ""tu"","" he added.""Nitish Kumar should know that Rabri Deviji was the first woman chief minister of the state. She is elder to Nitish both in age and also in relationship,"" the RJD leader said.And while targeting Nitish over his health suits Tejashwi's politics, senior political analyst N K Choudhary has a different take on the changed behaviour of Bihar chief minister.""Nitish Kumar is perhaps reacting to the challenges he faces to his undisputed leadership for the first time. Nitish enjoyed unbridled power for over 15 years but realises that political dynamics in the state has changed,"" says Choudhary, who is also a former professor of Patna University.Also read: 'I made your father': Bihar CM Nitish to Tejashwi Yadav amid big showdown in assembly ""No one could question Nitish Kumar and there was no challenge to his authority all these years. This perhaps led to some arrogance. Also, the social system that gave him power increased his ego over the years. So, now when questions are raised over his governance or his development claims are criticised, Nitish reacts very strongly,"" says N K Choudhary.""Even Lalu Prasad, during his prime enjoyed a lot of power and would often say ""I am the king,"" he adds.Whatever be the reason, those who have followed Nitish Kumar and seen his politics over the years, do feel that there is a perceptible change in his behaviour. In fact, one of the biggest factors that differentiated Nitish from his arch rival Lalu Prasad, who is also a mass leader, was the grace with which the JD(U) chief handled his critics and the opposition.With elections scheduled later this year in Bihar, Tejashwi has stepped up his attack on Nitish. However, the strong reactions from Bihar chief minister seem to suggest that he is not ready to take such political attacks lying low. May be Nitish feels offence is the best defence. More so, as his dominance in Bihar politics is perhaps on the decline. However, what Nitish needs to realise that his frequent outbursts will give the opposition an opportunity to raise more questions on his health - a narrative that not just suits RJD's Tejashwi, but also the BJP. The saffron party, which is now the senior partner in the Bihar alliance, would be keen to lead the alliance once the Nitish era comes to an end.(With inputs from agencies)","Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar lost his temper inside the state legislative council.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin is on a warpath with the BJP-led NDA government. The two major issues at the center of the now almost everyday war of words are delimitation and the Hindi ""imposition"" row concerning the National Education Policy (NEP).On Friday, Stalin wrote to his counterparts of seven states, including Bengal's Mamata Banerjee, Punjab's Bhagwant Mann, and also BJP-ruled Odisha's Mohan Chandra Majhi to fight the delimitation exercise. Stalin also wrote to the chief of political parties if these states proposing the inaugural joint action committee meeting in Chennai on March 22, urging the leaders to join forces to chart a ""collective course forward.""Stalin has claimed that the representation of the South in the Lok Sabha would be reduced due to delimitation exercise.Despite Amit Shah's assurance that the southern states will not lose a single Lok Sabha seat, the chief ministers of two Congress-ruled states — Karnataka's Siddaramaiah and Telangana's Revanth Reddy — have united with Stalin to attack the BJP-led Centre on delimitation.At a recent all-party meeting, Stalin also secured the support of the main opposition AIADMK, Congress, and Left parties, as well as actor-politician Vijay's TVK and Kamal Haasan's Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM). The meeting was boycotted by the BJP, Tamil nationalist Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK), and former union minister GK Vasan's Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar).During the meeting, Stalin also asserted that the 1971 population data should be the basis for delimitation of Lok Sabha seats for 30 years from 2026, and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make an assurance in Parliament.In what maybe seen as a win for Stalin, BJP’s ally, PMK, also voiced concerns on Thursday that Tamil Nadu's representation in Parliament could decline due to delimitation.With assembly elections due next year, Stalin has intensified his attacks on the NDA government on another front with three-language policy . The Tamil Nadu government has strongly opposed implementing the New Education Policy (NEP) 2020, raising concerns over the ""three-language formula"" and alleging that the Centre is attempting to ""impose"" Hindi.However, while Congress leaders in the South have supported Stalin's stance, the party's central leadership has so far maintained a neutral stance on the issue.With Bihar assembly elections just months away, followed by Uttar Pradesh, Congress seems to have adopted a carefully balanced approach. This is likely because Congress still holds influence in the South. Among the three Congress-ruled states, two — Telangana and Karnataka — are in the South. The party's 99-seat Lok Sabha win was largely powered by southern states, where it won a total of 42 seats:To keep the party's stance in balance, Manickam Tagore, Congress MP from Tamil Nadu’s Virudhunagar and party whip in Lok Sabha, recently stated: ""Our party respects all languages, and we are against all kinds of language imposition. Hindi can be learned by choice but not by imposition.""Other key INDIA bloc allies, including Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Jammu and Kashmir's National Conference leader Omar Abdullah, have remained silent on both issues.On NEP, all state governments except Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and West Bengal have adopted and implemented the policy. However, Bengal CM and INDIA bloc ally Mamata Banerjee has also refrained from making any public statements in support of Stalin.Instead, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief has shifted focus and is now trying to corner the NDA government and the Election Commission, alleging voter list manipulation.The Parliament session after Lok Sabha elections saw the INDIA bloc divided with their individual agendas (Congress on the Adani issue, Samajwadi Party on Sambhal violence) as they tried to corner the NDA government. With TMC already announcing that it will raise the issue of voter ID number duplication during the upcoming session starting from March 10, it will be interesting to see if the INDIA bloc finds a common ground to carry out coordinated attack this time.","Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin is on a warpath with the BJP-led NDA government.

In the annals of political faux pas, Mitt Romney’s infamous ‘47%’ comment or Hillary Clinton branding Trump supporters as ‘deplorables’ stand out as classic cases of plain speaking gone horribly wrong—instances where opponents easily cast them as out-of-touch elitists. But perhaps no self-goal in Indian politics has been as monumental as Mani Shankar Aiyar ’s 2014 ‘chaiwala’ jibe at then-Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi. Modi may well have ascended to the Prime Ministership without that gaffe, but Aiyar ’s ill-timed comment ensured that the crumbling edifice of UPA-2 was buried six feet under. Narendra Modi, who had always sought to play on the theme of the entitled versus the commoner, lapped up the ‘chaiwala’ moniker like a fish to water.If that was not enough, Aiyar repeated history just a few years later, once again helping PM Modi secure his home turf. In 2017, as the BJP grappled with anti-incumbency, the Patel agitation, and Dalit uprisings in Gujarat, Aiyar’s ‘neech aadmi’ remark gifted Modi the perfect opportunity to reframe the election as a question of Gujarati(pride). The result? A last-minute consolidation of core voters, allowing the BJP to scrape through in a tough contest. A red-faced Congress suspended Aiyar, but the damage was already done.While that may have been the formal break between Aiyar and the Congress, the former Union minister has continued to embarrass the party. The latest episode? A backhanded compliment to Rajiv Gandhi, where Aiyar, in his characteristic bluntness, detailed how the former Prime Minister had flunked at Cambridge and later at Imperial College, London. It provided fresh ammunition to the BJP, all too keen to puncture the image of the technocratic PM, who has been widely hailed for bringing the first wave of the IT revolution to the country.Furious Congress leaders wasted no time in denouncing Aiyar—Maharashtra’s Nana Patole labelled him “mentally unstable,” Harish Khare called him “frustrated,” and former Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot dismissed him as(crazy).Whether Aiyar is crazy or simply unfiltered remains up for debate. What is clear, however, is his unwavering desire for validation from the Gandhis. Despite the controversy, he expressed hope that Rahul Gandhi would take notice of him. Ironically, it was Rahul himself who, during an AICC session in 2014, praised Aiyar’s role in solidifying the Panchayati Raj system. In 2004, Rahul had apparently told Aiyar's wife that he would always listen to the ex-bureaucrat because his father trusted Mani. Yet, Aiyar himself admits that in all these years, he has had only one meaningful conversation with Rahul and just two with Priyanka. He claims he has long been ready to mentor Rahul, but that the Congress leader seems averse to taking his advice, likely due to his age. He even goes on to say that Rahul Gandhi probably despises him, even though Aiyar maintains that his relationship with the Gandhis remains intact!Aiyar’s connection with the Gandhis, however, is indisputable. He was one of Rajiv Gandhi’s closest aides, serving as his joint secretary, and has extensively chronicled his legacy. Even last year, he published a book arguing that Rajiv Gandhi remains one of India’s most misunderstood Prime Ministers. Aiyar’s loyalty to Rajiv appears unquestionable, making it unlikely that he intended to damage his legacy. Instead, his real problem is that he is a relic of a bygone political era—one in which intellectual acerbity was tolerated, if not encouraged.In today’s-obsessed generation with decreasing attention spans, where media organisations are fishing for viral outrage, Aiyar's verbose, long-winded explanations of his ideals leave too many loose ends. Even though thehas shifted with the BJP being in power for over a decade, Aiyar has held onto his pacifist ideals and commitment to secularism. Thus, the man who embarked on aduring the Ayodhya movement and accused then-PM Narasimha Rao of parroting the BJP's line on Hinduism faced brutal public pushback when he said Modi must be removed to improve Indo-Pak relations. Similarly, his attempt to explain the reason behind theattack also led to controversy. Perhaps a simple condemnation without qualifiers would have been easier, but then, it wouldn’t have been Mani Aiyar.In today’s world, political correctness reigns supreme. Aiyar’s brand of public discourse—witty yet sharp, opinionated yet unfiltered—has long since expired. His comments, mocking Hansraj College with his elitepedigree, his dyed-in-the-wool liberal stance regarding what he believed were ‘alleged’ Chinese incursions, his opposition to nuclear weapons, and his resistance to liberalisation, are now seen as political liabilities rather than intellectual contributions.Even as sports minister, he went against the tide, opposing India’s hosting of the Commonwealth Games, describing them as a colossal waste of money.It is a testament to his political gumption that he managed to win three elections from Mayiladuthurai (1991, 1999, and 2004). It is no mean feat for a person born in Lahore, schooled at Doon and Welham’s, later attending St. Stephen’s and Cambridge, to also find acceptance with the electorate despite his anglicised persona. In 2010, he made it to the Rajya Sabha, but his relationship with the Congress leadership gradually soured, leaving him out in the cold.In another political system—perhaps in the US—Aiyar, a self-proclaimed 'secular fundamentalist,' might have found space as India’s equivalent of Bernie Sanders or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a left-liberal figure leading an ideological movement. But in India, where political pragmatism trumps ideological rigidity, he stuck out like a sore thumb. A more strategic Congress leadership could have harnessed Aiyar’s intellect and commitment to rural empowerment to craft an alternative policy vision, challenging the ruling government’s policies. As an IFS officer, he served in Pakistan and was the first consul general of India in Karachi. His insights could have been leveraged to shape opposition's foreign policy towards India's neighbourhood. Instead, he has been relegated to a running meme—a political grenade who periodically explodes, causing maximum collateral damage to his own party.In many ways, his trajectory mirrors that of Sam Pitroda , another Congress veteran known for his verbal misadventures. But unlike Pitroda, who still enjoys official roles in the Congress, Aiyar remains an outsider, waiting for his next moment of unfiltered candour.Perhaps the world is simply not ready for another Mani Shankar Aiyar. Or perhaps, just maybe, Aiyar has outlived his political relevance—a man out of sync with his time, clinging to an era that no longer exists. In some ways, the Congress, despite all its grandstanding about being a melting pot of ideas, failed to accommodate Aiyar. Another man who does not shy away from speaking his own mind—a diplomat-turned-politician who runs his own successful campaign—Shashi Tharoor, may end up sharing Aiyar’s fate if he does not play by the rules.","Mani Shankar Aiyar’s 2014 ‘chaiwala’ jibe at then-Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi helped the BJP secure his home turf. The latest episode? A backhanded compliment to Rajiv Gandhi, where he detailed how the former Prime Minister had flunked at Cambridge.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118791513,imgsize-39554,width-400,resizemode-4/118791513.jpg"

"Mammoth 650-tonne tunnel boring machine completes epic 1,600-km journey from Tamil Nadu to Kolkata; here's why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/mammoth-650-tonne-tunnel-boring-machine-completes-epic-1600-km-journey-from-tamil-nadu-to-kolkata-heres-why/articleshow/118774275.cms,"A 90m-long, 650-tonne tunnel boring machine (TBM), mostly made in India, reached Kolkata after a 1,653 km journey from Tamil Nadu.

Despite uncertainty over land for Kidderpore station, tunneling for the Purple Line from Kidderpore to Park Street will proceed.

The TBM will be unloaded at St Thomas' Boys School and will first excavate a 1.7 km stretch from St Thomas' to Victoria, followed by 950 m from Victoria to Park Street.

Unlike previous Metro projects, these TBMs were primarily built and assembled in Tamil Nadu, with only four key parts imported.

Awarded a Rs 2,447 crore contract, L&T has been actively working since Sept 2023, with tunnel ring segment production underway at Sarkarpool to support the TBMs.

KOLKATA: A giant tunnel boring machine (TBM), 90m long and weighing around 650 tonnes, almost entirely made in India, has reached Kolkata after a 1,653 km journey from Tamil Nadu's Alinjivakkam . Despite the ongoing impasse over land for construction of the Purple Line's Kidderpore station, Metro has decided to proceed with the underground tunnelling from Kidderpore to Park Street.TBMs are earth pressure balance (EPB) machines used to excavate tunnels through hard rock, wet or dry soil, or sand. The superior technology allows burrowing and building tunnels with precast segment rings. The Purple Line's TBMs will first build 1.7 km from St Thomas' to Victoria. The second drive will span 950 m from Victoria to Park Street. The northern end between Park Street and Esplanade will be built using the cut-and-cover method.Around 5 km of the 14 km Metro corridor, which will connect Joka and Esplanade via 12 stations, is underground. But there is uncertainty whether Kidderpore station will be built at all, as land at Kolkata Police's Bodyguard Lines is not available yet.Meanwhile, contractors L&T, awarded the Rs 2,447 crore underground package by Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL), the railways undertaking tasked with building most of the city's Metro lines, has started work in full swing. L&T commenced work on this package in Sept 2023, with Victoria station. In July 2024, it started casting tunnel ring segments in its Sarkarpool (near Mahestala) unit. The unit is likely to produce around 3,000 segments to feed the TBMs to build the section's twin tunnels, which will have an inner diameter of 5.8 m.The TBM, dismantled and loaded onto 17 trailers, will be directly unloaded in the shaft built inside St Thomas' Boys School and launched from there.On Feb 20, Metro GM P Uday Kumar Reddy and RVNL's chief project manager Vipin Kumar travelled to Alinjivakkam to witness the second TBM's factory acceptance test (FAT). Unlike the East-West Metro project, where all three pairs of TBMs were manufactured in Germany, shipped to Delhi, and ferried by road to Kolkata, most of the two new TBMs were built and assembled in Tamil Nadu.""Except for four parts - the cutter head (which digs through soil), manlock (which holds workers to access the inside of tunnel borer), material lock (which removes the excavated material hydraulically), and propulsion system (comprising hydraulic cylinders which supply power) - most of the two TBMs were indigenously built,"" an official said. ""Though S-1410A and S-1411A are from German manufacturer Herrenknecht AG's TN unit, they were not totally built/assembled outside India,"" he said.Key highlights:","A 90m-long, 650-tonne tunnel boring machine (TBM), mostly made in India, reached Kolkata after a 1,653 km journey from Tamil Nadu.

NEW DELHI: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) flagged Sandalwood actress Ranya Rao’s travel history, citing entries in her passport and available data. Investigators revealed that she had visited Dubai 27 times and traveled to over 45 countries despite having no professional job or multiple film assignments that would justify such frequent international trips.On Wednesday, the DRI confirmed the seizure of gold bars worth Rs 15 crore from Ranya Rao at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport.

International Women's Day 2025: Now more women say yes to freezing their eggs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/international-womens-day-2025-now-more-women-say-yes-to-freezing-their-eggs/articleshow/118793581.cms,"HYDERABAD: Right after the Covid lockdown was lifted, Prianjali (name changed) was asked to take over her family business – a chain of mid-sized eateries across Hyderabad. But before she could sit in the CEO's chair, the then 36-year-old made a quick trip to a fertility clinic.She needed to freeze her eggs.""I knew once the storm (of work) hits me, I'd have no time for anything else. So, I had to ensure I was prepared to have a child a few years later. Work was important but so was fulfilling my desire to become a mother,"" said the spinster entrepreneur who eventually took the plunge into motherhood with an embryo transfer in Dec last year at the age of 41.This trend of "" social freezing "", where women – majority of them single – are choosing to freeze their eggs, either to delay their plans for marriage or parenthood, to build their careers through their 30s, has seen an uptick in recent times, say embryologists and fertility experts from Hyderabad.Much like other metros, fertility experts in this city too are witnessing four to five women walk through their doors every month to sign up for oocyte (egg) freezing. Until about two years ago, the average was one a month.""While most of the women are still in the 33 to 35 years age bracket, there are some as young as 27-28 who are opting for this procedure,"" said Dr Kiran Sekhar, medical director and chief fertility consultant at Kiran Infertility Centre. And unlike earlier, when oocyte freezing was largely driven by medical reasons – women suffering from serious illnesses like cancer – it is now more about them choosing when to become a mother.Cost, EMIThe cost of the roughly month-long procedure ranges between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 3 lakh. It then attracts an annual fee of Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000 for every year that the egg is stored in the egg bank.But that is a price a lot of women are willing to pay for a ‘healthy' future, said fertility specialist Dr Meera Jindal. She also attributed the growing frequency to more awareness about the procedure. ""The social awkwardness around freezing eggs is on the wane. So, more women are comfortable opting for it,"" Dr Jindal said, reiterating how the technology has allowed women to extend their professional lives, allowing them to reach higher career goals.""Also, the EMI facility available at the clinic made it easier for me,"" said marketing professional, Suhasini (name changed) who availed a 10-month, zero interest, loan through a third-party that has a tie-up with the clinic.However, there are only a handful of platforms offering this facility at present, with the majority only offering loans for IVF treatment. ""Though some large corporations and tech firms also foot the bill for single women opting to freeze their eggs, the number is miniscule.

Carlos Sainz Senior on son’s wedding plans

Carlos Sainz senior has opened up on his son and Williams driver’s wedding plans. Carlos Sainz Jr has been dating Scottish model Rebecca Donaldson for two years and the two prefer not to share too much about their love life on social media, though she is seen cheering for him at the races and being spotted out and about in town.On being quizzed about Carlos’ marriage plans, the legendary race driver said in an interview with the Hola magazine, “Well, I think getting married and starting a family is a very difficult decision for everyone. You have to think about it. You have to choose who will be the mother of your children. You have to meditate on it.”He mentioned walking his two daughters down the aisle and how it was now his wife Reyes Vázquez de Castro’s turn to take over for their son. “I’ve already been with my two daughters, this time it’s not my turn, it would be Reyes’ turn (laughs)... Seriously, I trust that when he decides, it will be because it’s clear,” he added.Sainz Jr may not have decided on marriage but is clear on how he wants to lead his life as a father and husband. It is to be noted, Carlos Sainz Jr is a former legendary racer who spent more time at the races than at home.Hinting at what he wishes from his own partner, he said, “That my mother was able to take care of the education of three children is complicated, having raised three children in a house with a somewhat peculiar situation. So, yes, having that example at home is obviously my reference and what I would like to aspire to.”Sainz Jr comes from a happy family of five including two sisters who are now married. His parents have been married for more than 32 years. Carlos is close to the women in his life and had wished them on Women’s Day a few years back. Sharing a happy family picture, he had written on Instagram, “On a day like today I want to thank my mother and my sisters for always being by my side, helping and supporting me every step of the way.”Also Read: WATCH: Formula 1 champions Carlos Sainz and his father look their stylish best in new ad campaign The Williams driver is gearing up for the upcoming F1 season, starting with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on March 16.

Two people arrested for allegedly masterminding a massive ticket fraud scheme for Eras Tour

Two individuals, Tyrone Rose and Shamara P. Simmons, have been arrested for allegedly stealing and reselling over $600,000 worth of tickets for Taylor Swift's 'Eras Tour'. The incident occurred during Swift's tour, which was a massive global success. Prosecutors claim they exploited a loophole in an offshore ticketing vendor's system, rerouting over 900 digital tickets and selling them at inflated prices.Taylor Swift's record-breaking Eras Tour has enthralled fans globally, making news for its record-breaking success and colossal global reach. But a recent cyber attack has put a shadow on the tour's success, with two people arrested for allegedly masterminding a massive ticket fraud scheme.Tyrone Rose and Shamara P. Simmons have been arrested by authorities for purportedly swiping and selling over $600,000 worth of tickets for Swift's extremely popular concerts. Prosecutors, according to Fox News, said that the duo took advantage of a flaw in an offshore ticketing vendor's system and were able to divert over 900 digital tickets. The stolen tickets were resold at extremely inflated rates to unwitting consumers.The scam operation is thought to have occurred between June 2022 and July 2023, a period when demand for tickets to Eras Tour was at an all-time high. The authorities are still investigating the scope of the scam, as ticket fraud is a rising issue in the live events industry, particularly for such high-profile events as Swift's tour.Former StubHub employee Rose allegedly redirected 350 orders, sending stolen tickets to Simmons and a deceased accomplice in Queens, New York, and reselling them through secondary markets.Both Tyrone Rose and Shamara P. Simmons are reportedly facing several serious charges, such as grand larceny, computer tampering, and conspiracy, as reported by Fox News. They will face up to a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison if convicted. The case underscores the growing complexity of cyber-related offenses in the ticketing business and the difficulties in curbing such scam schemes.In addition to targeting Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, prosecutors charge that Rose and Simmons employed the same technique to take advantage of weaknesses in the ticketing system for other big-time events. They are accused of hijacking and reselling tickets to big concerts, including shows featuring Adele and Ed Sheeran, The Washington Post reported. Their scam is said to have extended outside the music arena to major sports events, including NBA games and the U.S. Open tennis tournament.Also Read: “Her silence says a lot”: Travis Kelce beau Taylor Swift's silence in the ongoing Blake Lively-Justin Baldoni messy lawsuit sparks debate The magnitude of their supposed scheme highlights the increasing problem of ticketing fraud, wherein cyber scammers exploit digital systems to obtain high-demand tickets and resell them at outrageous prices.

Taylor Swift was reportedly ""gripped by fear"" over Travis Kelce's decision of returning for the 2025 NFL season

Following the loss of the Kansas City Chiefs during Super Bowl 59 to the Eagles, there was uncertainty around Travis Kelce 's future in the NFL. He confessed during the New Heights podcast that he took time considering whether to continue playing or hang up his boots. He, however, finally decided to remain in the league. Radar Online, however, indicated that Taylor Swift was exceedingly worried about this decision, citing its importance not only for his career but for their relationship.After the Kansas City Chiefs' gut-wrenching defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 59, rumors circulated regarding Travis Kelce's NFL future. Fans and pundits alike wondered if the superstar tight end would come back for another year or retire after the crushing loss.Kelce himself cleared the air about the uncertainty on the New Heights podcast, saying that he himself did not know what he would do next in the moments after the game. He revealed that he had taken time to consider his options before making a conclusive decision regarding his football future.Finally, Kelce decided to keep playing, deciding to play on rather than retire from the sport. His long-time girlfriend, global singing sensation Taylor Swift, though, was highly invested in the consequences of his choice, and by a Radar Online report, worried about the heaviness of it all. According to the report, Swift feared what route Kelce would end up going down, stressing the importance the decision held for him professionally as well as personally, for himself and for the couple's future.A source close to Swift told the outlet, ""Taylor is really gripped by fear over which way he's going to jump because it has big ramifications for their relationship, but also, it is totally his call. Travis is totally adamant that Taylor would never pressure him into anything, insisting she’ll support whatever he decides – but let’s be real, it’s no secret she’s itching to settle down.”The report also indicated that both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift were keen on spending more quality time with each other, something that has not been easy given their hectic schedules. Since they started dating, their hectic schedules—Kelce's NFL commitments and Swift's global music career—have restricted their time together, making it hard to give their relationship the priority it deserves.Also Read: “Their fantasy bubble has been popped”: Taylor Swift is clearly happy for her beau Travis Kelce's retirement decision, but she had some reservations Furthermore, Radar Online asserted that Swift was worried about the possible public outcry if Kelce had decided to retire. Being one of the most powerful celebrities, she feared that others would hold her responsible for his decision, surmising that their relationship was behind him leaving the sport. This concern apparently contributed to the tension surrounding Kelce's decision, making the whole ordeal even more stressful for the couple.","Taylor Swift was reportedly ""gripped by fear"" over Travis Kelce's decision of returning for the 2025 NFL season.

Micah Parsons is advocating for a contract that accurately depicts his influence on the Cowboys, stating that his role goes beyond the position of just a linebacker. During an interview with USA Sports Today, he expressed frustration about being limited to a single label as a position, highlighting his versatility as both a pass-rusher and coverage player.
