"Maharashtra CM pick: Day after Mahayuti leaders' meet, Eknath Shinde goes to his village, talks on govt pushed back",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-cm-pick-day-after-the-mahayuti-leaders-meet-eknath-shinde-goes-to-his-village-talks-on-govt-pushed-back/articleshow/115825022.cms,"Eknath Shinde

Maha govt formation meet unlikely before Monday

A day after the Mahayuti leaders' meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi, caretaker CM Eknath Shinde left for his village Dare Tamb in Mahabaleshwar taluka in Satara district. Sources said the BJP is working on him to get him to accept the deputy CM's post.The swearing-in of the Maharashtra cabinet is unlikely until Dec 5 as the talks could only progress after partners agree on the return of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis as CM with nominees of Shiv Sena and NCP as the two deputies.The swearing-in was earlier expected to be held on Monday. However, the negotiations are unlikely to be wrapped up because of the preoccupation of Amit Shah, who has to balance the competing demands of Mahayuti partners with the DGPs' conference until Saturday. Sources now expect the oath-taking to be scheduled on Dec 5 at Azad Maidan both because of the tricky nature of Shah's assignment and the engagements of PM Modi, who is billed to be the star of the show.The deliberations at Shah's residence late Thursday night saw outgoing CM Eknath Shinde signing up on the logic that BJP, with 132 MLAs of its own and having lined up another five, was the natural claimant for the CM's office, sources familiar with the negotiations said.While Shinde did not spell out whether he would serve as deputy CM along with NCP's Ajit Pawar , BJP sources remained hopeful of persuading him to be part of a Fadnavis team, with NCP sharing the optimism. There also appears to be an understanding among the partners over the Speaker, an important figure when it comes to coalitions, being a BJP nominee. Significantly, Shinde dropped hints about Sena's interest in having his nominee as chairperson of the legislative council and BJP, according to sources, did not look averse to acceding to the desire as part of compensation to Shinde.The appreciation of Shinde's contribution in Mahayuti's grand return and the ""sacrifice"" he is likely to make for the sake of the unity of the alliance will not extend to BJP acquiescing in an insistence for the home department. Fadnavis would get to retain home, while Ajit Pawar is seen as a shoe-in for sixth term as finance minister of the richest and the most industrialised state.Both Shiv Sena and NCP have argued that the power-sharing arrangement cannot be worked out merely on the basis of mathematics because doing so would, for all practical purposes, mean installing a BJP regime, given that the party's own numbers are within striking distance of the magic mark of 145. However, unlike a scheme based on numbers where berths are assigned on the basis of who has got how many MLAs, crafting an arrangement expected to be based on abstract considerations like ""fairness"" and ""objectivity"" can be difficult, with each partner having notions which may not gel.In Delhi, Shinde, speaking to the media on Thursday night, said the meeting with Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda, along with his colleagues from the Mahayuti-Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar-was cordial. ""The meeting was to discuss govt formation. Today was the first meeting; tomorrow, a second meeting will be held in Mumbai on CM and portfolio allocation. I have already announced Shiv Sena's support to Mahayuti CM candidate, so that deadlock was resolved,"" he said.When no Mahayuti meeting happened and news came that Shinde would be in the village for the next two days, his colleague Uday Samant told media that Shinde was running a fever the past couple of days and went to his village, to a healthier environment to recuperate.Asked if Shinde would accept dy CM's post, Samant said, ""We want Shinde Saheb to be in Maharashtra politics, and he should be in govt."" Sources said there is Shani Amavasya on Saturday and Sunday, additional reasons for no action happening.BJP sources said its elected MLAs have so far not been called to Mumbai to elect the party's legislative leader. ""This meeting is likely to be held on Monday. Thereafter, the legislative heads of the three parties will meet to decide on the CM, Dy CM posts and portfolio allocation,"" sources said.BJP sources said if Fadnavis, a former CM, could be dy CM, then Shinde too could take up the post, adding it would send out a clear message that it is not just BJP netas who have to compromise.",Maha govt formation meet unlikely before Monday. Caretaker CM Eknath Shinde left for his village Dare Tamb in Mahabaleshwar taluka in Satara district.

Sambhal survey report

: SC

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday directed the Sambhal district administration to maintain peace and harmony in the communally charged area and ordered the trial court , which had ordered a survey of Shahi Jama Masjid on the Hindu side's suit claiming it to be Harihar temple, not to proceed further till Allahabad high court heard the mosque management committee's plea. Five people had died in violence in the wake of the survey on Nov 24.Importantly, a bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar refused to accede to senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi's plea on behalf of the mosque committee to halt the survey of the mosque being carried out by an advocate commissioner, who was entrusted with the task on the Nov 19. However, it asked the trial court to put the survey report in sealed cover. It also faulted the mosque committee for bypassing HC to move SC directly.SC requested HC to give priority to the committee's appeal against the trial court order and take it up for hearing within three days of its filing. It clarified that it has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the matter.After the bench said it would keep the mosque committee's special leave petition challenging the Nov 19 order pending in Supreme Court while giving liberty to it to move high court for appropriate relief, Ahmadi said the advocate commissioner may file his survey report before the trial judge in the interregnum. ""He should be directed not to file his survey report,"" he pleaded.The CJI Khanna-led bench said, ""That is something different. We will not restrain him from filing the survey report. If the report is submitted by advocate commissioner, it will be kept in sealed cover and will not be opened by the trial court.""Ahmadi said the order of trial court could cause ""great mischief"" across the country, which was witnessing a new trend.""To my knowledge, there are at least 10 similar suits filed across India claiming rights over mosques. In many cases, the modus operandi is to appoint a surveyor on the first day of hearing. Thereafter a narrative is built,"" he added.""No further steps in the suit shall be taken by trial court without further orders from HC,"" the bench ordered.SC posted further hearing on Jan 6 after advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain, appearing for one of the plaintiffs, said trial court had fixed the hearing on Jan 8.Laying stress on maintenance of law and order as well as peace and harmony in the area, the bench sternly told additional solicitor general K M Natraj, who appeared for the Sambhal administration, ""We do not want any untoward incident to happen in the meanwhile. The district administration must ensure peace and harmony. We do not want to say anything more at this stage.""CJI Khanna told Natraj, ""Under Section 43 of the new mediation law, the district administration must form peace committees comprising members of all communities. You have to be absolutely and totally neutral.""

NEW DELHI: After back to back losses in Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge addressed the party’s ""below-expectation"" performance during the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Friday. He questioned the dependence on the national leaders and issues and called on the party workers to focus on local issues.""Till when will you fight state elections with the help of national leaders and national issues?"" he questioned during the opening remarks of the CWC meet while urging the party to focus on localised concerns and prepare detailed strategies tailored to each state. He also stressed that election preparations should begin at least a year in advance. ""Our teams should be present in the field well in advance. The first task should be to check the voter lists so that the votes of those in our favour remain in the list under all circumstances,"" he added.Further, addressing the Congress' performance in the elections this year, he celebrated the Congress’s resurgence in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections but admitted that the subsequent state assembly elections did not yield the expected results. ""The momentum was in our favour in the elections. But just the momentum being in our favour is not a guarantee of victory. We will have to learn to convert the atmosphere into results. What is the reason that we are not able to take advantage of this momentum?"" Kharge questioned, urging the party to introspect and identify its shortcomings.He pointed out that despite the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) forming governments in two of the four states that went to polls after Lok Sabha, the Congress’s own performance was disappointing. Reflecting on these results, Kharge emphasised the need for urgent corrective measures. ""These results are a message for us. We need to immediately learn from them and address our weaknesses at the organizational level,"" he said.The Congress president then went on to hint at the in-fighting and disunity that proved as a setback for them. ""The most important thing that I keep saying is that lack of unity and statements against each other harm us a lot. Unless we fight elections unitedly and stop making statements against each other, how will we be able to defeat our opponents politically?"" Kharge asked.""Therefore, it is important that we strictly follow discipline. We have to remain united under all circumstances. The party also has the weapon of discipline. But we do not want to put our colleagues in any bondage. Therefore, everyone needs to think that the victory of the Congress party is our victory and the defeat is our defeat. Our strength lies in the strength of the party,"" he added.Then, Kharge moved on to raising doubts about the credibility of the electoral process, Kharge criticised the role of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and the Election Commission. ""I believe that EVM has made the electoral process suspicious. The Election Commission is a constitutional institution, so the less said about it, the better. But it is their constitutional responsibility to ensure free and fair elections in the country,” he remarked.Reflecting on Congress’s historical legacy, Kharge reminded members of the party’s pivotal role in shaping modern India and empowering its citizens. He called on members to focus on issues that resonate with the public, such as unemployment, inflation, economic inequality, and social justice. At the same time, he warned against divisive forces, accusing the ruling BJP of using religious polarization to distract from its failures.Acknowledging the challenges posed by ""propaganda and misinformation"", Kharge urged the party to improve its micro-communication strategies and take timely decisions to counter these tactics effectively. ""We will have to improve the ways of fighting elections in every situation. Because times have changed. The ways of fighting elections have changed. We will have to improve our micro-communication strategy as compared to our opponents. ,"" he said while adding that they'll ""have to take tough decisions with confidence.""Kharge further called for unity, determination, and tough decision-making to bring the Congress back to power. ""We have overcome challenges in the past as well. We will have to move ahead by overcoming the current challenges,"" he said, urging the party to stand united and committed to restoring progress, peace, and harmony in the country.The CWC meet saw Kharge presiding over the session, with several leaders including LoP Rahul Gandhi, alongside AICC general secretaries Priyanka Gandhi Vadra , K C Venugopal and Jairam Ramesh, among others.","Mallikarjun Kharge addressed the party’s ""below-expectation"" performance during the Congress Working Committee (CWC) He questioned the dependence on the national leaders and issues and called on the party workers to focus on local issues.

The Punjab government should immediately issue instructions to all officers not to indulge in any such activities,"" the court said.The CAQM later announced exemptions to Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), relaxing the restrictions under Stage-III and IV regarding plying of BS IV Diesel and BS III petrol LMVs, permiting them to use them for their personal use.GRAP-4 measures primarily focus on limiting the entry of non-essential goods vehicles into the national capital. The GRAP, introduced in 2017, comprises anti-pollution measures implemented in Delhi and surrounding areas based on pollution severity levels.Earlier on Monday, the apex court had refused to relax the strict GRAP-IV measures being implement in Delhi-NCR but suggested that educational institutions in the National Capital Region (NCR) could reopen for physical classes.The court said a large number of students cannot avail mid-day meals, online classes and do not have access to air purifiers.The top court also came down heavily on the authorities, asking the CAQM to take action against the Delhi government, city police and others responsible for not complying with its order under GRAP-IV to prevent the entry of trucks into the national capital.Despite permitting relaxation of GRAP-IV measures in order to allow physical classes, the court noted that it could not order curbs below GRAP-III or GRAP-II unless it is satisfied with the consistent decrease in the Air Quality Index (AQI).The court also asked the state governments to use the labour cess it collected for the subsistence of the labourers during the construction ban.",All Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-IV measures except relating to schools will continue to be in place untill next hearing on December 2. Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) will hold a meeting and come out with the suggestion about moving from GRAP IV to GRAP III or GRAP II.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115769296,imgsize-30156,width-400,resizemode-4/115769296.jpg"

One pensioner was long dead.A previous inspection by Information Kerala Mission, which oversees computerisation and networking of local self-govt institutions, found that 1,458 govt employees had been fraudulently claiming social security pensions.In most cases of alleged fraud, the first breach was found to have occurred during eligibility checks for schemes for the underprivileged.Sources said one suggestion was to evaluate the progress of any such investigation monthly. Authorities havealready decided to repeat eligibility checks covering all social security beneficiaries in Kottakkal municipality.State finance minister K N Balagopal instructed local self-govt institutions to carry out regular assessments of the eligibility of beneficiaries of social welfare pensions through bank accounts.

NAGPUR: Bombay high court 's Nagpur bench recently ruled that sexual intercourse with a wife under 18 years of age, even if consensual, constitutes rape.The HC upheld the trial court's order sentencing the convict 10 years of rigorous imprisonment, reinforcing Supreme Court's precedent in Independent Thought versus Union of India . Delivering the verdict, Justice Govinda Sanap emphasised that marital rape exceptions under the IPC do not extend to minors. ""Sexual intercourse with a girl below 18 is rape regardless of marital status,"" he said.The case dates to 2019 and involves a minor victim in a three- four-year relationship with the convict. The victim, then a resident of Wardha, consistently rejected the man's advances. Facing financial difficulties, she later moved to another town for work, and the man followed her.Offering rides to and from her workplace, the man gained her trust before coercing her into a sexual relationship under the false promise of marriage. Their relationship eventually led to pregnancy. The accused then hastily arranged a makeshift marriage ceremony in a rented room, attended by a few neighbours.The victim later described the ceremony as a sham, devoid of legal validity or formalities. The man then pressured her to have an abortion, denied responsibility for the child, and accused her of infidelity. Left with no recourse, the victim reported the matter to Wardha police, leading to his prosecution."," Bombay high court's Nagpur bench recently ruled that sexual intercourse with a wife under 18 years of age, even if consensual, constitutes rape.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday said it was of the prima facie view that the Shahi Masjid Idgah management committee should have appealed the order of a single judge of Allahabad HC before a division bench of the HC, instead of moving the SC directly, to question maintainability of Hindu side suits claiming the entire disputed premises in Mathura to be the birthplace of Sri Krishna.The masjid committee has challenged the Aug 1 order of the single judge which said the 15 suits filed by Hindu parties claiming right over the Idgah as the birthplace of Sri Krishna were maintainable and ordering them to be clubbed together for a joint trial.The single judge had rejected the Muslim side's plea that the suits were barred by limitation as these were filed nearly 50 years after leaders of the two communities had reached an agreement to continue their respective religious activities in the areas demarcated for the mosque and the Sri Krishna Janmasthan temple. The masjid committee had also unsuccessfully pleaded before the HC that all the suits were covered by the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which barred any change in the religious character of a place of worship after Aug 15, 1947.Right at the beginning of the hearing on Friday, a bench of CJI Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said it was of the prima facie view that the appellant (masjid committee) could have challenged the single judge's order before a division bench of the HC through an intra-court appeal. This preliminary view synced with the argument by Hindu side counsel Vishnu Jain.However, as Idgah management committee counsel Tasneem Ahmadi said the issue would require an elaborate scrutiny of facts woven intricately with the history of the place, the bench agreed and posted the matter for arguments on Dec 9. In the last two orders, the court had asked the parties to submit written submissions on the advisability of resorting to intra-court appeal before the HC.","The Shahi Masjid Idgah management committee should have appealed the order of a single judge of Allahabad HC before a division bench of the HC, the Supreme Court said.

Widespread disruption gripped Denmark on Thursday as a major cellphone network outage left millions without connectivity. The outage, affecting TDC Net , one of the country's largest providers, significantly impacted phone calls, text messages, and internet access.The outage caused a critical disruption to emergency services across the country. Many residents were unable to reach police, fire departments, or ambulance crews, raising concerns about public safety. In response, authorities urged citizens to use alternative communication methods, such as landline phones or visiting emergency services in person.Hospitals across Denmark also faced challenges due to the outage. Some medical centers reportedly reduced non-critical procedures, fearing communication breakdowns could hinder patient care.While TDC Net officials attribute the outage to a likely software update issue , the cause remains under investigation. This has raised concerns about potential cyberattacks, especially considering the critical nature of the affected services. The Danish Centre for Cyber Security and the Defense Intelligence Service are currently investigating the incident.TDC Net announced late yesterday that they had implemented a fix, allowing customers to make calls again, albeit with reduced sound quality. However, the company is still investigating the root cause of the problem to prevent similar disruptions in the future.","Outage affects TDC Net, one of the country's largest providers.

Australia passes law banning children under 16 from social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-passes-law-banning-social-media-for-children-under-16/articleshow/115774949.cms,"Australian Senate on Thursday passed a world-first law banning children under 16 from using social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook, with tech companies facing fines of up to AUD 50 million (£26 million) for non-compliance.The ban, designed to protect young people from online harm, has ignited a national debate. While advocates hail it as a vital step in addressing youth mental health issues, critics warn of privacy infringements and unintended consequences for vulnerable groups.The law seeks to address rising concerns about social media’s impact on youth mental health, particularly among teenage girls. Senator Sarah Henderson of the Liberal Party cited global trends linking social media use to mental health crises, stressing the urgency of regulation.However, critics, including Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, dismissed the legislation as out of touch. “This is boomers trying to tell young people how the internet should work,” she argued, adding that the year-long delay before enforcement undermines its credibility.Privacy advocates have also raised alarms about potential data misuse. The legislation prohibits platforms from demanding government-issued IDs for age verification but leaves unresolved questions about how age checks will be conducted without infringing on user privacy.While many countries have proposed social media age restrictions, Australia's absolute ban is among the most stringent. Critics argue it may alienate vulnerable groups, including LGBTQIA+ youth, who rely on online communities for support. The Australian Human Rights Commission voiced concerns about potential human rights infringements, warning of social exclusion for young people.Tech companies have also criticised the law as rushed and impractical. A spokesperson for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argued the legislation “ignores evidence” from child safety experts and imposes unrealistic demands on parents and teens.","The law seeks to address rising concerns about social media’s impact on youth mental health, particularly among teenage girls.

List of unsold player in IPL mega auction

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn. Notable names like David Warner, Jonny Bairstow, and Kane Williamson , who have been cornerstones in the IPL for years, found themselves without bids.Each had a base price of Rs 2 crore, but despite their immense experience and proven track records, none of them attracted offers. Their absence from the auction table raised questions, particularly given their global stature in T20 cricket. It’s a stark reminder of how the dynamics of the auction can sometimes overshadow established stars in favour of fresh talent.In addition to these marquee international names, other seasoned players like Shardul Thakur Ajinkya Rahane , and Glenn Phillips also went unsold. Rahane, a reliable middle-order batsman, and Thakur, an all-rounder with vast IPL experience, both entered the auction with a base price of Rs 1.5 crore, but failed to secure a contract.Similarly, Phillips, known for his explosive batting and wicketkeeping skills, and Thakur, a consistent bowler, were left out despite being integral parts of their national teams. This reflects the fierce competition in the auction, where franchises appear to be banking on younger, more explosive talent rather than experienced hands.Perhaps the most surprising snub was former U-19 captain Prithvi Shaw , who had once been considered one of India’s brightest young talents. With a modest base price of Rs 75 lakh, Shaw was expected to generate significant interest.However, despite his impressive domestic performances, Shaw failed to attract any buyers. This highlights a growing trend in the IPL, where franchises are increasingly looking for players who can deliver immediate impact, while the burden of expectation weighs heavily on players like Shaw, who have not yet lived up to their early promise.The unsold list also includes several uncapped players, such as Yash Dhull, Kartik Tyagi, and Piyush Chawla, who could have added value to any team. With base prices ranging from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh, these players were considered potential investments, but their inability to secure deals underscores the auction's unpredictable nature.As franchises continue to focus on emerging talent from India and abroad, the auction results serve as a reminder that the IPL is not just about star power but also about fitting the right players into the right roles, irrespective of their past achievements.","IPL 2025 Mega Auction brought excitement and surprises, but for some seasoned players, it marked an unexpected turn.

Key Provisions of Australia's social media law :

Age Verification:

Strict Penalties:

Exemptions:

Facebook, Tiktok others raise implementation concerns

Australia has made history by becoming the first country to implement a nationwide ban on social media platforms for children under 16. This landmark legislation, passed by the Australian Parliament , seeks to protect young people's mental health and well-being from the potential harms of excessive online activity. The Senate passed the bill on November 28 by 34 votes to 19. The House of Representatives on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved the legislation by 102 votes to 13.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the law supported parents concerned by online harms to their children. “Platforms now have a social responsibility to ensure the safety of our kids is a priority for them,” Albanese told reporters.Social media platforms will be responsible for preventing underage users from accessing their services.Companies that fail to comply with the age verification requirements could face hefty fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars.Messaging apps, online gaming platforms, and educational services will be exempt from the ban.There are no penalties for young people or parents who flout the rules. Social media companies also won't be able to force users to provide government identification, including the Digital ID, to assess their age.The social media platforms have one year to work out how they could implement the ban. Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook and Instagram , said the legislation had been “rushed.” The platforms had complained that the law would be unworkable. Meta had urged the Senate to delay the vote until at least June 2025 when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies will report on how young children could be excluded.“Naturally, we respect the laws decided by the Australian Parliament,"" Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms said. “However, we are concerned about the process which rushed the legislation through while failing to properly consider the evidence, what industry already does to ensure age-appropriate experiences, and the voices of young people.” Snapchat said in a statement, ""While there are many unanswered questions about how this law will be implemented in practice, we will engage closely with the Government and the eSafety Commissioner during the 12-month implementation period to help develop an approach that balances privacy, safety and practicality. As always, Snap will comply with any applicable laws and regulations in Australia.”",Australia has made history by becoming the first country to implement a nationwide ban on social media platforms for children under 16.

Real reason behind Gronkowski’s absence from Fox NFL Sunday



Rob Gronkowski just might be retarded

Is there tension between Rob Gronkowski and Terry Bradshaw?



Rob Gronkowski ’s absence from Fox NFL Sunday this past week sparked rumors and speculation, especially after a playful jab from co-host Terry Bradshaw . Fans quickly wondered if the two were involved in some sort of on-air fallout. However, the truth behind Gronkowski ’s missing appearance is far simpler than the gossip suggests.Rob Gronkowski, former Patriots star, made headlines when he missed this Sunday’s Fox NFL Sunday broadcast. Speculation quickly swirled—did Terry Bradshaw’s recent jab at Gronk’s on-air analysis play a part in his absence? The two have co-hosted the show for two years, but this week, Gronk wasn’t there.The truth behind Gronkowski’s absence is much simpler and a bit less dramatic. He was actually in New Hampshire on November 24 to honor a commitment with Dick’s Sporting Goods, a date he’d set before the so-called ""beef"" with Bradshaw even happened. So, despite rumors, there was no falling-out or retirement plans at play here.Still, Bradshaw’s comment about Jimmy Johnson filling in for Gronk sparked curiosity. Johnson, who retired from his role last year, was replaced by Gronkowski two years ago, and his name resurfaced after Bradshaw’s November 17 remark about the four-time Super Bowl champion. The speculation about a rift between Bradshaw and Gronk was fueled, but it seems there’s no drama, just a prior commitment for Gronk.So, despite the chatter, Gronkowski’s absence had nothing to do with any tension with his co-host.Also Read: Andy Reid’s Chiefs highlight major TE injury as Travis Kelce struggles against NFL veteran After the Lions' dominant 52-6 victory over the Jaguars on November 17, the Fox NFL Sunday crew shared their thoughts on the game. Rob Gronkowski, a broadcaster for the show since 2022, highlighted how the Lions’ performance reflected Bill Belichick's philosophy of never underestimating an opponent.However, Terry Bradshaw couldn’t resist poking fun at Gronkowski’s analysis.“The guy whose seat you’re sitting in right now, while he’s on vacation” Bradshaw joked, referring to his absence.Gronkowski, slightly nervous, responded,“I’m part of the show, Terry, okay? Where are you going with that?” Bradshaw quickly backtracked, apologizing with, “I apologize Gronk, you know I love you.” (via: EssentiallySports)While the comment may have caught Gronk off guard, it was all in good fun—especially after the 35-year-old legend jokingly confirmed why his 76-year-old co-host sees him as a “part-time” worker due to his commitments to a $16 billion company.","Rob Gronkowski made headlines when he missed this Sunday’s Fox NFL Sunday broadcast.

KOCHI: An aircraft carrying 250 passengers from Oman to Kochi experiences a serious technical snag and is cleared for emergency landing. The aircraft's last known location is 150 nautical miles off Kochi before it disappears from radar. Soon, an offshore vessel, Coral King, reports sighting an aircraft ditching into the sea.Debris from the air crash causes a fire aboard a merchant vessel and one casualty on a passenger vessel. This scenario was part of a simulated exercise conducted in the Arabian Sea off the Kochi coast, involving 16 ships, 12 aircraft and 11 other crafts as part of the 11th edition of the National Maritime Search and Rescue Exercise (Sarex-2024), one of the largest search and rescue exercises in the country, which was organised by Indian Coast Guard (ICG).The exercise was inaugurated by defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh and reviewed by ICG Director General S Paramesh. Hosted in Kochi for the first time, the event also saw participation from National Maritime Search and Rescue Board members and 38 foreign observers.The simulation of the air crash showcased the innovative deployment of drones to deliver lifebuoys and the use of remotely controlled lifebuoys to save lives. Life raft drops by IAF aircraft and ICG ships, passenger evacuation using Advanced Light Helicopters (ALH), and crew rescue operations utilising Jason Cradle technology were also displayed. The use of green dye to mark the location of casualties in the sea and flares to alert the need for help were also demonstrated.The ICG director general highlighted the participation of 38 foreign delegates. He said the ICG has memorandums of understanding and cooperation with friendly nations, facilitating personnel exchanges, structured training, capacity building and the sharing of best practices during such events. “So it is our endeavour, with the approval of the govt of India, to invite as many observers as feasible for every edition of Sarex,” said Paramesh.He also stressed the importance of conducting these exercises across the country, ensuring that each coastal state gets an opportunity to host and test its capabilities.The ICG DG lauded the seizure of 6,016kg of methamphetamine from the Andaman waters by ICG. “Whether these drugs are meant for India or not, our main focus is to thwart the use of sea routes by those involved in smuggling contraband,” he asserted.During the exercise, ICG’s interceptor boats demonstrated how a highspeed chase is executed when a suspicious vessel is spotted and ICG ship ‘Shoor’ and a tugboat of Cochin Port used an external firefighting system to douse a fire onboard a dredger.

India urges Bangladesh to ensure safety of Hindus

A mob on Friday attacked three Hindu temples in Bangladesh 's Chattogram, where protests and violence erupted after sedition charges were filed against a former Iskcon member. The incident occurred at 2.30 pm (BDT) in the port city's Harish Chandra Munsef Lane, targeting the Shantaneshwari Matri Temple, Shani Temple, and Shantaneshwari Kalibari Temple.The temple authorities said that slogan-shouting people's brickbats caused damage to the three Hindu religious sites.Bangladesh officials reported minimal damage following the confrontation between the groups, who exchanged brickbats.Chinmoy Krishna Das, formerly associated with Iskcon Bangladesh, was arrested on Monday for sedition charges and denied bail on Tuesday, sparking protests by Hindu community members across Bangladesh, including Dhaka and Chattogram, also known as Chittogong.On October 30, authorities filed a sedition case against 19 individuals, including Das, at Chattogram's Kotwali Police Station, alleging disrespect towards Bangladesh's national flag during a Hindu community rally in New Market area.The Bangladesh financial intelligence unit has directed the freezing of the bank accounts of 17 individuals allegedly connected to Iskcon Bangladesh, including imprisoned Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, for a duration of 30 days.The directive was issued on Thursday to various banks and organisations, following the high court's refusal to issue a suo motu order prohibiting Iskcon's operations in Bangladesh amidst Hindu protests over Chinmoy Krishna's sedition charges. Iskcon Bangladesh has distanced itself from Das, saying he was previously expelled with two others for disciplinary violations before his arrest. The BFIU order, based on the Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2012, says, ""All types of transactions in the bank accounts of these individuals (named in the document) will remain suspended for 30 days.""The account freezing announcement coincided with Hefazate-Islam Bangladesh's street demonstrations in Dhaka, demanding Iskcon's prohibition and labelling it a ""terrorist-militant organisation"". The religious group also protested the death of lawyer Saiful Islam Alif during unrest in Chattogram, reportedly connected to Chinmoy Krishna's bail denial. Hefazat supporters claimed Iskcon members damaged mosques and were responsible for advocate Saiful's alleged murder.The interim administration released a statement criticising the ""desecration of the national flag and burning of an effigy of chief adviser Yunus"" during demonstrations in Kolkata.India expressed concerns regarding the leader's arrest and bail denial, urging Bangladesh to ensure the protection of Hindus and other minorities.These incidents have created diplomatic tensions between the neighbouring countries. India said on Friday that Bangladesh's interim government must protect all minorities, expressing serious concern about extremist rhetoric and increasing violence against Hindus and temple attacks.External affairs minister S Jaishankar informed Parliament that India has noted the violence against minorities in Bangladesh seriously, emphasising Dhaka's responsibility to protect all citizens' rights. He further added that the Indian high commission in Dhaka is closely monitoring the situation.“Our position on the matter is clear — the interim govt in Dhaka must live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities. We are concerned at surge of extre mist rhetoric, increasing incidents of violence and provocation. These developments cannot be dismissed only as media exaggeration,” ministry of external affairs (MEA) spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said while addressing the unrest in Bangladesh.Bangladesh responded on Friday by expressing deep concern about the violent protest at their deputy high commission in Kolkata, requesting New Delhi to ensure the safety of all Bangladeshi diplomatic missions in India.","Chinmoy Krishna Das, formerly associated with Iskcon Bangladesh, was arrested on Monday for sedition charges and denied bail on Tuesday. India expressed concerns regarding the leader's arrest and bail denial, urging Bangladesh to ensure the protection of Hindus and other minorities. India said Bangladesh's interim government must protect all minorities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115829575,imgsize-1262891,width-400,resizemode-4/115829575.jpg"
"Chinese women mobilise against subpar sanitary pads, forcing brands to apologise",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-women-mobilise-against-subpar-sanitary-pads-forcing-brands-to-apologise/articleshow/115827816.cms,"Picture credit: Getty/istock

When Sabrina Wang, a Chinese university student, saw an online post that claimed that manufacturers of sanitary pads had been cheating women, selling them pads that were significantly shorter than advertised, she decided to measure her own.She was shocked to find that all three brands she had at home were shorter than labelled, by as much as 17%. ""If I had issues when using them, I'd wonder if it was that I had gone too long without changing them,"" Wang, 22, said. ""It was only after everyone pointed it out that I realised it was a manufacturing problem."" She wrote her own post, urging other women to lobby for stricter oversight of pad makers. ""Manufacturers think we can't go without their products because of our everyday physiological needs, so they dare to be so arrogant,"" she said. ""It's a lack of respect.""Wang was joining a chorus of voices in China that in recent weeks have demanded greater accountability from pad manufacturers and govt regulators - and, more broadly, greater consideration of women. Criticism of the lengths of pads quickly expanded to scrutiny of their quality and price. From there, the conversation branched out to topics like inadequate sex education, body shaming and the lack of female CEOs.Women have called for boycotts of brands they deem to be of subpar quality, and shared guides to making reusable pads at home. Dozens of hashtags about the topic, such as ""black-hearted pads"" and ""Is it so hard for sanitary pad producers to meet women's needs?"" have trended online. The backlash prompted one major manufacturer to pull all its products from the e-commerce platform Taobao, promising to improve them. State media outlets have denounced ""deep-seated problems"" in the industry. And a govt-backed trade association vowed to take public comments into account when formulating new regulations for sanitary products.The uproar is the latest example of how discussions of gender inequality have become increasingly common in China, even as the ruling Communist Party has worked to silence civil society and independent speech. Menstruation, in particular, has become a popular rallying topic. During the pandemic, many women criticised the lack of sanitary pads for medical staff. China's high-speed rail agency did not sell pads on trains until an online pressure campaign in 2022 prompted some routes to begin stocking them.Despite the apparent success of the women's protests, there were signs of official wariness toward mass mobilisation and feminism. Wang, the university student who shared tips for lobbying regulators on Xiaohongshu, said her post appeared to have been partly censored; others could not see her replies to their comments, and the post's viewership rate suddenly plunged overnight.For some women, even if the companies did change, it was too little, too late. Zhang Yanchi, a 23-year-old writer, said she wanted to see female entrepreneurs building their own companies that respected and empowered women. ""I am waiting for their pads,"" she said.",Chinese women demand greater accountability from pad manufacturers and govt regulators.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.
