Can't expect man to maintain ex-wife as per his status all his life: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cant-expect-man-to-maintain-ex-wife-as-per-his-status-all-his-life-sc/articleshow/116516872.cms,"NEW DELHI: For a rich man, both marriage and divorce are costly affairs. An India-born American citizen, running a successful IT consultancy service in the US, realised this as he had to cough up Rs 500 crore as alimony to his first wife in Nov 2020 and has now been ordered by SC to pay Rs 12 crore to his second wife, with whom his marriage lasted less than a year.Responding to the husband's plea to the SC to annul the ""irretrievably broken"" marriage, which lasted only for a few months after they tied the knot on July 31, 2021, the second wife said she should get a permanent alimony on par with the divorced first wife.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and Pankaj Mithal frowned at the woman's demand for parity with the first wife, who had spent several years in matrimony with the man, in terms of alimony and her attempt to seek equalisation of her wealth with that of her husband.Writing a detailed 73-page judgment , Justice Nagarathna said, ""We have serious reservations with the tendency of parties seeking maintenance or alimony as an equalisation of wealth with the other party. It is often seen that parties highlight the assets, status and income of their spouse, and then ask for an amount that can equal their wealth to that of the spouse."" She asked why such demands were conspicuously absent when the spouse's wealth decreased substantially after separation.The bench said the law of maintenance was to save the estranged wife from destitution, maintain her dignity and deliver social justice. ""As per settled law, the wife is entitled to be maintained as far as possible in a manner similar to what she was accustomed to in her matrimonial home while the parties were together,"" it said.""But once the parties have separated, it cannot be expected of the husband to maintain her as per his present status all his life. If the husband is fortunately doing better in life post his separation, then to ask him to always maintain the status of the wife as per his own changing status would be putting a burden on his own personal progress,"" the bench said.""We wonder, would the wife be willing to seek an equalisation of wealth with the husband if due to some unfortunate events post-separation, he has been rendered a pauper,"" the bench asked.","An India-born American citizen, running a successful IT consultancy service in the US, realised this as he had to cough up Rs 500 crore as alimony to his first wife in Nov 2020.

BHOPAL: In a latest development, the Income Tax Department’s discovery of 52 kg of gold and ₹10 crore in cash from an abandoned vehicle near Mandora village has been linked to the Lokayukta’s raid on former RTO constable Saurabh Sharma and his associate, Chandan Singh Gaur. The seizure has brought further attention to the duo, already under investigation in a disproportionate assets case.The Lokayukta’s Special Police Establishment (SPE) raided the residences of Sharma and Gaur on Thursday, unearthing Rs 2.5 crore in cash, gold, silver jewellery, and property documents from Sharma’s home in Arera Colony. The value of these assets is expected to exceed Rs 3 crore.Saurabh Sharma, who took voluntary retirement from the Transport Department a year ago, is now active in real estate.Raids revealed investments in multiple properties, a hotel, and a school. Properties linked to Sharma are spread across multiple districts, including Bhopal. Complaints of corruption and illegal land use prompted the investigation.Sharma, originally from Gwalior, joined the Transport Department on a compassionate appointment after his father’s death. During his 12-year tenure, his lifestyle and assets saw a drastic transformation, raising suspicions. After clashes with bureaucrats and complaints regarding a school allegedly built on reserved land, Sharma retired early to focus on real estate ventures.Both Sharma and Gaur have been booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act, with ADG Lokayukta Jaideep Prasad confirming that investigations are ongoing. Officials believe the gold and cash found in the abandoned vehicle may be part of the illicit wealth amassed by the duo.

At the Arulmigu Kandaswamy temple at Thiruporur, near Chennai, a devotee inadvertently dropped not a baby but an iPhone into the hundi. The result is the same. This temple too has claimed the phone as its property.Dinesh, a devotee from Vinayagapuram, had to return home empty-handed on Friday as the temple authorities said anything dropped into the hundi belongs to the deity. They, however, offered to give him the SIM card and to let him download data from the phone.Dinesh had visited the temple with his family a month ago and after worship went to drop some money in the hundi. He said that while he was pulling out currency notes from his shirt pocket, his iPhone accidentally fell into the hundi. Since the hundi was placed at a height, he couldn't retrieve the phone. Panic-stricken, Dinesh approached the temple authorities. However, they told him once an offering is placed in the hundi, it is considered the property of the deity and cannot be returned. Besides, according to tradition, the hundi is opened only once in two months. Dinesh lodged a complaint with the HR and CE (Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments) officials, requesting to be informed when the hundi would be opened.When the temple authorities eventually opened the hundi on Friday, Dinesh rushed to retrieve his phone, only to be told that the device would remain in the temple's custody. He was offered the option to take the SIM card and download any important data from the phone. Dinesh had already obtained a new SIM card and left it to the authorities to decide on his plea to return the phone. Temple executive officer Kumaravel said the tradition of treating anything dropped in the hundi as belonging to the temple and deity would be followed and that the phone would be kept in the temple's custody. ""We are not clear whether he dropped it as an offering and later changed his mind, because the hundi is well protected with an iron fence,"" Kumaravel said.","Dinesh, a devotee from Vinayagapuram, had to return home empty-handed.

JAIPUR: If pain and tragedy needed a face, the lumbering figure of 32-year-old Radheyshyam Choudhary with his arms outstretched and body enveloped in flames would encapsulate everything that went horribly wrong on the Jaipur-Ajmer highway early Friday.Radheyshyam, a motor mechanic with National Bearings Company Ltd in Jaipur, had left his home near Ring Road on his motorbike as usual, having no inkling of the catastrophe that awaited him and many others barely 2km ahead.By mid-morning, videos of the aftermath of the gas tanker explosion on the national highway were circulating online, with more than one showing a burning man struggling to stay on his feet as he scampered for help amid the cacophony unleashed by the accident.Radheyshyam's elder brother Akheram recalled being woken up at 5.50am by a stranger calling to deliver an ominous message, ""Come to Heerapura bus terminal immediately. Your brother is in trouble.""Half-asleep and disoriented, Akheram rushed to the area with two neighbours. What he saw on reaching the accident site would haunt him forever. ""My brother was lying on the road,"" Akheram said, his voice breaking. ""People told me he walked nearly 600 metres from the explosion site. They said he was crying for help as he struggled down the road. But instead of helping, most bystanders just made videos.""Realising it would be futile to expect an ambulance to arrive anytime soon because of the traffic chaos, Akheram and his neighbours carried Radheyshyam to their car.""He was conscious, talking coherently all the way to the hospital,"" Akheram said. ""He told us exactly what happened, intermittently trembling. He mentioned giving my number to the caller who alerted me. It was unbelievable how he managed to recall my number despite experiencing excruciating pain. Watching him writhe in agony, yet speak so clearly, was unbearable.""During the journey, Radheyshyam recounted the harrowing moments leading up to the tragedy. He described how he felt the ground shake seconds before a wave of flames swept everything in its way.Instinctively, Radheyshyam jumped off his bike and ran in the opposite direction, but the flames caught up with him. Despite his burns, he alternately ran and walked until he found someone to call his brother.At SMS Hospital, the medical staff, already overwhelmed by the surge of accident victims, admitted him. For a brief moment, hope flickered. ""We thought he would survive,"" Akheram said, struggling to be heard. ""But with 85% burns, his chance of survival was a thread that snapped.""","Radheyshyam Choudhary, 32, was badly burned in the Jaipur-Ajmer gas tanker accident. He had left his home on his motorbike as usual, having no inkling of the catastrophe.

26/11 accused to be extradited to India? US government asks Supreme Court to dismiss Tahawwur Rana's plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/26/11-accused-to-be-extradited-to-india-us-asks-supreme-court-to-dismiss-tahawwur-ranas-plea/articleshow/116469774.cms,"Tahawwur Rana (File photo)

The US government supported India's request to extradite Tahawwur Rana, a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai attacks . The government called upon the top US court to reject ""the petition for a writ of certiorari"" submitted by Rana.Rana, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, recently petitioned the Supreme Court to block his extradition. The US Solicitor General, Elizabeth B. Prelogar , filed a response on December 16 urging the court to deny the petition.Rana had previously appealed his extradition in lower courts, including the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, but was unsuccessful. ""The (India US Extradition) Treaty permits Rana's extradition,"" the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had ruled in August.He then filed a ""petition for a writ of certiorari"" with the Supreme Court on November 13. This petition represents Rana’s final legal attempt to avoid extradition.A writ of certiorari is a request to a higher court to review a lower court's ruling. The term ""certiorari"" comes from Law Latin, meaning ""to be more fully informed.""Rana's ""petition for a writ of certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"" contends that he was previously tried and cleared in the federal court of Northern District of Illinois (Chicago) regarding the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. His petition states, ""India now seeks to extradite him for trial on charges based on the identical conduct at issue in the Chicago case.""However, Prelogar argued that Rana is not exempt from extradition. She contends that the Indian charges against Rana are not fully identical to the charges he faced in a US federal court in Chicago. ""The government does not concede that all of the conduct on which India seeks extradition was covered by the government's prosecution in this case. For example, India's forgery charges are based in part on conduct that was not charged in the United States: petitioner's use of false information in an application to formally open a branch office of the Immigration Law Centre submitted to the Reserve Bank of India,"" she said as quoted by news agency PTI.She further explained that the prior US case against Rana, which resulted in an acquittal on some charges, does not cover all the conduct India intends to prosecute. ""It is not clear that the jury's verdict in this case - which involves conspiracy charges and was somewhat difficult to parse - means that he has been 'convicted or acquitted' on all of the specific conduct that India has charged.""","Tahawwur Rana is a suspect in the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

Let’s look at 5 such NFL players whose marriages ended due to such extramarital affairs -Ronnie was engaged to Emily Kuch, sister of famous influencer Aliison Kuch; they were together for around 8 years and about to get married Emily decided to call off the wedding just hours before it was about to begin.

Is this for good. In the moment, I was kind of just like, ‘Did I make the right decision?’ … I’m like, ‘S—, what is going on?'”Ryan Shazier married his long time girlfriend Michelle Rodrigues in 2019 after suffering a spinal cord injury that ended his career. They also had a son together in the same year. But last year, Michelle accused Shazier of having an affair outside his marriage. Michelle made a post on her Instagram that said “A person that loves his family … this is what they do to their family … the WIFE.. that has been there for him since day 1! Infidelity at its finest! I can’t sit here and keep hiding anymore. You can have it. I deserve better. This is Ryan. … he’s a liar and a cheater!”The post is now deleted and in January of this year, Ryan filed for divorce.Cody Ford was dating Tianna Robillard who is a popular influencer. They started dating in 2022 and in April 2024, Cody went down on one knee and proposed to Tianna but the engagement did not last long. In June 2024 Tianna found out Cody was cheating on her and Tianna broke off the engagement and cancelled their upcoming wedding.Later in July 2024, Tianna appeared on the podcast “Hot Mess With Alex Earle” where she revealed she was live on TikTok and one of her followers exposed that Cody was cheating on her.

Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce: A Look At Their Net Worth, Properties and Cars In 2024



Where Do Taylor And Travis Live?



Their Cars

Ever since Taylor Swift attended the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Chicago Bears at Arrowhead Stadium in September last year, Swifties haven’t stopped rooting for her relationship with tight-end Travis Kelce. Now that engagement rumours are swirling around the power couple, it’s worth exploring their combined net worth exceeding billion dollars and some of their prized assets.Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour has become a global phenomenon, with sold-out shows across the US, Europe, and Asia. Taylor Swift's Eras Tour grossed over $3.2 billion, making it the most lucrative concert in American music history; the concert film itself made more than $260 million. In October last year, she officially became a self-made billionaire and ended the year as one of the most powerful women in the world on Forbes‘ list. And in 2024 Taylor became the richest female musician in the world.In addition to the Eras Tour, Swift’s 11th studio album, ‘The Tortured Poets Department’ became the first album in Spotify’s history to reach 300 million streams in a day. According to a Forbes report which was released in October, the singer’s net worth is now pegged at $1.6 billion. Forbes estimates that Taylor has grossed at least $1.15 billion before taxes and fees, with pretax earnings of $400 million.Travis Kelce on the other hand isn’t doing so bad either. According to the website prestigeonline, Kelce's salary with the Chiefs currently sees him take home $17.125 million per year. Kelce has accumulated around $80 million in total salary since entering the NFL in 2013 and the three-time Super Bowl winner has signed a new two-year $34.2 million deal with the Chiefs, with an average yearly salary of $17 million.This means that the couple have a combined net worth of over $ 1.65 billion.Is it any wonder that Taylor Swift owns multiple homes across the US? From her Nashville apartment and her Hollywood Hills mansion to her Rhode Island vacation home, she owns some of the most gorgeous properties in America. She owns a penthouse condo in Nashville which was most likely the first home she bought for herself. The 3,240-square-foot condo has three bedrooms overlooking Nashville’s Music Row.In 2011, Taylor picked up Greek Revival-style estate Nashville for $2.5 million in the quiet Forest Hills suburb and she purchased a $1.78 million single-story midcentury-style Beverly Hills bungalow in 2012.

Jim Ross Talks WWE Wildest NSFW Scene in Attitude Era: 'Show a couple of b**bs',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/jim-ross-talks-wwe-wildest-nsfw-scene-in-attitude-era-show-a-couple-of-bbs/articleshow/116506802.cms,"Credits: WWE

WWE's Risque Moment DECODED: Jim Ross Spills Behind the Scenes Secrets



The reasoning behind one WWE segment that would never happen in the present day was explained by Jim Ross . The late 1990s was a very different era, even though WWE has been a PG product and has remained family-friendly since 2008. In an attempt to attract more viewers during the Monday Night Wars, the weekly TV shows continuously pushed the boundaries deep into The Attitude Era. While explicit content was common on Raw, the company took pay-per-view to the next level at Armageddon 1999.Miss Kitty went topless to celebrate winning the Women's Championship in an Evening Gown pool match, marking the first time she had purposefully been nude in the promotion. In response to a question concerning the content of the contentious segment on Grilling JR, Ross stated that it was done so in order to appeal to their largest audience:He said, “It was a way to try to entertain men 18 to 34. And if you’re a marketer, or you’re a business person, or you’re someone that has average intellect, you know that men 18 to 34, as a rule, like that kind of thing. So consequently, we’re trying to cater to our biggest and most viable demographic. Pro wrestling is a male show.”“You can say, ‘Well, it’s this or that.’ If you lose your males, you’re out of business. So let’s not bullsh*t each other. Does it have a place for women? Absolutely, hell yeah, of course, women broadcasters and all kinds of things. We’ve got great women, you know, Rene Paquette at AEW is one of the most intelligent and informed people on TV as far as pro wrestling is concerned. She does a great job. It’s a key role that can be filled and has been filled by others, but you know, you’re looking at, how do you please men 18 to 34? Show them a couple of boobs, and Miss Kitty, AKA The Kat, was happy to provide that opportunity with her luscious little breasts.”Ross went on to say that although women do have a place in wrestling, particularly in the modern world, the primary goal at the time was to appeal to young, male fans. Ross initially said that the former Women's Champion was ""properly rewarded"" when asked if Miss Kitty received additional compensation for the segment. He then went on to explain his point:“It probably enhanced them going from a good payday to the best payday they ever had. So hell yeah, they got compensated for it.”ALSO READ: Kevin Owens WWE Fate Decided?

The Attitude Era, characterized by its edgy content and provocative storylines, was a time when WWE pushed the boundaries of television to attract a specific demographic. While such a segment would be unthinkable in today's more family-friendly WWE, it remains a fascinating glimpse into the past and the evolution of professional wrestling.","The late 1990s was a very different era, even though WWE has been a PG product and has remained family-friendly since 2008.

Leader of Canada’s New Democratic Party (NDP) Jagmeet Singh , a key ally keeping Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 's party in power, declared on Friday that he will vote in favor of a no-confidence motion against Trudeau.Singh made the announcement through an open letter, which comes after his party withdrew its support for Trudeau's government earlier this year.In his letter, Singh sharply criticised Trudeau’s leadership, saying, “Justin Trudeau failed in the biggest job a Prime Minister has: to work for people, not the powerful.”He highlighted the NDP's resolve to bring down the government and provide Canadians with an opportunity to ""vote for a government that would work in their best interests"".""The Canadian dream is a good job that gets you a home and a fridge full of groceries with enough left over to save for vacations.

Purdy’s priceless gift to his O-Line



Brock Purdy’s Top Plays from the First Half of the 2024 Season | 49ers

QB likely for a significant extension



In the NFL, it’s a time-honored tradition for quarterbacks to play Santa Claus for their offensive linemen, showing gratitude with generous Christmas gifts . While rookies often stick to simple presents, seasoned pros go all out for their trusted blockers. This year, Brock Purdy went above and beyond, surprising his O-line with an unforgettable gift.One of the most cherished traditions in the NFL is quarterbacks playing Santa Claus for their offensive linemen, showering them with Christmas gifts. Rookies tend to keep things modest, while the league’s top earners go all out with extravagant presents for their trusted blockers.San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy, who’s set to make less than $1 million in salary this season, could have easily opted for a simpler gift. Instead, Purdy took full advantage of his Toyota sponsorship , gifting each of his O-line teammates a brand-new car. The 49ers shared the heartwarming moment on social media Thursday, showcasing Purdy’s surprise as he presented his linemen with a choice: a Toyota Tundra TRD Pro truck or a Toyota Sequoia SUV.The total cost of the 10 cars, which Purdy gave away, is estimated at around $800,000. But the priceless reactions from his teammates made the hefty price tag more than worth it. Shocked and grateful, they expressed their thanks and shared emotional moments with the quarterback. Offensive lineman Jaylen Moore couldn’t help but comment:""My mind is blown, honestly. This is probably the greatest gift I have ever gotten in my life.” (via: Sportskeeda)Brock Purdy had to rely on his Toyota sponsorship to buy Christmas gifts for his offensive linemen this year, but that won’t last long. The 24-year-old QB, who was the last pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, is poised for a massive contract extension worth anywhere between $30 million and $50 million annually, a far cry from his humble beginnings.Purdy originally signed a modest four-year, $3.7 million deal, with most expecting him to serve as a backup. But with injuries to Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo, Purdy was thrust into the starting role and he delivered. He’s now thrown for 8,828 yards and 59 touchdowns, leading the 49ers to the NFC Championship and a Super Bowl appearance in just two seasons as the starter.His current deal has allowed the 49ers to maintain financial flexibility, but once his new contract is in place, that will all change. A $30-$45 million extension would be a massive raise, yet still be relatively team-friendly compared to other top quarterbacks. Should it reach $50-$60 million, Purdy will be counted among the highest-paid quarterbacks in the league. Either way, a significant payday is on the horizon, and it will undoubtedly alter the dynamics of the 49ers’ roster.Also Read : Julian Edelman stands by Bears’ Kevin Warren amid ongoing Mike Vrabel hiring rumors","San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy surprised his offensive linemen with a $800,000 gift.

Director not liable if company cheque dishonoured: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/director-not-liable-if-company-cheque-dishonoured-sc/articleshow/116523346.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Providing a loophole to ingenious persons, the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that if a person repays a personal loan through a cheque signed by him as a director of a company, then he would not be liable to be prosecuted under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act if the cheque bounced..A man took a personal loan of Rs 7 lakhs and returned the amount through a cheque drawn on an account of Shilabati Hospital, Kolkata, of which he was a director. The cheque bounced and the creditor had initiated proceedings under Section 138 of NI Act. The HC quashed the proceedings. The creditor appealed in the SC.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan said Section 138, being a penal provision, has to be strictly construed and a man could face prosecution only if the cheque, issued by him from an account maintained by him, gets dishonoured.It said since the cheque was drawn from the hospital's account, the man as director cannot be prosecuted under the NI Act. There are as many as 36 lakh cheque bouncing cases pending in various courts as of 2023.Writing a detailed judgment analysing the provision threadbare, Justice Pardiwala said, “Section 138 of the NI Act clearly postulates that the cheque returned for insufficiency of funds should have been drawn by a person on an account maintained by him.”“It will amount to doing violence to the language of the statute if Section 138 of the Act is interpreted to mean that even if a person draws a cheque on an account not maintained by him, he shall be liable if the cheque is returned for insufficiency of funds. Such an interpretation will lead to absurd and wholly unintended results,” he said.Referring to the dishonour of the cheque signed by the debtor as a director of Shilabati hospital, the bench said, “The mere fact that the cheque signed by the accused in his capacity as a “Director” of the Company would in the normal course be honoured by the Bank to which it was presented does not satisfy the statutory requirement of Section 138 of the Act.”However, the bench said that though the debtor cannot be prosecuted under Section 138, he would be liable for the offence of cheating as it stands proved that he had undisputedly offered the cheque to settle the loan amount.“In such circumstances, although it is not possible to hold the accused liable for the offence under Section 138 of the NI Act, yet the possibility of him having committed the offence of cheating cannot be ruled out. Prima facie, the mens rea (guilty mind) of the accused speaks for itself,” the bench said.","A man took a personal loan of Rs 7 lakhs and returned the amount through a cheque drawn on an account of Shilabati Hospital, Kolkata.

I WAS SIRED on a damp Monday on the third floor of a near-empty office, born not of passion but of a lust for purpose. My father leaned back in his ergonomic chair, eyes half-closed, muttering the immortal words: “Let’s do it!” There were no roses, no romance. Not much joy either, I suspect. I came into being with the ease of a sigh, the grace of a shrug. I didn’t cry. My father stared at me for a moment, nodded solemnly, and sent me into the world.I travelled swiftly: weightless, unseen. I was lean. Silent, until I pinged. I was meant to stir things up, to create the illusion of movement.L was the first to open me next morning. She scanned me, her brow creasing briefly, and forwarded me without hesitation. Her message was brief: ‘Looping in R.’ R opened me reluctantly, his cursor hovering before he clicked. He skimmed, added a single comment—’M needs to be on this’—and despatched me without ceremony. M squashed me through lunch and much of the afternoon. In his corner cubicle, under the caustic gaze of a well-thumbed David Allen, he eyed me occasionally but held firm. At 4:30, he opened me, read me slowly, hit Reply All, and typed: ‘Let’s circle back tomorrow.’I grew on Wednesday. My subject line swelled: ‘Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Fwd: Re: Re:’. Someone added an attachment—dutifully forwarded but never opened. I carried it awkwardly, like balloons to a board meeting.I was a monster by Thursday. Unrecognisable, my skin blistered with emojis—thumbs-ups, hearts, clapping hands; my soul buried under empty phrases—‘Flagging for visibility,’ ‘Let’s align,’ ‘Adding my two cents,’ ‘For action’, ‘For URGENT action’, and ‘FYI.’ I had become an organism, a hydra with heads in 47 inboxes. I reached places I was never meant to: the CEO’s executive assistant, who promptly forwarded me to Legal without pause; a woman on maternity leave who read me in horror, then marked me unread; and a man on holiday in Thailand, who sighed, shook his head, and deleted me. Within an hour, I was resurrected by a woman who replied all with, ‘Apologies—just catching up now!’ By Friday, I was the Ever Given in the Canal. Perhaps as an act of kindness, F forwarded me to the guillotine of Finance. They replied promptly with a form to fill out and a question no one could answer: ‘Who’s the budget holder?’ M responded with a question mark, @mentioning my father, who sent me out again, now bearing the subject line ‘URGENT—PLEASE ADVISE’. I should have died then. Not I. For I am both ephemeral and eternal. I am your solace, email warriors—you lionhunters of the digital savannah.I am the Ouroboros of your inbox. You think you wield me, but I am the thing that wields you.","Chindu Sreedharan is Professor of Journalism at Bournemouth University (UK) She says she was born with a lust for purpose.

Negotiation highlights

Scrapped provisions

Political tensions and fallout

Looking ahead

The House of Representatives approved a government funding bill Friday evening in a 366-34 vote, aiming to prevent a partial shutdown. The bill’s passage came after intense negotiations and objections from President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the incoming chief of the Department of Government Efficiency, who criticized the initial version as overly ""bloated.""Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) announced, “We will not have a government shutdown , and we will meet our obligations for our farmers who need aid, for disaster victims all over the country, and for making sure that military and essential services and everyone who relies upon the federal government for a paycheck is paid over the holidays.”The legislation, trimmed from 1,547 to 118 pages, funds the government at current levels through March 14, 2025. It includes $100 billion in disaster relief for hurricane-hit states and farmers, extends agricultural subsidies for a year, and allocates $25 million for the US Marshals Service and Supreme Court security. A peculiar $3 million provision for inspecting molasses at U.S. ports also survived.Republicans largely supported the measure, with just 34 voting against it. No Democrats opposed the final version, and one voted “present.” This marks a stark contrast to Thursday night, when 38 GOP members rejected a similar bill.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) played a key role in breaking the impasse. Jeffries supported the final version and praised the decision to reject Trump’s proposal to abolish the federal debt ceiling, which he argued would have triggered recurring crises.Musk, who initially pressured Republicans to reject the earlier version, endorsed the revised package. “The Speaker did a good job here, given the circumstances. It went from a bill that weighed pounds to a bill that weighed ounces. Ball should now be in the Dem court,” he tweeted.The revised bill removed contentious proposals, including a 4% pay raise for Congress, a provision restricting pharmacy benefit managers, and funding for Robert F. Kennedy Stadium renovations. It also struck measures against AI-generated non-consensual pornography.Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) criticized Speaker Johnson’s decision to work with Democrats, claiming, “Johnson flipped his decision after the meeting when he spoke to [Hakeem Jeffries] and realized he could get Democrat votes to pass all the legislation as one bill.”Massie and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) had previously attempted to oust Johnson as Speaker. Musk also fueled tensions, questioning on X, “So is this a Republican bill or a Democrat bill?”Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) fired back, “How about the House add campaign finance reform to the CR so Republicans and Democrats alike can stop being so scared about what a billionaire man-child thinks before they vote on anything around here.”While the House avoided a shutdown, uncertainty looms as the Senate faces time constraints to consider the bill. A senior Democratic aide noted Johnson’s challenges: “He was juggling all that with wanting to keep the gavel while being hit with asteroids launched by Elon Musk.”","The House of Representatives approved a government funding bill Friday evening in a 366-34 vote.

"Musk: Elon Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/elon-musk-says-twitter-in-precarious-position-defends-cost-cuts/articleshow/96413370.cms,"""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Elon Musk Govt Shutdown: Govt shutdown crisis averted? Elon Musk's 2-word reaction to new spending bill plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/govt-shutdown-crisis-averted-elon-musks-2-word-reaction-to-new-spending-bill-plan/articleshow/116513667.cms,"Speaker Mike Johnson's Plan C is ready to avert a government shutdown.

What happened to Plan A and B?

What did Elon Musk say about the new plan?



To avert a shutdown of the government from midnight today, the Republican leadership has now come up with a Plan C to hold separate votes on three bills: a three-month government funding bill, a $100 billion disaster package and a $10 billion farm aid bill. It's not yet clear when the House will vote and how many Democratic votes will be needed to avert the crisis. Fragmenting the bill into three parts will allow these bills to pass or fail in Congress individually.GOP leaders are debating voting tonight under a process that would require two-thirds of the chamber to agree, or waiting to vote until tomorrow by first passing a rule that would require only a simple majority to pass the funding plan, according to a source.House Republicans will meet behind closed doors at 12:30 PM ET to discuss a new plan to avert a government shutdown -- as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says the “lines of communication have been reopened” with Speaker Mike Johnson.Plan A was a bipartisan bill agreed by Democratic and Republican leaders. But led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance called for rejecting the bill as it had unnecessary expenses. Also, the bill was given a day before its passage to which the DOGE co-chiefs opposed staunchly and said it was not meant to be read.Plan B was a new spending deal which had the backing of all the MAGA major leaders including Donald Trump, JD Vance, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. But Democrats and 38 Republicans voted against the bill pushing the government one step closer to a possible shutdown.Donald Trump said if there has to be a shutdown it should be under Biden's watch and not after January 20 when he takes over.Elon Musk said the new plan of splitting the spending bill into smaller pieces allowing each piece to pass or fail individually sounds promising. Elon Musk's reaction became all the more important as he emerged as the driving force behind the failure of Plan A and consequently, Plan C.","Plan C is to hold separate votes on three bills: a three-month government funding bill, a $100 billion disaster package and a $10 billion farm aid bill.

"US raises alarm: Soon, Pakistan missiles could reach American soil",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-nuclear-missiles-and-us-jon-finer-india-and-pakistan-us-sanctions-on-pakistan/articleshow/116498678.cms,"File photo: Pakistani military personnel stand beside a Shaheen III surface-to-surface ballistic missile during Pakistan Day military parade in Islamabad.

Driving the news

Speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer described Pakistan’s missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country’s strategic posture.

described Pakistan’s missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country’s strategic posture. “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology, from long-range ballistic missile systems to equipment that would enable the testing of significantly larger rocket motors,” Finer said.

“If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”

This revelation comes on the heels of Washington imposing a fresh wave of sanctions on Pakistan’s missile program. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, alongside three private Karachi-based companies accused of supporting missile development.

Why it matters

Finer’s revelation marks a stark turning point in US-Pakistan relations, underscoring a broader erosion of trust since the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Historically viewed as a key partner in counterterrorism, Pakistan’s ballistic missile advancements are now seen as a direct challenge to US security.

The move also raises critical questions about whether Pakistan’s missile program, long designed as a counter to India, is shifting toward broader ambitions with potentially global consequences.

Two senior US officials, speaking anonymously, revealed that Washington has repeatedly pressed Islamabad to explain the development of more powerful rocket engines but received evasive responses. “They don’t acknowledge our concerns. They tell us we are biased,” said one official.

This development places Pakistan alongside nations like Russia, North Korea, and China—states identified by the US as adversaries with nuclear weapons and missile systems capable of reaching American soil.

The strain in US-Pakistan relations reflects a broader geopolitical realignment in South Asia. Pakistan continues to cultivate strong ties with China while voicing concerns about US defense cooperation with India, including technology transfers and joint missile projects.

The big picture

Sanctions imposed:

The US has sanctioned Pakistan’s National Development Complex over proliferation-related concerns tied to ballistic missile development.This is a big deal; unlike recent rounds of US sanctions, this targets a government entity instead of just companies. Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center’s South Asia Institute

Zoom in: Eroding US-Pakistan ties

The tensions over Pakistan’s missile program reflect a larger deterioration in the once-robust US-Pakistan partnership.

Historical context: Pakistan was a key ally during the Cold War and a central partner in the US-led war on terror, particularly after the 9/11 attacks. However, relations have soured over the years due to Pakistan’s alleged support for Taliban factions and its increasingly close ties with China.

India factor: The US-India defense relationship has grown stronger in recent years, underpinned by agreements like the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) and the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA). Washington has facilitated India’s acquisition of advanced missile systems, which has drawn criticism from Islamabad for allegedly undermining regional stability.

What it means for India

Accelerating India's missile programs:

India’s strategic reassessment:

Proxy conflicts:

Nuclear security risks:

Strengthening India-US ties

What’s next

The US administration is expected to maintain pressure on Pakistan through diplomatic channels and additional sanctions, while continuing to bolster ties with India.

The US appears to view Pakistan’s missile development as a broader shift in its strategic posture. Finer emphasized that Pakistan’s actions raise “real questions” about its intentions, particularly given its long-standing partnership with the US in security and counterterrorism.

Washington is also likely to encourage other countries to scrutinize Pakistan’s missile program as part of broader non-proliferation efforts.

Pakistan, however, is expected to deepen its reliance on China, which has historically supported its missile program and nuclear ambitions.

The United States has expressed alarm over Pakistan’s ongoing development of long-range ballistic missiles, a move Washington sees as an emerging security threat.Meanwhile, Washington’s public condemnation of Pakistan’s missile program could fuel further regional instability.The US State Department sanctioned Pakistan’s NDC for its involvement in developing long-range missile systems. This marks the first time a Pakistani state-owned enterprise has faced direct sanctions tied to missile production. Three Karachi-based companies—Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise—were also sanctioned for supporting the program.Islamabad has dismissed the US sanctions as “discriminatory” and warned that such actions could upset the region’s strategic balance. Its Foreign Office defended the missile program as “defensive in nature,” aimed solely at countering Indian aggression and preserving peace in South Asia.Pakistani officials argue that their missile program is not intended to target the US. Diplomatic sources in Islamabad insist the program is designed to counter perceived threats from India, with whom Pakistan has fought three wars since 1947, a Reuters report said.In a strongly worded statement, the Pakistani Foreign Office accused the US of “double standards.” It criticized Washington for imposing sanctions on Pakistani entities while granting India waivers for advanced military technology. “Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,” the statement read.Pakistan's development of long-range missiles may prompt India to fast-track its missile initiatives, particularly the Agni series, and enhance its Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) systems.Pakistan’s expanded missile range could push India to reevaluate its nuclear policies, potentially reconsidering its no-first-use stance or enhancing second-strike capabilities.Pakistan’s growing confidence, potentially bolstered by Chinese support, might lead to more aggressive postures, including cross-border skirmishes.The growing political instability in Pakistan increases the risk of its nuclear assets falling into the hands of radical groups, posing a significant threat to India and the world.: Pakistan's missile advancements could lead to closer India-US defense cooperation, including technology transfers and intelligence sharing.(With inputs from agencies)","US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer described Pakistan's missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country's strategic posture.
