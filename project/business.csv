"Pant Varsity develops way to use pine leaves to boost rural economy, reduce forest fires",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pant-varsity-develops-way-to-use-pine-leaves-to-boost-rural-economy-reduce-forest-fires/articleshow/110317446.cms,"Rudrapur:

Researchers at GB Pant Agriculture and Technology University in Pantnagar, Udham Singh Nagar, have discovered a method to convert pine leaves (pirul), the primary cause of forest fires, into valuable bio-grease and bio-resin . The research promises to prevent forest fires and enhance the local economy.Tarannum Jahan, under the mentorship of Prof T K Bhattacharya and Prof A K Verma from the biochemistry department of the College of Sciences and Humanities, led the research.""The bio-grease we developed reduces friction in ball bearings and prevents rust, while the bio-resin is highly effective for glueing plywood,"" said Verma.The technology, developed under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)- All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP)- Energy in Agriculture & Agro-based Industries (EAAI) project, has been patented and sold to Green Molecules, a Gujarat-based company. ""This initiative will not only increase the value of pine leaves but also provide villagers with a new source of income, thereby mitigating forest fires,"" said A S Nain, director of research.Nain added, ""Uttarakhand generates approximately 2 million tonnes of pirul annually. The increase in its market value due to this research will significantly benefit local villagers financially. The methods involve producing bio-resin by mixing pyrolysis oil with phenyl, formaldehyde, and caustic soda at specific temperatures. Bio-grease is created by combining caustic soda and animal fat with pyrolysis oil, and then cooling the mixture to form a lubricant"".For her contribution, Jahan received the ‘Young Woman Scientist Excellence’ Award from Uttarakhand Governor Lt Gen (retd) Gurmit Singh.Anil Hafeez, an agricultural scientist, said ""This innovation is a game-changer for forest conservation and rural economies. It leverages a previously hazardous material to create sustainable products, providing dual benefits of environmental protection and economic growth.”","Researchers at GB Pant Agriculture and Technology University in Pantnagar, Udham Singh Nagar, have discovered a method to convert pine leaves into valuable bio- grease and bio-resin.

We can confirm that there are injuries and one fatality on board the Boeing 777-300ER. There were a total of 211 passengers and 18 crew on board.”“Singapore Airlines offers its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. Our priority is to provide all possible assistance to all passengers and crew on board the aircraft. We are working with the local authorities in Thailand to provide the necessary medical assistance, and sending a team to Bangkok to provide any additional assistance needed,” the statement added.The flight had taken off from Heathrow at 10.38 pm on May 21. It encountered severe turbulence, possibly near in the airspace of Myanmar or Thailand. According to website Skybrary, severe turbulence “is characterised by large, abrupt changes in attitude and altitude with large variations in airspeed. There may be brief periods where effective control of the aircraft is impossible. Loose objects may move around the cabin and damage to aircraft structures may occur.”The pilots then decided to divert to Bangkok. Thai authorities kept emergency personnel and ambulances ready.Passengers are advised to keep their seat belts on during flights as an aircraft can fly into turbulence at any time.About two years back, a SpiceJet Mumbai-Durgapur flight encountered severe turbulence during descent at the destination that saw 14 passengers and three crew members getting injured. One of these passengers succumbed to his injuries two months after the incident.","A passenger died and many were injured when a Singapore Airlines’ Boeing 777 headed from London to Singapore encountered “severe turbulence” enroute.

But on Tuesday this happened on an IndiGo aircraft with a person not getting a seat on the full flight and then having to stand at the rear of the plane.

Sources say one confirm passenger was late and then deemed as no show (someone who does not turn up for flight). So the employee — standby passenger — boarded the aircraft. But the passenger running late also turned up and took his seat, leaving no seat for the standby.Regulatory agencies, DGCA and BCAS, are probing this lapse. They are examining how did the standby passenger board the aircraft. It is learnt the standby passenger did not have any check-in baggage and was to travel only with a cabin bag.IndiGo said in a statement: ""There was an error during the passenger boarding process of 6E 6543 from Mumbai to Varanasi, wherein a standby passenger was allotted a seat reserved for a confirmed passenger.

Mid-air turbulence turns fatal: How climate change is impacting your flight journey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mid-air-turbulence-turns-fatal-how-climate-change-is-impacting-your-flight-journey/articleshow/110309146.cms,"Hazardous clear air turbulence

How hot weather impacts aircraft engine performance

NEW DELHI: Turbulence is one of the uncertain factors a flyer may encounter when travelling on a plane . While these inconvenient shake-ups are rarely fatal, they quite certainly can inflict unwarranted injuries .The rarest mishap occurred on Tuesday when a passenger died after Singapore Airlines ’ Boeing 777 encountered ""severe turbulence"". The flight was heading from London to Singapore but later diverted to Bangkok.The incident, in which many passengers were injured, has thrown up multiple questions, with climate change impact being one of them.Experts say global warming may increase instances of clear air turbulence by upto 200% by 2050. In India, the increase in flight turbulence could be felt during the pre-monsoon season.Paul D Williams, a professor of Atmospheric Science at the University of Reading, UK says research has shown that severe clear-air turbulence, which is strong enough to catapult unbuckled passengers and crew around the aircraft, could become twice or even three times as common on some flight routes later this century.Paul shares, ""We’ve recently extended our analysis globally and that includes Indian airspace. We found that there will be significant increases in clear air turbulence over India within the next few decades. The projected increases are strongest in the northern half of India and are especially strong in the pre-monsoon season, in other words from March to May, when we estimate that there will be 100-200% more clear air turbulence by the period 2050-2080.""Paul explains that clear air turbulence is particularly hazardous to aircraft because it is invisible to both radar and satellites ""and also because it cannot be seen by pilots from the cockpit either"".“Clear air turbulence is caused by instabilities in the atmosphere, mainly in the jet stream and especially when wind shear is strong. Now, climate change is strengthening the wind shear. We know that the jet stream over the North Atlantic Ocean, for example, is already 15% more sheared than when the satellites began observing in the late 1970s,"" said Paul Williams.""Our studies have used climate models to show that this effect will increase the amount of severe clear air turbulence in the atmosphere by hundreds of per cent in the next few decades. And that’s just clear air turbulence. We need a lot more research before we understand whether and how the other kinds of turbulence due to storms and cumulonimbus clouds are also being modified by climate change,” says the professor,"" he added.Flying becomes a little turbulent with the mercury level going over 40°C. The high surface temperature coupled with the presence of hills nearby triggers a sudden change in the direction of wind close to the ground, and crosswinds make it difficult for pilots to keep planes stable when gliding down to land. Climbing for a takeoff is a challenge because the air is thinner. The lift of the plane caused by its aerodynamic body is reduced.Pilots, however, are trained for these very changes and keep a watch for turbulence, wind shear and birds as they come in to land on the main runway. “The turbulence can be experienced up to 10,000 feet. Planes start to waver when descending towards the airport. Often, the approach starts quite far from the city so that glide is smooth and the plane can do a go-round in case the cross wind is too strong,” said a pilot.Safety is given priority over inflight service. “The seat belt sign may remain on throughout the trip or soon after the plane starts its descent from cruising altitude. This is to prevent passengers from walking around, as turbulence can strike anytime,” he added.While planes are inspected for potential snags due to overheating, pilots take a few precautions. “In Chennai, we prefer the main run way because we get the maximum length for landing. It does not mean we insist on using it because the second runway is also safe to land. But if the main runway is available, it is preferred,” said another pilot.Airlines try to reduce cargo load to take more fuel, especially if headed to an airport with a short runway like in Trichy. This is to ensure there is enough fuel for a go-round or diversion to another airport.","Experts say global warming may increase instances of clear air turbulence by upto 200% by 2050.

"With junk food now officially defined, FSSAI has no reason not to regulate them",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-junk-food-now-officially-defined-fssai-has-no-reason-not-to-regulate-them/articleshow/110305223.cms,"NEW DELHI: With the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) releasing new Dietary Guidelines for Indians, FSSAI ’s plea that it is hampered in regulating ultra-processed food (UPF) and foods high in fat, sugars and salt (HFSS) because the terms “have not been defined” may no longer be valid. The guidelines released last week have detailed definitions of UPF and HFSS foods put together by a scientific body.The guidelines also spell out the harm caused by consumption of UPF. “Lack of fibre and poor micronutrients makes them unhealthy. Also, UPFs contribute to high calorie (energy) intake as they are often high in fat. UPFs are consumed in larger quantities by a large population since these have unique taste, high palatability and low cost as well as are easily available even in remote areas. …UPF consumption is associated with overweight/obesity and higher risks of coronary heart disease (heart attack), cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) and diabetes. UPFs also hasten the process of ageing,” stated the guidelines.On February 5, Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest-India (NAPi), a national think tank on nutrition consisting of independent experts in epidemiology, nutrition, and paediatrics, wrote to the health ministry seeking regulations for labelling and marketing of UPF and HFSS foods “to halt their rising consumption”. Responding to the letter on April 15, FSSAI stated that “it is informed that the terms ultra-processed food and junk foods have not been defined in any of the Food Safety and Standards Regulations” and that comments and suggestions received from stakeholders on the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling & Display) Amendment Regulations, 2022 notified by the FSSAI “are under examination”.It included a list of initiatives taken by FSSAI to reduce consumption of UPFs such as Eat Right India, the social media campaign “Aaj se thoda kam” urging dietary modifications to reduce diet-related non-communicable diseases and a ban on sale/marketing of HFSS foods in schools or in areas within 50 metres from the school gate in any direction.“Why does it take FSSAI so long to examine the comments given in 2022? It has been working on regulation of front-of-pack labeling for a decade now,” said Dr Arun Gupta of NAPi. Front-of-pack labelling was proposed in 2014 by an expert committee constituted by the FSSAI on the order of the Delhi High Court on a public interest petition seeking labelling and a ban on sale of junk food in schools.On May 10, NAPi wrote to the health ministry urging the use of the NIN dietary guidelines, which are “science-based practicable guidelines”, “for developing regulations that could meaningfully prohibit advertising of HFSS and UPFs”. The guidelines also provide guidance on which food products could be regulated for front-of-pack labelling and prohibition of advertisements, stated the letter.","The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) released new Dietary Guidelines for Indians last week.

Theatre commands will bolster military preparedness and war-fighting: CDS,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/theatre-commands-will-bolster-military-preparedness-and-war-fighting-cds/articleshow/110306950.cms,"NEW DELHI: The impending creation of integrated theatre commands will lay the foundation for catapulting the armed forces into the next orbit of military preparedness and war-fighting, while also setting the stage for the next generation of reforms, chief of defence staff General Anil Chauhan said on Tuesday.The Army, Navy and IAF must also create a `joint culture’ as they move towards forming the integrated operational structures.“Jointness and integration are prerequisites for the creation of functional integrated theatre commands (ITCs),” Gen Chauhan said, delivering the Maj Gen Samir Sinha memorial lecture here.The comments come soon after the government notified and enforced from May 10 onwards the Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, which will pave the way for the long-pending ITCs in the most radical military reorganization envisaged since Independence, as was reported by TOI.“The creation of ITCs will separate the ‘operational’ functions from the `raise-train-sustain’ (RTS) and other administrative functions. They will allow greater focus of the operational (ITC) commanders to matters of security,” Gen Chauhan said.The plan is to set up two “adversary-specific” ITCs for the borders with China and Pakistan, and a maritime one for the Indian Ocean Region and the larger Indo-Pacific. At present, India has 17 single-service commands, with the Army and IAF having seven each and the Navy three.“The theatre commands will not be the end-state, but only the beginning of the next set of reforms,” the CDS said. These reforms will include moving from single to multi-domain operations and network-centric to data-centric operations as well as fusing space and cyberspace into the traditional domains of land, air and sea, among others.As for the ‘ joint culture ’, Gen Chauhan said the three services must now move towards `Jointness 2.0’ after more or less achieving ‘Jointness 1.0’, which was about creating better trust, bonhomie and consensus among them.“The joint culture, though different from service-specific culture, needs to respect the uniqueness of each service. We must be able to distil the best of each service, and incorporate the highest common factor, rather than settle for the least common denominator,” he said.","The Army, Navy and IAF must also create a `joint culture’ as they move towards forming the integrated operational structures.

NEW DELHI: Making an exception to the norm that children in conflict with law should be granted bail irrespective of the crime's seriousness, Supreme Court denied bail to a Uttarakhand school student accused of circulating obscene videos of his classmate, a 14-year-old girl , which allegedly drove her to suicide.On Jan 10 this year, Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), Haridwar, had rejected the bail plea of the 'child in conflict with law', who had been booked under Sections 305 and 509 of IPC and Sections 13 and 14 of Pocso Act.After JJB's decision was upheld by Uttarakhand high court, the boy through his mother moved Supreme Court seeking bail.Senior advocate Lok Pal Singh argued that his parents were ready to take care of him. The child should not be kept in a reform home and his custody given to his mother, Singh appealed.But the apex court bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and Pankaj Mithal on Monday examined the HC judgement and said it was right in declining bail to the juvenile.While dismissing the boy's appeal, the SC bench said, ""After carefully perusing the material placed on record, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order passed by the high court at this stage.""The girl had gone missing from her residence on Oct 22 last year and her body was recovered later.The girls’s father lodged a police complaint alleging that the boy had shot obscene videos of her and circulated the clips among students. Fearing ignominy, she took her own life, the father said.Justice Ravindra Maithani of Uttarakhand HC on April 1 had given a reasoned order declining bail to the juvenile. He said, “For a child in conflict with law (CIL), every offence is bailable and such CIL is entitled to bail irrespective of the offence being classified as bailable or non-bailable.”However, he added, “Bail may be denied if there are reasonable grounds for believing that his release is likely to bring the ‘child in conflict with law’ into the association of any known criminal, expose him to moral, physical, or psychological danger, or if his release would defeat the ends of justice.”Perusing the social investigation report about the juvenile in the case in hand, HC said he is an undisciplined child keeping bad company and that he required strict disciplining. The report also stated that on release, there could be further untoward incidents involving him.“Having considered the social investigation report, the medical examination report, the report from the school, this court is of the view that the best interest of the child would be served if he is not granted bail. If he is released on bail, it would definitely defeat the ends of justice,” Justice Maithani had said while rejecting his bail.","Supreme Court denied bail to a Uttarakhand school student accused of circulating obscene videos of his classmate.

It says, only if the parents, guardians or owners can prove that the offence was committed without their knowledge or that they exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence, they may not be held responsible.However, it will be for them to prove this as the law mentions that the court hearing such cases shall presume that the use of the vehicle by a juvenile was with the consent of the guardian or the owner.

Besides, sections 119 (duty to obey traffic signs) and 184 (driving dangerously) of the Motor Vehicles Act were also slapped.In case the court replaces Section 304-A with Section 304, the maximum punishment, in the event of a conviction, can be up to 10 years instead of two years as provided under Section 304-A. Sections 337 and 338 IPC also carry a maximum punishment of two years.If the teenager is tried as a minor, then he can get away with a lesser sentence. If the sessions court clears the teenager’s trial as a major, then in case of a conviction, he can face a full term of punishment. While the police await the court’s nod, the teenager till then will face trial before the juvenile justice board after the police’s chargesheet post-investigation.The builder’s lawyer, Prashant Patil, told TOI, “If the police have submitted any application in the court seeking changes in the IPC sections, we have not received any correspondence from the court. We can comment on this after receiving the communication.”The police commissioner said, “We have collected enough evidence in the form of CCTV footage from the two pubs the teeenager visited by along with his four friends and the route he took from Mundhwa to reach the accident site, etc. The boy is seen drinking in the CCTV footage. We have now decided to invoke charges of drunk driving against him. The boy and his friends went to the first pub at 10.40pm and were served liquor there. However, they stepped out at 12.10am after the pub refused to serve liquor. They moved to the other nearby pub where they were upto 2am before starting for their home.”Regarding the outcome of the boy’s blood sample tests, Kumar said, “Two separate tests were conducted — one on personal appearance, smell and walking and the other on blood sample. The blood sample tests are being conducted at two different facilities to ensure that there is no scope for managing any of these test reports. We are awaiting the blood sample test report before we make any further comment.”A senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, told TOI, “The personal appearance test was conducted about eight hours after the accident and it came out negative.”Asked about allegations of preferential treatment to the boy at the police station, Kumar said, “I am personally studying the CCTV footage of the police station. If any preferential treatment has been given to the boy, I will suspend the entire staff of the police station.”","A panchnama of the Porsche Taycan revealed that the car was being driven at a speed of 160kmph when it hit the motorcycle that resulted in the two deaths.

"No trials, Olympic quota-winning wrestlers to compete in Paris",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/wrestling/no-trials-olympic-quota-winning-wrestlers-to-compete-in-paris/articleshow/110311277.cms,"NEW DELHI: There will be no selection trials for all six Olympic quota-winning wrestlers as the sport's national federation ( WFI ) on Tuesday announced that all of them will represent the country at the Paris Games. However, they will be subjected to assessment at a 11-day-long training camp in Hungary, beginning June 10.The decision was taken at WFI's selection committee meeting here after considering the requests received from quota-winning wrestlers that holding the trials could lead to injuries.It means that Aman Sehrawat will be India's choice in the men's freestyle 57kg division, while Vinesh Phogat (50kg), Antim Panghal (53kg), Anshu Malik (57kg), Nisha Dahiya (68kg) and Reetika Hooda (76kg) will represent the country at the Games in the women's category. The wrestling competition in Paris will be held from August 5-11.The development has also spelt an end to the challenge of wrestlers including Ravi Dahiya (men's 57kg), Shivani Pawar (women's 50kg), Ankush (50kg), Pooja (53kg), Sarita Mor (57kg), Mansi Ahlawat (57kg) and Kiran (76kg), among others, who all were training in anticipation of a trial with the quota winners.The decision also means that Vinesh will now compete in the women's 50kg event only. If the trials had happened, she would have had the chance to challenge Antim for a spot in the 53kg division.During the time of Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh as WFI's president, the federation had a policy to hold trials to select the wrestling contingent. The policy had come into effect in 2021. But, with several of the existing quota winners sending written requests to the WFI's current president Sanjay Singh that holding the trials at this juncture may lead to injuries before the Games, the selection committee decided to do away with the process this time since making the weight would also pose a major problem for the wrestlers.Singh, however, made one thing clear to the Paris-bound wrestlers. ""The chief national coaches will be assessing them over the course of a ranking series tournament in Budapest, scheduled between June 6-9 and later at a 10-day training camp in the Hungarian capital, to be held from June 10-21. If we find any wrestler lacking in fitness or is injured, we can still go ahead with trials in that particular weight category to pick the best athlete to represent the country at the Games. The last date to send entries to the Paris Games organisers is July 8. We want to ensure that the best wrestlers go to Paris,"" Singh said.""Also, this is a one-off thing (to not hold trials). It's been done for the benefit of our wrestlers and to maximise the country's medal chances at the Olympics. In future, we may revert to the old system of holding trials,"" he added.","There will be no selection trials for all six Olympic quota-winning wrestlers.

British MPs demand action taken over blatant evasion of sanctions on Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/british-mps-demand-action-taken-over-blatant-evasion-of-sanctions-on-russia/articleshow/110312243.cms,"LONDON: British MPs have called on govt to take action over blatant evasion of sanctions on Russia by companies in Europe.UK purchases of fuel from China, India and Turkey — much of which originates from Russian oil — have shot up since the sanctions regime began. From 2021 to 2023, purchases from India went up from £402 million (about Rs 4,255 crore) to £1.5 billion (Rs 15,875 crore), those from China rose from £30 million (Rs 317 crore) to £663 million (Rs 7,016 crore), and those from Turkey from £1.8 million (Rs 19 crore) to £60 million (Rs 634 crore).“How do the govt explain that loophole,” SNP MP Dave Doogan asked in the House of Commons during a debate on Ukraine on Monday.“Russian oil products are getting through to the UK despite the UK officially banning the import of Russian oil from Dec 1, 2022. A loophole in the legislation allows Russian oil to continue to flow into the UK, provided that it has been refined into fuel in a third country. What do the govt say to UK taxpayers, who are funding billions in military aid to Ukraine so that it can defend itself from a Russian aggression that is, if we follow the money, part-funded by UK purchases of fuel refined from Russian oil,” he asked.UK businesses are seeing record growth in exports to Russia’s former Soviet state neighbours too. That manifold spike coincides precisely with the introduction of sanctions on goods to Russia, he pointed out.“Against the backdrop of a 1,860% increase in the export of UK-manufactured vehicles to Azerbaijan, is anybody in the govt really under any illusions about what is happening there,” Doogan said.North Durham Labour MP Kevan Jones added exports from Europe through Turkey, Azerbaijan and China, are clearly not end-user destinations, and are being moved to Russia.Deputy foreign secretary Andrew Mitchell said: “We are bearing down on the circumvention of sanctions and this was a major focus during the foreign secretary’s recent visit to Central Asia. We are adopting new measures to target the shadow fleet that transports Russian oil.”","UK purchases of fuel from China, India and Turkey have shot up since the sanctions regime began.

"Brandon bids goodbye to FC Goa, signs four-year contract with Mumbai City",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/brandon-bids-goodbye-to-fc-goa/articleshow/110312484.cms,"Club Captain Inks Long-Term Contract With Mumbai City After Seven Years In Goa

Panaji:

After seven years and over 100 appearances in the Indian Super League ( ISL ) with FC Goa , club captain Brandon Fernandes is returning to Mumbai City.One of the state’s most popular footballer, Brandon joined Goa in 2017, after two short ISL seasons with Mumbai. Since then, he has played an influential role, captaining the team for the last two seasons under coaches Carlos Pena and Manolo Marquez .Now, the attacking midfielder has made a move to Mumbai, agreeing a four-year contract.“Brandon is Goa’s icon and his absence will be felt by the club, particularly since he has been here for seven years,” a source told TOI. “The club was keen on renewing, had started talks too, but could not agree on the numbers. So, when Mumbai came calling with a very good offer, it was hard to turn it down.”According to sources, Brandon, 29, agreed terms with Mumbai a few months ago while his performances for Goa, particularly towards the business end of the ISL, made the club rethink. At the end of the season, club officials reached out to the player again in the hope of making him change his mind. But while Brandon did explain his predicament to Mumbai, the ISL winners were understandably unwilling to let him go. “It was too late,” said another source.“Brandon wished that things were different because he wanted to extend his stay with Goa, but the circumstances did not allow this to happen. It’s a tough decision for him,” said another source close to the player.According to Goa sources, they had no doubt about Brandon’s usefulness to the team but could not agree terms. “There was lack of clarity about the financial situation. When Brandon signed at Mumbai, the new player guidelines were not clear. It was only last week that ISL organisers informally intimated clubs that the salary cap would be increased, and two players allowed to be signed outside the salary cap,” said the official.Brandon has made over 100 appearances for Goa in the ISL and has three goals to his name from this season, his first one particularly emotional as he put on the club jersey with Dada in front, a tribute to his father, Jaju Fernandes, who passed away last year.This season he was particularly effective with the ball at his feet, creating over 60 chances, the highest in the league, even ahead of influential foreign players like Madih Talal (Punjab FC) and Dimitri Petratos (Mohun Bagan).“Since 2017, it has been an incredible journey for me,” Brandon told reporters prior to the semifinal clash at home against Mumbai. “Being the captain, playing for the home team is a privilege. For me, it has always been about playing and giving my best.”","FC Goa captain Brandon Fernandes signs four-year contract with Mumbai City.

Trafficked Telugu youngsters revolt in Cambodia days after Vizag police busts human trafficking racket,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/visakhapatnam/trafficked-telugu-youngsters-revolt-in-cambodia-days-after-vizag-police-busts-human-trafficking-racket/articleshow/110310181.cms,"VISAKHAPATNAM: Days after the Vizag city police busted a human trafficking racket being operated by some Indian agents from Cambodia, hundreds of youngsters from Vizag other parts Andhra Pradesh and India who were struck in Cambodia and were forced to operate cyber-frauds schemes, revolted against their handlers in Cambodia. The protest had led to the arrest of the youngsters in the foreign country.Vizag city police chief Dr A Ravi Shankar said that the trafficked Indians caused large scale riots in Jinbei and Compound, Sihanoukvile in Cambodia, which is allegedly a hub for cyber-crime.“Trafficked youngsters from Cambodia called up Vizag city police WhatsApp numbers and sent videos. Yesterday (Monday), around 300 Indians revolted on a large scale against their handlers in Cambodia,” said Ravi Shankar.It may be recalled that Vizag city police have unearthed a human trafficking racket being operated by some Indian agents from Cambodia and arrested three local agents_ Chukka Rajesh, Sabbavarapu Kondalarao and Mannena Gnaneshwar from Vizag city. The preliminary investigation has revealed that the gang has lured the gullible unemployed youngsters by promising to provide data entry operator jobs in Cambodia but were being forced there to commit cybercrimes in India.These gullible youth are trained to handle specialized cybercrimes such as FedEx Scams, Stock Market Frauds, task game frauds, and various other types of cyber frauds on Indian citizens.Speaking to TOI, Inspector of cybercrimes police station, Vizag, K Bhavani Prasad said “hundreds of youngsters from Vizag city and other parts of Andhra Pradesh have fallen prey to the agents and are stuck in Cambodia. The number of victims from Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal could go up to 5,000,”, he added.In a bold move, the victims from Vizag and other parts of the country staged a walkout from their Cambodian offices and openly protested the fraudulent companies that had ensnared them. The protesters demanded the return of their passports, which had been confiscated by their employers, to facilitate their safe passage back to India. The youngsters, determined to break free from the clutches of the scam, stood united in their cause, refusing to continue participating in the illegal activities they had been forced into, added Bhavani Prasad.Once in Cambodia, the youths would be held captive, tortured and compelled by Chinese handlers to execute scams such as task game fraud, stock market fraud and others, police said.The police chief said that they have contacted the Bureau of Immigration and Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and related departments to repatriate the youth safely as most of them have been lodged in a jail after Monday's 'revolt. Seven special teams have been formed to unearth the whole gamut of human trafficking into cyber crime headed by Dr Fakkeerappa Kaginelli Joint Commissioner of Police, Visakhapatnam city and assisted by K.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Deforestation exacerbated deadly Brazil floods: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/deforestation-exacerbated-deadly-brazil-floods-experts/articleshow/110317946.cms,"PORTO ALEGRE: The floods devastating southern Brazil have been exacerbated by deforestation , much of it driven by soybean farming , according to experts, who urge the country to restore its forests and their vast water-retaining root systems.The key agricultural state of Rio Grande do Sul has been hit by an unprecedented climate disaster for the past three weeks, with cities and rural areas alike inundated by torrential rains that have left more than 150 people dead and some 100 missing.It is the region's fourth extreme weather event in less than a year, a phenomenon scientists say is driven by climate change -- and also deforestation.""There's a global component to climate change, and also a regional one, which is the loss of native vegetation. That increased the intensity of the floods,"" says biologist Eduardo Velez of MapBiomas, an organization that uses satellite images to track deforestation.According to the group, Rio Grande do Sul lost 22 percent of its native vegetation, or 3.6 million hectares (8.9 million acres), from 1985 to 2022.Those wildlands have largely been replaced by fields of rice, eucalyptus and especially soybeans, of which Brazil is the world's biggest producer and exporter.- Vicious cycle -Native forests help ensure water permeates the soil, preventing it from accumulating on the surface, says Jaqueline Sordi, a biologist and journalist based in the region who specializes in climate issues.Vegetation also holds soil in place, helping to prevent erosion and landslides.The deep brown color of the water that has flooded the state capital, Porto Alegre, along with 90 percent of Rio Grande do Sul's towns, ""shows just how many tons and tons of soil were washed away"" in the rains, Velez told AFP.In a vicious cycle, that mud has now accumulated in the beds of rivers, making them shallower -- and therefore more likely to flood next time.""Beyond relocating people (from high-risk areas) and rebuilding infrastructure, it's extremely important to have policies on restoring native vegetation,"" said Velez.Rio Grande do Sul ""urgently"" needs to restore more than a million hectares of forests in order for them to adequately perform their proper environmental role, according to a 2023 study by the sustainable development group Instituto Escolhas.But Velez says there is still no ""heavyweight"" plan to do that in Rio Grande do Sul, despite a deal it signed last year with other states in southern and southeastern Brazil to reforest 90,000 hectares by 2026.- 'Open people's eyes' -At the national level, deforestation surged under the government of far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, a climate-change skeptic and ally of the powerful agribusiness sector who was in office from 2019 to 2022.""It became easier to get permits (to clear vegetation), and Rio Grande do Sul played a big role"" in benefitting from those permits, said Sordi.A local municipal council member from Bolsonaro's Liberal Party, Sandro Fantinel, caused controversy last week by saying the region should clear more trees around roads, arguing their weight and water-swollen roots had caused landslides during the floods.Sordi says disasters like the current one have the potential to ""open people's eyes"" to the scientific evidence of climate change and its ""warning signs.""""Sometimes we only pay attention when the problem arrives.""","Rio Grande do Sul has been hit by an unprecedented climate disaster for the past three weeks.

It's so hot in Mexico that howler monkeys are falling dead from the trees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/its-so-hot-in-mexico-that-howler-monkeys-are-falling-dead-from-the-trees/articleshow/110317552.cms,"MEXICO CITY: It's so hot in Mexico that howler monkeys are falling dead from the trees.At least 83 of the midsize primates, who are known for their roaring vocal calls, were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco . Others were rescued by residents, including five that were rushed to a local veterinarian who battled to save them.""They arrived in critical condition, with dehydration and fever,"" said Dr Sergio Valenzuela.""They were as limp as rags. It was heatstroke.""While Mexico's brutal heatwave has been linked to the deaths of at least 26 people since March, veterinarians and rescuers say it has killed dozens and perhaps hundreds of howler monkeys.In the town of Tecolutilla, Tabasco, the dead monkeys started appearing on Friday, when a local volunteer fire-and-rescue squad showed up with five of the creatures in the bed of the truck.Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and can be around 2 feet (60 centimeters) tall, with tails as long again. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly, their lion-like roars, which bely their size, are what they're known for.""They (the volunteers) asked for help, they asked if I could examine some of the animals they had in their truck,"" Valenzuela said Monday. ""They said they didn't have any money, and asked if I could do it for free.""The veterinarian put ice on their limp little hands and feet, and hook them up to IV drips with electrolytes.So far, the monkeys appear to be on the mend. Once listless and easily handled, they are now in cages at Valenzuela's office. ""They're recovering. They're aggressive ... they're biting again,"" he said, noting that's a healthy sign for the usually furtive creatures.Most aren't so lucky. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo counted about 83 of the animals dead or dying on the ground under trees. The die-off started around May 5 and hit its peak over the weekend.""They were falling out of the trees like apples,"" Pozo said. ""They were in a state of severe dehydration, and they died within a matter of minutes."" Already weakened, Pozo says the falls from dozens of yards (meters) up inflict additional damage that often finishes the monkeys off.Pozo attributes the deaths to a ""synergy"" of factors, including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat.For people in the steamy, swampy, jungle-covered state of Tabasco, the howler monkey is a cherished, emblematic species; local people say the monkeys tell them the time of day, by howling at dawn and dusk.Pozo said the local people - who he knows through his work with the Biodiversity Conservation of The Usumacinta group - have tried to help the monkeys they see around their farms. But he notes that could be a double-edged sword.""They were falling out of the trees, and the people were moved, and they went to help the animals, they set out water and fruit for them,"" Pozo said. ""They want to care for them, mainly the baby monkeys, adopt them.""""But no, the truth is that babies are very delicate, they can't be in a house where there are dogs or cats, because they have pathogens that can potentially be fatal for howler monkeys,"" he said, stressing they must be rehabilitated and released into the wild.Pozo's group has set up a special recovery stations for monkeys - it currently holds five monkeys, but birds and reptiles have also been affected - and is trying to organize a team of specialized veterinarians to give the primates the care they need.Belatedly, the federal government acknowledged the problem Monday, with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador saying he had heard about it on social media. He congratulated Valenzuela on his efforts and said the government would seek to support the work.Lopez Obrador acknowledged the heat problem - ""I have never felt it as bad as this"" - but he has a lot of human problems to deal with as well.By May 9 at least nine cities in Mexico had set temperature records, with Ciudad Victoria, in the border state of Tamaulipas, clocking a broiling 117 F (47 C).With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up, water supplies are running out and authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.Consumers are feeling the heat as well. On Monday, the nationwide chain of OXXO convenience stores - the nation's largest - said it was limiting purchases of ice to just two or three bags per customer in some places.""In a period of high temperatures, OXXO is taking measures to ensure supplies of products for our customers,"" parent company FEMSA said in a statement. ""Limits on the sale of bagged ice seek to ensure that a larger number of customers can buy this product.""But for the monkeys, it's not a question of comfort, but of life or death.""This is a sentinel species,"" Pozo said, referring to the canary-in-a-coal mine effect where one species can say a lot about an ecosystem. ""It is telling us something about what is happening with climate change.""","At least 83 of the midsize primates were found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco.

Donald Trump opts not to testify as defense rests in hush-money trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-opts-not-to-testify-as-defense-rests-in-hush-money-trial/articleshow/110317107.cms,"NEW DELHI: The defense rested their case in Donald Trump ’s criminal trial on Tuesday, without calling the former president to testify.Despite Trump’s earlier complaints about being silenced and his false claims that he was not permitted to testify, he ultimately chose not to take the stand in his own defense.Trump’s decision to refrain from testifying came without fanfare.While not surprising, as defendants in criminal cases often opt not to testify to avoid potentially harming their defense during cross-examination, it followed several instances of Trump claiming he was prohibited from doing so.Judge Juan Merchan addressed Trump's claims directly, emphasizing, “I want to stress, Mr Trump, that you have an absolute right to testify at trial.” He also clarified that the gag order preventing Trump from verbally attacking witnesses did not impact his right to take the stand.After the defense rested, Judge Merchan instructed jurors to return on Tuesday, May 28, for closing arguments. He also mentioned that he would provide instructions to the jurors the following day and anticipated that deliberations would commence thereafter.The trial resumed on Monday with the continued cross-examination of Robert Costello, who the defense has relied on to challenge the credibility of Michael Cohen, the former president’s one-time fixer.Trump arrived in the courtroom just before 9:30 am. The former president, widely expected to be the Republican presidential nominee, faces charges of falsifying business records concerning the payment of $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep silent about an alleged sexual encounter.Manhattan prosecutors assert that in the summer of 2015, Trump collaborated with his then-consigliere Michael Cohen and former tabloid executive David Pecker to conceal any damaging information, aiming to safeguard his candidacy in the 2016 election.Cohen informed jurors that he coordinated the payment to Daniels weeks before Election Day and personally covered the cost. He testified that the campaign was deeply worried that Daniels's story could severely damage Trump's chances in the presidential race, especially following the emergence of a highly embarrassing hot mic recording where Trump boasted about non-consensual groping.During his four-day testimony, Cohen recounted a moment when a furious Trump directed him to silence Daniels's story, instructing him to ""just take care of it.""“This was a disaster, a fucking disaster,” Cohen recalled Trump saying. “Women will hate me.”Cohen also revealed to the jury that he had worked to keep Daniels's story under wraps back in 2011, collaborating with her then-lawyer to remove a piece about their alleged encounter from a gossip website.During cross-examination, Trump's legal team struggled to land significant blows. The closest they came was when Blanche managed to get Cohen to effectively admit to over-billing the Trump Organization for reimbursement for a payment made to a tech company called Red Finch, aimed at skewing a poll about famous business figures in favor of Donald Trump.Cohen acknowledged paying the tech company $50,000 but revealed the actual payment was $20,000. Blanche questioned whether Cohen had pocketed the $30,000 difference. “So you stole from the Trump Organization?” Blanche asked. “Yes, sir,” Cohen replied.On Monday, the prosecution concluded its case, and Trump’s defense began theirs. The day concluded with testimony from Costello, a lawyer Cohen had mentioned during his four days on the stand. Cohen stated that he met with Costello after law enforcement raided his hotel room and home in April 2018 but was hesitant about retaining him as legal representation due to his association with Rudy Giuliani.","The defense rested their case in Donald Trump ’s criminal trial on Tuesday, without calling the former president to testify.

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Twenty-one sailors aboard the Dali ship are enduring severe hardships as they remain stranded at sea. The vessel, which has been immobilized for an extended period due to mechanical issues , has left the crew in a precarious situation without access to essential resources.One of the sailors, speaking on the condition of anonymity, shed light on the dire conditions they are facing: “Life is tough.We don’t have access to proper food, water, or medical supplies. The situation is getting worse every day.” The sailor’s account highlights the urgent need for relief and assistance, as the crew’s basic needs are not being met, a New York Post report said.The ordeal began when the Dali ship encountered mechanical problems that halted its journey, leaving it adrift and unable to reach a safe harbor. Despite efforts to secure assistance, the response has been sluggish, compounding the crew's struggles. The lack of immediate aid has left the sailors feeling isolated and abandoned.Another sailor shared the emotional toll of their situation: “We are trying to stay hopeful, but it’s hard. We need help soon.” The prolonged uncertainty and harsh living conditions have taken a significant toll on the crew's morale and well-being. The sailors are confined to the ship with limited communication with the outside world, adding to their sense of isolation.The update came following reports that the 20 Indian crew stuck in Baltimore can not pay bills for their families in India as their phones have been confiscated by the probe agencies.Authorities are reportedly working on a solution to rescue the stranded sailors, but the timeline for such efforts remains unclear. The delay in providing assistance has raised concerns about the welfare of the crew, as their situation grows increasingly desperate with each passing day.Family members of the stranded sailors have also expressed their anxiety and frustration. One relative, who wished to remain unnamed, said, “We are worried sick. It’s been too long, and we need answers. Our loved ones are out there suffering, and it feels like nothing is being done.”Maritime experts have pointed out the importance of swift action in such situations. Prolonged delays not only jeopardize the physical health of the crew but also pose psychological risks. “In cases like this, immediate intervention is crucial to prevent a humanitarian crisis,” said a maritime safety expert.As the world watches and waits, the stranded sailors aboard the Dali ship continue to hope for a timely rescue. Their story is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities faced by those who work at sea and the critical need for efficient emergency response mechanisms in maritime operations.Meanwhile, recovery teams refloated Dali in the Port of Baltimore early on Monday and pulled it free of the main channel, two months after the boat crashed into the Francis Scott Key bridge and caused the span to collapse.Tugboats led the Dali to a local marine terminal after a successful effort to make the container ship buoyant at about 6:40am EDT (1040 GMT), the US Army Corps of Engineers said on social media platform X.The removal of the Dali marked a significant step in the Port of Baltimore's recovery from the boat's March 26 collision with one of the bridge's support pillars. The bridge's collapse killed six road workers and hindered traffic through the busiest port for car shipments in the US.President Joe Biden praised the team that freed the ship from its weeks-long imprisonment under the bridge's wreckage in a post on X on Monday.""It took the grit of workers and officials coming together to get this done,"" Biden said. ""That's Baltimore Strong.""",Twenty-one sailors aboard the Dali ship are enduring severe hardships as they remain stranded at sea.

"Andhra-born Gopi Thotakura makes history, becomes first Indian to go to space as tourist",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/andhra-born-gopi-thotakura-makes-history-becomes-first-indian-to-go-to-space-as-tourist/articleshow/110255096.cms,"India-born Gopi Thotakura made history on Sunday evening as he became the first Indian citizen to venture into space as a tourist. He was part of the elite crew for Blue Origin ’s New Shepard-25 (NS-25) mission, which took off from the company’s West Texas launch site in the US around 8:05 pm (IST), an hour late from its scheduled launch time of 9:35 am (local US time).Born in Vijayawada (Andhra Pradesh), Gopi, an entrepreneur and a pilot, journeyed to the edge of space beyond the Earth’s atmosphere along with five others — Ed Dwight, Mason Angel, Sylvain Chiron, Kenneth L Hess and Carol Schaller. Ed Dwight (90) is now the oldest man on Earth to go to space.Gopi has retained his Indian passport despite working in the US. Although he became the first Indian citizen to go to space as a tourist, he is officially the second astronaut from the country after Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma, who flew as a professional cosmonaut to space on board Soyuz T-11 on April 3, 1984, as part of the Soviet Interkosmos programme. Astronauts Kalpana Chawla, Sunita Williams, Raja Chari, and Sirisha Bandla were all US citizens of Indian origin who also went to space as professional astronauts. TOI had earlier reported on Gopi’s probable entry to the elite astronaut club.Following takeoff, the NS-25 vehicle reached beyond the boundary of space smoothly. The rocket and capsule then returned to Earth, with the rocket landing upright a few minutes after takeoff. The capsule successfully touched down, using two of its three parachutes, roughly 15 minutes after takeoff. It was Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin’s first crew launch in nearly two years. “Capsule touchdown. Welcome back, NS25 crew!” Blue Origin said in a post on X.Introducing the Indian space tourist , a Blue Origin statement said, “Gopi Thotakura is a lifelong pilot and aviator who learned how to fly before he could drive. He flies jets commercially, in addition to piloting bush, aerobatic, and seaplanes. Gopi is a co-founder of Preserve Life Corp, a global center for holistic wellness and applied health located near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.”He studied for a BSc in aeronautical science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, US. A trained pilot, Gopi had worked in medical air evacuation services in India in the past. “A lifelong traveller, his most recent adventure took him to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro,” the statement said.In another first, America’s first Black astronaut candidate, Ed Dwight, finally rocketed into space 60 years later. Dwight, a former Air Force captain who was selected in 1961 but never got to fly to space with NASA, finally reached the edge of space — at 90 years, 8 months, and 10 days. He thus became the oldest person to go to space, narrowly surpassing Star Trek actor William Shatner, who was almost two months younger when he launched with Blue Origin in 2021.This flight is Blue Origin’s first tourist mission on New Shepard since August 2022. The company was forced to halt flights of the rocket after a New Shepard vehicle suffered an engine failure mid-flight during an uncrewed mission in Sep 2022. Blue Origin spent most of 2023 investigating the failure and making design corrections, and the company successfully returned to flight with another uncrewed mission in Dec.This mission was the seventh human flight for the New Shepard programme and the 25th in its history. Earlier, Blue Origin launched six tourist missions, flying celebrities like William Shatner, Michael Strahan, and Bezos himself to space. In all, New Shepard has flown 31 humans above the internationally recognized boundary of space, the company said.The company, seen as a future key strategic rival to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, plans to debut a much larger and more powerful New Glenn rocket later this year, capable of launching cargo to orbit. Blue Origin also aims to send humans to the moon later this decade for NASA.","India-born Gopi Thotakura made history on Sunday evening as he became the first Indian citizen to venture into space as a tourist. He was part of the elite crew for Blue Origin ’s New Shepard-25 (NS-25) mission, which took off from the company’s West Texas launch site in the US around 8:05 pm (IST) Ed Dwight (90) is now the oldest man on Earth to go to space.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110255094,imgsize-1072896,width-400,resizemode-4/110255094.jpg"

Biden releasing 1 million barrels of gasoline from Northeast reserve in bid to lower prices at pump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-releasing-1-million-barrels-of-gasoline-from-northeast-reserve-in-bid-to-lower-prices-at-pump/articleshow/110311684.cms,"WASHINGTON: The Biden administration said Tuesday that it is releasing 1 million barrels of gasoline from a Northeast reserve established after Superstorm Sandy in a bid to lower prices at the pump this summer.The sale, from storage sites in New Jersey and Maine, will be allocated in increments of 100,000 barrels at a time. The approach will create a competitive bidding process that ensures gasoline can flow into local retailers ahead of the July 4 holiday and sold at competitive prices, the Energy Department said.The move is intended to help ""lower costs for American families and consumers,″ the department said in a statement.Gas prices average about $3.60 per gallon nationwide as of Tuesday, up 6 cents from a year ago, according to AAA. Tapping gasoline reserves is one of the few actions a president can take by himself to try to control inflation, an election year liability for the party in control of the White House.""The Biden-Harris administration is laser-focused on lowering prices at the pump for American families, especially as drivers hit the road for summer driving season,″ Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in the statement. ""By strategically releasing this reserve in between Memorial Day and July 4th, we are ensuring sufficient supply flows to the tri-state (area) and Northeast at a time hardworking Americans need it the most.""White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said release of gas from the Northeast reserve builds on actions by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, ""to lower gas and energy costs - including historic releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the largest-ever investment in clean energy.″Biden significantly drained the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, dropping the stockpile to its lowest level since the 1980s. The election year move helped stabilize gasoline prices that had been rising in the wake of the war in Europe but drew complaints from Republicans that the Democratic president was playing politics with a reserve meant for national emergencies.The Biden administration has since begun refilling the oil reserve, which had more than 364 million barrels of crude oil as of last month. The total is lower than levels before the Russia-Ukraine war but still the world's largest emergency crude oil supply.The Northeast sale will require that fuel is transferred or delivered no later than June 30, the Energy Department said.""While congressional Republicans fight to preserve tax breaks for Big Oil at the expense of hardworking families, President Biden is advancing a more secure, affordable, and clean energy future to lower utility bills while record American energy production helps meet our immediate needs,"" Jean-Pierre said.","The sale, from storage sites in New Jersey and Maine, will be allocated in increments of 100,000 barrels at a time.

"Trump or Biden? Either way, US seems poised to preserve heavy tariffs on imports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-or-biden-either-way-us-seems-poised-to-preserve-heavy-tariffs-on-imports/articleshow/110302294.cms,"NEW DELHI: The continuity in trade policies between the Trump and Biden administrations has raised eyebrows and stirred debates among industry leaders and economists alike. Despite stark differences in other policy arenas, particularly taxes and immigration, both presidents have maintained a protectionist stance, leaving many wondering about the future trajectory of US trade relations .The story of Clips & Clamps Industries, a Michigan auto supplier, epitomizes the challenges faced by American businesses amidst these trade policies. Initially impacted by President Trump's 25% tariff on foreign steel, the company hoped for relief with Biden's presidency, only to find that the new administration largely preserved Trump's tariffs, extending them to include aluminum and various Chinese goods.Jeff Aznavorian, the company president, expressed surprise at the continuity between the two administrations, highlighting the unexpected alignment in their trade approaches. Both leaders have emphasized protecting American industries , particularly in key battleground states crucial for electoral success.Trump's tenure as president saw a brazen implementation of tariffs, aimed at reducing trade deficits and revitalizing the manufacturing sector . While some agreements were renegotiated, such as the North American trade deal, and China made commitments to purchase more American goods, the overall impact on manufacturing employment remained limited.Biden's approach, while nuanced, continues to prioritize domestic industries. Subsidizing key sectors like chipmaking and electric vehicle manufacturing underscores a strategic effort to bolster American competitiveness, especially in light of China's ascendancy as a global economic and technological powerhouse.However, the protectionist tilt comes with economic risks, including inflationary pressures, potential inefficiencies in domestic industries, and strained international relations. Critics argue that while Trump's policies were often labeled as knee-jerk and incoherent, Biden's approach appears more strategic, focusing on strengthening the US economy rather than outright protectionism.The bipartisan consensus on the need for a shift in trade policy reflects broader concerns about job losses due to globalization and China's growing influence. Trump's disruptive trade war with China may not have achieved its intended goals in terms of job creation, but it undoubtedly resonated politically in industrial heartlands.As the US grapples with its economic recovery and strategic positioning in a globalized world, the permanence of protectionist trade policies seems increasingly likely. With China's aggressive export strategies and geopolitical rivalry, American businesses like Clips & Clamps Industries brace for a future where protectionism is not just a temporary measure but a long-term reality.","The story of Clips & Clamps Industries, a Michigan auto supplier, epitomizes the challenges faced by American businesses amidst these trade policies.

IMF asks Pakistan ensure transparency in working of Special Investment Facilitation Council,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-asks-pakistan-ensure-transparency-in-working-of-special-investment-facilitation-council/articleshow/110302522.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The IMF has asked Pakistan to share a draft of the under-preparation investment policy and ensure transparency in the working of the much-hyped Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) as the cash-strapped country is seeking a fresh bailout package from the global lender, a media report said on Tuesday. The SIFC was established in June last year under an "" economic revival plan "" devised by civilian and military leaders to capitalise on ""untapped potential in key sectors"" and attract foreign direct investment (FDI).The hybrid government body promises to create an enabling business environment in the country and offer a one-window solution to investors.A visiting team of the Washington-based lender , which is on a sort of assessment mission, has not yet converted ongoing engagement into formal talks with the Pakistani authorities, The News International reported.Both sides expressed divergent views on the macroeconomic framework for the next fiscal budget for 2024-25, the newspaper said.The Pakistani authorities informed the International Monetary Fund's assessment team that the new investment policy was under preparation and would be announced after conducting due deliberations, the report said.The IMF asked for transparency in the working of the SIFC. The assessment team also inquired about the potential investment in different projects and especially asked for privatisation of the national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and other state-owned enterprises (SOEs).Envisaging the CPI-based inflation on the higher average rate of 12.7 per cent for the next budget 2024-25, the Washington-based lender also inquired about the tax exemptions offered by the government for the upcoming Special Economic Zones (SEZs) under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The IMF wants maximisation of non-tax revenues as the proposal under consideration is to increase the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL) for increasing collection up to Pakistani Rs 1.08 trillion in the next fiscal year or slap a carbon levy to compensate the zero rate of GST on petroleum products, The News International reported.The international lender has recommended imposing 18 per cent GST on petrol and diesel along with PDL.The IMF has refused to accept the macroeconomic framework of the Finance Ministry and so far pitched the macroeconomic framework for the next budget 2024-25 including a real GDP growth rate of 3.5 per cent while the CPI-based inflation was projected on the higher side at 12.7 per cent.The Ministry of Finance has prepared a macroeconomic framework whereby the GDP growth was envisaged at 3.7 to 4 per cent while inflation was kept on average in the range of 11 to 12 per cent, the report said.For the outgoing fiscal year 2023-24, the provision GDP growth figure may hover around 2 to 2.5 per cent of GDP against the official target of 3.5 per cent, it said.Pakistan has made a formal request for a fresh bailout package of USD 6 to USD 8 billion under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the possibility of being augmented through climate finance. If successful, it would be the 24th IMF bailout programme for the country.Last month, Pakistan completed a short-term USD 3 billion programme with the IMF, which bailed the country out of any default.It was unclear whether the IMF mission would end with a formal staff-level agreement for the next bailout package, according to The Express Tribune newspaper.The duration, instrument, and size of the next IMF programme were open to discussion, the report said, quoting sources.Pakistan narrowly averted default last summer, and the economy has stabilised after the completion of the last IMF programme, with inflation coming down to around 17 per cent in April from a record high of 38 per cent last May.The country is still dealing with a high fiscal shortfall, and while the external account deficit has been controlled through import control mechanisms, it has come at the expense of stagnating growth, which is expected to be around two per cent this year compared to negative growth last year.","The IMF has asked Pakistan to share a draft of the under-preparation investment policy and ensure transparency in the working of the Special Investment Facilitation Council.

As the IMF and Pakistan continue their negotiations, it is clear that the new bailout programme will require strict economic measures. However, Pakistan remains committed to the IMF loan program and has no intentions of replacing it.To be eligible for the ""new bailout programme,"" sources indicate that Pakistan will need to practice fiscal discipline by reducing spending and deficits in accordance with IMF requirements. Last week, the IMF mission ""asked"" Pakistani authorities to raise the general sales tax (GST) to 18 percent during four rounds of talks for a new loan.The IMF mission noted that Pakistan's sales tax collection system is problematic, as the centre collects sales tax on commodities while the provinces collect it on services. They suggested that the federal government should be solely responsible for collecting sales tax. Additionally, the IMF demanded an end to GST exemptions and an increase to 18 percent on both commodities and services.During the fourth round of talks, the IMF mission also called for reforms in the insurance sector and the establishment of a separate regulatory body.

Pakistan government forecasts USD 72 bn investment needed to meet 50 pc surge in power demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forecasts-usd-72-bn-investment-needed-to-meet-50-pc-surge-in-power-demand/articleshow/110249530.cms,"ISLAMABAD: In a comprehensive overview of Pakistan's energy landscape, the government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade. This forecast, outlined in the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP 2024-34) submitted to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), aims to bolster the country's power infrastructure to meet escalating demand, Dawn reported.Under the proposed plan, renewable energy sources are slated to account for a significant portion, with an expected surge to 46 per cent of the total energy mix within the next decade.This surge in capacity, estimated to rise from 42,000MW to 57,000MW, underscores the government's commitment to embracing sustainable energy solutions .The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) has provided insights into the anticipated growth in electricity demand, projecting increases ranging from 46 per cent under a low-growth scenario to 74 per cent in a high-growth scenario over the next ten years. To accommodate this surge, an estimated investment of USD 62-64 billion would be required, reflecting the scale of the challenge at hand, as reported by Dawn.The Transmission System Expansion Plan (TSEP 2024-34) outlines an additional USD 8.7 billion investment imperative for enhancing the transmission network. This allocation includes funds for both ongoing projects, requiring USD 3.2 billion for completion, and new projects necessitating USD 5.5 billion in funding.Employing state-of-the-art generation planning software, PLEXOS, the least-cost, long-term generation expansion plan has been meticulously developed. This plan factors in existing and future generation projects, policy frameworks, contractual obligations, natural resource allocations, and prevailing Grid Code provisions. It adheres closely to the National Electricity Policy 2021 and incorporates a series of assumptions to guide strategic decision-making.In crafting the base case scenario, NTDC has meticulously accounted for existing contractual obligations and projected retirements of power projects as stipulated in their respective Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), with the exception of KAPCO. The plan also factors in the retirement of 8,330MW of existing power generation capacity over the planning horizon.The forecasted demand is calibrated to accommodate the intermittency of variable renewable energy resources such as wind and solar PV, critical elements in achieving the government's ambitious renewable energy targets. With an estimated 87,600 hours of energy and peak demand forecasted from FY24 to 34, the plan aims to balance the evolving energy landscape with a diversified and resilient energy mix.By 2034, the envisioned energy mix will reflect a notable shift towards indigenous fuel sources, with local coal and renewables playing a prominent role. Hydropower is expected to contribute 46 per cent of the energy mix, accompanied by 10 per cent from variable renewable energy sources. The plan minimizes reliance on imported fuels, with RFO making no contribution and imported coal and RLNG accounting for a modest share of total energy requirements, Dawn reported.","The government anticipates a substantial increase in electricity generation capacity, with a projected investment of USD 72 billion over the next decade.

The Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) withdrew its support last week while quitting the coalition government.This will be Prime Minister Prachanda's fourth vote of confidence within one and a half years after he assumed the top executive position on December 25, 2022.The new government requires at least 138 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives to win the vote of trust.Earlier on March 13, Prime Minister Dahal won his third consecutive vote of confidence.Last year, Prachanda faced a floor test after former prime minister KP Sharma Oli-led CPN-UML withdrew its support to the Prachanda-led government following a rift over backing the main opposition party's candidate for the presidential poll.Prachanda's support has notably declined in successive confidence votes. In January 2023, he obtained 268 votes, followed by 172 in March of the same year. His support further dwindled to just 157 votes in the third-floor test.Currently, the ruling coalition holds a majority with 77 seats of the CPN-UML, 32 of the Maoist Centre, 21 of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, seven of the newly formed Janata Samajbadi Party and 10 seats of the CPN-Unified Socialist (CPN-US).Meanwhile, the major political parties have agreed to form a panel to look into the misappropriation of fund by cooperatives.","Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' has exuded confidence that he would win the trust vote in the House of Representatives on Monday.
