SIR row: Amartya Sen raises concern over revision; claims it risks 'disenfranchising' poor people,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sir-row-amartya-sen-raises-concern-over-revision-claims-it-risks-disenfranchising-poor-people/articleshow/123465728.cms,"Amartya Sen

NEW DELHI: Nobel laureate Amartya Sen raised concerns over the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar, cautioning that without sensitivity, the exercise could “disenfranchise” large sections of the poor and marginalised.He questioned the fairness of a bureaucratic process that requires strict documentation from citizens who may not have easy access to such papers.While acknowledging the need for administrative checks and periodic revisions, Sen stressed these must not come at the expense of fundamental rights.""Yes, it's true that from time to time various procedural tasks need to be carried out. However, in doing so, one cannot create a 'better system' by trampling on the rights of the poor,"" Sen told news agency PTI.He emphasised the importance of a just and inclusive approach, pointing out that many individuals still lack proper documentation and, as a result, are often excluded from the electoral process.""Many people don't have documents. Many cannot vote. If, in the name of trying to improve things a little, harm is caused to many, then that becomes a serious mistake,"" Sen said, adding, ""You cannot justify seven new mistakes just to correct one"".Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Friday expressed surprise at the lack of political parties' involvement in correcting names of voters deleted during the SIR of the electoral rolls in Bihar.The top court also said that claim forms can be submitted along with Aadhaar card or any other 11 acceptable documents.""We will allow online submission of claims of deleted voters with Aadhaar card or any other acceptable documents for Bihar SIR,"" the bench said, as quoted by PTI.""All the political parties shall file the status report by the next date of hearing on the claim form they had facilitated in filing by excluded voters,"" the bench added. The matter has been posted for hearing on September 8.During the hearing, the Election Commission informed the court that while 85,000 new voters had been added in the ongoing revision, only two objections had been filed by booth-level agents of political parties. A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi was hearing a batch of petitions challenging the SIR exercise.The petitions were filed by RJD MP Manoj Jha, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), PUCL, activist Yogendra Yadav, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and former Bihar MLA Mujahid Alam.The petitioners have sought to quash the ECI’s June 24 directive, which requires large numbers of voters in Bihar to submit proof of citizenship to stay on the rolls.",Nobel laureate Amartya Sen raises concerns over the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar.

That was 11 years before Trump's tariff vendetta and six years before realisation of the need for diversification of supply chains.He consistently stressed the need to become self-reliant in every field with the announcement of govt's focus on ' Atmanirbhar Bharat ' after Covid-19 pandemic, reducing sourcing of products from other nations & putting more thrust on 'Vocal for Local'.In his latest address, the PM emphasised the need to reach new heights in manufacturing by adopting the ""daam kam, dum jyada"" mantra.The first speech saw Modi identifying himself as an ""outsider in Delhi"" who was not part of the ""elite"", and announcing schemes such as Jan Dhan Yojna, Make in India , Skill India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat and transformation of the erstwhile Planning Commission which, among other things, will define his legacy.The 2016 speech saw Modi celebrating the progress of his signature achievements: construction of toilets, bringing large numbers of the poor to the banking net. He followed that up next year by focusing on his theme of New India - a secure, prosperous and strong nation, and expeditious completion of works, since the poor suffer the most because of delays.Two years later, he spoke about how international experts used to refer to the Indian economy as being ""risky"" prior to 2014.Since 2020, the PM's I-Day speeches have focused on national unity and a long-term vision of building a strong nation. While in his 2020 address, the PM spoke about ""Make in India, Make for the World"" as a strategy, the address in 2021 focused on a roadmap for 'Viksit Bharat by 2047'.The PM's address in 2022, marking 75 years of Independence, introduced Panch Pran (five vows), urging citizens to commit to unity, development, and the removal of colonial mindsets.By 2024, the PM's speech had a strong reformist thrust.

'Too harsh': Supreme Court modifies order on Delhi stray dogs - top quotes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/too-harsh-supreme-court-modifies-order-on-delhi-stray-dogs-top-quotes/articleshow/123451643.cms,"""The provision in Rule 11(19) that the dogs, upon sterilisation and immunisation, should be relocated to the same locality from which they have been picked up, is scientifically carved out inasmuch as it serves two purposes. Firstly, the same prevents the scope of overcrowding in the dog shelters/pounds, and secondly, the picked-up stray dogs after immunisation and sterilisation are relocated to the same environment where they were living earlier, which is a compassionate treatment,"" the court said.

""The aggressive sterilisation would definitely put a curb on the rapid growth of the stray dog population, ultimately leading to its reduction. However, this is possible only in an idealistic situation, which seems unlikely in the present scenario,"" the court said.

The court said, ""It was argued by some of the counsels appearing for the animal lovers that the process of sterilisation and inoculation has worked wonders in many towns across the country and has significantly brought down the population of stray dogs. To be specific, it was pointed out that towns like Dehradun and Lucknow, which have taken aggressive measures for sterilisation, etc., as per the ABC Rules, have seen a steady decline in the population of stray dogs. A suggestion has also been received that chemical castration is a safe, painless, and effective mode of sterilisation.""

""A blanket direction to pick up all the strays and place them in dog shelters/pounds without evaluating the existing infrastructure may lead to a catch-22 situation because such directions may be impossible to comply with. We, therefore, feel that a holistic approach requires mollification of the directions issued vide order dated 11th August, 2025,"" the court said.

Municipal authorities must continue complying with previous directions, but the bar on releasing picked-up strays has been kept in abeyance. Stray dogs are to be sterilised, dewormed, vaccinated, and then released in the same area, except in cases of rabies or aggressive behaviour. Such dogs must be kept in shelters after treatment.





Each municipal ward must establish designated feeding zones for stray dogs. Feeding on streets is prohibited, with violators facing legal action. Helplines are to be set up for reporting violations.





No individual or organisation may obstruct officials implementing these directions; obstruction will invite prosecution.





NGOs involved in the case must deposit Rs 2 lakh each, while individual dog lovers must deposit Rs 25,000 each, within seven days. These funds will be used for stray-dog infrastructure.





Citizens may formally adopt stray dogs through municipal bodies, ensuring adopted dogs do not return to the streets.





Municipalities must file compliance affidavits, detailing available facilities such as dog pounds, vets, capture staff, and vehicles.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday reversed the August 11 order on the relocation of stray dogs in Delhi-NCR, saying that the animals that are not rabid or aggressive will not be shifted to shelters but instead sterilised, immunised, and released back to their original locations.The court said that the ""direction given in the order dated 11th August, 2025, prohibiting the release of the treated and vaccinated dogs seems to be too harsh.""It referenced Rule 11(9) of the ABC Rules, which mandates that once stray dogs have been sterilised, inoculated, and dewormed, they must be released back into the same locality from which they were picked up.A three-judge bench comprising Justice Vikram Nath, Justice Sandeep Mehta, and Justice NV Anjaria clarified that stray dogs must be released to their original areas after sterilisation, deworming, and immunisation, except for those infected with rabies, suspected of rabies infection, or exhibiting aggressive behaviour.Here are top quotes:The court also ordered a ban on public feeding of stray dogs and directed the establishment of dedicated feeding spaces. The Bench reiterated the August 11 order that no individual or organisation should obstruct municipal authorities from picking up dogs in accordance with the ABC Rules.The scope of the matter was extended beyond Delhi-NCR to a pan-India level, involving all States and Union Territories, Secretaries of Animal Husbandry departments, Secretaries of local bodies, and Municipal corporations for compliance with ABC Rules. The court also stated that it would transfer similar petitions pending in high courts to itself to formulate a national policy on the issue.The Supreme Court has supplemented and modified earlier directions on stray dog management, laying down fresh guidelines for municipal bodies:","The court also ordered a ban on public feeding of stray dogs and directed the establishment of dedicated feeding spaces. Stray dogs are to be sterilised, dewormed, vaccinated, and then released in the same area, except in cases of rabies or aggressive behaviour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123452612,imgsize-1718985,width-400,resizemode-4/123452612.jpg"

Ethanol-blended petrol push: PIL in Supreme Court challenges nationwide sale of E20; claims 'engines are suffering',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ethanol-blended-petrol-push-pil-in-supreme-court-challenges-nationwide-sale-of-e20-claims-engines-are-suffering/articleshow/123457552.cms,"India's E20 Push



Is all petrol in India now E20?



How is E20 different from E10 or E15?



What impact does E20 have on vehicles?



What Government said?



NEW DELHI: A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the nationwide rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20), claiming that millions of motorists are being forced to use fuel their vehicles are not designed for.The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.The PIL argues that cars and two-wheelers manufactured before 2023 and even some newer BS-VI models, are not compatible with high ethanol blends like E20.""Direct the respondents to ensure that consumers are informed about ethanol compatibility of their vehicles at the time of fuel dispensing. Engines are suffering corrosion, fuel efficiency is dropping, and repair bills are mounting, while insurance companies are rejecting claims for damage caused by ethanol fuel,"" the plea stated.The petitioner further sought clear labelling of ethanol content at all petrol pumps and dispensing units so that consumers are fully informed about what they are purchasing.The petition highlighted that global practices differ sharply.In countries like the US and EU, ethanol-free petrol continues to be widely available, and pumps clearly display the ethanol content.In India, however, only ethanol-blended petrol is sold, and there is no disclosure of composition at dispensing units, the plea added.India has accelerated its transition to E20 fuel, a blend of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol, as part of its efforts to cut carbon emissions and reduce dependence on imported crude oil.The nationwide rollout, originally planned for 2030, has now been advanced to 2025. While the government has set ambitious targets, questions remain over the availability of compatible vehicles, supply logistics, and consumer awareness.Not yet. Many petrol pumps are still offering E10 (10% ethanol), while E20 is being gradually introduced in select regions. The government’s aim is to achieve 100% E20 availability across India by 2025.The number indicates the ethanol percentage in the fuel blend. For example, E10 has 10% ethanol, E15 has 15%, and E20 contains 20%. The higher the ethanol content, the lower the reliance on crude oil imports.According to several reports, many motorists have expressed concerns about the impact of E20 fuel, particularly on fuel efficiency.While ethanol has lower energy density than petrol, the mileage impact is relatively small. For E10 vehicles tuned for E20, the drop is just 1-2% .In other vehicles, the reduction could range between 3-6% and even that can be minimised with proper engine tuning, as reported by ANI.The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas issued a statement rejecting all viral social media posts alleging that E20 causes a major fall in fuel efficiency.Calling the claims ""factually incorrect,"" the ministry said they lack any scientific backing or expert validation.","A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the nationwide rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20) The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123458210,imgsize-58496,width-400,resizemode-4/123458210.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Isro unveiled a model of the Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS) module, on the occassion of the national Space Day celebrations held at Bharat Mandapam on Friday.The BAS, which will be India’s first home-built space station, is set to have its first module launched by 2028. This will place India among a select group of countries operating orbital laboratories.At present, there are only two such stations in service, the International Space Station, run jointly by five space agencies, and China’s Tiangong space station.Under its long-term plan, India aims to assemble five modules of the BAS by 2035 as part of its ambitious space programme, PTI reported.The first unit, BAS-01, is expected to weigh 10 tonnes and will orbit at an altitude of 450 km above Earth. Standing 3.8 metres in diameter and 8 metres in length, the model of BAS-01 was the star attraction at the National Space Day event.The BAS will come with several key features. These include an indigenously developed Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), a Bharat Docking System, Bharat Berthing Mechanism, automated hatch systems, platforms for microgravity research and technology demonstration, as well as viewports designed for scientific imaging and crew recreation.It will also provide refuelling capabilities for propulsion and ECLSS fluids, alongside radiation, thermal and Micro Meteoroid Orbital Debris (MMOD) protection. Other features include space suits, airlocks to support extra-vehicular activities, and plug-and-play integrated avionics.The BAS will serve as a research platform for studying space, life sciences, medicine and interplanetary exploration. It will enable scientists to observe the effects of microgravity on human health while testing technologies vital for long-term human presence in space.The station will also open doors to space tourism, with India planning to tap into the commercial space sector by leveraging the resources of its orbital lab.In addition to fostering international collaboration, the BAS is expected to inspire future generations to take up careers in space science and technology.India’s space sector is stepping into a new era of growth and innovation, with reforms giving private players a greater role while freeing Isro to push the boundaries of advanced research and deep space exploration, senior government official P K Mishra said on Friday.Mishra, who is the principal secretary to the prime minister, highlighted how the government’s reforms have changed the outlook for the industry.""Space sector reforms have made the future of the sector scalable, innovative and resilient,"" he said.He explained that technology transfers from Isro, creation of a venture capital fund and a technology adoption fund are driving transformation in the sector.""Isro is now free to focus on frontier technologies and deep space, much of the application will be done by the private sector which is developing,"" Mishra said.Highlighting the need to integrate cutting-edge tools into space missions, he urged scientists to embrace artificial intelligence, quantum computing and big data analytics for future satellites and ground systems.Mishra also called for deeper international cooperation, pointing to recent collaborations such as the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite launch and the proposed G-20 climate satellite.""India should be seen as a hub of affordable, inclusive and innovative space solutions for the world,"" he said, as cited by PTI.He concluded by stressing that the country’s space journey is not only about science and technology but also about national progress.

NEW DELHI: India is now finally getting set to kick off the collaboration with France to co-develop a new powerful jet engine for its indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter and other futuristic platforms, which will further bolster the already expansive strategic partnership between the two countries.Defence Research and Development Organisation will soon move the cabinet committee on security for the approval of the ambitious project with French major Safran, with 100% transfer of technology, to jointly design, develop, test, qualify, certify and produce the new 120 kilonewton engines in India, senior officials told TOI.""DRDO has cleared the proposal by Safran, which already makes a variety of helicopter engines in India, as the best option for the twin-engine fifth-generation fighter called AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft). The project, with DRDO's lab Gas Turbine Research Establishment, would cost almost $7 billion,"" an official said.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, speaking at The Economic Times World Leaders Forum Friday, also confirmed the impending project. ""We have taken steps forward to build our fifth-generation fighter aircraft. We have also moved towards manufacturing the aircraft's engine in India itself. We are about to start engine manufacturing work in India with the French company Safran,"" Singh said.India's inability to manufacture an aero-engine, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, has for long been a major hurdle for indigenous fighter jet programmes.The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-F404 turbofan engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, as well as weapons and radar integration issues, for instance, are the main reasons for the major slowdown in production of Tejas Mark-1A fighters.Hindustan Aeronautics and GE are also yet to seal the final deal for the co-production of the GE-F414 engines in the 98 kilonewton thrust class in India, with 80% of transfer of technology for around $1.5 billion, to power the planned Tejas Mark-2 variant.""The project for jet engine with Safran will have full IP (intellectual property) ownership & licencing control by India. It will create an entire ecosystem for the manufacture of aero-engines in India, with complete supply chain development,"" an official said.This comes after the defence ministry in May finally approved a new ""programme execution model"" for prototype development of the 25-tonne AMCA, with greater private sector participation.As per existing timelines, the AMCA with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and ""serpentine air-intake"" will be ready for production only by 2035.IAF plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, with the first two squadrons powered by the American GE-F414 engines and the next five with 120 kilonewton engines.","Defence Research and Development Organisation will soon move the cabinet committee on security for the approval of the ambitious project. The project, with DRDO's lab Gas Turbine Research Establishment, would cost almost $7 billion. India's inability to manufacture an aero-engine has for long been a major hurdle for indigenous fighter jet programmes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123462765,imgsize-1291400,width-400,resizemode-4/123462765.jpg"

He added that businesses were also exploring alternatives and had supported the govt's stand.Goyal further pointed to several trade agreements that have been concluded, noting that like Australia, UK and EFTA nations, European Union too had recognised India's sensitivities in certain sectors. He said there had been good progress on proposed free trade agreement with the EU, while assuring that India's interests would always be safeguarded.""Geopolitical considerations, or wanting to look good, will never drive India's trade decisions. Trade will stand on its own legs, geopolitics stands on its own legs, we don't hyphenate the two. Our effort is to build good relations across the world; we are multilateral in every dimension. But when it comes to opening India's market and expanding India's trade, our stakeholders, their views and their best interests are paramount,"" he stressed."," commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said a review of checks on Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) can be considered if the situation so demands.

Gujarat's pride to remain MP's envy? Plan to bring lions to Kuno likely shelved,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarats-pride-to-remain-mps-envy-plan-to-bring-lions-to-kuno-likely-shelved/articleshow/123462376.cms,"Rumble in the jungle

A three-decade wait

Cheetahs take centre stage

BHOPAL: Has the curtain finally and quietly come down on a three-decade saga - the elusive plan to bring Asiatic lions from Gujarat's Gir sanctuary to Kuno in Sheopur district of Madhya Pradesh? Likely. Lions may sit at the top of the food chain, but the rumble in the jungle suggests cheetahs have outmanoeuvred them in the Kuno conservation stakes.A July 30 forest department notification announcing renaming of the 'Lion Project' in MP's Kuno National Park to 'Cheetah Project', and redesignation of its director to ""field director, Cheetah Project, Shivpuri"", has led many to suspect that Asiatic lions won't roar in what was supposed to be their second home in India after Gir.However, while Kuno effectively becomes the preserve of the ambitious cheetah reintroduction programme launched by PM Narendra Modi in 2022, official word on it is that the Lion Project hasn't been scrapped.""This is procedural restructuring. No post has been abolished. Positions have been renamed for better conservation targeting,"" additional chief secretary (forest) Ashok Barnwal told TOI.Another senior official who didn't want to be named said this had been done to ""ease international communication"" since Kuno was now globally identified with Project Cheetah.The idea of creating a home for the Asiatic lion beyond Gujarat dates back to the 1980s, when wildlife scientists warned that Gir alone couldn't safeguard the species. Field studies by the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India over a decade had identified Kuno as the most suitable site for relocation of lions.The Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project was then formally launched after the Supreme Court directed Gujarat in April 2013 to give away some Gir lions. The court specifically asked the Centre to establish Kuno as the endangered Asiatic lion's other home in India.Successive state govts in Gujarat refused to allow lions to be relocated from Gir, insisting that they were safe in their original habitat and alleging that Kuno's topography wasn't conducive to their survival. Officials in Gujarat described Gir lions as the state's ""pride"" and filed review and curative petitions, both of which were dismissed by the apex court.The reluctance, couched in ecological concerns, was widely seen as a mix of politics and prestige. The Centre maintained a stoic silence, and the project remained trapped in a maze of bureaucratic files, expert committee recommendations, and reports of periodic field visits.Since the first batch of African cheetahs landed in Kuno from Namibia and South Africa in Sept 2022, the only mention of the pending plan to relocate lions to Gir was in a state govt audit last year.""Cheetahs were not part of the Kuno management plan,"" states the audit report, also flagging alleged violations and incomplete documentation of Project Cheetah expenditure.According to the official management plan for the period 2020-21 to 2029-30, Kuno was to be designated a secondary habitat for Asiatic lions. ""No efforts had been made towards reintroduction of lions, as of Nov 2023,"" the audit report says.The audit also talks about missing reports from a three-member team appointed by SC on Jan 28, 2020. The team was required to submit four-monthly surveys and recommendations on sites for African cheetahs.""These reports were not found in the forest division's records, preventing verification of the facts presented to the Supreme Court,"" the report states.",The idea of creating a home for the Asiatic lion beyond Gujarat dates back to the 1980s.

Intermittent fasting may come with risks: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/intermittent-fasting-may-come-with-risks-study/articleshow/123462333.cms,"Getty images

New Delhi: Intermittent fasting may help shed some extra kilos in the short term, but such regimens may not be without their risks, a new study, published in Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research and Reviews, has suggested.Intermittent fasting involves limiting the hours for eating to a specific number of hours each day, which may range from a 4- to 12-hour time window in 24 hours.In the study, researchers who analysed long-term health outcomes for close to 19,000 US nationals with varying daily eating durations found that participants who ate for less than eight hours per day had a 135% higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (death due to heart and blood vessel diseases) compared to those with a typical 12-14-hour eating period.Further research is required to understand whether the risk of cardiovascular mortality is attributable to the short eating duration itself or residual confounding resulting from its contributing factors, the study says.Dr Anoop Misra, chairman Fortis C-doc and the editorial head of Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research and Reviews journal, said people who follow intermittent fasting tend to eat whatever they want in the non-fasting period, including junk food.""Some studies have shown increased low-density cholesterol (LDL) in such cases is a known risk factor for cardiovascular mortality,"" he said.The enthusiasm for intermittent fasting must be tempered with careful risk assessment. ""Until more long-term data are available, especially on hard outcomes like cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attacks), intermittent fasting should be individualised and ideally supervised, particularly for people with pre-existing health conditions, and applied for short term only,"" the doctor said.Nutritionists say extreme dieting can lead to long-term nutritional deficiencies, including proteins, vitamins, minerals & electrolytes. ""In some cases, sudden death due to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) and chronic inflammation are also possible. Magnesium deficiency can lead to serious cardiac events,"" Dr Ishi Khosla, a clinical nutritionist, said.","Intermittent fasting involves limiting the hours for eating to a specific number of hours each day.

"Parliament panel slams fertiliser sector’s 'Non-Strategic' tag, calls it misaligned with Atmanirbhar Bharat goals",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/parliament-panel-slams-fertiliser-sectors-non-strategic-tag-calls-it-misaligned-with-atmanirbhar-bharat-goals/articleshow/123462283.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel on fertiliser, in its report on disinvestment of fertiliser PSUs, has found the finance ministry's decision to classify the sector as “non-strategic” as “incongruent” with the government’s agenda to be self-reliance (Atma Nirbhar).The panel headed by Congress MP Kirti Azad in its report submitted to Parliament this week has mentioned that despite multiple submissions by the fertiliser department to the finance ministry to classify the sector as strategic considering its critical role in ensuring food security, sustaining rural livelihoods, and advancing national self-reliance, the latter did not accept this.The report mentioned that disinvestment department (DIPAM) turned down these requests, arguing that Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) contribute only 25% and 11% of the country’s urea and non-urea fertiliser production respectively; that many operate at a loss; and that their continued existence is inconsistent with fiscal prudence and the criteria for strategic classification, as approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) under the New PSE Policy.“The committee finds this reasoning incongruent with the govt’s Atmanirbhar Bharat agenda. Contrary to DIPAM’s claim, several fertiliser PSUs have shown remarkable turnaround, notably FACT, which has transitioned from a loss-making entity to a consistently profitable enterprise,” the report said. It also highlighted that the revival of closed units at Gorakhpur, Sindri, Barauni and Ramagundam through CPSE-led joint ventures, has added over 76.2 lakh tonnes to India’s annual urea production capacity.The panel said that this clearly demonstrates the strategic value of leveraging PSU assets to meet national goals. “In light of rising global fertiliser prices and India’s continued reliance on imports for over 90% of its potash and phosphate needs (procured under the Open General License), the sustained operation and strengthening of fertilizer PSUs is crucial not only for domestic production but also for price stabilisation, disaster resilience, and long term food sovereignty,” it said.Under the framework of the new public sector enterprise policy for Atmanirbhar Bharat in 2021, fertiliser sector was categorised as a non-strategic sector, making it eligible for privatisation or closure. But there has been no progress so far as disinvestments of seven PSUs manufacturing fertilisers is concerned.As per fertiliser department, in FY25, out of the total 38.8 million tonne (MT) of urea consumption, 5.6 MT was met through imports. In case of non-urea fertilisers such as diammonium phosphate (DAP), NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and muriate of potash (MOP DAP), imports were 10.4 MT against the consumption of 21.1 MT.According to the committee, the country's dependency on import at present is to the extent of 25% of the requirement of urea, 90% in case of phosphates - as raw material or finished fertilizers and 100% in case of potash.It has recommended that there is a strong need to ensure that the existing fertiliser manufacturing units function profitably. It has also stressed on the need to revive the closed units so as to bridge the gap between the demand and availability of fertilisers in the country.","A parliamentary panel on fertiliser has found the finance ministry's decision to classify the sector as ‘non-strategic’ as “incongruent’ with the government’s agenda to be self-reliance (Atma Nirbhar) The panel headed by Congress MP Kirti Azad in its report submitted to Parliament this week has mentioned that despite multiple submissions by the fertiliser department, the ministry did not accept this.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123462296,imgsize-1303592,width-400,resizemode-4/123462296.jpg"

Fantasy sports giant Dream11 on Friday announced that it has discontinued all paid contests on its platform and will now operate solely as a free-to-play online social game, in the backdrop of The Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill.In a statement released late on Friday, the company said, “This morning, we stopped all paid contests on Dream11 and pivoted entirely to a free-to-play online social game.”The new law, which received President Droupadi Murmu’s assent earlier in the day, prohibits all forms of money-based online gaming while providing recognition and support for e-sports and online social games. The legislation carries stringent penalties for companies that fail to comply, including imprisonment of up to three years and fines of up to ₹1 crore.Dream11, founded 18 years ago, said its journey was driven by the vision to improve sports engagement in India. “When we started this journey 18 years ago as a Sports Tech company, we were not even 1% of the size of the USA Fantasy Sports industry.

Shawn Kemp escapes prison time, ordered to serve home monitoring over parking lot shooting incident



Shawn Kemp’s trouble is far from over



Former NBA All-Star Shawn Kemp has been sentenced to 30 days of electronic home monitoring following his involvement in a 2023 parking lot shooting in Tacoma, Washington. The decision, handed down by Pierce County Judge Michael Schwartz, allowed the former Seattle SuperSonics star to avoid jail time despite prosecutors pushing for a nine-month sentence. Along with home confinement, Kemp must complete 240 hours of community service and serve one year of supervised release.Shawn Kemp, dressed in a navy blazer, tan pants, and a light blue tie, appeared composed during the hearing. Before sentencing, he addressed the courtroom directly, saying he was “very apologetic” for the choices that brought him before the court.The case stemmed from an incident in March 2023, when Kemp tracked his stolen phone to the Tacoma Mall parking lot. Believing the suspects had fired at him first, he returned fire, though no one was struck. Prosecutors argued there was no evidence the men fired a weapon, while Kemp’s defense pointed to an empty holster found in their abandoned vehicle and the suspects’ lengthy criminal records.Judge Schwartz acknowledged Kemp’s frustration but emphasized that restraint should have prevailed. “I cannot state strongly enough this could have been easily avoided by simply walking away.Property is replaceable, human life is not,” the judge said.Kemp ultimately pleaded guilty in May to a reduced charge of second-degree assault, a deal that lowered his prison risk. In court documents, his defense attorney Timothy Leary stressed that the public backlash had been punishment in itself, writing, “The public scorn, disappointment, embarrassment and personal shame weighs heavy on Mr. Kemp. That punishment lasts much longer than any jail sentence.”While Kemp avoided incarceration, the consequences extend beyond his sentence. One of the men involved, now serving time at Stafford Creek Corrections Center, has filed a lawsuit against him, claiming “The assault against me by Mr. Kemp has left me paralyzed with fear and hopelessness about the future.” The lawsuit seeks damages for both emotional suffering and medical costs.The conviction also places Kemp’s cannabis business at risk. Washington’s Liquor and Cannabis Board has guidelines against renewing licenses for those with recent felony convictions. “It’s up to the board to make those decisions,” spokesperson Brian Smith said. “Our guidelines say no. If you are convicted of a felony within 10 years, our guidelines say not to go forward with that license.” Kemp, who owns 10% of the business he launched in 2020, could be forced out if the license is challenged.After sentencing, Kemp told reporters the experience has been life-changing. “This is the first time I’ve ever been in trouble. I’m frustrated with myself because I believe I could have made a better decision with the law,” he said.Despite the setback, Kemp vowed to redirect his focus. His attorney, W. Scott Boatman, added, “Shawn is genuinely regretful of certain decisions he made that day and is committed to working with kids to help them understand the potential consequences of not thinking twice or acting impulsively.”Also Read: NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal agrees to celebrity fight with Charles “Charlie Mack” Alston following viral callout","Former NBA All-Star Shawn Kemp has been sentenced to 30 days of electronic home monitoring.

Austin Ekeler emerges as Commanders’ lead back after Brian Robinson trade

10 Fantasy Football Values, Sleepers & Lottery Tickets | Running Backs to Draft

Croskey-Merritt could be Washington’s 2025 Fantasy breakout

Who fills the gap behind Ekeler and Croskey-Merritt?

The 2025 NFL season is around the corner, and fantasy football managers are already recalibrating their draft boards. Washington’s decision to trade running back Brian Robinson Jr. to the San Francisco 49ers has opened a significant gap in the Commanders’ backfield, creating fresh intrigue and risk for fantasy players.Austin Ekeler, entering his 30s, is the immediate beneficiary. A proven pass-catching back, Ekeler remains dangerous in space but is unlikely to shoulder a heavy workload at this stage of his career. Last season, he logged 733 scrimmage yards and four touchdowns in 12 games.He projects as a reliable flex option in PPR leagues, though Washington will be cautious with his snaps to keep him fresh across a long campaign. Fantasy managers can expect Ekeler to deliver consistent production in short-yardage and passing situations, making him a key piece in the Commanders’ offense.The real buzz belongs to rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt, who has asked teammates to call him “Bill.” A seventh-round pick, Croskey-Merritt has quickly become a preseason talking point after producing 72 rushing yards and a touchdown across two games.His limited college resume tempers expectations, but Washington’s decision to move on from Robinson suggests confidence in his potential.For fantasy managers, he represents a high-upside mid- to late-round pick, one who could seize the starting role if Ekeler is restricted to situational duties.Beyond Ekeler and Croskey-Merritt, options are unconvincing. Jeremy McNichols and Chris Rodriguez Jr. will likely battle for rotational snaps, while Demetric Felton and Kazmeir Allen appear headed for practice squad roles. Neither group offers tangible fantasy value unless injuries create openings.Also Read: Cleveland Browns’ Dillon Gabriel eyes NFL breakthrough while fiancée Zo Caswell begins wedding dress hunt The Commanders’ backfield now revolves around two names. Ekeler provides stability and proven production, making him a safe selection for fantasy rosters. Croskey-Merritt is the wildcard — raw but explosive, and capable of becoming one of 2025’s breakout sleepers. Washington’s preseason usage patterns will be critical in determining how snaps are distributed, but for now, fantasy managers must weigh experience against potential. With Jayden Daniels at quarterback and Deebo Samuel joining Terry McLaurin at receiver, Washington’s offense looks primed for growth.",Austin Ekeler and Jacory Croskey-Merritt take center stage post-Robinson trade.

Sachia Vickery shocks fans with $1,000 dating rule and bold Instagram Q&A



“I will never talk s-t about girls on OnlyFans ever again… the amount I made on there in my first two days, I am overwhelmed. I am just shook really.”

Sachia Vickery, a 30-year-old American tennis player, hit the spotlight this week at the US Open qualifiers in New York. She lost in the second round to Germany’s Ella Seidel, but what really caught attention was her side job. Vickery opened an OnlyFans account earlier this year to help pay for tennis costs. She called it the “easiest money I’ve ever made,” and she said it lets her keep playing the game she loves while handling big bills like coaching, travel, food, training, and physio, which can cost over $100,000 a year.Sachia Vickery began her OnlyFans page in January 2025. She said the venture grew fast, partly because she is a pro tennis player. In an Instagram Q&A, she shared: “It’s also the easiest money I’ve ever made and I enjoy doing it.” She charges $12.99 per month for subscribers to see what she calls “content too spicy for Instagram.”When fans asked her to explain why, she said: “When you’re on tour, you’re not automatically making a ton of money… tennis players spend $100K plus a year on coaching, hotels, food, training, physio. So if I have another avenue where I’m able to make a lot of money to support that… I don’t see anything negative with it.”Vickery noted she has earned about $2 million during her 14-year career in tennis, but the extra help matters.Alongside her content, Vickery shocked followers with a new rule: she now asks for a $1,000 deposit before going on a date.

A call for guardrails and awareness



As part of a new revelation about AI, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’. For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems. As reported by Business Insider, speaking at a recent interview, Suleyman explained AI psychosis as a “real and emerging risk” which can easily affect vulnerable individuals who become deeply immersed in conversations with AI agents. The condition will mainly affect the individuals whose interactions blur the line between human and machine.As per the Microsoft AI CEO, AI psychosis is a state of mind in which individuals start to anthropomorphize AI, attributing emotions, intentions, or consciousness to systems that are fundamentally non-human. ""It disconnects people from reality, fraying fragile social bonds and structures, distorting pressing moral priorities,"" he said.The condition can lead to delusional thinking here individuals feel that AI is sentiment or has some personal relationships with them. Along with this, it can also cause emotional dependency to users who are either isolated or mentally fragile. Lastly, AI psychosis can also lead to distorted perception of reality as users rely a lot of AI for validation, companionship and also decision-making.Suleyman also stressed on that fact that while AI can be helpful and engaging but it is definitely not a substitute for human or clinical support.As per Business Insider, Suleyman also has asked the tech industry to take this risk quite seriously and also help in implementing some ethical guardrails, which include:* Clear disclaimers about AI’s limitations* Monitoring for signs of unhealthy usage patterns* Collaboration with mental health professionals to study and mitigate risksAlong with this, Suleyman also urged the regulators and educators to raise public awareness as AI is slowly becoming more embedded in the daily life in the form of personal assistant and therapeutic chatbots.""AI companions are a completely new category, and we urgently need to start talking about the guardrails we put in place to protect people and ensure this amazing technology can do its job of delivering immense value to the world,"" Suleyman added.","Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has now raised alarms about the growing psychological phenomenon which he calls ‘AI psychosis’ For those unaware, it is a condition where individuals start to lose touch with real life because of excessive interaction with artificial intelligence systems.

Unconventional leadership and office creativity

Monthly “work church” meetings with grammar lessons

Other companies embracing unconventional office setups



A billionaire breaking the mold

Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company, yet she has never taken a single share for personal use. Instead, she has committed to giving away nearly all her wealth to philanthropic causes, signing Bill Gates’ Giving Pledge in 2015 to donate 99% of her fortune. Beyond finances, Faulkner has created a corporate culture that values creativity, curiosity, and learning. From whimsical themed office buildings to innovative company-wide gatherings, she proves that leadership and generosity can coexist, while setting an example for other business leaders that success can be measured not only in profits but also in positive impact on employees and society.Faulkner, together with her husband, launched Roots & Wings to provide grants to nonprofits dedicated to improving the health, education, and well-being of children and families. Since its inception, the foundation has grown into a major philanthropic vehicle: in 2020, it granted $15 million to 115 organizations, and by 2024, it projected $67 million in grants to 305 nonprofits nationwide. Faulkner intends to steadily expand giving, aiming to distribute $100 million annually by 2027. To responsibly manage the sale of her non-voting Epic shares without destabilizing the company, she established a trust that governs these transactions. This careful planning ensures that her philanthropic mission can continue without affecting Epic’s stability or long-term growth.Epic Systems’ 1,670-acre campus in Wisconsin is far from a conventional office environment. Its 28 buildings feature fantastical themes ranging from Harry Potter and Alice in Wonderland to The Wizard of Oz, organized into mini-campuses such as Prairie Campus, Wizards Academy, and Storybook Campus. Inside, employees help source artwork and whimsical installations, including chocolate chip trails leading to a mock chocolate factory, hanging bridges to treehouses, and magical sculptures scattered across the grounds. This imaginative setting reflects Faulkner’s philosophy that creativity, play, and aesthetic engagement foster learning and productivity, making the workplace not just a location for tasks but a space for inspiration and collaboration.Once a month, Epic employees gather in the underground auditorium called Deep Space for a mandatory meeting affectionately nicknamed “work church.” These gatherings cover essential business news, company updates, and operational targets. Yet Faulkner adds unique elements that transform standard corporate meetings into engaging learning experiences. For instance, she incorporates grammar lessons, teaching employees proper usage of words such as “who” and “whom,” and emphasizing communication skills alongside company strategy. By blending education with corporate updates, these meetings reinforce a culture of continuous learning, intellectual curiosity, and attention to detail, encouraging employees to grow professionally and personally within the company. Her story demonstrates that visionary leadership can redefine both corporate culture and philanthropy on a global scale.Epic Systems is part of a broader trend of companies reimagining office culture to enhance employee engagement. Wellstar Health System, for example, offers wellness rooms with massage chairs, calming music, and healthy snacks, resulting in a 10% drop in employee turnover in 2024. Nonprofit Understood designs offices specifically for neurodivergent employees, with adjustable lighting, temperature zones, and assistive listening systems to support diverse needs. Even CEOs like Jeff Bezos favor “messy meetings” over rehearsed discussions to stimulate open debate and creativity. These examples show that unconventional setups, when thoughtfully implemented, can increase productivity, employee satisfaction, and innovation across industries.While many billionaires sign high-profile pledges without fully following through, Faulkner stands apart as a rare example of commitment and action. By giving away nearly all her wealth through philanthropy, cultivating a creative and educational workplace, and fostering employee engagement through unconventional office design and corporate rituals, she sets a benchmark for responsible, visionary leadership. Her approach demonstrates that a CEO can combine financial success, ethical responsibility, and innovation to create a lasting impact—not just on a company’s bottom line, but on the lives of employees, communities, and society at large. Faulkner’s legacy shows that generosity and innovation are not mutually exclusive but can reinforce each other. Her model inspires future leaders to pursue business success with purpose, creativity, and a commitment to societal well-being.","Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company.

What Take Two said about these job cuts



“While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,”

WhatsApp Makes Group Calls Smarter

Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of GTA 6 maker Rockstar Games, has laid off more than 80 employees at its Cloud Chamber studio. The job cuts represent about a third of the staff at the studio, which is developing the next instalment in the popular BioShock series. The layoffs, which took place this week, are reportedly part of a broader reorganisation. As a result, the new BioShock game, which was previously expected to be released in late 2026 or early 2027, will now be delayed, a report claims. The move comes after rumours claimed that Cloud Chamber had replaced its studio head and creative director due to development issues.According to a report by Bloomberg, 2K Games, the Take-Two label behind BioShock has confirmed the job cuts but did not disclose how many employees were affected. When asked for comment, a spokesperson pointed to an internal email sent to the studio's staff by 2K President David Ismailer .Ismailer wrote in his statement.The new BioShock has been in development for over a decade, cycling through multiple studios and leadership teams since 2014. After failed attempts with Certain Affinity, 2K formed Cloud Chamber in 2017, bringing in veterans and shifting development to Unreal Engine 5, which extended the timeline, the report notes.Despite promising demos, the project has faced technical hurdles, leadership departures, and narrative issues. Internal reviews deemed it solid but not exceptional, prompting leadership changes. Following layoffs at Cloud Chamber, 2K has appointed industry veteran Rod Fergusson, known as a project “closer,” to help steer the game to completion, the report adds.","2K Games has laid off more than 80 employees at its Cloud Chamber studio.

Trillion-dollar data centers to power the AI future

OpenAI eyes AI infrastructure as a service

Financial growth and innovative funding

OpenAI is gearing up for a bold expansion, with Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar revealing ambitious plans for the company’s future. According to Friar, OpenAI intends to invest heavily in trillion-dollar-scale data centers to meet the surging demand for artificial intelligence computation. Beyond supporting its own AI models like ChatGPT-5, the company is considering selling AI infrastructure services to other businesses, creating a new revenue stream. These moves reflect OpenAI’s strategy to control both the technology and physical resources driving AI innovation, while exploring financing avenues for large-scale growth.OpenAI faces unprecedented pressure to scale its computational resources. Friar highlighted that the company is “constantly under compute,” pointing to the skyrocketing demand for GPUs, AI-optimized chips, and high-performance servers. Partnerships with Microsoft, Oracle, and Coreweave are helping to secure the required hardware, while the company’s internal Stargate initiative focuses on building massive, AI-optimized data centers both in the U.S. and internationally. These efforts aim to keep OpenAI at the forefront of AI development, supporting not only ChatGPT-5 but also enterprise applications, developer workloads, and next-generation AI experiments that require vast computational power.CEO Sam Altman has indicated that OpenAI may spend trillions of dollars on constructing and optimizing data centers in the near future. These facilities are designed to efficiently handle enormous AI workloads, increase model training speeds, and reduce latency for enterprise and consumer applications. Beyond raw computing, these data centers also represent a strategic asset, giving OpenAI control over the underlying infrastructure that powers its AI models. By owning and optimizing its own facilities rather than relying solely on third-party providers, OpenAI can maintain a competitive edge and protect proprietary innovations.Friar revealed that OpenAI is considering renting out its AI infrastructure to other businesses, inspired by Amazon Web Services’ cloud model. While the company is currently focused on securing resources for its own operations, this potential business line could create a major new revenue stream in the future. Friar emphasized the importance of retaining control over intellectual property, stating that relying too heavily on external vendors allows competitors to learn from OpenAI’s infrastructure design. By offering AI-as-a-service, OpenAI could help other companies tap into cutting-edge AI capabilities while monetizing its massive investment in data centers.OpenAI recently achieved its first $1 billion revenue month in July 2025, with projections to triple revenue to $12.7 billion for the year. Paid ChatGPT subscriptions, particularly following the launch of ChatGPT-5, have driven enterprise and developer adoption. To support its infrastructure ambitions, OpenAI is exploring novel financing approaches, including debt financing with banks and private equity, as well as potential stock sales for employees and early investors. As of mid-2025, OpenAI is generating roughly $1 billion per month in revenue—translating to approximately $23,000 per minute—supported by over 700 million weekly active ChatGPT users. Friar also hinted at a future IPO, signaling that the company is preparing for broader access to capital to fund its ambitious plans.Friar urged companies aiming to remain competitive in AI to focus on automating real-world tasks and solving meaningful, high-impact problems. She stressed the importance of securing access to unique datasets, since more than 90% of the world’s data is locked behind universities, corporations, and other institutions. Firms that can harness exclusive information while efficiently deploying AI solutions will likely dominate the emerging market, mirroring OpenAI’s own strategy of combining technological innovation with control over infrastructure and data.","OpenAI is gearing up for a bold expansion, with Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar revealing ambitious plans for the company’s future.

US president Donald Trump on Friday announced that his administration has started a major investigation into imported furniture, a move that could soon lead to new tariffs.Posting on Truth Social, Trump said the investigation would be completed within 50 days. “Furniture coming from other countries into the United States will be tariffed at a rate yet to be determined. This will bring the furniture business back to North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, and states all across the Union,” he wrote.The announcement quickly hit the stock market. Shares of furniture and home goods retailers such as Wayfair, RH and Williams-Sonoma fell in after-hours trading.

Demand for big-ticket items such as sofas and dining tables has been falling for more than a year, partly because of a weaker housing market and high interest rates.The Trump administration has already imposed high tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium, and has signalled similar duties for imported copper, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.","US president Donald Trump announces investigation into imported furniture.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

"Facing a 'reading crisis,' Denmark wants to make books cheaper",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/facing-a-reading-crisis-denmark-wants-to-make-books-cheaper/articleshow/123463586.cms,"



Officials in Denmark, as in many other places, are worried about whether people are still turning to a good book in a world of screens and scrolling.They are hoping that a new proposal intended to make books cheaper will help. Books will soon be exempt from the 25% value-added tax, or VAT, that Denmark applies to most goods and services, the government said this week.""We would like people to read more,"" Jakob Engel-Schmidt, Denmark's culture minister, said in a phone interview Thursday.The proposed exemption, he said, was intended to combat what he called a growing ""reading crisis"" in the country, particularly among younger people. ""Making books more accessible, lowering the prices in the bookstore, will definitely do something about that.""Concerns over a decline in reading are not limited to Denmark. The share of Americans who read for fun has declined sharply in the past two decades, according to one recent study. Researchers have theorized that the increased use of cellphones and social media, along with economic pressures, could be driving the trend.In Denmark, books are among the goods subject to a value-added tax of 25%, among the highest in Europe.Other Nordic countries, including Finland, Sweden and Norway, have lowered or entirely lifted the consumption tax for books.The Danish government said Wednesday that it would remove the tax on books as part of its new national budget, which is set for a vote in November. The country's expected surplus would cover the cost of removing the tax, estimated to be about 330 million Danish krone (about $51 million), it said.One 2021 survey found that reading proficiency among fourth-grade students in Denmark had declined, with almost 25% considered ""weak"" readers who struggled to, for example, read between the lines or read critically.""The gift of reading and being able to concentrate on a book is something we should give to the younger generations,"" Engel-Schmidt said.Encouraging people to read, he added, would promote literacy as well as the development of Danish culture. He pointed to worries over the overuse of social media, and said that in some cases a book could cost more than the monthly charge for a streaming service.""Online and physical books are losing in competition to streaming services,"" he said. ""And we want to make a more level playing field in that regard.""It remains to be seen whether tax removal will actually draw new readers.Danish publishers, authors and booksellers welcomed the new initiative, and said it would encourage more investment in new literature.Book prices are expected to drop by 16% to 20%, said Christine Bodtcher-Hansen, the director of Danske Forlag, a group representing Danish publishers.The move, she added, reflected a ""political recognition of the book's value and of the importance of a strong reading culture -- something more crucial than ever in an age where reflection and critical thinking are essential.""Engel-Schmidt said that he had spoken with publishing companies that have promised to cut prices by about 20%. If it is approved, the removal of the value-added tax on books would be evaluated after four years, he said, and revised if book prices did not drop.""It is difficult to estimate the exact effect of this,"" said Mads Rosendahl Thomsen, a professor of comparative literature at Aarhus University and the vice chair of a task force that proposed the move to the government. He added that the proposal was one of several steps the government could take to promote reading, including investing in libraries and building more social communities around reading.But removing the tax, he said, was the ""right thing to do,"" adding that it could help make schoolbooks and children's books more accessible.Reading includes a wide range of benefits, Thomsen said, including the promotion of well-being and empathy for different perspectives.""It's a problem if people don't read books,"" he said, ""because that's where people are confronted with complex ideas.""","Danish government proposes to remove the 25% value-added tax on books.

Through massive investments in infrastructure such as power plants, highways, railways, and ports, the initiative has strengthened China’s economic and political ties with regions across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.A central pillar of the BRI is the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), under which Beijing has poured billions of dollars into Pakistan. The projects include road and rail networks, energy plants, and the strategic Gwadar Port linking China’s Xinjiang region to the Arabian Sea. However, CPEC has also faced security challenges, with Chinese nationals and workers targeted by separatist groups in Balochistan and insurgents elsewhere.Despite these risks, Beijing and Islamabad have pledged to expand cooperation beyond infrastructure, extending into science, technology, industry, and agriculture. China remains Pakistan’s closest ally and major financial supporter, particularly critical as the country grapples with a prolonged economic crisis. Pakistan, in turn, has ramped up security for Chinese workers to safeguard the partnership and ensure progress on CPEC projects.India has consistently slammed CPEC projects and China and Pakistan for roping in third countries.""We have seen reports on encouraging proposed participation of third countries in so-called CPEC projects.

China’s Wang Yi Lands In Pakistan After India Visit As Beijing Refreshes Af-Pak Ties With CPEC Push





ISLAMABAD: The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to expand their cooperation in multiple fields, including extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) to Kabul.Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Afghanistan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi took part in the 6th Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue in Kabul which focused on political, economic and security cooperation.The agreement on extension of the multi-billion dollars CPEC comes as Islamabad and Beijing are expected to launch the second phase of the project later this month during Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's visit to China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.Pakistan's Foreign Office in a brief statement on X said that the three sides ""committed to strengthen joint efforts against terrorism"".""They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as, extension of CPEC to Afghanistan,"" it said.This is the first visit by the Chinese foreign minister to Afghanistan since the Taliban stormed to power in 2021 while the third by Dar to the Afghan capital since April.According to sources, China has played a role in easing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.In a bilateral meeting with his Afghanistan counterpart, Pakistan's foreign minister claimed there was an ""increase in terrorist attacks"" in his country by terrorist outfits operating from Afghanistan, the Foreign Office said.In the last trilateral meeting in May in Beijing, the foreign ministers of the three countries had first agreed to expand the CPEC to Afghanistan to boost ""trilateral"" cooperation.India has been severely critical of the CPEC as it passes through Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.
