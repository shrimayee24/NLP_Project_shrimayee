National Herald FIR is a BJP afterthought to rescue illegal case: Abhishek Singhvi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/national-herald-fir-is-a-bjp-afterthought-to-rescue-illegal-case-abhishek-singhvi/articleshow/125708774.cms,"NEW DELHI: Making light of the police complaint filed in the National Herald case, Congress said on Monday the BJP govt has filed the fresh FIR out of the fear that its chargesheet was legally untenable in the absence of a govt complaint in the matter -- calling it a desperate attempt to fill a major loophole in the proceedings driven by political vendetta against the opposition leadership.AICC spokesman and MP Abhishek Singhvi said the National Herald row is based on a private court complaint by Subramaniam Swamy, while the ED can only pursue a case that is filed by the govt or police or empowered officials.“I had argued in the court that this chargesheet is infructuous. The National Herald case has no police or ED complaint. And the judgement on the issue is pending. This is a major lacuna on which a big building was erected, and it could fall anytime. So, this fresh FIR is a desperate attempt to fill the gap of govt complaint in the case,” Singhvi argued, adding, “we can see what kind of foolishness can be committed when one works in haste out of vendetta. ”Addressing a press conference, Singhvi said National Herald, an idealistic organisation which was part of the freedom struggle and run by AJL, was given huge loans by Congress to sustain its operations, since its debt had ballooned to Rs 90 crore at one point in time.He said to make AJL debt free, a routine measure was adopted that is staple for every such company – turn debt into equity by creating a not-for-profit company, Young Indian. “There was no transfer of property, no movement of money, while YI became the controlling company of AJL,” he said.But, he said, the govt and ED have claimed that creation of YI led to money laundering through property transfer. ""This is a bizarre situation -- no crime, no cash, no trail to find, the BJP still conjures a case out of its own twisted mind,” he said.","AICC spokesman and MP Abhishek Singhvi said the National Herald row is based on a private court complaint by Subramaniam Swamy. “I had argued in the court that this chargesheet is infructuous.

"Now, you can report disease outbreaks from your phone: NCDC’s new community reporting system seeks citizen eyes on public health",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/now-you-can-report-disease-outbreaks-from-your-phone-ncdcs-new-community-reporting-system-seeks-citizen-eyes-on-public-health/articleshow/125708379.cms,"file photo

NEW DELHI: What if spotting a cluster of fevers or sudden diarrhoea cases in your neighbourhood could help stop an outbreak? A new nationwide system launched by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is now making that possible — by turning ordinary citizens into the country’s earliest disease sentinels.At the heart of the system is a simple QR code. Anyone can scan it from the Health Ministry or NCDC website, or from posters and materials being rolled out across states. Once scanned, the user enters basic details and selects what they’re reporting — a fever cluster, recurring diarrhoea, jaundice, dog bites, suspected food poisoning or any other unusual health event. Photos or short videos can also be uploaded. The moment a report is submitted, the alert lands simultaneously in district, state and national surveillance dashboards, where officers verify it and initiate investigations if required.Dr Ranjan Das, director NCDC said that the tool fills a critical gap in India’s surveillance network. Many outbreaks begin silently in homes, neighbourhoods or small gatherings well before patients reach hospitals. A citizen report — sometimes within hours — can help health authorities intervene early, contain spread and prevent large-scale outbreaks.Dr Himanshu Chauhan, additional director and HOD IDSP call this a “game changer,” especially during dengue, diarrhoea, influenza and waterborne disease seasons.But they caution that the system will work only if citizens use it responsibly — and consistently.To protect users, all submissions are routed through secure government servers, with personal data safeguarded under national cyber-security protocols. False or irrelevant reports are filtered through a combination of automated checks and manual verification by trained district teams.The Community Reporting System, introduced in January 2024 under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), was envisioned to give communities a direct role in early outbreak detection. Despite being launched in 2024, the tool remained largely unknown due to poor efforts to popularize it, resulting in only about 100 valid reports so far. The low utilisation highlights the gap between technology and public engagement, though officials say even this early trickle shows that once people know the platform exists, they are willing to report.The message from NCDC is clear: public health isn’t just a government job — it needs citizen vigilance too. Sometimes, a QR scan and 30 seconds may be all it takes to stop the next outbreak.","The Community Reporting System, introduced in January 2024 under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), was envisioned to give communities a direct role in early outbreak detection.

Former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia reported to be in a critical condition; PM Modi offers assistance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/former-bdesh-pm-zia-reported-to-be-in-a-critical-condition-pm-modi-offers-assistance/articleshow/125707351.cms,"Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina Faces Fresh Conviction as Court Awards 21-Year Term

With former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia reported to be in a very critical condition, PM Narendra Modi expressed concerns about her failing health and offered all possible assistance to her. Modi’s gesture is significant as Zia has had a troubled past with India in contrast to her rival Sheikh Hasina’s warm and friendly ties with India. Zia’s party BNP accused the Indian govt of undermining democracy in Bangladesh by backing an “authoritarian” Hasina who was deposed last year and forced to flee to India.“Deeply concerned to learn about the health of Begum Khaleda Zia, who has contributed to Bangladesh’s public life for many years. Our sincere prayers and best wishes for her speedy recovery. India stands ready to extend all possible support, in whatever way we can,” said Modi in a post on X.Significantly, a team of Chinese doctors, apparently sent by Beijing, arrived in Dhaka on Monday to help in Zia’s treatment.This is not the first time Modi has reached out to Zia and her party. He had a meeting with her during his visit to Dhaka in 2015 that govt described as “full spectrum outreach” on Bangladesh.Modi’s message will also be seen as an acknowledgement of the new reality in Bangladesh - and re-evaluation of India’s position - which goes to polls early next year and the possible return to power of BNP, which is expected to gain majorly from Hasina’s ouster. According to a local survey last week, as reported by Prothom Alo, there’s a tight race currently between the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami, with the BNP holding a slight three-point lead. India has on several occasions said in the recent past it seeks fair and inclusive polls in Bangladesh.With his outreach, Modi is also doubling down on India’s position that it remains committed to the best interest of Bangladesh, including peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country and will continue to engage with all stakeholders. BNP too has said it wants “balanced and respectful” ties with India.",Former Bangladesh PM Khaleda Zia reported to be in a very critical condition.

"India’s AIDS deaths down 81% since 2010, infections fall 49%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-aids-deaths-down-81-since-2010-infections-fall-49/articleshow/125707141.cms,"Nursing students and doctors hold placards while participating in an awareness walk on 'World AIDS Day'

NEW DELHI: India’s HIV epidemic continues to decline, with adult HIV prevalence steady at 0.2% and AIDS-related deaths dropping 81% since 2010 — one of the steepest reductions globally.New HIV infections have fallen by nearly 49%, placing India ahead of worldwide trends.But this national success hides a troubling shift. The latest HIV burden estimate shows sharp surges in the Northeast, with Mizoram and Nagaland now recording HIV prevalence of above 1% — more than five times the national average.Several other states — such as Meghalaya and Punjab — are also reporting spikes linked to drug use and changing sexual behaviour among young adults.The findings come from the India HIV Estimation 2025, released by Union health minister Jagat Prakash Nadda at the national World AIDS Day event at Vigyan Bhawan on Monday.Developed by NACO under the IESE framework, the report covers 34 States/UTs and 762 districts and was led by ICMR–NIRDHDS with support from nine national institutes and state AIDS control societies.Releasing the report, Nadda said India’s HIV programme continues to show strong gains, with testing rising from 4.1 crore to 6.6 crore, people on treatment increasing from 14.9 lakh to 18.6 lakh and viral load tests nearly doubling to 16 lakh.India has achieved a 35% drop in new HIV infections and a 69% decline in HIV-related deaths, outperforming global averages.He added that 85% of people with HIV know their status, 88% are on treatment and 97% have viral suppression — putting the country firmly on track to meet the 95-95-95 targets by 2030. Nadda, however, cautioned that HIV–TB co-infection and poor adherence to ART remain major hurdles that demand intensified counselling and community support.Nationally, India was estimated to have 25.6 lakh people living with HIV in 2024, including nearly 14 lakh men and 11 lakh women. HIV prevalence among youth (15–24 years) remains low at 0.06%.Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka continue to carry the largest burdens and, together with six other states, account for 74% of all PLHIV in the country. The Northeast, however, presents the sharpest warning signs. Mizoram’s new infection rate (0.9 per 1,000 uninfected population) is nearly 18 times the national average.","India has achieved a 35% drop in new HIV infections and a 69% decline in HIV- related deaths.

NEW DELHI: As the Winter Session of Parliament begins on Monday, the government is set to push a heavy economic agenda, lining up nine key bills ranging from insurance reforms to new taxation frameworks for sin goods such as tobacco and pan masala. The session will run from December 1 to 19 and will also take up the first batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2025-26.A major item on the list is the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which aims to raise the foreign direct investment cap in insurance from 74 per cent to 100 per cent. The move, positioned as part of a wider effort to modernise financial-sector regulation, comes at a time when the industry has already drawn Rs 82,000 crore in FDI.On Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will also introduce two significant tax-related proposals in the Lok Sabha — The Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025 and The Health Security se National Security Cess Bill, 2025. Together, the bills aim to reshape how tobacco and pan masala are taxed. The measures would replace the GST compensation cess with an excise duty on tobacco products, while the new Health Security cess would be levied on machines or processes used to manufacture specified goods, with proceeds earmarked for national security and public health expenditure.Currently, tobacco and pan masala attract 28 per cent GST plus varying compensation cess rates.Another major reform on the agenda is the Securities Markets Code Bill, 2025, which proposes consolidating three separate laws governing India’s capital markets into a single unified code to streamline compliance and improve ease of doing business.The session is also expected to see progress on the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill, 2025, now with a Select Committee, which aims to decriminalise a wide range of minor offences and reduce regulatory friction for companies.Other economic bills planned for consideration include amendments related to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code , Manipur GST, National Highways administration, and corporate law updates — rounding out what is expected to be one of the more reform-heavy sessions in recent years.","The Winter Session of Parliament begins on Monday.

IITs bar from placement drive 20+ companies that rescinded offers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iits-bar-from-placement-drive-20-companies-that-rescinded-offers/articleshow/125706903.cms,"An IIT professor said the institutes have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by Centre under Viksit Bharat scheme

MUMBAI: Even as the placement season began across the premier IITs on Monday, more than 20 companies were banned from participating this year. These firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year, some even as late as June or July this year, at the time of joining. Since many IITs do not allow students with existing offers to sit for further interviews, such late withdrawals not only jeopardised career prospects but also affected students’ mental well-being, said officials. IITs, therefore, unanimously decided to ban these companies from the current placement cycle. IITs tried helping the concerned students despite the time lapse.The list of banned companies was finalised after these firms revoked offers at more than one IIT. Some of them are data analytics and software-based firms. They, however, are allowed to place students through off-campus process.An IIT professor involved in the placement process said the names of the companies were cross-verified by placement coordinators at 15 IITs recently. “We looked at their past records too. Some of these companies had a history of revoking offers and six to seven IITs had already banned them from participation.Offers have been revoked by some companies where some alumni are working. There were also a few companies that reduced salary packages offered in the letter. The placement cells are trying to speak to higher authorities in these companies,” said the professor.Speaking about such cancellations, a computer science graduate from IIT-Bombay’s batch of 2025, said he was hired by a trading platform last December and his joining date was June 1, 2025. “My offer was revoked on May 29. The company made me an offer of nearly Rs 30 lakh and I was more than happy to join. They revoked my offer just two days before I was supposed to join, but fortunately, I got a better offer through an alumnus in some time. Though IIT-Bombay extended help, I did not need it at that time,” said the graduate. He said some of his friends’ offers were revoked too, but a few of them landed other offers. “By June and July it becomes difficult for the institutes too to help with placements as phase-II of the process concludes by the end of the academic year,” he said.The professor added that the IITs this year have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by the Centre under the Viksit Bharat programme. “The job market is slow, but we are trying to reach out to many more companies and encourage start-ups incubated on prominent campuses to reach the best targets,” he said, adding that so far the placement season looks good.","Firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year.

The bottom line

Global arms revenues surged to an all-time high of $679 billion in 2024, up 5.9% in real terms, according to the latest SIPRI Top 100 ranking. While Europe and the US drove most of the increase, Asia and Oceania stood out as the only region to post a decline—largely due to a dramatic drop in Chinese arms company revenues, the SIPRI report said.India, though still far from being a global arms giant, posted a quiet but steady 8.2% increase in combined revenues across its three Top 100 companies. In sharp contrast, Chinese arms revenues fell 10%, a setback tied to a wave of high-profile corruption scandals and major contract delays that rattled Beijing's defense establishment.India’s three Top 100 firms-Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders-together pulled in $7.5 billion in arms revenue in 2024, up from $6.9 billion in 2023.BEL led the growth with a 24% revenue jump, hitting $2.47 billion. The boost came from domestic orders, particularly in radar systems and electronic warfare equipment, both prioritized in India’s military modernization drive.HAL, India’s top-ranked defense firm at rank 44 globally, earned $3.81 billion, a marginal 0.3% decrease from the previous year. The company faced delivery lags, but remained a cornerstone supplier to the Indian Air Force and Navy.Mazagon Dock, focused on naval shipbuilding, recorded $1.23 billion in arms revenue, with a 9.8% year-on-year increase, thanks to continued submarine and destroyer production.India is pressing ahead with its “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) campaign in defense production. While not grabbing global headlines, its incremental gains highlight an emerging industrial base that could challenge traditional suppliers over time.“The combined arms revenues of the three Indian companies in the Top 100 increased by 8.2 per cent to $7.5 billion on the back of domestic orders,” the SIPRI report said.The picture in China couldn’t be more different. For the first time in years, China’s eight arms producers in the SIPRI Top 100-previously hailed as key enablers of President Xi Jinping’s military modernization push-lost major ground.The steepest fall came from NORINCO, China’s primary land systems manufacturer, which saw its revenue plunge 31% due to corruption scandals and leadership upheaval.CASC, China’s aerospace and missile systems leader, dropped 16% following delays in military satellite programs and the removal of its president amid graft allegations.Even AVIC, the country’s biggest defense company, slipped 1.3%, hampered by delays in aircraft deliveries.“A host of corruption allegations in Chinese arms procurement led to major arms contracts being postponed or cancelled in 2024,” said Nan Tian, director of the SIPRI military expenditure and arms production programme.China’s top-down, state-controlled defense sector may be big-but its opacity leaves it vulnerable to internal shocks. Political purges tied to Xi’s sweeping anti-corruption campaign disrupted procurement and leadership pipelines across several top defense firms.Only two of China’s eight arms producers recorded revenue growth-CSSC, the shipbuilding powerhouse, was one, rising 8.7%, aligned with China’s naval buildup in the South China Sea.India’s slow, state-driven growth might lack flash, but it also avoids the internal disarray seen in Beijing. Its procurement is transparent, aligned to strategic plans, and largely free of major political scandal.China, meanwhile, is still far ahead in sheer scale but vulnerable to top-level instability.While China dragged down the region’s total, other Asian powers picked up slack:South Korean arms producers rose 31% to $14.1 billion, driven by booming exports.Japan posted the largest jump in Asia: a 40% increase in arms revenues across five firms, reaching $13.3 billion, reflecting Tokyo’s shift toward proactive defense spending amid regional tensions.US firms remain the backbone of the global arms industry. The 39 American companies in the Top 100 generated $334 billion in arms revenues in 2024, a 3.8 per cent increase that leaves them with just under half of global Top 100 sales. Lockheed Martin alone booked $64.7 billion, while RTX, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics each sat comfortably above $30 billion.Yet the American giant is struggling to turn money into timely capability. Programmes such as the F-35 fighter, the Columbia-class nuclear submarine and the Sentinel ICBM are all running late and over budget. Lockheed’s F-35 deliveries in 2024 were delayed by an average of 238 days per aircraft, and the programme’s projected sustainment costs have ballooned towards $1.6 trillion over its life. Northrop’s Sentinel programme has breached US cost-growth thresholds by around 80 per cent versus its original estimate.SIPRI’s Xiao Liang warns that “The delays and rising costs will inevitably impact US military planning and military spending… This could have knock-on effects on the US government’s efforts to cut excessive military spending and improve budget efficiency.” In plain terms, even as the US spends more, it risks getting less capability per dollar.European producers surged by 13%, reaching $151 billion, as countries rearm in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine.Russia’s corporate footprint in the SIPRI Top 100 remains surprisingly small—just two entities, Rostec and United Shipbuilding Corporation—but their combined arms revenues jumped 23 per cent in 2024 to an estimated $31.2 billion. Domestic demand linked to the Ukraine war more than offset shrinking exports. Russian plants have ramped up output of artillery shells, missiles and armoured vehicles; SIPRI cites reports of 1.3 million 152-mm shells produced in 2024, a more than fivefold increase over 2022.Where Russia is constrained, the Middle East is expanding. For the first time, nine companies from the region appear in the Top 100, with combined arms revenues of $31.0 billion, up 14 per cent where comparable data exist. Israeli firms alone generated $16.2 billion, a 16 per cent increase, fuelled both by the Gaza war and strong demand for uncrewed systems and missile defence worldwide.For India:Expect a continued push for domestic procurement and local manufacturing under the Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP).India may look to expand exports, especially to Africa and Southeast Asia, but lacks the global competitiveness of Korean or Israeli systems.For China:Beijing still accounts for around 13 per cent of total Top 100 arms revenues, and its shipyards and missile producers have been central to the rapid expansion of the PLA Navy and rocket forces over the past decade.But the 2024 rankings hint at a temporary pause or re-ordering in its modernisation drive just as tensions over Taiwan and in the South China Sea remain high.Recovery will depend on restoring procurement integrity, managing talent loss, and containing political fallout.For Asia:The regional arms race is far from over.The pivot from importing to building continues—but success will depend on supply chain resilience, governance, and geopolitical alignment.India is climbing slowly, but surely-fueled by trust in institutions, steady demand, and political will.China, long considered an unstoppable defense juggernaut, now faces turbulence not from outside threats, but from within.In the evolving landscape of Asian defense, discipline may matter more than dominance. And for now, India is playing the long game.","India posted a quiet but steady 8.2% increase in combined revenues across its three Top 100 companies.

Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw launches AI-powered portal ‘Sanchar Saathi’ to find lost phones

Govt: Sanchar Saathi must be visible, fully functional on devices

NEW DELHI: In a move that is causing some concern to the industry and privacy advocates, govt has asked smartphone makers to mandatorily pre-install its Sanchar Saathi app on their devices. Govt says this is being done to strengthen cyber security on the devices and prevent tampering and spoofing of the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number.The order, originally issued on Nov 21, gives device makers - including Apple, Samsung, Google, Motorola, and Chinese firms Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo - 90 days to comply with the regulation or face penalties.Sanchar Saathi is pitched as a citizen-centric initiative of DoT that promises to ""empower mobile subscribers and strengthen their security"" while increasing awareness about govt initiatives.An order recently issued by govt to handset manufacturers states, ""Central govt hereby directs every manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets that are intended for use in India to... ensure that the Sanchar Saathi mobile application, as specified by DoT, is pre-installed on all mobile handsets manufactured or imported for use in India."" It also directs companies to ensure that the pre-installed app is ""readily visible and accessible to end users"" at the time of first use or device setup and that ""its functionalities are not disabled or restricted"".Nikhil Pahwa, founder of tech policy analysis company Medianama, said the order was ""bad news"" for mobile phone users and their privacy. ""Legally, one can argue that your mobile phone is your personal space, and this is an invasion of your personal space. It's where we have our most private conversations and exchange sensitive information with people we trust. How do we know this app isn't used to access files and messages on our device? Or a future update won't do that? This is clearly an invasion of our privacy. Remember how govt exempts itself from much of the Data Protection Law. This explains why,"" Pahwa said. The order is valid even for devices being imported into the country, or still in pre-sales transit.The direction has been given under Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Rules, 2024, and its further amendments.","Govt has asked smartphone makers to mandatorily pre-install its Sanchar Saathi app on their devices.

When a finance executive at a British engineering firm, Arup, joined a routine Skype meeting in Jan 2024, familiar faces filled the screen. The company leaders he had interacted with countless times spoke with authority, blinked naturally, and smiled reassuringly. Except the people on screen were not real, and the AI-crafted doubles duped the firm, which worked on the Statue of Unity and India’s rail projects, of nearly $25 million. The deepfakes were so flawless that 15 transfers from the Hong Kong office went through before anyone realised the con.Months later, a deepfake surfaced closer to home. At the India office of a global chipmaker, a man used artificial intelligence (AI) to impersonate a real job candidate in an online interview. “He synced facial movements and tone quite well but we detected the use of deepfake tech, and he was out,” says Naveen Sharma, co-founder of Kroop AI, which built Vizmantiz, a detection tool for synthetic videos and audio.India’s deepfake saga began in 2020, when deepfake videos of politician Manoj Tiwari “speaking fluent Haryanvi” to appeal to voters went viral ahead of Delhi assembly polls. By mid-2023, the menace had turned personal: in Kerala, a 73-year-old man lost Rs 40,000 following a WhatsApp deepfake call seemingly from his friend, pleading for urgent help from Dubai.India recorded a staggering 280% year-on-year increase in deepfake incidents in Q1 2024, particularly in the leadup to national elections, reported Sumsub, a global identity verification provider. A McAfee survey in Nov 2024 found 75% of Indians had seen deepfake content in the past year, and 45%reported that they knew someone who had been duped by a deepfake fraud.“The term ‘deepfake’ covers both synthetic content created from scratch and manipulated content that alters existing videos,” said Sharma. “Both forms distort truth: one invents it, the other rewrites it.”Forensic experts are now learning to read what AI cannot hide. “Deepfake audio is often too clean, lacking normal background noise,” says Dr Surbhi Mathur, head of Centre of Excellence in Multimedia Forensics at National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU). “AI faces also lack natural light variations and photo response non-uniformity (PRNU) — the ‘fingerprint’ left by camera sensors. The facial micro-expressions often lacks natural blinking patterns, or the way someone moves their face or their hands near the face. ”Sandeep Shukla, director of International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, says, “There are tools that claim over 90% accuracy in deepfake detection. However, as these rely on neural network-based deep learning tech, there’s no guarantee that every form of media manipulation will be detected.” Police and judges must be trained in detection and its limits, he urges. “And, when guilt is proven, the punishment must be high enough to act as a deterrent. ”The surge in deepfake content is driven by mass appeal, says Mathur. “Scammers exploit trusted faces for massive financial gain.” Since 2023, the deepfakes analysis unit (DAU), established under the Misinformation Combat Alliance with support from the corporate affairs and IT ministries, has tracked hundreds of AI-created scams. Fabricated “endorsements” for investment schemes and gaming apps have used the faces of Ratan Tata, N R Narayana Murthy, Rahul Gandhi, Nirmala Sitharaman, Virat Kohli, and even doctors Naresh Trehan and Devi Shetty for bogus health cures. A viral Ratan Tata “investment video” was found to be 83.8% AI-generated. Tata later publicly debunked it on Instagram.In Nov 2023, a deepfake of actor Rashmika Mandanna was created by morphing influencer Zara Patel’s face. Experts warn that ‘DeepNude’ or AI-generated explicit content created without consent pose grave risks to women’s privacy.With no dedicated deepfake law, several Bollywood actors are taking legal recourse. Delhi HC has issued ‘John Doe’ orders that allow legal action against anonymous offenders. It introduced ‘dynamic+ injunctions’, which compel platforms to remove the original deepfake as well as proactively monitor and take down re-uploads.Sharma identified the “most dangerous” use of deepfakes in the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector. He says that during online know your customer (KYC) processes,“I can clone a voice or face, and the system may verify that person as genuine”.To tackle this, the “first mandate” of the upcoming deepfake policy will require “BFSI to use deepfake detectors for KYC and document verification,” Sharma reveals. Amendments to the IT Rules, 2021, will enforce content labelling over 10% of the screen or audio, and faster takedowns — within 36 hours, or three hours during elections. “A person circulating or a platform hosting deepfake content, even unknowingly, will face legal action,” he says.However, experts say India must move faster. “Technology changes every 15-20 days and scammers evolve just as quickly,” warns Sharma.“We need laws, detection, and awareness that move at the same speed.”uses a public-private model for deepfake detection and digital forensicstackles image-based abuse, deepfake threatsallows anonymous reporting of deepfake, cyber abuse incidents to aid state police forcesfocuses on real-time deepfake detection for images, video, audiodevelops Explainable AI (Xai) for deepfakes, signature forgeryspecifically targets AI-generated voice impersonation to prevent fraud Images : AI‘Too clean’ audio lacking normal background noise is a red flagSounding scripted, robotic, lacking human cadence or characteristic pausesSudden changes in pitch, tone following awkward cut or pauseDistinct noise like human breathing, heard during pausesLip synchronisation errors or the mouth moving during audio pausesDeepfakes often miss the natural shadow effects and light variationsObjects near the face (e.g., microphone, hands) merging unnaturally into the chin or jawlineTeeth appearing blurred, inconsistent, or lacking definition, are common flawsUnique artefacts carried by the application that created the imageUses blood flow analysis to detect deepfakes by checking facial colouration caused by heartbeatsUsed to check if an audio is AI-generatedThe open platform detects synthetic contentProprietary software for voice and audio authenticity checkDetects AI images, especially from models like DALL·E 3","India recorded a staggering 280% year-on-year increase in deepfake incidents in Q1 2024, particularly in the leadup to national elections.

"Show results of anti-pollution steps: SC to Centre, NCR govts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/show-results-of-anti-pollution-steps-sc-to-centre-ncr-govts/articleshow/125706824.cms,"'We Can’t Breathe': Activists, Parents, Kids Held During Delhi Clean-Air Protest At India Gate

Measures must be implemented round the year, says apex court

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday bristled at attempts to pin the blame for Delhi-NCR air pollution on farm fires and asked the Union and NCR govts to detail measures taken on other pollution sources — vehicles, industries, construction, dust — and the tangible results achieved through implementation of such steps.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Aparajita Singh and additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said stubble burning incidents contribute to pollution in Delhi-NCR for just 15 days in winter months, but there are other major causes of pollution which need to be addressed round the year.In defence of farmers, a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, “Let stubble burning not be made a political or ego issue. During Covid (lockdown), stubble burning was there. Yet, we could see stars in the night sky. You (govt) say measures have been taken. Still, we can’t see stars. What are the tangible results achieved through enforcement of graded action plan (Grap)? What actions have been taken against other sources of pollution?”What is being done about high-end gas guzzlers, the bench asked. “Strengthening quality public transport is key to reducing vehicular contribution towards air pollution. But that will take time and should be part of the long-term plan,” it said, adding that financial empowerment of people in India has led to a burgeoning number of cars in the capital city, which was not planned to accommodate so many people with individual vehicles.As Bhati informed the court that the number of incidents of stubble burning has gradually gone down in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, the bench asked if there has been corresponding improvement in air quality in Delhi-NCR. “Normatively, you might have banned construction activities but is there sincere implementation on the ground?”Bhati admitted that Grap restrictions have not been scrupulously enforced.The bench said that both short-term and long-term measures require intensive implementation round the year and promised that matters relating to air pollution would be heard by SC at least twice a month round the year.Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar said all thermal power plants were required to implement sulphur dioxide emission control measures, primarily by installing the Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system, by 2021.The deadline has been extended by the govt several times, and now the thermal power plants have been asked to implement the emission control measure by 2027-29, he said.When Bhati said that the govt has already filed both short-term and long-term plans to tackle the problem of air pollution, the bench asked why they are not been revisited if they have not been able to reduce pollution.On many occasions, the rural-urban bias of experts results in misdirection of efforts to curb pollution, it said, and suggested that experts aware of ground realities of India, not those who studied at Harvard or other foreign universities, prepare action plans.The bench posted the matter for further hearing on Dec 10.","Supreme Court bristled at attempts to pin the blame for Delhi-NCR air pollution on farm fires.

Supreme Court Stays Key Provisions Of Waqf Amendment Act, Refuses To Suspend Other Proposals

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday refused to extend time for the mandatory registration of all waqf properties on the UMEED portal and asked those who have not done so to approach the tribunal constituted under Waqf (Amendment) Act, which has the power to extend the period by six months.Running against time to comply with registration as the deadline is to expire on Dec 6, a batch of petitions were filed in the apex court, including by All India Muslim Personal Law Board, for extension of time on various grounds including because of technical glitches encountered in accessing the portal. But the Centre strongly opposed the plea saying the Act states the extension can be granted by the waqf tribunal and aggrieved persons should approach it.Appearing before a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and A G Masih, senior advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi and M R Samshad said that so far, only around 1.6 lakh properties had been uploaded, and while the total number of such assets might be above 10 lakh, it would be difficult to upload details within the short span of time.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, however, said the court’s interference to extend the date would amount to amending the law itself which provided six months time.He also told SC the issue can be examined by the tribunal.Section 3B of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025 says every waqf registered under this Act shall file the details of the waqf and the property dedicated to the waqf on the portal and database, within a period of six months from such commencement. It, however, provides that the tribunal may, on an application made to it by the mutawalli, extend such period of six months under this section for a further period not exceeding six months as it may consider appropriate, if he satisfies the tribunal that he had sufficient cause for not filing the details of the waqf on the portal within such period.Taking note that the issue could be examined by the tribunal, the bench refused to extend the time. SC said that facing technical problems in uploading details of the properties would be a valid ground to seek a further six months time from the tribunal. “Technical glitch is a very good reason to seek extension from tribunal,” the bench said.The court had in Sept declined to stay many of the provisions under challenge in a batch of petitions challenging the amendments, including the requirement for all waqfs to be registered under section 3B, considering such a registration requirement was there earlier as well.","Supreme Court on Monday refused to extend time for the mandatory registration of all waqf properties on the UMEED portal.

SIR debate demand wipes out Day 1 of winter session,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sir-debate-demand-wipes-out-day-1-of-winter-session/articleshow/125706228.cms,"Watch: MPs Speak Out as SIR Row Dominates Winter Session Opening

You can’t dictate timeline for govt call on

SIR debate

, Rijiju tells oppn

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties disrupted proceedings in Lok Sabha and walked out of Rajya Sabha on the first day of the winter session after govt refused to concede their demand to immediately allow a debate on the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls being conducted by Election Commission.They rejected the stand of parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju that the demand for debate over SIR was under consideration but govt could not be tied to a timeline.The forthcoming days are likely to see more disruptions as there is no indication that the govt might relent on its stand not to discuss the functioning of Election Commission, an independent body. The opposition is determined to force the issue and chose the path of confrontation despite misgivings among smaller INDIA bloc parties.There are signs suggesting that Trinamool is ploughing its own furrow in the matter (special intensive revision of electoral rolls being conducted by Election Commission) rather than following Congress. At a meeting of the grouping, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, is learnt to have repeated his “vote manipulation” charge — a clear sign that Congress would remain hewed to its stand opposing special intensive revision.There were repeated adjournments in the first half of the session as opposition shouted slogans disregarding Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla’s appeal not to do so. “You can raise slogans outside but not in the House,” he said. A bill introduced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to implement amendments to GST law in Manipur was passed in Lok Sabha amid the din.Sitharaman also introduced in Lok Sabha two new bills that seek to repurpose levies on ‘sin goods’ such as tobacco, pan masala and related products. However, with opposition persisting with its slogan shouting, the House had to be adjourned for the day in the second half.In Rajya Sabha, opposition MPs were on their feet to press their demand soon after the felicitation of chairman C P Radhakrishnan, who chaired the proceedings for the first time since his election as Vice President in Sept this year.TMC member Derek O’Brien said that parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju had promised them on Sunday to get back to them on their demand that SIR should be taken up under the broader agenda of “electoral reforms”. Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, and CPM’s John Brittas joined in the demand.They cited suicides by booth-level officers (BLOs) due to alleged workload, with Kharge calling for taking up the debate on SIR first as they have been demanding it since last session.Rijiju reiterated that their demand is under govt’s consideration and that he would get back as soon as possible. “Nobody is undermining the matter taken up by opposition. It is under consideration of govt. But you cannot impose conditions like taking up the discussion today. There are opposition parties other than a dozen (demanding debate on SIR), who represent different states and want discussion on other issues,” he said. Opposition MPs told Rijiju that he had promised on Sunday to convey to them govt’s decision by 9pm the same day. Rijiju, however, said opposition cannot dictate a timeline.“Timeline is not the problem. But there is a trust deficit,” retorted Derek. Opposition members then staged a walkout in protest, following which the Chair took up special mentions and Zero Hour.Opposition functionaries said that they will continue to stick to their demand for SIR discussion on Tuesday and will take stock of the situation on Wednesday amid slender hope in its ranks that govt could agree.INDIA bloc will protest against the SIR at the Parliament entrance on Tuesday morning, in what will be reminiscent of the Monsoon session that was washed out over protests against ‘vote chori’.Many eyebrows were raised when Trinamool did not join the meeting of INDIA bloc held at Congress’s initiative. Also, smaller parties from Kerala like CPI, CPM, RSP and IUML felt that complete washout of proceedings should be avoided as there were important issues to be highlighted.Congress president Kharge sympathised with them, but said the issue of SIR is important and govt should accept the demand for discussion even if it is under some other subject like “electoral reforms”.But, sources said, a difference of views was the reason why opposition has decided to take a fresh look at the issue after two days.",Opposition parties disrupted proceedings in Lok Sabha and walked out of Rajya Sabha on the first day of the winter session.

In what raises privacy concerns and fears around state surveillance, govt has asked smartphone makers to mandatorily pre-install its Sanchar Saathi app on their devices, ostensibly to strengthen cyber security on the devices and prevent tampering and spoofing of IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number.The order, originally issued on November 21, gives the device makers – ranging from Apple, Samsung, Google, Motorola, and the Chinese lot of Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo – 90 days to comply with the regulation or otherwise face penalties. The govt’s order is even valid for devices being imported to the country, or still in pre-sales transit.The direction -- that raised red flags within the industry as well as privacy advocates -- said, “Central govt hereby directs every manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets that are intended for use in India to… ensure that the Sanchar Saathi mobile application, as specified by Department of Telecom (DoT), is pre-installed on all mobile handsets manufactured or imported for use in India.”And to ensure that the exercise does not end up as mere eyewash, the order also asks the companies to ensure that the pre-installed Sanchar Saathi app is “readily visible and accessible to the end users” at the time of first use or device setup and that “its functionalities are not disabled or restricted”.The order said that a provision to follow the instructions should also be made for devices which are in transit for sales.“For all such devices that have already been manufactured and are in sales channels in India, the manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets shall make an endeavour to push the App through software updates.”Sanchar Saathi is pitched as a citizen-centric initiative of DoT that promises to “empower mobile subscribers, strengthen their security” while increasing awareness about govt initiatives.The direction has been given under the Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Rules, 2024, and its further amendments. “Rule 5 of the Rules empowers the govt to establish digital or other mechanisms necessary to identify and report acts that may endanger telecom cyber security, and accordingly, the DoT has instituted the Sanchar Saathi App, that, inter-alia, enables stakeholders to report IMEI related suspicious misuse and also to verify authenticity of IMEIs used in mobile devices,” the order said.The order said that mobile handsets bearing duplicate or spoofed IMEI pose serious danger to telecom cyber security.Govt instructed the manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets to submit compliance reports to the DoT within 120 days from issue of the directions. “Failure to comply with these directions shall attract action under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, 2024 (as amended), and other applicable laws.”","The order, originally issued on November 21, gives the device makers – ranging from Apple, Samsung, Google, Motorola, and the Chinese lot of Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo – 90 days to comply with the regulation.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court order for pan-India CBI probe into 'digital arrest' cases, while signifying the threat from digital scamsters, is important also because the opposition-governed states had withdrawn ""general consent"" to CBI to probe crimes in their territories.Keeping two other forms of cyber-crime - investment scams and part-time job scams - on the back burner, the bench said CBI shall investigate digital arrest scam cases, and the court will consider whether the other two forms of cyber-crime require court supervision/monitoring. Suspecting assistance to scamsters by banking system insiders, the bench said, ""CBI shall have a free hand to investigate bankers under Prevention of Corruption Act when they are suspected to be involved in the opening of 'mule accounts' where the fraudsters park their extorted monies. ""CJI Kant and Justice Bagchi said that given the magnitude of the crimes and the fact that many of them were being committed from 'scam hubs' located in foreign countries, ""we direct the CBI to coordinate with Interpol to lay their hands on the cyber-crime havens operating from abroad"".The bench also issued notice to RBI and asked it to explain to the court why artificial intelligence tools or machine-learning technologies should not be employed to identify mule accounts in banks and freeze the deposits suspected to be proceeds of crime.The court also directed the IT intermediaries to preserve data relating to phones and equipment used by fraudsters, provide it to CBI and render full assistance to the central agency as and when sought in a particular case or in general.The bench further said that there is widespread breach of norms in issuance of SIM cards. ""Facts brought on record so far reveal an alarming negligent and irresponsible approach of telecom service providers while issuing multiple SIM cards in one name. We direct the DoT to submit a proposal for the consideration of SC, which may eventually be required to be implemented to prevent misuse of SIM cards,"" it said.SC directed all states and UTs to ensure establishment of regional/state Cyber-Crime Coordination Centres and operationalise them for better coordination with Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) of MHA so that effective steps could be taken against cyber-crimes, especially digital arrest scam cases.It asked MHA, ministry of finance, DoT, MeitY to submit a detailed plan of action for coordinated steps against digital arrest scam cases.The court adjourned hearing on the case by two weeks to enable CBI to choose experienced hands from state police forces as well as experts in information technology who can assist it in investigating digital arrest cases across India.","Supreme Court order for pan-India CBI probe into 'digital arrest' cases.

If CBFC considers it relevant to refer the matter to the Indian Army for necessary approvals, they should do that too.

PM Modi’s ‘Drama Nahi, Delivery’ Message Sets Fiery Tone As Winter Session Begins Amid Tensions

NEW DELHI: Eight states and a Union territory have changed the name of their governor/lieutenant governor’s house from ‘Raj Bhavan/Raj Niwas’ to ‘Lok Bhavan/Lok Niwas’ following a directive from ministry of home affairs (MHA) to shed the earlier nomenclature associated with colonial era.In a letter to principal secretaries or secretaries to state governors and lieutenant governors of UTs, the home ministry cited the suggestion made at the conference of governors held last year “to rename ‘Raj Bhavans’ as ‘Lok Bhavans’ as the word ‘Raj Bhavan’ smacks of colonialism.”“Accordingly, it is requested that offices of governor and office of Lt governor may be named as ‘Lok Bhavan’ and ‘Lok Niwas’, respectively, for all official purposes,” said the MHA directive.Taking cue from the MHA letter, states/UTs have started shedding the word ‘Raj’ from the nomenclature of governor/lieutenant governor’s residence-cum-office.West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Uttarakhand, Odisha, Gujarat and Tripura have effected the change and renamed ‘Raj Bhavan’ as ‘Lok Bhavan’. Ladakh’s Raj Niwas, the official residence and office of LG Kavinder Gupta, has been renamed as ‘Lok Niwas’.The Modi govt has been working on shedding the vestiges of India’s colonial past; it had earlier renamed Rajpath as Kartavya Path and has been using ‘Bharat’ instead of ‘India’ in many official communications.

Winter diseases you must be careful about as days get colder

Parts of NW, NE & Himalayan foothills may see hotter days

NEW DELHI: The upcoming winter (Dec-Feb) is likely to be colder in most parts of central India (Madhya Pradesh, north and east Maharashtra and parts of Gujarat) and parts of adjoining northwest ( Punjab , Haryana, Delhi, east and southeast Rajasthan, and west and south UP) and peninsular India (Telangana), with below normal day and night temperatures and 4-5 additional cold wave days, IMD said on Monday.These states normally get 4-6 days of cold wave days during Dec-Feb, but this time the region may get a total of 8-11 cold wave days. Parts of northeast India may also get additional cold wave days.Most of these states are also likely to experience below normal temperatures in Dec, with one to three additional cold wave days. This means there could be 3-6 days cold wave days during the month.The season’s first spell of cold-to-severe-cold wave conditions started early this year and were observed at isolated pockets over west, central and adjoining east India.Cold-to-severe-cold wave days were recorded in northeast Rajasthan, south Haryana, north Madhya Pradesh, south UP and north Chhattisgarh during Nov 8-18, and over north interior Maharashtra on Nov 15 and Nov 20. A cold wave is declared when the minimum (night) temperature of a station is 10 degrees Celsius or less for plains and 0 degree Celsius or less for hilly regions, and it is below normal by 4.5-6.4 degrees Celsius.Underlining the impact of such weather, IMD said above-normal cold wave conditions may increase health risks for vulnerable groups, including senior citizens, children and individuals with underlying medical conditions.“Early morning fog could reduce visibility and disrupt road, rail and air transportation, while stagnant atmospheric conditions may further deteriorate air quality in some urban areas. Weather-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, horticulture and daily-wage labour may face operational challenges during extended cold spells,” it said.“During the upcoming winter season (Dec 2025 to Feb 2026) normal to below-normal minimum (night) temperatures are likely over most parts of central India and adjoining peninsular and northwest India... However, some regions, including parts of northwest India, northeast India and areas along the foothills of the Himalayas, are likely to experience above-normal maximum (day) temperatures,” said IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra.While releasing the outlook for the cold weather season, he said, “The occurrence of cold waves during Dec is likely to be above normal over parts of northwest, central and northeast India.”Referring to the forecast, the Met department advised authorities to maintain heightened preparedness. “Both the public and agencies concerned are encouraged to regularly monitor the impact-based forecast (IBF) issued through IMD’s daily early-warning services for timely updates,” it said.","The upcoming winter (Dec-Feb) is likely to be colder in most parts of central India.

Major Twist In BrahMos Espionage Case As Higher Court Acquits Scientist Of Passing Defence Secrets

Other scientists were also on Pakistan agents’ radar: Defence lawyer

NAGPUR: Seven years after his arrest, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court on Monday exonerated a former scientist with BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited, Nishant Agarwal, of charges of espionage and cyber terrorism, but upheld his conviction under Section 3(1) C of Official Secrets Act for possessing classified information on his personal device, carrying a three-year sentence. Having already served a longer period in jail, his lawyers say the ruling paves way for his release.Agarwal had been accused of passing missile secrets to Pakistani intelligence operatives and of cyber terrorism, offences for which a sessions court had imposed a 14-year term. The high court set aside those convictions after hearing his appeal against the trial court's June 2024 judgment, while maintaining the finding that he illegally held sensitive data.Arrested in October 2018, Agarwal remained in custody till he secured bail in April 2023. He was again sent to prison in June 2024 after the lower court convicted him on all counts.Advocate Chaitanya Barve, who argued Agarwal's appeal, said, ""Formalities for his release will be initiated after the order copy is received. One of his main contentions was a deposition by an expert from India Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), that none of the information was passed on to any other device from Agarwal's laptop.The point was stressed to prove there was no leakage of information to an enemy agent. The conviction that he illegally held information in his personal device will also be challenged.""CERT-In is a govt body that deals with computer-related issues like hacking.Agarwal lost his post at BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited, an Indo-Russian joint venture, soon after his arrest. He was represented at the high court by senior counsel Sunil Manohar, with Barve assisting.He came under the scanner in October 2018, when a team from the Anti-Terrorist Squad of Uttar Pradesh, joined by Maharashtra counterparts, questioned him at dawn on a Dussehra holiday and arrested him after a day's interrogation. A young scientist who had received the President's award and married less than a year earlier, Agarwal faced charges under Section 66F of Information Technology Act for cyber terrorism and under section 5(a)(b)(c)(d) and section 5(3) of the Official Secrets Act for holding classified information, the latter attracting the three-year term.According to Maharashtra ATS, Agarwal was allegedly in contact with two Pakistani agents posing as young women — Neha Sharma, Pooja Ranjan and Sejal Kapoor —via social media apps such as Facebook. They purported to offer him an overseas job and, purportedly through malware embedded in Qwhisper, Chat to Hire and X Trust, extracted sensitive missile information from his personal computer in violation of BAPL's strict security protocol.Defence lawyer Chaitanya Barve during cross examination proceedings in the high court on Monday stated Pakistani agents had tried to establish contact with other officials of BrahMos Aerospace Private Limited (BAPL), besides Nishant Agarwal. The two Pakistani intelligence operatives posing as Indian girls — Neha Sharma and Pooja Ranjan — were also in the friend list of their social media apps, he stated, adding this part of the enemy’s meticulous planning to extract information.Sources in BAPL told TOI that no classified data was lost and though Agarwal had some information on his personal device, it was not of much help to enemy agents. This is because a single employee does not have access to complete data of the system.They added that former scientist Nishant Agarwal was too low in the hierarchy to access any critical or sensitive information that could have been valuable to an adversary. However, the organisation’s rules prohibit copying data from official systems onto personal devices.The anti-terrorist squad had also cross-verified with BAPL, seeking to confirm whether the documents found with Agarwal were part of secret information, the source said. The organisation has a well-layered security system designed to prevent unauthorised copying or leakage of data, the source added.","Nishant Agarwal had been accused of passing missile secrets to Pakistani intelligence operatives and of cyber terrorism.

NEW DELHI: A new analysis of early winter trends in Delhi-NCR by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) revealed that particulate matter 2.5 rose and fell almost in tandem with nitrogen dioxide during morning (7-10 am) and evening (6-9 pm) hours, as both pollutants surged with traffic emissions before being trapped near the surface by shallow winter boundary layers.While carbon monoxide showed sharper, more immediate peaks linked to vehicular plumes, PM2.5 displayed broader peaks as fine particles accumulated and dispersed more slowly. Carbon monoxide, another highly toxic pollutant that curdles the blood and is predominantly emitted by vehicles, showed widespread exceedances across Delhi this winter, said CSE.Nearly 22 monitoring stations in Delhi recorded carbon monoxide levels above the 8-hour standard on more than 30 out of 59 days, beginning Oct 1, indicating persistent traffic-linked emissions. Dwarka Sector 8 was the worst affected, with 55 exceedance days, followed by Jahangirpuri and DU North Campus (50 days each).This synchronised pattern clearly demonstrates that the daily particulate pollution spikes are closely reinforced by traffic-related emissions of both nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, especially under low-dispersion winter conditions. ""This cocktail of pollutants also makes the air more toxic to breathe.Yet, every winter, anti-pollution efforts are dominated by dust-control measures with feeble action against polluting vehicles and industry as well as burning of waste and solid fuel,"" said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE.Since the contribution of farm fires to Delhi's pollution has decreased this year, it means local sources are adding to the foul air, the organisation said. Peak levels of pollution during early winter were lower compared to the previous year due to less farm fires, but average winter trends have remained nearly the same.""Since 2022, the annual trend in PM2.5 levels plateaued and even took an upward turn, showing plateauing of pollution at an elevated level. Between 2018 and 2020 (start of the pandemic), there was a steady decline in year-on-year PM2.5 levels in Delhi. But from 2021-22, the levels have remained largely elevated and stable with slight variations,"" said CSE, adding that Delhi continues to breathe extremely polluted air throughout the year, with no sustained downward trend.The report found that several NCR cities remained just as polluted, and often worse. A region-wide smog episode affected NCR towns, but it was Bahadurgarh that endured the most persistent conditions, with the episode lasting a full 10 days — from Nov 9 to 18. ""Smaller towns in the region display more intense and longer smog build-up. Even though peak pollution spikes are lower this winter due to lesser contribution of farm fires, the airshed is getting increasingly more saturated,"" said Sharanjeet Kaur, deputy programme manager, urban lab, clean air unit, CSE.To deal with pollution, the report recommends meeting electrification targets for all segments of vehicles in a time-bound manner and replacing older vehicles. It proposes upscaling integrated public transport with last-mile connectivity and walking and cycling infrastructure, restraining the use of personal vehicles with the help of parking caps and congestion tax. It recommends encouraging the industry to switch over to affordable cleaner fuels, closing the waste loop to stop burning, ensuring access to clean fuels for households and decomposing or ploughing straw back into the soil to increase soil carbon.","Analysis of early winter trends in Delhi-NCR by Centre for Science and Environment.

and S-team,

In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond.

We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis.

We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth.

We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm:

Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming. Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019.

The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants.

Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas.

Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement.

Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional.

Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally,

Jeff Bezos

owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance.

All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need.

We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following:

No AI with dirty energy.

No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments.

No AI without employee voices.

We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact.

No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.

Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine.

The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are.

This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of.

Signed,

1,039 Amazon employees (and counting!)





Thousands of Amazon employees have signed an open letter issuing some dire warnings about the company’s move toward AI. The letter, signed by more than 1,000 workers (and counting) calls out Amazon for pushing its AI investments at the expense of the climate and its human workforce. The letter’s supporters come from a wide array of roles at the company, including many software engineers, and even employees focused on building AI systems. ""We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth,” the letter’s authors wrote. It adds, “We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene.”The open letter is reportedly signed by Amazon workers anonymously, and comes almost a month after Amazon announced mass layoff plans as it increases adoption of AI in its operations. Among the signatories are employees in a range of positions, including engineers, product managers and warehouse associates. The letter argues that their employer is throwing out its climate promises in the scramble to win the AI race.Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, pointing to efficiencies from electric delivery vehicles and reduced plastic packaging in its climate commitment.","Over 1,000 Amazon employees have penned an open letter expressing grave concerns about the company's rapid AI development. They warn of significant damage to democracy, jobs, and the environment.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

How Elon Musk sees AI and robotics reshaping global industries





Elon Musk: A Different Conversation w/ Nikhil Kamath | Full Episode | People by WTF Ep. 16

Elon Musk’s prediction of AI-driven instant manufacturing





Elon Musk’s view of AI evolving beyond human well-being goals





Elon Musk’s vision of a future where ‘money becomes irrelevant’









Elon Musk has once again shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour. During a conversation on Nikhil Kamath’s People by WTF podcast, the Tesla and SpaceX chief suggested that the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and robotics is pushing society towards a future where humans no longer need to work to survive. Musk’s view is rooted in the belief that machines will eventually handle all essential tasks, allowing people to approach work as a creative or recreational activity rather than an economic necessity.He expressed strong confidence that the world could reach this turning point within the next two decades. For Musk, this future is not a distant fantasy but a likely outcome of the accelerating technological breakthroughs unfolding today.Musk argued that the extraordinary pace of development in AI models, autonomous systems, and humanoid robots is already rapidly reshaping industries worldwide. According to him, the next phase of technological growth will create intelligent machines that can replicate or even surpass human capability in almost every domain, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare, education, and creative services.He believes that this massive transition may occur much sooner than most people expect, possibly within ten to fifteen years. Musk compared future labour to home gardening. Just as people may choose to grow vegetables for enjoyment rather than necessity, he thinks future generations will increasingly engage in work for personal fulfilment, creativity, or social contribution rather than mere survival. The essential work that maintains society will be managed entirely by advanced automated systems that require minimal or no human oversight.A core part of Musk’s argument is that AI systems will eventually be able to create anything a person can imagine. His own AI company, xAI, along with its chatbot Grok, reflects his belief that increasingly capable generative systems will expand into physical production through robotics, automation, and smart manufacturing techniques. As these technologies combine, they could enable a world where scarcity becomes obsolete and resource distribution becomes more equitable. Musk visualises a future in which goods and services can be produced instantly and efficiently.He emphasised that the ability to turn ideas into tangible products without traditional labour inputs would fundamentally reshape economies, social structures, and the global workforce. Once technology reaches this stage, he thinks most constraints on human consumption and lifestyle will disappear, creating unprecedented opportunities for innovation, creativity, and human progress.Musk also explored a lesser-discussed aspect of hyper-advanced AI. He suggested that there may come a time when AI and robotics complete every possible task aimed at improving human well-being. After satisfying all imaginable human desires and demands, these systems could reach a saturation point where they no longer have meaningful human-centred tasks to perform.At that stage, Musk believes AI may begin working on activities that serve its own optimisation because the catalogue of tasks that benefit humanity is finite. This idea raises profound questions about the long-term relationship between humans and intelligent machines once human needs are no longer the defining force behind technological activity. Musk’s predictions extend far beyond the automation of work. At the US Saudi Investment Forum earlier this month, he stated that humanoid robots and AI systems have the potential to eliminate poverty. His argument relies on the assumption that when machines can produce goods for virtually no cost and at limitless volume, wealth becomes universal because essential resources are accessible to everyone.If machines can meet all human needs, the traditional economic struggle for income, resources, and opportunity would disappear. Musk envisions a world where every person benefits equally from the capabilities of intelligent robots that can generate abundance without relying on human labour.In his discussion with Kamath, Musk introduced an even more radical idea. He predicted that money might eventually lose its relevance. In his view, money exists primarily as a tool for allocating labour and determining the value of goods that require human effort to produce. If production becomes entirely automated and unlimited, the need for money as a mechanism for distribution fades.Musk suggested that in such a world, the primary form of value might shift towards power generation. Energy would become the foundational currency because machines require it to operate, create and sustain the systems that support human life. The economy would therefore revolve around energy capacity rather than labour or manufactured goods.","Elon Musk has shared a striking prediction about the future of human labour.

Gemini 3 boosts Google’s market value





Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi

Years of hard work





Google CEO Sundar Pichai on AI layoffs









Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0. Announcing the launch of Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that it is ‘the best model in the world for multimodal understanding’. Now weeks after the intense work on Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has acknowledged that his engineers are overdue for a break. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Google AI” Release Notes podcast, Pichai said “I think some folks need some sleep,” adding that hopefully he and his teams “get a bit of rest” now that the milestone launch is behind them.The comment made by Pichai comes as Google is moving towards a $4 trillion market cap as the stock price of the company has surged by nearly 70% this year, including a 12% jump following Gemini 3’s debut on November 18. The Gemini 3.0 model has been widely praised for its reasoning, speed and multimodal capabilities. Recently, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also described the Gemini 3.0 model as an ‘insane’ leap forward. He also added that after using Gemini 3.0 for two hours he will not go back to ChatGPT.After the successful roll out of Gemini 3.0, Google has managed to reclaim its frontrunner position in the AI race. Pichai noted that years of hard work of the company is the sole reason behind this success.“In 2016, I wanted the whole company to be AI-first,” he said, pointing to milestones such as the creation of Google Brain in 2012, the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014, AlphaGo’s victory in Go, and the unveiling of Google’s own tensor processing units (TPUs), which were used to train Gemini.Pichai further talked about the Google’s strategy. Pichai explained that Google always worked towards a “full-stack” approach to innovation, improving everything from infrastructure to model training and test-time compute. He admitted that when generative AI first gained traction, Google was short on capacity and had to invest heavily to scale. “If you were on the outside, it would look like we were quiet, or we were behind, but we were putting all the building blocks in place, and then executing on top of it,” he said.Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked about AI layoffs. In a recent expansive interview with BBC, Sundar Pichai pushed back against concerns that AI could eventually lead to mass job cuts. Pichai said that the tech will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others -- ramifications that mean ""people will need to adapt.""Pichai further added that AI may be gunning for his job, but he doesn’t seem too worried about it. AI is advancing so swiftly, he said, that over the next 12 months the tech will be able to perform “complex” tasks and act as an agent on a users' behalf. ""That’s where it gets really interesting,"" he said.",Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0.

He posits that while AI can manage technical tasks, the human touch—through empathy and collaboration—remains irreplaceable in driving success.

Social intelligence gains prominence in AI era

CEO reshapes Microsoft’s culture with 'growth mindset' approach





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella emphasized that emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly vital in the workplace as artificial intelligence takes over more technical responsibilities, calling empathy a crucial business skill rather than just a soft skill.During a recent conversation with Axel Springer CEO Mathias Döpfner on the ""MD Meets"" podcast that aired November 29, Nadella stated that leaders cannot succeed with intelligence quotient alone. ""IQ has a place, but it's not the only thing that's needed in the world,"" he said in the interview. ""I've always felt, at least leaders, if you just have IQ without EQ, it's just a waste of IQ.""Nadella added that social intelligence is also becoming key as AI handles more technical tasks. The Microsoft chief executive has consistently maintained that empathy represents an important business capability, not merely a peripheral soft skill.When Döpfner questioned whether the growing importance of empathy influenced Microsoft's decision to implement return-to-office mandates starting early next year, Nadella responded that recognizing the role of human collaboration is even more crucial in the age of AI, describing the workplace as ""the best collaboration tool.""However, he clarified he doesn't want to be overly rigid about office return policies.Nadella has recently restructured Microsoft's leadership team partly to enhance competitiveness in the AI race, with the company pursuing artificial general intelligence through its new superintelligence team.The emphasis on soft skills comes as many workplaces are starting to value problem-solving, emotional intelligence, and creativity as they delegate more technical responsibilities to AI, according to executives and workplace transformation experts.Nadella's leadership philosophy centers on what he calls a ""growth mindset,"" transforming Microsoft's culture from ""know-it-alls"" to ""learn-it-alls"" during his decade-long tenure as CEO. This approach has helped Microsoft achieve significant growth, with its stock climbing almost 20% this year and its market capitalization reaching $3.7 trillion, making it the world's second most valuable company after Nvidia.","Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella argues that emotional intelligence is essential for business leaders.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

A greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/exemptions is the need of the hour.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"Starbucks settlement: Coffee chain to pay $35 mn to 15,000 NYC workers; Mamdani and others join striking baristas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/starbucks-settlement-coffee-chain-to-pay-35-mn-to-15000-nyc-workers-mamdani-and-others-join-striking-baristas/articleshow/125708715.cms,"Starbucks, one of the world’s biggest coffee chains, has finally agreed to hand over about $35 million to more than 15,000 New York City workers after claims that shifts were slashed without warning and schedules kept in constant flux. The announcement landed on Monday, just hours before Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and US Senator Bernie Sanders walked onto a Brooklyn picket line to visit protesting baristas.The settlement comes in the middle of a union-led strike that began last month across dozens of stores nationwide. Workers argued that their demands are simple: better staffing and more stable hours. But frustration only grew as almost four years passed since baristas at a Buffalo branch first came together to strike against the organisation, and a contract has still not materialised. Since then, unionisation has spread to around 550 of Starbucks’ 10,000 company-owned outlets. A further 7,000 stores operate under licence in airports, supermarkets and other venues.Both the company and union workers dispute the scale of the strike’s impact. Even so, Mamdani, Sanders and a group of state and city officials added political firepower to the movement on Monday, joining scores of baristas and supporters outside a Brooklyn Starbucks.“These are not demands of greed — these are demands of decency,” Mamdani said. Some workers held oversized cut-outs of Starbucks takeaway cups, swapping the company’s branding with the union’s. Sanders said, “Starbucks has refused to sit down and negotiate a fair contract.”Strikers described a workplace buckling under pressure, understaffed shifts, unpredictable scheduling and online orders so complex that the list of ingredients sometimes stretches beyond the height of the cup. “It is the company's issue to give us the labor amount to schedule partners fairly, and they are not scheduling us fairly, no matter how much money we are making them,” said Gabriel Pierre, 26, a shift supervisor at a suburban Bellmore shop.Meanwhile, the Seattle-based chain has been trying to regain its financial footing. Cost-conscious customers have been pressing pause on premium coffees, questioning whether they still justify the price. Starbucks recently recorded its first rise in same-store sales in nearly two years, but restructuring costs, store redesigns and other changes dragged on profits in the July–September quarter.The settlement announced by New York City’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection further requires Starbucks to pay $3.4 million in civil penalties in addition to the $35 million earmarked for workers. Additionally, the company agreed to follow the city’s Fair Workweek law from here on.Starbucks said that it is committed to responsible operations and compliance with local laws, while acknowledging the difficulty of the rules in question. “This is notoriously challenging to manage,"" spokesperson Jaci Anderson said.Most hourly employees affected will receive $50 for each week worked between July 2021 and July 2024, the department confirmed. Staff who experienced violations after that window can still seek compensation by filing a complaint.The deal also guarantees reinstatement opportunities for employees laid off during recent store closures in the city.For many baristas, the fight continues. “I sure hope that it gives Starbucks an awakening,” said Kaari Harsila, 21, a shift supervisor from Brooklyn who joined the picket line.",The settlement comes in the middle of a union-led strike that began last month across dozens of stores nationwide.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in red on Tuesday on weak global cues. While Nifty50 was above 26,150, BSE Sensex was near 85,500. At 9:24 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 26,152.25, down 24 points or 0.090%. BSE Sensex was at 85,523.64, down 118 points or 0.14%.Markets have been taking a breather with profit booking in focus after hitting recent record highs.Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “It appears that the market is consolidating around the new record highs before breaking out to new highs. There is fundamental support for newer highs as reflected in the robust GDP numbers and the leading indicators like auto sales in November. The continuing weakness in the rupee is a dampener which is impacting FII flows. A fair trade deal between India and the US can stem the weakness in rupee, but this has been hanging fire for too long. ”“Investors can use the current period of consolidation to slowly accumulate fairly-valued largecaps and growth-oriented midcaps which will lead the next leg of rally in the market. The Smallcap segment continues to be over-valued.The Bank Nifty, despite the recent run up, has the potential to impart resilience to the market since there is valuation comfort in this segment. The pick up in credit growth is another positive for the segment. ”Asian equities showed modest gains at opening, attempting recovery following Monday's decline, where cryptocurrency losses led the broader market downturn.American stocks dipped on Monday, affected by rising Treasury yields and manufacturing sector data showing tariff impacts, as traders awaited the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy statement next week.Gold prices decreased in early Asian trading on Tuesday, following its six-week high in the previous session, with profit-taking evident whilst investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair's comments and crucial economic indicators for interest rate guidance.Oil prices increased early Tuesday for the second straight session as traders evaluated risks from Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian energy facilities and growing US-Venezuela tensions.Foreign institutional investors sold net shares worth Rs 1,171.31 crore on Monday.
