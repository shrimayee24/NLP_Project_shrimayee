Ties between the two countries had worsened after the killing of pro-Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in June 2023.In October last year, India withdrew its high commissioner and five other diplomats after Canada linked them to the Nijjar case. India also expelled Canadian diplomats. India had said the Justin Trudeau government was letting pro-Khalistani groups operate from Canada.Carney became prime minister in March this year after Trudeau stepped down. He is an economist and entered politics recently.After Trudeau’s exit, India said it hoped to rebuild relations with Canada based on ""mutual trust and sensitivity.""In recent months, security officials from both countries resumed contact. There have also been talks about appointing new high commissioners.The ministry of external affairs said last week that India sees the upcoming meeting between PM Modi and Carney on the sidelines of the G7 Summit as a chance to exchange views and “explore pathways” to reset ties.During PM Modi’s previous visit to Canada in 2015, the two countries upgraded their relationship to a strategic partnership.Canada has a large Indian diaspora. About 4.5 per cent of Canada’s population is of Indian origin, including around 1.8 million people of Indian descent. The Sikh population is around 770,000. Additionally, nearly 1 million Non-Resident Indians (NRI) live in Canada as students, skilled professionals, or temporary workers.Indian students have been the largest group of international students in Canada.

""Long periods of remaining unallocated shall adversely impact associate compensation, career growth, avenues of overseas deployment in future, and continuity of employment with the organisation,"" it said. The new policy, which came into effect on June 12, was laid out by Chandrasekaran Ramkumar, global head of The Resource Management Group (RMG).RMG at TCS oversees workforce deployment, ensuring the right talent with the right skills is assigned to projects. This team focuses on maximising organisational utilisation by making sure every associate is optimally engaged and allocated to projects at all times.""In the event an associate is unallocated, it is the primary responsibility of the associate to proactively engage with the Unit / Regional RMG for seeking allocation and take initiative towards pursuing suitable opportunities provided by the organisation,"" the policy said.All associates who are released to RMG, available for the next assignment, and reporting to RMG are unallocated resources.TCS provides opportunities through platforms like iEvolve, Fresco Play, VLS, and LinkedIn. While unallocated, associates are expected to spend 4-6 hours daily on relevant learning via iEvolve, complete all mandatory and prioritised training, attend in-person sessions as recommended by RMG, and actively upskill to stay interview-ready. They should also use the Gen AI interview coach, review and address feedback from past interviews, and complete all training programmes on time with full attendance.To facilitate swift deployment, TCS has called out that physical presence in the office is mandatory. As a result, WFO exceptions and flexible work arrangements are generally not applicable. ""However, associates may request short-term flexible work options for personal emergencies in exceptional circumstances, subject to organisational policies and prior approval from the RMG.""TCS has stated that frequent short-term allocations to multiple projects are discouraged and may lead to HR investigations and appropriate disciplinary measures. An email sent to TCS on the policy didn't elicit a response till the time of going to the press.","TCS's updated associate deployment policy mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually.

"Mumbai New Rail Overbridge: Mumbai's newly-inaugurated rail overbridge has three lanes, no divider and no pedestrian space; commuters question planning",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/newly-inaugurated-rail-overbridge-in-mumbai-has-three-lanes-no-divider-and-no-pedestrian-space/articleshow/121888200.cms,"



MUMBAI: Days after the newly opened Vikhroli rail overbridge (ROB) was opened to traffic to improve east-west connectivity, motorists are questioning key design choices. Why does a two-way bridge have only three lanes and no central divider? Why are there no footpaths?The absence of footpaths is a continuing trend seen in several recently reconstructed bridges across the city, say residents.Bridges like Delisle Road (Lower Parel) and Gokhale (Andheri), rebuilt in recent years, lack adequate pedestrian space — a stark contrast to their British-era predecessors, which featured wide footpaths used daily by thousands of pedestrians. Though the fully commissioned Gokhale bridge includes a footpath, its width is significantly reduced compared to the original.An official from the bridges department said that the width of the bridge at Vikhroli is 12 metres and the three-lane carriageway was as per the earlier general administrative drawing (GAD).Former Congress corporator Sheetal Mhatre was among the people who questioned the lane arrangement. ""Is it one lane for each direction, with the middle lane reserved on a first-come, fast-come basis?"" Mhatre said.A resident said it took seven years to build the 615-metre-long bridge yet it lacked a few important interventions like footpaths and dividers. ""When you enter from Vikhroli (West), there's no option to take a right turn towards Tagore Nagar at the exit — you're forced to make a full U-turn.Even the cat reflectors on the bridge have already gone missing in some places,"" the resident said.It was on the evening of June 14 that the BMC opened the Vikhroli bridge without any official inauguration. The work order for the bridge works was issued in 2018. Owing to land acquisition issues and pandemic-induced lockdowns, the work on the bridge was delayed, said civic officials.","The absence of footpaths is a continuing trend seen in several recently reconstructed bridges across the city, say residents.

"Ahmedabad Plane Crash: 'Are we not humans?': Doctor covered in soot, asks for time to shift belongings after Ahmedabad plane crash; later issues clarification as BJMC confirms support",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/doctors-distress-call-gain-attention-all-medics-rehoused-bjmc/articleshow/121854928.cms,"



AHMEDABAD: A doctor's emotional plea for time to vacate the crash-damaged quarters near BJ Medical College struck a chord online early Saturday. The video showed Anil Panwar, a cardiac anaesthetist at UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre (UNMICRC), describing the difficulty of relocating while tending to an unwell child.Even as the appeal garnered widespread concern and sympathy, Dr Panwar posted a second video, clarifying that his earlier remarks were made in a moment of stress and that his family had, in fact, been provided accommodation. BJMC authorities, meanwhile, confirmed that all junior doctors and faculty members who were displaced have been allotted new accommodation.The initial video, filmed on Friday night near the residential quarters, showed Dr Panwar standing among packed belongings, his voice trembling as he spoke of the urgency and pressure to vacate. He said the administration had asked them to vacate the quarters immediately as they planned to demolish parts of the buildings as part of the relief and rescue work.""Are we not humans? Can't you give us 2-3 days? We need some basic goods to run the house. Several of our doctors are admitted (to the hospital for treatment). We are troubled... Understand that it is not easy to clear a house overnight,"" said Dr Panwar, who was covered in soot from attempting to shift his belongings.He was on duty when the tragedy took place.""I pray to you with folded hands that give us 2-3 days' time. My child is admitted, and I should be with her. Instead, I am here (at the site, clearing belongings). Convey my message to the higher-ups as I am helpless. I am not from Gujarat, and I need some time to shift,"" he said. His wife, Dr Chanchal Bhandari, also a cardiac anaesthetist, had grabbed attention a day ago when news broke out of how her heroism and her nanny's presence of mind helped them save her two-year-old daughter's life after the ill-fated plane crashed onto the hostel buildings.The appeal, shared widely across social media platforms, drew empathy and concern from citizens and medical professionals alike, many of whom highlighted the psychological and physical toll the crash had taken on healthcare workers already coping with long shifts and trauma.However, by Saturday afternoon, Dr Panwar issued a second statement. In a video message, he said that the earlier remarks were made in a moment of stress and confusion, and that he had not been aware that his wife — also a doctor — had already been allotted temporary housing by hospital authorities ""I was mentally disturbed and didn't know what I was saying,"" he said. ""Volunteers helped us shift our belongings. I again thank the hospital and government authorities,"" he said in the video.The clarification came as the BJ Medical College administration announced that a total of 159 accommodations had been arranged for residents from the damaged hostels and staff quarters.Dr Minakshi Parikh, dean of BJMC, said that 100 students from Atulyam 2 and 3 had been moved to the GCRI Old Block and Digvijaya Lions Hostel. Another 38 residents from Atulyam 1 were relocated to PG Hostel wings ON MediCity campus, the Mithila quarters, and the UN Mehta hostel. Twenty-one residents from Atulyam 4 were shifted to the Dental College quarters and Mithila 2 quarters. ""All affected students and residents have been shifted to new accommodations as of Saturday,"" she confirmed.Some junior doctors, speaking anonymously, acknowledged that the shifting process was not without hurdles as the relief and rescue work was going on all around. ""Almost all of us were reporting to duty due to the scale of the catastrophe. But one can understand that the authorities are also pressed on multiple fronts. The seniors and staffers also helped us, and almost all have now been shifted to new accommodations,"" said a doctor. Several voluntary organizations are providing meals and other help to the affected residents, said officials.","Anil Panwar, a cardiac anaesthetist at UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre, made emotional plea for time to vacate quarters near BJ Medical College.

Ahmedabad: The AI 171 plane crash claimed the lives of two members of the Parmar family – Bhogilal, 57, and his wife Hansa, 55, natives of Rakhiyana near Mandal in Ahmedabad district – on Thursday. But even before the family could recover from the blow, they received another: Bhogilal's elder sister, Gomti Parmar, unable to process the grief, collapsed and died.Bhogilal and his wife Hansa were among the passengers on board the ill-fated Air India flight when it crashed near B J Medical College on June 12. The couple, on their first-ever trip abroad, had been invited by their son and daughter-in-law in the UK, who are expecting their first child this week.s their relatives gathered at the family home in Lambha, Ahmedabad, to mourn, the shock of the tragedy proved too much for 65-year-old Gomti. Her son, Sagar, who lives in Vaghala near Patdi in Surendranagar, said she collapsed during the gathering and died on the spot. ""She was very close to my mama (uncle),"" he said. ""When she heard about the crash and realized there were almost no survivors, her heart just gave out.""Gomti's final rites were performed on Friday — ironically, before those of her younger brother, whose mortal remains are still being identified. While Hansa's body has been identified, DNA reports for Bhogilal are still awaited. Sagar said his cousin Pinki, Bhogilal's daughter, gave a sample for DNA matching.""Their last rites will take place once both the bodies are handed over to the family,"" said Sagar.""It's all too much for us. My mother and uncle were emotionally very close since childhood. She couldn't bear the grief,"" Sagar said. ""We were all excited for the baby. Now we don't know how to console each other.""The family had hoped this week would be a time of celebration and joy. Instead, they find themselves reeling from loss after loss; mourning not just those who died in the crash, but also a woman who died from the weight of the sorrow.","Bhogilal Parmar and his wife Hansa were among the passengers on board the ill- fated Air India flight when it crashed on June 12.

Air India Plane Crash Voice Recorder: CVR recovered from AI 171 wreckage; key to unravelling final moments of Ahmedabad-London flight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/cockpit-voice-recorder-recovered-from-air-india-plane-crash-site/articleshow/121868442.cms,"What is a black box?

Role of a CVR





AHMEDABAD: The Cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of Air India flight AI 171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12, was recovered from the debris, a govt release informed on Sunday.The CVR, commonly referred to as one of the two ‘black boxes' of the aircraft, according to US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), is a critical piece of investigative equipment that stores audio recordings from the cockpit, including pilot conversations, alarms and background sounds in the final hours or minutes leading up to a crash. The other black box, the flight data recorder (FDR), which logs technical flight parameters, was earlier recovered.""The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) launched a detailed investigation, and the NTSB is conducting a parallel probe under international protocols since the aircraft is American made. Officials confirmed that the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were located and secured,"" the govt release said.In the past, black box data has helped resolve major aviation disasters — such as the 2015 Germanwings crash, where the CVR revealed deliberate pilot action, and the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 incident, which confirmed a missile strike.In India, the 2020 Kozhikode air crash investigation also relied on black box recordings to reconstruct pilot decisions and evaluate runway conditions.The black box comprises two devices, the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder. For AI 171, both CVR and FDR have been found. Large commercial aircraft and some smaller commercial, corporate and private aircraft are required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to be equipped with two ‘black boxes' that record information about a flight. Both recorders are installed to help reconstruct the events leading to an aircraft accident, according to NTSB website.The CVR captures pilots' voices and cockpit sounds — like alarms, engine noise and switch clicks — to help reconstruct flight events. Positioned between the two pilots, it also records communications with air traffic control and crew. A multi-agency CVR committee analyses the audio, using timestamps and spectrum software to create a detailed transcript, which is released publicly only under strict legal conditions. Due to the sensitive nature of cockpit conversations, the actual audio is never released, and both the recordings and transcripts are handled with high security and confidentiality.","The Cockpit voice recorder (CVR) of Air India flight AI 171, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12, was recovered from the debris.

BENGALURU: Over 100 bike taxis were seized across Bengaluru on Monday as enforcement agencies cracked down on aggregators flouting a recent Karnataka HC directive halting such operations.The ban came into force Monday following the HC declining to stay an earlier govt order prohibiting bike taxi services. While companies, including Rapido and Uber , claimed compliance, officials reported that several platforms continued to operate, prompting action by the transport offices.Transport minister Ramalinga Reddy said some aggregators were circumventing the court order by using parcel delivery services as a cover. ""There are instances of aggregators replacing bike taxi services with parcel and courier options and using them as a proxy to ferry passengers. Officials booked cases after identifying such violations. This drive will continue,"" he said.On Monday morning, Rapido rebranded its bike-taxi feature as 'Bike Parcel'. Uber and Ola continued offering the bike-taxi option on their apps until midday before removing it.All three platforms offer parcel delivery services.A total of 103 bike owners were booked and their vehicles seized across 11 RTO jurisdictions.

What Anthropic CEO said on AI

Anthropic on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's statement

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Amodei, in a recent Axios interview, had warned that AI could disrupt half of entry-level office roles and urged policymakers to prepare for economic impacts. Huang countered that while AI will transform jobs, it will also create new opportunities, citing increased productivity as a driver for hiring. “Some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs are going to be created,” he said.In response, an Anthropic spokesperson clarified to Fortune that Amodei has never claimed only Anthropic should build AI. “Dario has advocated for a national transparency standard for AI developers … so the public and policymakers are aware of the models’ capabilities and risks,” the statement read. The spokesperson reaffirmed Amodei’s concerns about AI’s economic impact and his commitment to addressing them.Anthropic, founded in 2021 by Amodei and other ex-OpenAI researchers, prioritizes safety in AI development, a focus rooted in the founders’ reported concerns over OpenAI’s direction. The public clash between Huang and Amodei highlights ongoing debates in the AI industry about its societal and economic implications.","Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris.

In a social media exchange in May 2024, a Twitter user responded to a post by Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticizing Boeing ’s management style. The user Gunther Eagleman @GuntherEagleman replied pointedly to the post saying:Musk responded to the user in a joking tone:the user further replied.But, the online conversation took a dark turn when another user followed up with:While Elon Musk did not publicly respond to this last comment, the thread has resurfaced after an Air India Dreamliner 787-8 aircraft crashed minutes after taking off from Ahmedabad airport on June 12. The deadly crash killed 241 of 242 people onboard the London-bound flight.In the original tweet, Elon Musk highlighted Boeing’s $4.2 billion investment in the Starliner spacecraft, contrasting it with SpaceX ’s (owned by Elon Musk) $2.6 billion for the Dragon 2, which completed four years earlier despite a near-complete redesign.He said: “Although Boeing got $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX only got $2.6 billion, SpaceX finished 4 years sooner. Note, the crew capsule design of Dragon 2 has almost nothing in common with Dragon 1. Too many non‑technical managers at Boeing.”The resurfaced conversation has gained further urgency after a recent report claimed that the Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad was one of the same 787 Dreamliners that late Boeing whistleblower John Barnett had warned regulators about. Barnett, a former quality manager worked at Boeing for over 30 years. He had alleged serious flaws in the manufacturing of the 787 jets, citingat the company’s South Carolina plant. He claimed that Boeing prioritized speed over safety and even said he refused to fly on the Dreamliner. Barnett was found dead in March 2024 from an apparent suicide, shortly after testifying in a legal case against Boeing — a death that sparked widespread conspiracy theories. He is one of several whistleblowers whose warnings have resurfaced in light of recent safety incidents.The June 12 plane crash is being termed as one of the deadliest air disasters in decades. The total toll rose to 279 people killed, including 241 onboard the flight and 38 others on the ground. The lone survivor, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh said even he could not explain how he survived. ""Initially, I too thought that I was about to die, but then I opened my eyes and realised that I was still alive,"" Ramesh told national broadcaster DD News from his hospital bed.Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has directed all Boeing Dreamliner 787/9 fleet of Air India equipped with Genx engines to undergo additional maintenance and safety checks with immediate effect in coordination with the concerned regional DGCA offices.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk responded to a Twitter user criticizing Boeing ’s management style.

India’s New AC Rule: Cooling Between 20°C–28°C Explained

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised concerns that it could take away jobs, especially entry-level roles. But Reid Hoffman , co-founder of LinkedIn believes that young people should not fear AI. Instead, they should use it to their advantage while job hunting. In a video he published on his YouTube channel this week, Hoffman said “""You are generation AI. You are AI native. So bringing the fact that you have AI in your tool set is one of the things that makes you enormously attractive”.Reid Hoffman was responding to questions from college students, many of whom were worried about their job prospects in the AI age. He admitted those fears are valid, but encouraged students to flip the script.“Yes, it’s changing the workplace and creating confusion for employers,” he said. “But it also gives you a chance to show your unique abilities. In teams with older professionals, you might even be the one helping them understand new tools,” Hoffman stated.Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, recently warned that AI could eliminate up to half of all entry-level office jobs in the next five years. He said this could cause unemployment to rise by 10% to 20%, and added, “Most people don’t realize this is about to happen.”But top tech figures like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and investor Mark Cuban strongly disagreed with Amodei’s view. Speaking at VivaTech 2025, Huang said: “I pretty much disagree with almost everything he says. AI will definitely change jobs — it changed mine — but it will also create new ones.”Cuban echoed the same sentiment in a recent social media post, pointing out that even in the past, roles like secretaries and in-office dictation staff were replaced by technology, but new industries and jobs emerged.“AI will lead to new companies and increase total employment,” he wrote in the post.","LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman believes young people should not fear AI.

At 9:18 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,933.10, down 13 points or 0.054%.

The decline in the US volatility index CBOE suggests that markets are unlikely to correct sharply unless the conflict takes a dramatic turn for the worse. The main contributor to the market resilience is the retail investors using every dip in the market as a buying opportunity. Valuations do not appear to deter retail investors.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Former Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani's Body Identified After DNA Matching | Air India Plane Crash

NEW DELHI: The last rites of former Gujarat chief minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Vijay Rupani were performed with full state honours on Monday in Rajkot, Gujarat.Union home minister Amit Shah, Gujarat governor Acharya Devvrat, chief minister Bhupendra Patel, and several other leaders attended the funeral to pay their final respects. Rupani was accorded a 21-gun salute at the Ramnathpara crematorium, where his last rites were conducted. His funeral procession, which began from his residence at 5 pm, saw a heavy security presence and traffic restrictions carefully managed by Rajkot Police.Earlier in the day, chief minister Bhupendra Patel, accompanied by senior cabinet ministers, paid tribute to Rupani at the Ahmedabad Civil Hospital’s mortuary block, where the former chief minister’s mortal remains were kept for public homage. Gujarat health minister Rushikesh Patel, home minister Harsh Sanghavi, and former deputy CM Nitin Patel also visited the mortuary to offer condolences.A deeply emotional moment unfolded when Rupani’s wife, Anjali Rupani, stood beside her husband’s mortal remains and bid him an emotional farewell as family members and close friends gathered for the final rituals.Expressing the family’s profound grief, Rupani’s son, Rushabh Rupani, acknowledged the immense loss not just for their family but for hundreds affected by the tragic incident.“This is a sad time not just for our family but also for the other 270 families. I thank the Police, Aarogya staff, Civil Defence, Fire Services and RSS workers for their rescue efforts during this incident, which are praiseworthy. I also express gratitude to PM Modi, CM Bhupendra Patel and other leaders for supporting and standing with not just our family, but also all other families,” he said.Rushabh also reflected on his father’s long political career and the impact he made.“My father touched many lives during the 50-55 years of his political life. Today, all those people are standing by us. Many party workers from Punjab are also coming here to express their condolences,” he added.Vijay Rupani was among the 241 victims of the devastating Air India crash in Ahmedabad on June 12. The London-bound Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner tragically went down shortly after takeoff, crashing into a doctor’s hostel complex near the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport.Rupani, 68, who was the chief minister from August 2016 to September 2021, steered Gujarat through a critical post-Covid recovery phase.He was among the 242 passengers and crew members on board the London-bound Air India flight AI-171 that crashed in Ahmedabad on June 12.While 241 persons on board the aircraft died, one passenger miraculously survived. Besides, 29 persons are reported to have died in the disaster on the ground, which includes five MBBS students.","Vijay Rupani was accorded a 21-gun salute at the Ramnathpara crematorium.

Narrow escapes and miraculous timing

13-year-old tea seller among victims





NEW DELH: A delayed take-off may have prevented a far greater tragedy on Thursday when an Air India Dreamliner crashed into the residential quarters and mess hall of BJ Medical College in Ahmedabad, killing at least four people on the ground — including three resident doctors and the pregnant wife of another.Flight AI171 to London Gatwick, carrying 241 people onboard, took off 29 minutes behind schedule.Minutes earlier, a large group of doctors had finished lunch at the mess hall, which was later struck by the aircraft’s tail section.The Boeing 787, which lost control shortly after departing from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport, disintegrated in mid-air and fell in three parts: the nose hit the Atulyam-11 residential quarters for undergraduate and postgraduate doctors, the midsection tore through a garden and road and the tail slammed into the mess building.The crash turned a quiet afternoon into chaos on the BJ Medical College campus in Meghaninagar. Resident doctors Aaryan Rajput, Manav Bhadoo, and Rakesh Deora were confirmed dead. Kajal Pradip Solanki, the pregnant wife of another doctor, also died in the incident. Another doctor, Jay Prakash Chaudhary, was reported missing as of Thursday evening.With more than 300 doctors present across the five-storey building that houses both residential quarters and the doctors’ mess, the death toll could have been much higher if the plane had crashed even a few minutes later.Dr Ramkrishna, who survived the crash, recounted the terrifying moment:“I was having lunch in the mess when a friend called to warn me about a plane flying unusually low. I stepped out — and then came a massive blast. There was intense heat, smoke, and panic. When it cleared, we saw the wreckage. We pulled out bodies — they were doctors, still in aprons.”The impact and ensuing fireball, fuelled by an estimated 1.25 lakh litres of jet fuel, caused widespread devastation across the premises.Junior Doctors’ Association president Dhaval Gameti narrowly escaped the tragedy.“I was upset in the morning because I couldn’t join my friends for lunch,” he said. “At 1:41pm, I got a call about smoke and assumed it was a small fire. I called Civil Hospital superintendent Rakesh Joshi for an ambulance. When we reached, Air India’s ambulances were already there — and the devastation was far worse than expected. We pulled out 21–22 students.”Intern Kushal Chauhan had just returned to his hostel after lunch. MBBS student Manthan had just started his two-wheeler when the plane crashed.“I tried to flee, but my friend who was riding pillion caught fire. He sustained burns but survived,” he said.“If the crash had happened just a few minutes later, many more doctors would have been in the mess. Most finish OPD around 2pm and come for lunch,” Chauhan added.Among the youngest victims was Akash Patni, 13, who ran a tea stall near the doctors’ quarters. He had taken up the job after losing his father during the Covid pandemic. His cousin Anil, who had gone home to fetch lunch for Akash, recalled:“I heard the blast and ran back. But there was nothing left — just pieces of him.”","Flight AI171 to London Gatwick, carrying 241 people onboard, took off 29 minutes behind schedule.

From Liam to Aria Capri the Antetokounmpo home is full of love and little feet





Forget trade rumors — Giannis Antetokounmpo just released a TikTok that has everyone talking, and it’s unrelated to basketball. Weeks after the birth of baby Aria Capri, he humorously teased about having a fifth child with his wife Mariah Riddlesprigger. With four kids, a recent wedding, and sincere comments about being a father, it’s evident that Giannis is balancing MVP-level parenting with his superstar status like only The Greek Freak can.Giannis and Mariah’s family is already lively. They have two sons called Liam Charles, who was born in February 2020, and Maverick Shai, who was born in August 2021, and two daughters, Eva Brooke (September 2023) and their newborn, Aria Capri (May 2025). They got married last September in a small Greece wedding that just hit the right notes between major moments and a little emotional secrecy. When Giannis joked about baby #5 With fans, they knew he wasn’t joking with the guys in the locker room, but it could be a natural progression of a family on its way to a dynasty.In May, Giannis was over the moon when he called Aria a ""blessing"" while talking to People, celebrating the joy and development that their new daughter has brought to their close-knit family.Mariah, who created the brand Sincerely, Mariah and has a sports management degree, has also become a philanthropic partner, focusing on maternal health and diaper drives in Milwaukee.Outside of the court, chatter has been buzzing about Giannis’ future with the Bucks—some folks are curious if he could be looking to request a trade. However, his new TikTok was released just as the trade season was warming up, changing the narrative. The lighthearted caption, “When she tells me to get ready for baby #5,” landed with perfect comic timing, hinting at life outside the hoop.Giannis has been truthful regarding what it has been like being a father and those diaper changes at late nights and the lessons that parenting has taught him about legacy and humility. The fact that he has recently joined forces with Huggies in recent ad campaigns like the Little Movers campaign; really demonstrates how fatherhood has transformed him into a nicer person, the nurturing part of his temperament. The Greek Freak is not only throwing out his muscles; he is also showing the human aspect of being a father.Also Read: Nikola Jokic clocks out for the summer and where he goes might surprise you This year is about more than just family expansion. It’s filled with achievements — Giannis, now 30, is kicking off his 12th NBA season after being picked in 2013, and he has an impressive list of accolades including two MVP awards (‘19, ‘20), a Finals MVP (’21), and a 2024 NBA Cup title.
