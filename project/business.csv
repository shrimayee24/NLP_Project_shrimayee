ALMHULT: After putting in over Rs 10,500 crore since 2018 in India, Swedish furniture retailer IKEA is planning a ""second wave"" of growth in India, focused on accelerated expansion backed by stronger local sourcing and logistics and a deeper omni-channel strategy, said Patrik Antoni, CEO, IKEA India.Discussing the challenges due to the US's tariff moves, Jesper Brodin, CEO of INGKA Group, the biggest franchisee of Inter IKEA, said the company will adapt to the new scenario. ""There's still significant uncertainty, and while IKEA has limited ability to influence outcomes, the focus is on preparing to adapt, given that its supply chain is far more regional and local than many assume,"" he said.Ikea plans to add four-to-six new customer touch-points in India every year, a significant step-up from its current pace of rolling out one store every year or two.The upcoming formats will be a mix of large-format flagship stores, such as those in Hyderabad, Navi Mumbai, and Bengaluru; new outlets in Noida and Gurugram; and smaller city-centre stores, planning studios, and online platforms.""The IKEA experience is no longer limited to a single visit to a large store - it's a combination of many touchpoints, more convenient and more accessible,"" Antoni added. Localisation will be central to IKEA's India strategy.The company plans to increase local sourcing from 30% today to 50% by 2030. With partnerships already in place with 45 suppliers, many of whom export globally, IKEA is also investing in a design centre to create products tailored for Indian homes, with an emphasis on sustainable and recycled materials, including Indian wood varieties.Antoni said India's growing role as a sourcing hub strengthens IKEA's ability to balance supply chain risks. ""Localisation and diversification are important for us. As global trade dynamics evolve, India's position becomes even more critical in ensuring affordability and resilience in our offering,"" he noted.Beyond retail, IKEA's India presence spans sourcing, a global capability centre, a digital hub supporting global teams, and Ingka Centres' two large shopping centres under construction in Noida and Gurugram.(The writer is in Almhult, Sweden, at the invitation of IKEA Group)",Ikea plans to add four-to-six new customer touch-points in India every year.

NEW DELHI: ED has arrested Sandeepa Virk, a social media influencer who also ran an online platform with little business, allegedly a front for money laundering.The arrest followed a police case registered in Mohali, with the probe agency conducting raids on Tuesday and Wednesday at multiple locations in Delhi and Mumbai, ED said in a press release.The agency said it found that Virk, who acted in movies and claims to be a cosmetologist, was in regular touch with Angarai Natarajan Sethuraman, a former director of Reliance Capital, which was part of the Anil Ambani group.The ED statement alleged Virk had been communicating with Sethuraman regarding illegal liaising work. It added that this was also confirmed during searches at the residence of Sethuraman, who was a prominent member of the business group's corporate affairs team in Delhi.When contacted, Sethuraman said, ""These allegations are entirely baseless"" and that he had no connection or involvement with Virk or any transactions related to her.In a release, ED said, ""Besides, diversion of funds for personal benefit has been unearthed during course of search. In 2018, public money of Rs 18 crore approx belonging to Reliance Commercial Finance Ltd was disbursed to Sethuraman by flouting prudent lending norms.The funds were lent under terms that allowed deferment of principal as well as interest, with multiple waivers granted & no due diligence conducted. Besides, home loan of Rs 22 crore was provided by Reliance Capital Limited by violating the prudential norms. Large part of these loans are seen to have been eventually siphoned off and remained unpaid.""Sethuraman said that the home loan he received from Reliance Capital was granted following due process and was secured by the property offered as collateral.Following her arrest, Virk was produced before a special court here on Wednesday, which remanded her to ED custody till Aug 14. Virk's arrest came after searches conducted by the agency in Delhi and Mumbai on her premises and those of her close associates,She is accused of impersonating officers of law enforcement agencies, duping individuals, and participating in a Rs 6 crore fraud against complainant Jasneet Kaur, under the pretext of investment in a film project. The main accused in the fraud, Amit Gupta alias Nageshwar Gupta, was declared a proclaimed offender in Oct 2024.The agency claimed during its searches, it seized ""incriminating documents"" and records, and statements of key persons and associates, including Farrukh Ali, were recorded. ED said its current searches were part of an ongoing investigation into charges against Virk and her associates, who are alleged to have ""exerted undue influence through misrepresentation and defrauded individuals by soliciting money under false promises"".""Virk has acquired immovable property in her name by making false promises and cheating. She claims to be owner of hyboocare.com, a website purportedly selling FDA-approved beauty products. However, the products listed on the site have been found to be non-existent,"" the agency said. It added that its probe revealed that the website floated by Virk lacked basics, such as user registration options. Scrutiny of the website uncovered minimal social media engagement, an inactive WhatsApp contact number, and absence of transparent organisational details, all of which reinforce suspicion of non-genuine commercial activity, ED said.","Sandeepa Virk, a social media influencer who also ran an online platform with little business, allegedly a front for money laundering.

MUMBAI: Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told TOI.She was airlifted from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday and is under the care of doctor Farokh Udwadia.Simone, 95, is fighting several symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, the same illness that her stepson and former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata passed away from last October.“She and Noel arrived in Mumbai from Dubai on a medical plane at Terminal 8,” the sources said.Simone is most famous for turning the Lakmé cosmetic brand into a well-known household name in India. The name Lakmé comes from the French word for Lakshmi, a goddess known for her beauty in Hindu mythology.The Tata Group was urged by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to launch a makeup brand after learning that Indian women were spending the country’s foreign reserves on Western makeup brands. Lakmé was established by the Tata Group in 1952.Originally from Geneva, Switzerland, Simone first visited India as a tourist in the summer of 1953 at the age of 23. During her visit, she met Naval Tata, who was 26 years her senior and divorced from his first wife Soonoo.They fell in love, got married in 1955, and she decided to make Mumbai her permanent home.In 1996, the Tata Group sold Lakmé to Hindustan Unilever as part of a restructuring strategy. Simone used the proceeds from the sale to create Westside, a popular department store where many Indians shop.She managed the Tata Group’s consumer-facing businesses including Lakme and Trent (which owns Westside and Star India Bazaar stores) for over four decades until her retirement in 2006. She also served on the board of Tata Industries, an important investment company within the Tata Group.After her retirement, Simone made fewer public appearances. In October 2019, she was seen in a wheelchair at the opening of the renovated flagship Westside store in South Mumbai. In September 2022, she attended the funeral of former Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry (Noel is married to Cyrus’s sister Aloo Mistry), and in October 2024, she was present at Ratan’s funeral.Following Ratan’s passing, Noel took over his position at Tata Trusts, the driving force behind the $180-billion Tata Group.","Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital.

'I'm In Space, Can't Reach Me': Minister Quips As Oppn Interrupts Speech On Space Achievement

Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill, 2025

Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 2025

NEW DELHI: The government will on Wednesday introduce three bills in Parliament to provide a legal framework for the removal of prime minister, a Union minister, chief minister, or a minister in a state/Union territory if they are arrested or detained on serious criminal charges.According to PTI, the proposed legislations are: Government of Union Territories (Amendment) Bill, 2025; Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 2025; and Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2025.Union home minister Amit Shah will also move a motion in the Lok Sabha to refer these bills to a joint committee of Parliament.The Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, currently has no provision for the removal of a chief minister or minister if arrested or detained for serious criminal charges. The proposed bill would amend Section 45 of the Act to address this gap.The Constitution lacks provisions for the removal of prime minister, Union ministers, chief ministers, or state/Delhi government ministers if arrested and detained on such charges. The bill seeks to amend Articles 75, 164, and 239AA to create this framework.The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, does not provide for the removal of the UT's chief minister or minister detained on serious criminal charges. The proposed bill would therefore amend Section 54 of the Act seeks to address this.","The government will introduce three bills in Parliament on Wednesday.

Twenty proposers and as many supporters are expected to join him when he does so. Sources said the documentation work for his nomination was completed on Tuesday.After felicitating Radhakrishnan with a shawl, Modi praised his simple lifestyle and dedication to public service, noting cryptically, ""He might have a lot of interest in sports, but he does not play games in politics"".Like Modi, Radhakrishnan, a two-time former Lok Sabha MP from Coimbatore and former Tamil Nadu BJP president, was an RSS functionary before joining Jana Sangh and later BJP.Modi's remarks on Radhakrishnan's interest in sports and political integrity reminded political circles of Jagdeep Dhankhar, who resigned as vice president on July 21 amid indications of strained ties with the governing party.Modi lauded Radhakrishnan's 40 years of public service and appealed for his unanimous election.However, opposition later announced the name of former Supreme Court judge B Sudershan Reddy as its candidate, ensuring a vice-presidential election on Sept 9.Modi's speech covered various issues, including S&P Global Ratings' recent upgrade of India's long-term sovereign credit rating, which, he said, highlights the robust condition of the country's economy and will attract more investment.He said after his Independence Day speech, in which he announced next-generation reforms and GST rate simplification, he was told the stock market will respond positively.

NEW DELHI: The recent Sino-Indian detente seemed set for a significant step forward with PM Narendra Modi saying Tuesday that bilateral ties have made “positive and steady” progress guided by respect for each other’s interests and sensitivities, and accepting President Xi Jinping’s official invitation to visit China for the SCO summit.The invitation along with a message from Xi was delivered to Modi by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi who called on the PM after his meeting with NSA Ajit Doval for the Special Representatives’ talks on the boundary question. Recalling his meeting with Xi in Kazan in October, which opened the doors for normalisation of the relationship after an intense and prolonged military standoff, Modi said he was looking forward to meeting the Chinese president again in Tianjin, on the margins of the Eurasian bloc summit in Tianjin on September 1.“Stable, predictable, constructive ties between India and China will contribute significantly to regional as well as global peace and prosperity,” said Modi in a post on X after the meeting with Wang.According to an Indian readout, Modi also emphasised the importance of maintaining peace and tranquillity on the border, and reiterated India's commitment to a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable resolution of the boundary question.This was also underlined by Doval in his meeting with Wang in which they discussed issues related to de-escalation, delimitation and boundary affairs. Wang also shared with the PM his positive assessment about his meetings with both Doval and Jaishankar, saying there was “new consensus” on border management, maintenance of peace and on starting boundary delimitation talks.Doval and Jaishankar strongly raised the need to fight terrorism in all its forms, including cross-border terrorism, underscoring that one of the original objectives of the SCO was to counter the evil of terrorism. According to the MEA, Wang, who will visit Pakistan this week, concurred that countering terrorism should be given the highest priority.“Prime Minister welcomed the steady and positive progress in bilateral ties since his meeting with President Xi in Kazan last year, guided by mutual respect, mutual interest and mutual sensitivity, including the resumption of the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra,” said the Indian government, adding that the PM thanked Xi for the invitation and expressed support for China's presidency of the SCO Summit.Modi will arrive in Tianjin on August 31 for what will be his first visit to China in over 7 years. He had last visited China in 2018, again for the SCO summit. SCO has been an important forum for India to assert its strategic autonomy but his visit on this occasion has evoked more than just a cursory interest, as it comes in the middle of what many see as the worst phase in India’s ties with the US in decades.While the Trump administration seems to have made peace with Moscow, it continues to target India for its energy imports from Russia, accusing the Indian government of funding Vladimir Putin’s war. Trump’s trade advisor Peter Navarro accused India of “now cozying up” to both China and Russia, as he made his point about the risks involved in transferring cutting-edge US military technology to India.In his meeting with Wang, Doval hailed new energy and momentum in ties saying that with peace and tranquility in the border areas, there had been more substantive engagement between the 2 countries. Wang too said that since the beginning of this year, the border situation has remained stable and is improving.",PM Narendra Modi accepted President Xi Jinping’s official invitation to visit China for the SCO summit.

KOCHI: The year M A Abdullah Maulavi was born marked the dawn of the Roaring Twenties, a decade of rapid tech transformation. Little did the now 105-year-old Kerala native know that it would take him another century and more to find his tech mojo as a ""fully digi-literate"" person able to use a smartphone.""I used to have keypad phones. With training from the panchayat, I can now access internet on a smartphone, keep myself abreast of news,"" Abdullah told TOI.The centenarian is among 22 lakh Keralites to have undergone training under state's Digi Keralam project, meant to achieve 100% digital literacy - the second such landmark since communist-governed Kerala became India's first fully literate state in 1991.For Abdullah, a resident of Odakkali in Ernakulam district's Perumbavoor, the pandemic was the catalyst for change. His son Faisal Ali recalls seeing his father get increasingly restless during the lockdown as the newspapers stopped coming. ""He would watch news channels on our phones, but didn't relish having to depend on others,"" Faisal said. ""Last year, when Digi Keralam volunteers asked if he was interested in becoming digitally literate, my father grabbed the opportunity. He didn't want to be left behind.""It helped that Abdullah, a religious scholar, has been a learner all his life. He is fluent in Arabic, Urdu, English and Hindi, besides Malayalam. But Jaya CR, the area's saksharatha pracharak and Digi Kerala panchayat coordinator, said teaching Abdullah wasn't easy. ""He had a disciplined routine for decades, leaving little room for new things. Our volunteers had to adapt to his schedule and learning methods."" The training lasted two months, during which Abdullah and the other learners were taught the basics of operating a smartphone. They also learnt how to pay bills and access govt e-services. With over two million citizens benefiting from the initiative, CM Pinarayi Vijayan is ready to declare Kerala a fully digi-literate state on Aug 21.","M A Abdullah Maulavi, 105, is among 22 lakh Keralites to have undergone training under state's Digi Keralam project.

NEW DELHI: Cabinet on Tuesday approved a bill that seeks to ban ""online money game"", where users pay a fee or deposit money, proposing a maximum three years in jail or fine of up to Rs 1 crore for those involved in offering, encouraging or inducing players to participate, which also extends to banks facilitating these transactions.At the same time, Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, which will be introduced in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, seeks to promote e-sports and online social games where no money is involved.A regulator body is planned to oversee the functioning of the sector, sources told TOI. The proposed legislation defines ""online money game"" as an online game played by a user by paying fees, depositing money or other stakes in expectation of winning.Online social games have been defined as those that don't involve exchange of money, although users may be allowed to pay a subscription or one-time access fee.Govt has proposed the new law considering unregulated online money gaming platforms pose threats to national and economic security as they use digital wallets and cryptocurrencies for money laundering and illicit money transfer, cross-border data flows without compliance of data protection law, sources said.Moreover, offshore entities are seen to be circumventing tax and legal obligations.The proposed legislation also assumes significance as online money gaming poses serious concerns, including addiction among children and youth, mental health issues, financial losses leading to suicides and lack of uniform regulation across states. Law enforcing agencies face problems in tracking and regulating these platforms, particularly those hosted or operated from outside India.Sources said the govt proposes penalties of up to two years in jail or with a maximum fine of Rs 50 lakh or both for any entity advertising such games in media. For those offering online money games and banks engaged in transactions face violations of the proposed law will be ""cognisable and non-bailable"" offences. Every subsequent violation after conviction would attract penalties of at least three years' jail and fine of Rs 10-20 lakh. In the case of advertisers, such penalties would be 2-3 years in jail and fine of Rs 5-10 lakh.The bill proposes to hold senior executives of the companies liable, if it's established that the offences have been committed with the consent or connivance or due to their neglect.It also proposes blocking of platforms and money gaming services, if the entities or individuals fail to comply with the law.According to the proposal, the bill seeks to encourage Indian startups to build culturally relevant content, reduce dependence on foreign platforms and promote self-reliance in the digital gaming ecosystem.","Cabinet approves bill that seeks to ban ""online money game"", where users pay a fee or deposit money.

Opinion given by a

Constitution bench

of SC is binding on all, Mehta tells court

NEW DELHI: Keeping aside objections of Kerala and Tamil Nadu govts on the maintainability of the Presidential reference, Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would give its opinion on the President's 14 queries if it finds these raising important questions of law on SC's power to fix timelines for her and governors in granting, withholding or refusing assent to bills passed by assemblies.After hearing senior advocates K K Venugopal for Kerala and A M Singhvi for TN, a five-judge bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar asked, ""Are you really serious in raising preliminary objections?""CJI said, ""We are not deciding the validity of the (April 8) Tamil Nadu judgment (regarding its governor's role on bills). We are only deciding Presidential reference and will be giving an advisory opinion."" Kant said, ""We will first decide whether a question of law of public importance has been raised in the reference.""Singhvi said SC cannot overturn the two-judge bench's April 8 judgment in the Tamil Nadu case through an advisory opinion and that if the opinion expresses a view contrary to that expressed in the Tamil Nadu case, then there would be two sets of constitutional laws - one for TN on the governor's role on bills and the opinion applicable to all other states.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta cited a few judgments to argue that the opinion given by a Constitution bench of SC is binding on all and can even overturn views expressed by a bench on similar issues.Both AG R Venkataramani and Mehta, supported by senior advocates Harish N Salve, N K Kaul and Maninder Singh, argued in support of the Presidential reference and said in the light of the two-judge bench's judgment, but without referring to the facts of that case, the President felt an authoritative pronouncement from SC was needed given that there had been a series of disjointed pronouncements on the core issue.Venkatramani's arguments outlined the Centre's unease over SC, through its April 8 judgment, foraying into the legislative domain and amending constitutional provisions on the roles of governors (Article 200) and the President (Article 201) in relation to their power to give or deny assent to bills passed by legislatures, and said the two-judge bench should have referred the constitutional issues to a five-judge bench as mandated by Article 145(3) of the Constitution and not ventured to decide them.By prescribing timelines, ""SC looked upon the President as an ordinary statutory authority and asked her to give assent to a bill within a specified time without examining whether the bill is unconstitutional, against the national policy framed by the Union govt or against the national interest,"" the AG said.Venkataramani also faulted SC using its exclusive powers under Article 142 to mandate the President to seek advisory opinion of the court under Article 143 whenever she had doubts about constitutionality of a bill. ""SC robbed the highest constitutional authority of the power to think, and decide the legality or constitutionality of a bill,"" he said, adding that another unthinkable part of the SC judgment was the use of Article 142 powers to grant 'deemed assent' to bills.Without referring to facts of the case where the TN governor had long delayed granting assent to bills, the bench asked the AG, ""If the facts of a case on egregious delay (on the governor's part) comes for adjudication before a constitution bench of SC, can you suggest what should be the court's approach?"" The AG said even if a constitution bench can examine the issues, under no circumstance could the court either amend the Constitution or assume the role constitutionally assigned to the governor to grant ""deemed assent"" to bills. ""If this is permissible, then for every small mistake or delay, the states would approach SC for grant of deemed assent.""Mehta supplemented the AG's arguments and said the CJI-led five-judge bench could keep the TN facts aside and give an ideal interpretation of Articles 200 and 201.""Some mistakes committed by a governor or a minister or anyone in a given case should not be the guiding factor for interpreting constitutional provisions,"" he said.The SG will continue his arguments on Wednesday.",Supreme Court will give its opinion on the President's 14 queries if it finds these raising important questions of law. Kerala and Tamil Nadu govts raised objections on the maintainability of the Presidential reference. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta cited a few judgments to argue that the opinion given by a Constitution bench of SC is binding on all.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123396026,imgsize-10502,width-400,resizemode-4/123396026.jpg"

As a lawyer, govt advocate, as a judge of HC and then CJ of an HC and SC judge, I had been doing the same.""""No doubt, NDA has a majority.

But canvassing for support and the contest would not reflect the sharp differences and bickering that is seen in the political arena between the governing dispensation and opposition."" ""What NDA group would do while seeking support for their candidate is not in my hands.

IMPHAL: Beoncy Laishram, who broke the glass ceiling by becoming the Northeast's first transgender doctor, won another landmark battle Tuesday when Manipur high court acknowledged her right to have all academic certificates reissued to reflect her ""female"" name and gender. The court directed the authorities to issue the certificates Beoncy had applied for within a month of the order.Beoncy, born male and known as Boboi Laishram before undergoing gender reassignment surgery in Oct 2019, got her Aadhaar, voter ID and PAN updated by producing a transgender certificate issued by the district magistrate of Imphal West.She approached the high court in Feb 2024 after the Board of Secondary Education Manipur, Council of Higher Secondary Education Manipur, Manipur University and Manipur Medical Council refused to change her name and gender in their records. Beoncy's counsel Jayna Kothari cited sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, while arguing for her right to have the requisite modifications made in her academic certificates. The law applies to all official documents, including one's birth certificate.The court ruled that the relevant provisions outlined in sections 6 and 7 of the Act must be incorporated into all laws, rules and regulations governing establishments within Manipur, as defined under Section 2(b) of the legislation.For Beoncy, the judgment comes as ""a relief"" that she can now build on her career without having to worry about identity confusion. ""I have been thinking of specialising in surgery or gynaecology someday. I was scared I would be made to stay in a boys' hostel just because my academic records say I am a male,"" she said.","Beoncy Laishram is the Northeast's first transgender doctor.

More than 1.07 crore people sterilised during Emergency: Govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/more-than-1-07-crore-people-sterilised-during-emergency-govt/articleshow/123395691.cms,"Indira Gandhi and son Sanjay in a file photo from 1977

NEW DELHI: Over 1.07 crore people were sterilised during the National Emergency from 1975 to 1977, exceeding the ""targets"" set by the then Indira Gandhi govt by 60%, as per the findings of the Justice J C Shah Commission shared by the Union home ministry with Lok Sabha on Tuesday.The Justice Shah commission had inquired into the excesses, malpractices and misdeeds during the Emergency, including the use of force in implementation of the family planning programme. Its report was tabled in Parliament on Aug 31, 1978. Junior home minister Nityanand Rai, in a reply to a question, shared the Shah panel reported 548 complaints of sterilisation of unmarried people and 1,774 deaths linked to sterilisation.As per the Shah commission, the govt of India had set annual targets for the states and Union Territories for the sterilisation programme for 1975-76 and 1976-77. While the states exceeded the 1975-76 target of 24.8 lakh sterilisations by 5.6% (having sterilised 26.2 lakh people), the number of actual sterilisations in 1976-77 (81.3 lakh) exceeded the target(42.5 lakh) by a whopping 91%.Maharashtra saw the most sterilisations during the Emergency period (14.4 lakh), followed by Madhya Pradesh (11.1 lakh), Bengal (10.8 lakh) and UP (9.65 lakh).As per Shah commission report seen by TOI, the voluntary nature of family planning programme appeared to have undergone a sudden change during the Emergency period. A note sent by then Union health minister Karan Singh to Indira Gandhi on Oct 10, 1975, on the 'crash programme to intensify family planning', spoke of ""introduction of some element of compulsion in the larger national interest"".""This can be done by enforcing a judicious and carefully selected mixture of incentives and disincentives. The present Emergency...(has) provided an appropriate atmosphere for tackling the problem,"" Singh added.On Jan 22, 1976, PM Indira Gandhi spoke of ""bringing down birth rate speedily"" with ""steps that may be described as drastic"".As per the Shah panel, the health ministry's approach to family planning during the Emergency became focused on a single method: sterilisation. While the achievement of sterilisation targets was ""107%"" and 190% in 1975-76 and 1976-77, the performance with regard to other methods fell far short of the targets.Strangely, some states went out of their way to raise the 1976-77 targets beyond those set by the govt of India. For instance, UP revised the target to 15 lakh from 4 lakh, though it could achieve only 8.4 lakh sterilisations. Similarly, Maharashtra revised the target from 5.6 lakh to 12 lakh but ended up doing 8.3 lakh sterilisations. West Bengal revised the 3.9-lakh target set by Centre to 11 lakh, only to achieve 8.8 lakh sterilisations in 1976-77.","Over 1.07 crore people were sterilised during the National Emergency from 1975 to 1977.

NEW DELHI: The central government has said that it intends to control street dog population only through its established animal birth control (ABC) programme that mandates civic bodies to catch strays and release them back to their original locations post-sterilisation.The ABC rules, framed under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, align with global standards set by the World Organisation for Animal Health and promote the ""Capture-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release method"" for humane and effective stray dog population management, Union minister of state for fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying, SP Singh Baghel, informed Parliament on Tuesday.The government's stand validates the viewpoint of protesting animal rights activists who have described the Supreme Court's Aug 11 order to remove all Delhi-NCR stray dogs to shelters in far-off places as ""inhumane, unscientific"" and ""one that violates the established ABC rules"".Though the issue of stray dogs falls under the purview of state governments, the minister, in a written reply to Lok Sabha, said, ""To ensure humane and effective dog population management, the central government has framed the Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023.""""Under the Rules, local bodies are responsible for implementing sterilisation and vaccination programmes in collaboration with animal welfare organisations,"" he said.In fact, only last month, the minister said, ""...the Secretaries of the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, and Ministry of Panchayati Raj jointly issued an advisory reiterating that sterilisation of stray dogs is central to dog population management.""""The advisory urged urban local bodies to establish Animal Birth Control units and undertake large-scale sterilisation programmes, covering at least 70% of stray dogs,"" he said in his written reply to Lok Sabha.Moreover, to bolster its ABC efforts, the government has revised the existing Scheme for Birth Control and Immunisation of stray dogs and stray cats, which is being implemented through the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) from the current financial year.Under this scheme, for sterilisation, the government has earmarked financial assistance of up to ₹800 per dog and ₹600 per cat for Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCAs) and local bodies to conduct ABC programmes.""A one-time grant of ₹2 crore is provisioned for state-run veterinary hospitals to develop facilities such as surgical theatres, kennels, and recovery units,"" the minister told Lok Sabha.

NEW DELHI: Observing that it was not a crime to love and teenagers falling in love should not be treated as criminals and sent behind bars, Supreme Court on Tuesday stressed the need to protect mutual romantic relations between adolescents instead of criminalising them under Pocso Act At a time when the Centre is strongly objecting to the idea of reducing the age of consent from 18 to 16 years, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and R Mahadevan said genuine romantic relations should be on a different footing.""We are facing situations of minors falling in love and they even run away... It is a harsh reality. Same law (Pocso) should not be applied in such cases. Do not treat the minors as normal criminals in case of genuine romantic relations. Social reality should be kept in mind,"" the bench said while hearing a batch of petitions filed by NCPCR and NCW challenging various HC orders providing protection to minors who had eloped.The court was also hearing a plea by Bachpan Bachao Andolan challenging Tamil Nadu govt's circular to police to not make ""hasty"" arrests under the Pocso Act in cases involving ""love affairs and marriages"" and stating that arrests under Pocso should be made only after permission from an SP-level officer.Senior advocate H S Phulka said the circular was prone to misuse in case of adults getting into physical relations with minors. The bench, however, said it was for the police to apply its mind on a case-to-case basis.""Nowadays, boys and girls go to the same educational institutions and develop feelings for each other. It is a reality. Can you say that it's a crime to love and the minors should face rape charges... There are romantic cases where teenagers on the verge of majority run away... don't read such as criminal cases. It is more traumatic for girls who get separated from boys and see them going to jail...,"" the bench said. The court added that parents of girls would often use Pocso to cover up an elopement.The bench said it was strange that bodies meant to protect the interests of children and women were assailing the protection given to minors by HCs. The court said they had no locus standi to file appeals and asked them to take up cases with better causes. SC pointed out that if the court did not protect such a couple, they may be killed for ""honour"" by their families. ""If two minor children are protected by HC, how can NCPCR challenge such an order?

The final weapons firing trials (including Astra air-to-air missiles) are slated for Sept. With the order for another 97 jets, HAL will be able to expand and stabilize its supply chains,” a source said.Faced with flak from IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh for the huge delays in deliveries, HAL has promised to progressively scale up production to 20 Tejas per year, and then to 24-30 per year, with the third production line now fully functional in Nashik to add to the two existing ones at Bengaluru, apart from private sector supply chains.The project for the six AEW&C aircraft, which will entail mounting active electronically scanned array antenna-based radars, electronic and signal intelligence systems on second-hand Airbus-321 planes bought earlier from Air India, in turn, will cost Rs 19,000 crore. “All six AEW&C aircraft will be delivered by 2033-34,” the source said.The timely induction of the 180 Tejas Mark-1A fighters is needed to stem the rapid depletion in the number of IAF fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets), which will go down to its lowest-ever figure of 29 squadrons next month after retirement of the 36 old MiG-21s still in service.The IAF, incidentally, is authorized 42.5 combat squadrons. Pakistan now has 25 fighter squadrons, and is slated to get at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation stealth jets from China in the near future.China, of course, has more than four times the number of fighters, bombers and force-multipliers as compared to India. In the AEW&C arena, which are required to boost surveillance capabilities along the borders as well as help direct friendly fighters during air combat with enemy jets, India lags far behind even Pakistan.The IAF currently has just three Netra AEW&C Mark-1 planes, with indigenous sensors mounted on Brazilian Embraer-145 jets for 240-degree radar coverage, and three Israeli `Phalcon’ radars mounted on Russian IL-76 aircraft.The new AEW&C project will involve the A-321 narrow-body aircraft first being “hardened and modified” in Spain and then being equipped with an antenna in the nose in addition to the main dorsal antenna to give 300-degree radar coverage. “The project, which was finalized earlier, has seen a cost escalation of around Rs 7,000 crore since a lot of modifications are required on the A-321s,” the source said.To make up numbers, the defence ministry in March also accorded the initial “acceptance of necessity” to a separate project for six Netra Mark-1A on Emb-145 jets, with more advanced technologies than the first three Mark-1 aircraft.On the Tejas front, IAF till now has got only 38 of the first 40 Tejas Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010.The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-404 engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, as well as weapons and radar integration issues are the main reasons for the delay in the Tejas Mark-1A fighters.","India on Tuesday gave the final nod for the acquisition of another 97 indigenous Tejas fighter jets and six advanced airborne early-warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft.

Penguins ownership race intensifies as billionaires enter the fray



Penguins’ future hinges on who pays the steepest price



The Pittsburgh Penguins may not only be fighting for wins on the ice, but also for ownership stability off it. Fenway Sports Group (FSG), which purchased the franchise in 2021, could be willing to part ways with the team if the right buyer steps forward. And according to NHL insider Josh Yohe, the price tag to lure FSG into selling is nothing short of staggering.For months, speculation has swirled around Mario Lemieux, the Penguins legend and former co-owner, seeking to reclaim his place at the helm. But the story took another twist with the emergence of the billionaire Hoffmann Family, who have now thrown their hat into the ring. Their involvement signals a looming bidding war, one that could push the team’s value into uncharted territory.Yohe’s report revealed the blockbuster figure attached to this potential sale: “Should an offer in the neighborhood of $1.75 billion be thrown at FSG, the source believes a deal could be struck.” That number doesn’t just reflect the Penguins’ historic success—it underscores the NHL’s surging market value. With franchise prices skyrocketing and expansion fees reaching similar levels, the Penguins’ worth mirrors the growing appetite for hockey investments.The Penguins aren’t strangers to ownership shifts. After all, the franchise only changed hands in 2021 when FSG bought them. Yet, this latest development suggests the team could once again see a transition, just four years later. Whether it’s Lemieux’s deep-rooted passion for the franchise or the Hoffmann Family’s financial muscle, the question boils down to who can meet—or surpass—the $1.75 billion threshold.For fans, the uncertainty brings mixed emotions. While the team has struggled in recent seasons, the Penguins remain one of hockey’s most marketable brands, anchored by a loyal fan base and a rich championship legacy. If the sale materializes, it could reshape the franchise’s direction for decades.One thing is clear: the Penguins are no longer just playing for playoff contention.

Local businesses brace for economic impact amid U.S. tariffs

Wayne Gretzky’s reputation caught in the crossfire

Brantford, Ontario, long celebrated as the hometown of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, is now facing unexpected economic turbulence as U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods take effect. Local businesses, residents, and even Gretzky’s legacy are feeling the ripple effects of the trade measures announced by President Donald Trump.Graeme Roustan, owner of the historic Roustan Hockey company, expressed frustration at the sudden trade restrictions. “It’s totally ridiculous. This business here has been in place for 178 years and it’s been selling product and trading product with the United States since before Canada was a country,” he said. With finished hockey sticks destined for U.S. customers facing a 25% tariff, Roustan and other manufacturers are rushing shipments to avoid extra costs.Brantford’s economy, tightly linked to cross-border trade, is especially vulnerable. Mayor Kevin Davis noted that some local businesses sell up to 80% of their products in the U.S., while also relying on American suppliers for raw materials.“There’ll be industries in Brantford that may shut down, they may reduce production, they may have to retool, and – for a year or two – not be producing much and employing less,” he warned.Despite this, Davis emphasized the city’s resilience: “You know, we’re nice until we’re not. And yeah, if you want a war, then it’s a war. But it’s a, it’s a totally meaningless war from my perspective.”Beyond economics, the tariffs have stirred controversy around Gretzky himself. Though long admired as Canada’s “Great One,” his public ties to Trump, including attending the inauguration and wearing a MAGA hat, have drawn criticism.Some Canadians have gone so far as to label him a “traitor” online. Local fans, however, remain measured. Rick Mannen, attending a game at the Wayne Gretzky Sports Centre, said, “I wish he would say to Donald ‘back off and treat Canada as a partner instead of trying to take over.’”Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s daughter Paulina Gretzky enjoys Jason Derulo’s LIV Golf concert while teasing her own music future As Brantford navigates the fallout, many residents are turning to Canadian-made products, reflecting a renewed sense of local support.

The potential mega-tsunami threat

Areas at highest risk of tsunami

Urgency of preparedness for tsunami and earthquake





Scientists are sounding the alarm about a potentially devastating mega-tsunami that could strike the U.S. Pacific Coast, triggered by a powerful earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ). This fault line, which spans approximately 600 miles from Northern California to Vancouver Island, is under immense tectonic pressure as the Juan de Fuca Plate is slowly forced beneath the North American Plate.A research team from Virginia Tech, led by geoscientist Tina Dura, estimates there is a 15% chance of an earthquake measuring magnitude 8.0 or higher occurring in this region within the next 50 years.Their findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, warn that such a quake could cause coastal land to suddenly drop by as much as 6.5 feet. This abrupt shift would drastically expand flood zones and generate tsunami waves that could reach hundreds of feet in height. The resulting destruction would pose a serious threat to millions of people, essential infrastructure, and fragile ecosystems along the West Coast.The Cascadia Subduction Zone is one of North America’s most hazardous fault lines, according to the Virginia Tech research team. Over centuries, tectonic stress builds as the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate is forced beneath the North American Plate.When this stress is released during a major earthquake, coastal regions could experience sudden land subsidence, dramatically increasing floodplain areas and altering shorelines almost instantly.The last great earthquake along this fault occurred in 1700, triggering a tsunami recorded as far away as Japan. The Virginia Tech study emphasizes that a similar event today would have far more devastating effects due to dense populations, developed urban infrastructure, and critical transportation networks along the coast. Researchers warn that rapid inundation could leave little time for evacuation, magnifying the human and economic toll.According to simulations conducted by Dura and her team, a major CSZ earthquake could generate a “mega-tsunami” with waves potentially reaching up to 1,000 feet, far surpassing typical tsunami heights of only a few feet. Coastal cities, including Seattle, Portland, and towns in northern California could be submerged within minutes. The Virginia Tech study ran tens of thousands of models, showing that thousands more people, buildings, and miles of roads would be exposed to flooding than current hazard maps predict. The force of such waves could reshape coastlines, erode entire beaches, and permanently alter the geography of the Pacific Northwest.Researchers emphasise that such an event would combine sudden ground subsidence with extreme wave heights, creating conditions unlike any historical tsunami in the region. The study highlights the urgent need for improved early-warning systems, evacuation planning, and resilient infrastructure to minimise potential loss of life. Researchers conclude that proactive measures taken now could significantly reduce the risks posed by a future Cascadia mega-tsunami.The Virginia Tech research identifies southern Washington, northern Oregon, and northern California as the regions most vulnerable to flooding from a CSZ mega-tsunami. While Alaska and Hawaii also face tsunami risks due to their own seismic activity, they are geographically farther from the CSZ and would experience less immediate threat. Low-lying coastal zones along the fault line could face permanent inundation, particularly when combined with climate-driven sea level rise projected by 2100.The study underscores that communities must prioritize flood-resilient urban planning, fortification of critical infrastructure, and preparation for long-term displacement scenarios. Emergency planners are advised to use the study’s simulations to guide evacuation routes, reinforce hospitals and shelters, and prepare for cascading impacts to energy, water, and transportation systems.Research led by Tina Dura highlights that a Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquake has the potential to generate a large tsunami, making advance planning an important priority. The study notes that while such an event could cause significant impacts, careful preparedness can help reduce risks. Factors such as evacuation planning, stronger building codes, and resilient infrastructure are seen as practical steps to improve community safety. Researchers also point out that rising sea levels may add to future challenges, making coordinated efforts even more important.According to Dura, cooperation between local governments, policymakers, and residents through early-warning systems and community preparedness activities can strengthen resilience. The Virginia Tech study concludes that proactive measures taken today can significantly minimize long-term damage, protect vulnerable populations, and ensure quicker recovery for coastal communities after a catastrophic tsunami event in the future.",Researchers from Virginia Tech say there is a 15% chance of an earthquake measuring magnitude 8.0 or higher occurring in this region within the next 50 years.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year.

The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

The corridor will function seven days a week.Currently, East-West Metro is operated in two disjointed sections: the 9.2 km Sector V-Sealdah or Green Line I and the 4.8 km Esplanade-Howrah Maidan or Green Line II. The in-between 2.6 km Esplanade-Sealdah segment will be flagged off on Friday, starting operations across the entire 16.6 km East-West Metro corridor. Green Line II has Sunday services, but there are no trains running on the Sector V-Sealdah section on Sundays.Metro Railway has been running 134 daily services on Green Line II and 108 on Green Line I. When the two sections are linked on Friday, 180 daily services will be provided from 6.35 am to 9.40 pm, across Sector V and Howrah Maidan stations. Commuters will get trains every 8 minutes during morning and evening peak hours and every 10 minutes in the afternoons. During non-rush hours, the gap between trains will be 15 minutes.The tentative schedule available with TOI goes like this: Till 9 am, trains will run at 15-minute intervals. From 9 am to noon, passengers will get trains after every eight minutes. From noon to 4.30 pm, the frequency will be 10 minutes. From 4.30 pm to 8 pm, trains will be available every eight minutes.For the rest of the evening, trains will run at 15-minute intervals. Services will be available on Sundays with operations starting at 9 am, at 15-minute intervals, till 9.40 pm.To accommodate the increased services, five more rakes will be deployed. Currently, five rakes are used between the two disjointed sections. East-West Metro uses the state-of-the-art BEML rakes, which are operated on the communication-based train control (CBTC) or superior signalling system.The rakes need regular upkeep at the Salt Lake Central Park's maintenance-cum-depot. Since there is no stabling yard at the Howrah end, there will be a slight difference between the timings of the trains leaving from the two terminal stations, officials said.Metro Railway on Tuesday said the expected daily ridership of East-West Metro or the Green Line would be six lakhs. Currently, between the two sections, around 1 lakh people use East-West Metro or Green Lines I and II everyday.Officials hinted the number of services may be increased after studying the passenger behaviour for a few weeks.

Radioactive shrimps found?

What is Cesium-137, why is it harmful?





The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Monday warned consumers not to eat certain frozen shrimp products sold at Walmart after tests revealed possible contamination with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope.Federal officials said three lots of Great Value brand frozen shrimp were pulled from Walmart stores after the isotope was detected in shipping containers and a sample of breaded shrimp imported from Indonesia. “If you have recently purchased raw frozen shrimp from Walmart that matches this description, throw it away,” FDA officials said in a statement.Walmart has recalled frozen, raw shrimp sold in 13 states following the warning, the Associated Press reported.Cesium-137, also known as Cs-137, is a byproduct of nuclear reactions, including nuclear weapons testing, reactor operations and nuclear accidents. It is the most common radioactive isotope of cesium, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Cs-137 is also used in medical devices, gauges, and radiation therapy to treat cancer, while in some cases, it emerges as a waste product of nuclear reactors.According to the agency, exposure to low levels of Cesium-137 over time could pose a “potential health concern.”Trace amounts of the isotope are found globally in soil, air and food. While the levels detected in the shrimp were far below FDA intervention thresholds, officials said avoiding potentially contaminated products could help reduce unnecessary exposure to radiation.",FDA warns against consuming certain frozen shrips; cites potential Cesium-137 contamination.

Poll Do you think Afghanistan's control over its water resources will lead to more regional disputes? Yes No

Iran revives Helmand dispute

Pakistan watching Kabul basin closely

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.

Protests mark Hasina’s exit anniversary: Student-led party rallies in Dhaka; calls for new constitution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/protests-mark-hasinas-exit-anniversary-student-led-party-rallies-in-dhaka-calls-for-new-constitution/articleshow/123078902.cms,"Protesters on the streets of Dhaka (AP)





A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

LONDON: A pandit raised in India has become the Royal Navy’s first ever Hindu chaplain.Bhanu Attri (39), who grew up in Himachal Pradesh but now lives in Essex, formally passed out of Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth last week and is also the Royal Navy’s first non-Christian chaplain.He was one of two chaplains and 148 new Royal Navy officers to pass out.Chaplains offer religious, pastoral, welfare and moral support to any member of the naval service, regardless of faith, who need it either at a base, or on ships and submarines. Attri, a Hindu priest with decades of experience running a Hindu temple in London, will also offer Hindu prayer ceremonies for Hindus.There are around 40 Hindu personnel serving full-time in the Royal Navy, plus another 30 in the Maritime Reserves. In the UK military, as a whole, there are more than 1,550 Hindus serving full-time, mostly in the army.Whilst most cadets underwent 29 weeks of training, he underwent a slightly different 13-week course: six weeks of officer instruction, which included learning about the Royal Navy’s worldwide role, its present-day mission, and how to survive a sinking ship; four weeks at sea, and three weeks focused on the role of a military chaplain.Bhanu will now join the chaplaincy at HMS Drake, serving the thousands of personnel working in and around Devonport Naval Base, ashore and at sea.“Passing out from Britannia Royal Naval College to become the first ever Hindu chaplain in the fleet is a profound honour,” Attri said. “The chance to represent individuals from other diverse religions brings meaningful representation for the Hindu community and reflects the Navy’s commitment to diversity, inclusion, and spiritual care for all. My family feels immense pride.”Anil Bhanot, Hindu adviser to the ministry of defence (MoD), said: “In 2023 the Royal Navy created a position for a Hindu chaplain and I endorsed Pandit Bhanu Prakash Attri for best fitting the criteria. He has qualifications from India equivalent to a Sanskrit scriptural postgraduate degree.” Bhanot said he wanted to encourage more Hindu youth to join the British armed forces.“Although our spiritual Bhoomi is India, our Karma-Bhoomi is the UK and MoD represents our protective arm,” he said.","Bhanu Attri (39), who grew up in Himachal Pradesh but now lives in Essex, formally passed out of Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth last week.

"‘Crushing cost’: UK parents skip meals, forego heating to afford school uniforms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/crushing-cost-uk-parents-skip-meals-forego-heating-to-afford-school-uniforms-survey/articleshow/123384048.cms,"Representative AI image





A survey has found that parents in England are skipping meals and relying on buy-now-pay-later services like Klarna to cover the cost of school uniforms ahead of the autumn term.The survey, conducted by parenting charity Parentkind, found that many parents were being pushed into debt to afford school uniforms. Nearly half (45 percent) of respondents said they planned to use credit cards, while a third (34 percent) expected to rely on services such as Klarna.Of the 2,000 parents surveyed, nearly half (47 percent) expressed concern over the high cost of school uniforms, often running into hundreds of pounds for branded items. More than a quarter (29 percent) reported skipping food or heating to meet the cost.Education secretary Bridget Phillipson has called on schools to urgently ease the burden on struggling parents by cutting back on mandatory branded uniform items, ahead of an upcoming change in the law.“School uniform matters, but it shouldn’t break the bank. No family should have to choose between putting food on the table and buying a new blazer,” said Bridget Phillipson as quoted by the Guardian.“Parents have told us they want fewer costly branded items, and that’s exactly what we’re delivering. Schools can help ease the pressure on families right now by reducing the number of branded items they require.” Philllipson added.From September 2026, schools in the UK will be limited to three branded items, plus a branded tie for secondary and middle schools, under the government’s Children and Schools Bill. However, Phillipson has urged parents to adopt the changes earlier on a voluntary basis.The new legislation will allow parents to purchase basic uniform items, such as shirts and trousers, from general retailers like Aldi and Marks and Spencer.At present, schools can require parents to purchase multiple logo-branded items from specialist suppliers, with some demanding more than five, and in certain cases up to 10, pushing total uniform costs to as much as £400 when PE kits are included.“Parents have faced the crushing cost of sending their children to school for far too long. For many families the bills soar into the thousands every year, covering uniforms, books, stationery, trips, laptops and travel. These reforms are the first real step towards ending that injustice,” Parentkind’s chief executive Jason Elsom was quoted as saying by the Guardian.“Limiting branded school uniform items will make a difference straight away. Our research shows 85% of parents believe this will cut costs, 71% prefer to buy plain items and add the logo later, and 83% say unbranded uniform is just as good quality. This is about keeping money in parents’ pockets without sacrificing school pride,” Elsom said.Almost 9 in 10 parents (86 percent) of children aged between 4 to 15 in state schools in England said branded uniforms made no difference to a student’s behavior, as per the survey conducted.",Parents in England are skipping meals and relying on buy-now-pay-later services like Klarna to cover the cost of school uniforms.
