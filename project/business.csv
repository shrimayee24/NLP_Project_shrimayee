600mm July-August rain mark not breached in last 30 yrs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/600mm-july-aug-rain-mark-not-breached-in-last-30-yrs/articleshow/112978223.cms,"July and Aug are the rainiest months of the year in India and the most crucial for kharif sowing . However, in recent decades, countrywide rainfall in these two months has been lower than the average of previous decades.This statistic puts the situation in perspective: July-Aug rainfall crossed the 600mm mark in 28 years from 1901 to 1994, that is, once every 3.4 years on average.However, the 600mm-mark hasn't been breached even once in the last 30 years.""In the last 20-30 years, we have barely seen what can be called a strongly wet year where the monsoon has been clearly above 10% of normal,"" said Roxy Mathew Koll , a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology .A look at the 30-year average rainfall in July-Aug brings out the decreasing trend clearly. Monsoon rainfall in July-Aug has averaged 530.2mm in the last 30 years (1995-2024).This is way lower than the averages in the previous 30-year periods - 543mm during 1965-1994, 587.1mm in 1935-1964 and 559.3 in 1905-1934.One explanation that is given for this trend is that the monsoon behaves in a cyclical manner over ""epochs"" lasting around 30-40 years.The last epoch of decreasing monsoon rainfall began around the 1970s and was preceded by an epoch of higher rainfall. We are currently supposed to be moving into an epoch of higher rainfall, Koll says.However, some experts believe this hypothesis worked well in the previous century but may be running into problems in recent times. ""We keep saying that we are coming out of the weak monsoon epoch but we haven't seen any clear evidence of it yet. It has been a long epoch and we are still in the dip,"" says Koll.Koll further adds that there are certain regions within the country - the Uttar Pradesh-Jharkhand belt and Kerala, for instance - which are showing a stark decline in rainfall in recent decades and this could be linked to climate change .""Climate change patterns are getting more regional. Earlier, the epochal and decadal patterns were much clearer,"" Koll says.""Now, these patterns seem to be getting disrupted. The all-India picture is an aggregate of the regional trends and the decrease in monsoon rainfall in some regions may well be getting reflected in the countrywide trends,"" Koll adds.","In the last 20-30 years, we have barely seen a strongly wet year where the monsoon has been clearly above 10% of normal. Monsoon rainfall in July-Aug has averaged 530.2mm in the last 30 years. This is way lower than the averages in the previous 30-year periods.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112978432,imgsize-17510,width-400,resizemode-4/112978432.jpg"
India's call whether to hand over Hasina or not: Bangladesh interim govt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-call-whether-to-hand-over-hasina-or-not-bdesh-interim-govt/articleshow/112978132.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh 's interim govt will do whatever it takes to get deposed PM Sheikh Hasina back home to face justice, foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said Sunday in remarks that put the onus on India to decide ""whether to hand her over or not"".""If our legal system wants, we will definitely try to bring her back. There is an agreement (with India) and legal processes.It is better not to speculate,"" he told reporters.On whether the interim govt was aware of Hasina's whereabouts in India, the foreign affairs adviser said, ""It is better to ask India about it.""Bangladesh has revoked Hasina and her kin's diplomatic passports, raising questions about whether she can stay in India any longer and whether she faces possible extradition. The approval for the ex-PM to enter India after she fled Bangladesh in the wake of a student-led uprising last month had been granted at short notice, according to officials at the Indian ministry of external affairs.Hossain said in response to a question on MoUs with India that such agreements were not legally binding, and there was always scope for reviewing them in national interest. He confirmed the interim govt's chief adviser Muhammad Yunus will attend 79th UNGA session this month.","Interim govt will do whatever it takes to get deposed PM Sheikh Hasina back home to face justice, foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain says.

New-age brands wooing Gen Zs bag VC funding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-age-brands-wooing-gen-zs-bag-vc-funding/articleshow/112975728.cms,"MUMBAI: India's new-age consumer brands are piquing the interest of venture capital investors. The brands - which have mushroomed over the past few years and most of which are less than 10 years old - have been able to tap into evolving consumer demands and identify gaps in the market, something traditional companies may be late in recognising.Be it the five-year-old luggage brand Mokobara, young fashion brand Snitch or older incumbents like Sugar Cosmetics and Boat, these companies have managed to cater to the tastes of the fashion-forward Gen Z and millennials while also localising their assortment to suit desi nuances.""The big brands which existed were averaging people's requirements. Consumers are demanding more, they want more than average and are willing to pay a premium for that. There is now a fairly large chunk of people who have a reasonable amount of discretionary income,"" V S Kannan Sitaram, co-founder and partner at Fireside ventures, told TOI.The VC fund, for instance, recently invested in Gurgaon-based Moxie Beauty which makes haircare products for Indian hair type, habits and weather - a proposition which global brands hardly offer.Several new-age brands like Mokobara, Sid's Farm, Foxtale, Bummer, and ICON have raised funding from investors this year. Last month, Accel led a $9 million funding in luggage brand Uppercase. New-age direct-to-consumer brands have already pocketed over $400 million from investors so far in 2024, data sourced from market research firm Tracxn showed. Since 2014, the segment has collectively bagged more than $5 billion in funding, the data showed.Analysts at Bain & Company describe these brands as ""insurgent"", with higher adoption among Gen Zs who prefer buying from digital-first brands. ""The increase in India's income and consumption has led to the rise of insurgent brands - young, new brands that cater to the underserved needs of the emerging affluent consumer class. These brands are already growing faster than their respective categories - by approximately three times,"" said Hariharan Premkumar, managing director and head of India at DSG Consumer Partners, which has funded new-age companies like Farmley, Go Desi and SuperBottoms. Such brands are trying to create new categories for Indian consumers who are increasingly seeking more solutions as well as products which can cater to different needs and occasions.With consumers demanding more, there is also an opportunity for them to premiumise. ""The premium segment is underserved and offers a good beachhead for insurgent brands to build from there,"" said Premkumar. In fact, estimates suggest that premiumisation and new category creation will account for about 50% of overall consumption growth by 2030, providing ample scope for new-age brands to capitalise on.With the emergence of quick commerce platforms, brands can also reach consumers faster, said Maanav Sagar, partner at Bharat Founders Fund.","India's new-age consumer brands are piquing the interest of venture capital investors.

Delay in heinous crime trials raises questions about sensitivity: Prez Murmu,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delay-in-heinous-crime-trials-raises-questions-about-sensitivity-prez-murmu/articleshow/112974909.cms,"NEW DELHI: President Droupadi Murmu on Sunday said people feel the judicial process lacks sensitivity when verdicts in heinous crimes like those against women, including rape, is long delayed and said every judge and judicial officer has the ""moral responsibility to respect dharma, truth and justice"".Speaking at the valedictory ceremony of the national conference of district judiciary, Murmu said it had become a part of social life that those who commit crimes roam around freely and fearlessly, while the victims cower in fear of court cases and reprisal from the criminals.In what could be a reflection on liberal bail policy adopted by the Supreme Court and HCs by invigorating the 'bail is the rule and jail is the exception' principle, the Prez said, ""Those who suffer from their crimes live in fear as if those poor people have committed some crime.""She said commoners are afraid of courts and approach the judiciary for grievance redressal as a last resort. ""Often, they tolerate injustice silently because they feel that fighting for justice can make their lives more miserable. For them, going away from the village to the court even once becomes a cause of great mental and financial pressure,"" she said.""In such a situation, many people cannot even imagine the pain that poor people experience due to the culture of adjournment. Every possible measure should be taken to change this situation,"" she told the gathering of SC judges, HC chief justices and over 800 judicial officers.Murmu said the Constitution has provided for grassroots level democracy through panchayats and municipalities and asked the top judges whether they could devise a justice system at the grassroots level. The Gram Nyayalaya Act, which came into force on Oct 2, 2009, is yet to be fully implemented. A PIL seeking implementation of the Act in letter and spirit is pending in Supreme Court.The Prez was concerned about the future of children of women prisoners and said the lives of these youngsters must be taken care of to ensure that they achieve their full potential. ""Taking measures to improve their thinking and mental health, providing them with useful skills for living, and providing them free legal aid should also be our priority,"" she added.She said pendency was a huge challenge for the judiciary and expressed dismay that many cases were yet to be decided even three decades after their institution. She suggested holding of frequent Lok Adalats to settle maximum number of cases amicably between contesting parties.""District-level courts determine the image of the judiciary in the minds of crores of citizens.

CJI pitches for all-India judicial services to fill vacancies and reduce pendency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-pitches-for-all-india-judicial-services-to-fill-vacancies-and-reduce-pendency/articleshow/112974896.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud on Sunday said district courts working with 30% vacancy in judicial officers had achieved 95% disposal rate and said to tackle the monstrous backlog of 4.5 crore cases, time had come to think of implementing All India Judicial Services (AIJS) for quick filling of vacancies for expeditious disposal of cases and reducing pendency .Speaking at valedictory ceremony of the two-day national conference of district judiciary to mark 75 years of SC, the CJI said, ""Our current national average disposal rate stands at 95%.""""Despite progress, tackling pending cases remains a challenge. Increasing our disposal-to-filing ratio hinges on attracting skilled personnel. At district level, vacancies in judicial personnel stand at 28% and of non-judicial staff at 27%. For disposal to outweigh the institution of cases, courts must work beyond the capacity of 71-100%.""""Time has come to think of national integration by recruiting members to judicial services across narrow walls of regionalism and state-centred selections,"" he added. Centre's AIJS, proposed in 2015, had virtually no takers, as only Haryana and Mizoram govts and HCs of Tripura and Sikkim had favoured it. Others opposed it on grounds of linguistic barrier and federalism.The CJI said though women were outnumbering men in recent recruitments of judicial officers across states, sadly only 6.7% district court infrastructure are female friendly. ""Is this acceptable in a nation where basic level of recruitment in some states sees over 60-70% women joining?"" he asked & said judiciary's focus areas were on increasing accessibility measures which could be understood by carrying out infrastructure audits, opening medical facilities and creches in court and technological projects.""Inclusivity in judiciary is a reflection of our broader commitment to equality and justice. Some key measures are developing a comprehensive framework for gender equality in decision making; adopting measures to recruit, retain and promote members from diverse and vulnerable groups; and monitoring impact of gender equality initiatives,"" he said.He said panel on reducing arrears of cases had devised an action plan for reducing pendency through case management. Stages of tackling pendency are - preparatory stage of forming district level case management committees to identify target cases, undated cases, and reconstruction of records; resolve cases which have been pending for 10-20 years, 20-30 years and over 30 years.He said from Jan to June 2025, judiciary shall execute third phase of clearing the backlog of cases pending for over a decade in courts.",Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said district courts working with 30% vacancy in judicial officers had achieved 95% disposal rate.

Her lower body was plastered just six days after she was born, leaving her with weak legs and an irregular leg posture, making her susceptible to various ailments. She underwent several traditional treatments to strengthen her legs.At the tender age of five, Preeti began wearing calipers, which she continued to use for eight years. Despite many doubting her chances of survival, Preeti proved to be a true warrior, overcoming life-threatening situations and emerging triumphant, showcasing her incredible strength and resilience.When Preeti turned 17, her outlook on life began to change as she watched the Paralympic Games on social media. Inspired by what she saw, she realized that she, too, could pursue her dreams.

"Pune: Sculptor behind 'Statue of Unity' working on 100-foot Sambhaji Maharaj statue, says PCMC",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/pune-sculptor-behind-statue-of-unity-working-on-100-foot-sambhaji-maharaj-statue-says-pcmc/articleshow/112966880.cms,"Statue of Unity

PUNE: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Commissioner Shekhar Singh has refuted the reports of cracks on some parts of the Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj statue that have arrived in the city. Singh said that the renowned Indian sculptor Ram Sutar , who had designed the ‘Statue of Unity’ in Gujarat, has been appointed as the sculptor for the 100-foot statue that will be installed in the Moshi area in Pimpri Chinchwad. IIT Bombay was also roped in to look into the structural stability of it.Singh said that the videos circulating on social media platforms are ‘an act of mischief’ and the reports of cracks are false. It may be noted that the civic body will be spending more than Rs 40 Crore for the project, and the statue will be installed on around 2.5 acres of land near the PMRDA’s exhibition hall located in the Moshi area to also make it visible for the citizens travelling from the Pune-Nashik highway . The NCP (SCP) leaders and several activists of the city have questioned the quality of the statue and they have demanded an inquiry into the matter.Tushar Kamthe, the city president of NCP (SCP) Pimpri Chinchwad, who on Saturday visited the fabrication godown where the parts of the statue are kept, said, “The wastewater is flowing under the parts of the statue kept in the fabrication godown. Besides, there are cracks to a ‘Mojadi’ (a type of Indian shoe) of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and other parts of the statue which are clearly visible.”The municipal commissioner said that till now only the pedestal work is completed and the installation of the statue is yet to start. “The design of the statue has been finalised by IIT Bombay, renowned sculptor Ram Sutar, and PCMC . Currently, the bronze parts which are made in the fabrication centre of Ram Sutar in Delhi are being transported to his fabrication shed in the city. Once all parts arrive, the installation process will begin,” he said.He further said that IIT Bombay will also do a concurrent evaluation of the structure and a full-time renowned structural engineering firm has also been appointed by PCMC for the project so that the works related to the strength of the statue and pedestal are carried out without any error. It may be noted that earlier the statue was being installed at Vinayaknagar in the same area and some works were also carried out there but later, the civic body changed the plan and it was shifted to PMRDA’s land to make it also visible to people travelling via Pune-Nashik highway. However, the municipal corporation has already paid around Rs 5 Crore to the contractor for the works that were carried our in the earlier proposed site which has now gone into a waste. The municipal commissioner earlier had said that, the base work which was completed earlier can be used for some other project and it will not go waste.","The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Commissioner Shekhar Singh has refuted the reports of cracks on some parts of the Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj statue that have arrived in the city.

People consider every judge in the country as God. Every judge and judicial officer of our country has the moral responsibility to respect dharma, truth and justice. At the district level, this moral responsibility is the lighthouse of the judiciary. The district-level courts determine the image of the judiciary in the minds of crores of citizens. Therefore, providing justice to the people through the district courts with sensitivity and promptness and at a low cost is the basis of the success of our judiciary,"" said the President, who also unveiled the flag and insignia of the Supreme Court on the occasion.While noting that in recent years there have been significant improvements in the availability of infrastructure, facilities, training and human resources of the judiciary at the district level, the President highlighted that pendency and backlog of cases is a big challenge before the judiciary.She stressed the need to ponder upon the serious issue of cases remaining pending for as long as over 32 years.The President emphasised that programmes such as special Lok Adalat week should be organised more frequently, which will help in tackling the pendency of cases.The President further said there are many challenges before our judiciary which will require coordinated efforts by all stakeholders to resolve them. ""For example, the judiciary, government and police administration should work together to find solutions to issues related to evidence and witnesses,"" she said.The President said that when court decisions in a heinous crime like rape come after a generation has passed, the common man feels that the judicial process lacks sensitivity.

Those who suffer from their crimes live in fear as if those poor people have committed some crime, she added.The President further said that the poor people from villages are afraid to go to court. ""They become a participant in the justice process of the court only under great compulsion. Often they tolerate injustice silently because they feel that fighting for justice can make their lives more miserable.

In such a situation, many people cannot even imagine the pain that poor people experience due to the culture of adjournment. Every possible measure should be taken to change this situation,"" the President added.The President also noted that the SC has ordered the implementation of the provision of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita with retrospective effect. Under this, there is a provision to release first-time accused and those who have served one-third of the prescribed maximum imprisonment period, on bail. She expressed confidence that by implementing the new system of criminal justice with this promptness, the judiciary will usher in a ""new era of justice"".",President Droupadi Murmu said Indian jurisprudence has a very respectable place because of the Supreme Court. She stressed the need to ponder upon the serious issue of cases remaining pending for as long as over 32 years.

"North India likely to see heavy rainfall in September, cautions IMD",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/north-india-likely-to-see-heavy-rainfall-in-sept-cautions-imd/articleshow/112957620.cms,"NEW DELHI: Continuing its Aug trend, monsoon rainfall in most parts of the country in Sept is likely to be ' above normal ', with some states, including Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and parts of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, expecting extremely heavy rainfall that could lead to floods and landslides, India Meteorological Department said Saturday. India reported 16% more than 'normal' rainfall in Aug, the fifth highest in the month since 2001 and 29th highest since 1901.Good rains (287mm) in Aug, however, could not bring down the overall temperature during the month as it reported the highest average minimum temperature and fourth-highest average mean temperature since 1901.This can be attributed to variation in spatial distribution of rainfall - northwest India got 32% more than 'normal' rainfall in Aug (second highest in the month since 2001), whereas south peninsula received merely around 1% more than normal rains in the month.Though the country as a whole is likely to get 'above-normal' rainfall in Sept, in certain areas - north Bihar, northeast UP, most parts of northeast India, extreme northwest India and many parts of south peninsular India - it is likely to be 'below normal'. Overall, the four-month (June-Sept) monsoon season, as predicted in mid-April, will be logged as 'above-normal' rainfall activity.Good rains in Aug, mainly in 'monsoon core' zone (rainfed areas), already had its positive impact on kharif sowing. Total acreage of the season is well on course to cross 'normal' (average of past five years) sown area, indicating possibility of a higher foodgrain output in the crop year. Good rains in monsoon season also mean adequate soil moisture and enough water in reservoirs to feed rabi (winter-sown) crops.La Nina phenomenon has, however, not yet formed. It is now expected to be formed by Sept-end, but it won't have any effect on the current rainy season as the summer monsoon may, by that time, be in its withdrawal phase.La Nina during Sept-Nov generally weakens the northeast (winter) monsoon in southeast India.""It is, however, too early to predict its impact. We would be able to say anything on this by Sept-end. We'll also see how the La Nina will lead to cyclonic conditions,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD.On the reasons for heavy rainfall in Aug, he said six low-pressure systems formed during the month (out of that one became a deep depression and another a cyclone) could be one of the major influencing factors. Aug generally sees an increase in trend for the 'break' (pause) days of monsoon, but such a phase was missing this time and the month could see one of the highest number of active days in the recent past. Earlier such high numbers of active days were observed in 2020 and 2022.Mohapatra said, ""Above-normal maximum (day) temperatures are likely over most parts of the country, except for some areas in northwest India, south peninsular India, and some pockets of east-central India, where normal to below-normal maximum temperatures are likely.""","Some states, including Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and parts of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, expecting extremely heavy rainfall that could lead to floods and landslides. India reported 16% more than 'normal' rainfall in Aug, the fifth highest in the month since 2001 and 29th highest since 1901.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112962904,imgsize-2536327,width-400,resizemode-4/112962904.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Amid ongoing protest against the Eknath Shinde government in Maharashtra , NCP (SP) president Sharad Pawar on Sunday said that opposition won't sit quietly till the Mahayuti government was removed from power. He said that the new government would be formed on the ideals of Shivaji, whose statue collapsed in Sindhudurg district on August 26, sparking criticism for the ruling government.""I assure you (party workers) that if you show your unity, then we will not sit quietly till the government in Maharashtra is changed in the next two months and a new government is formed on the ideals of Shivaji Maharaj that will safeguard the interests of people,"" Pawar said.The collapse of the Shivaji statue at Rajkot Fort in Malvan tehsil has sparked a firestorm in the state, with the opposition accusing the BJP-led Mahayuti of ""corruption"" and ""insult"" to the icon.Earlier in the day, Pawar participated in a protest march organized by the opposition bloc Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) from Hutatma Chowk to the Gateway of India in South Mumbai, in response to the statue collapse.The 'jode maro andolan' (hitting with slippers) protest highlighted the unity among the Maha Vikas Aghadi partners—Shiv Sena (UBT), NCP (SP), and Congress—against the ruling coalition of Shiv Sena, BJP, and NCP.","Sharad Pawar said that opposition won't sit quietly till the Mahayuti government was removed from power.

National Security Guard (NSG)

Para SF (Para Special Forces)

Garud Commando Force

Ghatak Force

COBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action)

Special Frontier Force (SFF)

Special forces , or Special Operations Forces (SOF), are elite military units designed for high-stakes missions that require specialised skills and tactics. Emerging in the early 20th century and expanding significantly during World War II, these forces have become vital for disruptive operations, including sabotage and covert strikes. Their primary role is to handle high-risk situations that demand precise and strategic intervention.Established by the Indian Navy in 1987, MARCOS excels in direct actions, special reconnaissance, amphibious warfare, and counter-terrorism.Known for their rigorous training and mental toughness, MARCOS are often referred to as the ""Dadiwala Fauj"" (Bearded Army) due to their disguises.India's premier counter-terrorism force, the NSG, is tasked with VIP security, anti-sabotage checks, and neutralising threats to critical infrastructure. With a demanding selection process that sees a 70–80% dropout rate, the NSG is split into the Special Action Group (SAG) and the Special Rangers Group (SRG).Formed in 1966, the Para SF is part of the Indian Army 's elite Parachute Regiment. These commandos specialise in rapid deployment behind enemy lines to disrupt and destroy key defensive positions.Created in 2004, the Garud Commando Force is the Indian Air Force’s special operations unit. It boasts the longest training period among Indian special forces—three years. Garud commandos are responsible for protecting air force bases, conducting rescue operations, and supporting air operations.Operating within the Indian Army, the Ghatak Force consists of elite infantry platoons that lead assaults and spearhead strikes. Each battalion has a Ghatak Platoon, composed of highly motivated and physically fit soldiers trained for counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations.A specialised unit of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), COBRA was formed to combat Naxalism. It is one of the few Indian forces exclusively trained in guerrilla warfare and has played a significant role in countering Naxalite groups.Established in 1962, the SFF was created for covert operations behind enemy lines, particularly in conflicts with China. Operating under India's external intelligence agency, RAW, the SFF reports directly to the Prime Minister and the Directorate General of Security.","Special forces, or Special Operations Forces, are elite military units designed for high-stakes missions that require specialised skills and tactics.

State-wise data for six years showed that UP reported the highest cases (280) followed by Madhya Pradesh (207), Assam (205), Maharashtra (155) and Karnataka (79).The analysis, carried out by non-profit Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, highlighted that going by the total number of 1,551 cases, this works out to an annual average of a little more than 258 cases. ""In other words, on an average, almost five cases (4.9) of rape/gangrape with murder were reported every week between 2017-2022,"" the report said. The NCRB in its annual 'Crime In India' report began reporting statistics about rape/gangrape followed by murder as a separate category from 2017.As far as outcomes go, out of the 308 cases in which trial was completed, a little less than two-thirds (65%) of cases (200) resulted in conviction. In more than a third of cases, the outcome was one of discharge (6%) or acquittal of the accused (28%). The rate of conviction was lowest in 2017 (57.89%) and highest in 2021 (75%). It was 69% in 2022.NCRB's data showed that the number of rape/gangrape with murder cases before trial courts increased year on year during the period under study. The total number of cases - backlog plus new cases sent for trial - was at its lowest (574 cases) in 2017 and steadily increased to 1,333 by 2022 which is an increase of 132%.CHRI director Venkatesh Nayak said, ""It is extremely worrisome that in a large number of cases, the police filed a final report instead of a chargesheet after the completion of investigation. As many as 140 cases of rape/gangrape with murder were closed with a final report during the six-year period with 97 of these closed due to insufficient evidence to try the accused for rape/gangrape with murder.""NCRB captures this data with regard to cases where the police investigation was not able to unearth sufficient evidence to try the accused or where the accused remained untraced, or the complaint was found to be false or where the case ended as a mistake of fact or law or the issue was in the nature of civil dispute.In four of the six years under study, the rate of chargesheeting was above 90% even during the pandemic years. The success rate dipped below 90% in 2018 (87%) and more recently in 2022 (85%). However, the findings also show that the police have not been able to complete investigation in 32-49% cases of rape/gangrape with murder during this period.","The highest number of cases of rape/gangrape with murder at 294 were reported in 2018.

The BJP often uses the term ""double-engine"" to refer to its rule both at the Centre and state while vouching for accelerated growth.At a ""Badlav Jansabha"" at Naraingarh in the Ambala district along with Anurag Dhanda, the Aam Aadmi Party's ( AAP ) Haryana unit senior vice president, Mann said the people of the state have repeatedly given chances to the Congress, BJP, and the INLD, ""but there has been no improvement"".""Over the past 78 years, the problems being faced by the people have only increased under different governments,"" he claimed.Appealing to the people to vote for the AAP in the October 5 Assembly elections , Mann said, ""Delhi and Punjab found a new path and a new engine for progress. Similarly, Haryana needs a new engine as well, not any double engine.""Pointing out that Haryana shares its borders with Delhi and Punjab, he said both states have AAP governments that provide free electricity to people while education and healthcare sectors have seen significant improvements.Haryana is lagging in these aspects, the Punjab chief minister said and described the AAP as a viable alternative.Mann claimed that Punjab provides the cheapest electricity to industries while 90 per cent of households in the state have been receiving zero electricity bills for the past two years.""Free electricity is also available in Delhi.

Is this acceptable today in a nation where, at the basic level of recruitment in some states, over 60 or 70 per cent of the recruits are women? Our focus areas are on increasing accessibility measures, which can be understood by carrying out infrastructural audits. Opening in-court medical facilities, creches and technological projects like e-seva Kendras and video conferencing devices. These endeavours aim to increase access to justice,"" the CJI said.CJI Chandrachud further called for a safe and accommodating environment for all sections of society and emphasized the need to confront the biases faced by vulnerable groups at the bar and the bench.""Axiomatically, we must also ensure that our courts provide a safe and accommodating environment for all members of our society, particularly for groups such as women and other vulnerable groups such as persons with disability, members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and people across the socio-economic landscape. With the increasing number of women coming into the judiciary, we must also confront the biases which we may unwittingly have towards our colleagues at the bar and the bench,"" he said.CJI Chandrachud highlighted the action plan formulated by the Committee on Reducing Arrears of Cases as he addressed the issue of case pendency. The CJI emphasized the importance of intricate coordination and data management in executing these strategies effectively.""The three stages of the action plan include first, the preparatory stage of forming district-level case management committees to identify target cases, undated cases and reconstruction of records. The second stage, which is ongoing, aims to resolve cases which have been pending before the courts for 10 to 20 years, 20 to 30 years and more than 30 years. Third, from January to June 2025, the judiciary shall execute the third phase of clearing the backlogs of cases pending for over a decade in courts. This effort requires an intricate coordination of various applications and data management systems to plan and track our strategies. Some of the other strategies for dealing with the backlog include pre-litigation dispute resolution,"" the CJI said.The CJI also underscored the success of the Supreme Court's first-ever National Lok Adalat, where nearly 1,000 cases were resolved amicably in just five working days. During the conference, CJI Chandrachud pushed for a standardized recruitment process that transcends regional and state-specific biases, promoting national integration and ensuring a more equitable selection of judges.""To fill the vacancies, the conference deliberated upon the criteria for selection of judges and standardizing the recruitment calendars for all vacancies. The time has really come now to truly think of national integration by having a recruitment to the judicial service which crosses the narrow domestic walls of regionalism and state-centered selections,"" he said.The CJI reaffirmed the Constitution's foundational principles of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity, which continue to guide the judicial system's evolution. ""Over 75 years ago, the axis of the Earth aligned itself a little more closely with the axis of justice India, one fifth of the human race, gave itself a democratic and republican constitution. The Constitution, which promised to digress from the path of a hierarchical and discriminatory society governed by colonial operation. A Constitution which would modernize the country and champion social justice through a democratic and peaceful process.

"No footpath for 44% of Delhi roads, existing 26% meet norms: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/no-footpath-for-44-of-delhi-roads-existing-26-meet-norms-report/articleshow/112974030.cms,"Occupants of four-wheeled vehicles were much less likely to die, but these vehicles were involved as impacting vehicles at high rates.

NEW DELHI: Around 44% of roads in Delhi have no footpath and only a little over one-fourth of the existing ones meet the width and height norms prescribed by the Indian Road Congress (IRC), according to a report released by IIT-Delhi .These details, highlighted in the India Status Report on Road Safety released on the eve of the World Safety Summit in Delhi on Monday, come at a time when there is much talk and discussion about making the national capital safer and more pedestrian-friendly.Quoting the findings of the audit carried out in Delhi this year, following an order by the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety, the report mentions that compliance with the mandatory helmet-wearing rule is better on urban roads in the national capital, where more than 88% of two-wheeler drivers and pillion riders wear helmets. However, on rural roads, around 65% of two-wheeler drivers and 31% of pillion riders wear helmets.The report also mentions the findings of the study of FIRs lodged by Delhi Police in 2019, 2021 and 2022, highlighting how nearly 44% of the people killed in road crashes in the capital during these three years were pedestrians, followed by two-wheeler riders (40%). According to the analysis, a significant 45% of vehicles involved in road fatalities were recorded as 'unknown' in FIRs, while another 18% were trucks, and 14% were cars.""These details simply show that we must set quantitative targets for reducing risk to pedestrians and motorised two-wheelers users as the immediate priority in Delhi and other states and UTs as well,"" said Geetam Tiwari , professor at Transport Research and Injury Prevention Centre at IIT, Delhi. Pedestrians, cyclists and two-wheeler riders are catergorised as the most vulnerable road users (VRUs).The FIRs filed in 2020 were not included in the analysis since it was a pandemic year - the number of road crashes was lowest due totraffic restrictions during that year.Road safety activists Prerna Arora Singh and Sarika Panda Bhatt asked if govts can build wider highways and city roads why can't they provide safe and comfortable space for pedestrians. ""Cities can be pedestrian-friendly when we provide safe and required space for people to walk,"" said Bhatt who spearheads the Raahgiri in the National Capital Region (NCR).Besides Delhi, the FIRs filed in five other states - Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh, Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand - were also studied to find the share of victims under different categories of road users and the impacting vehicles as well.""Though reliable crash data are a prerequisite for effective safety programs, India does not have a reliable crash surveillance system. Therefore, this report presents an analysis of data extracted from FIRs... Additionally, this report summarises results from audits of the compliance of states with Supreme Court directives to establish robust road safety governance frameworks, including institutional arrangements, infrastructure enhancements, enforcement measures, educational initiatives, and medical care improvements,"" the report said.It said motorcyclists face very high risks across the country. In contrast, occupants of four-wheeled vehicles were much less likely to die, but these vehicles were involved as impacting vehicles at high rates.","44% of roads in Delhi have no footpath and only a little over one-fourth of the existing ones meet the width and height norms prescribed by the Indian Road Congress.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals.

Former Trump aide drops a bombshell: 'She hates ...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-melania-secretly-rooting-for-kamala-harris-former-trump-aide-drops-a-bombshell-she-hates-/articleshow/112978592.cms,"Scaramucci’s brief White House tenure

Melania Trump’s low-profile life

Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci has made headlines again with a provocative claim: Melania Trump may be more invested in a Kamala Harris victory than he is. According to Scaramucci, Melania’s enthusiasm for Harris is not just a matter of political preference but is deeply rooted in her strong dislike for her husband, Donald Trump.Scaramucci shared this surprising insight on the MediasTouch podcast, where he suggested that Melania’s support for Harris could surpass even his own.“I think Melania Trump might be the only person who feels that way,” Scaramucci said, hinting that her intense aversion to Trump is so significant that it affects her political choices. He humorously noted that even his wife and the podcast host’s spouse seem more neutral compared to Melania’s fervent stance.Adding a touch of humor, Scaramucci joked that General Mark Milley is the only individual he knows who harbors even stronger negative feelings toward Trump than Melania. “It’s almost as if Melania’s hatred sets the benchmark for how much someone can dislike Trump,” he quipped.Anthony Scaramucci, known for his brief and tumultuous role as White House Communications Director, served in the position from July 21 to July 31, 2017. His short stint was marked by high drama and controversy, including the resignation of Sean Spicer, which was reportedly tied to Scaramucci’s appointment. The former aide’s departure was ultimately influenced by John Kelly, the new Chief of Staff, who questioned his credibility.Trump has consistently dismissed Scaramucci’s comments, attributing them to personal animosity and grudge-holding.Meanwhile, Melania Trump has kept a low profile, focusing on her personal life rather than her husband’s 2024 campaign. Besides a few fundraisers and a brief public statement following a serious incident involving Trump, she has remained out of the spotlight. Melania is also gearing up for the release of her memoir, Melania, set for October 1. The memoir promises an inspiring look into her personal journey and experiences.Recently, Melania expressed her affection for New York, where her son Barron is about to start college. Although details about Barron’s college choice are still under wraps, Melania’s message highlights her current focus on family and personal milestones.","Scaramucci shared this surprising insight on the MediasTouch podcast.

She also disclosed that more than 400 individuals, including students and members of the public, have lost their sight due to police action, with some losing vision in one eye and others in both eyes.""So far 1,000 people have been killed and more than 400 students and members of the general public have lost their sight.Many have been blind in one eye, while others are blind in both,"" Nurjahan was quoted as saying by the bdnews24.com news portal.During her visit to the hospital, Nurjahan Begum interacted with injured police personnel and inquired about their condition. She mentioned that many officers had sustained injuries to their heads and legs.Begum also noted that the interim government has taken responsibility for the families of those who have lost their lives and has pledged to provide free treatment to the injured.Nurjahan Begum said, ""Some have had severe leg injuries and even had to have their legs amputated. We are in discussions with various donor organizations and the World Bank to bring in a team of doctors from abroad for proper treatment. We are making efforts in this regard.""The protests, which began as an anti-discrimination student movement against the controversial quota system in jobs, escalated into a violent confrontation between protesters and security forces.The movement later evolved into an anti-government campaign, demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina . On August 5, Hasina stepped down and sought refuge in India, leading to the formation of an interim government headed by the 84-year-old Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief adviser.Yunus has committed to holding elections but highlighted that a ""free, fair and participatory"" election can only be conducted once the interim government has fulfilled its mandate to implement crucial reforms.Amidst rising cases against Hasina in Bangladesh, foreign affairs advisor, Touhid Hossain, said that if the home ministry or law ministry makes a request for Sheikh Hasina's extradition in the future, India will be obligated to comply with their demand. Hossain said that while he is not the appropriate person to address this matter, if such a request is made, it could create an uncomfortable situation for the Indian government.","The protests against the Sheikh Hasina-led government have claimed the lives of over 1,000 people.

Who is Maya Neelakantan?

There are two major musical moments in Season 4 of Stranger Things. The first is, of course, Kate Bush’s ""Running Up That Hill,"" and the second is Metallica ’s "" Master of Puppets ,"" which Eddie Munson plays in the Upside Down, a scene that has been labeled ""the most metal scene of all time."" Now, Joseph Quinn (who plays Eddie Munson) has some competition, and she’s even more metal.One of the standout performers at America’s Got Talent was 10-year-old Maya Neelakantan whose Master of Puppets cover wowed every judge and even Metallica who shared her performance on Facebook.She wrote on YouTube: ""Thank you so much! It was such an honor that Metallica trusted me that I’ll make them proud and I was able to play this iconic Metallica song for the first time ever on AGT! And the AGT crew are amazing in creating such an incredible unforgettable experience. Metallica was the reason I started playing guitar since 6 years old and now it feels like a full circle that I got to play Metallica for my 2nd ever biggest stage performance. That's what made this day most special for me! Thank you all for the love and support. It means a lot!""Maya advanced to the quarterfinals of America’s Got Talent, where she delivered a powerful rendition of Metallica's Master of Puppets, using a Gibson Flying V metallic silver guitar. Despite her electrifying performance, she did not advance to the semifinals. However, her journey on AGT significantly boosted her profile, earning her fans worldwide, including notable musicians like Gary Holt of Exodus and Slayer, who attended her audition to show his support.Here’s what you ought to know about the guitar prodigy :Maya Neelakantan, born on May 4, 2013, in Chennai, India, is a young guitar prodigy renowned for her unique fusion of heavy metal and Carnatic music . Hailing from MRC Nagar, Raja Annamalai Puram in Chennai, Maya has captivated audiences worldwide with her extraordinary talent and innovative musical style. Her journey began at the tender age of six when she picked up the guitar under the influence of her father, who, though not a professional musician, had a passion for playing riffs from iconic metal bands like Metallica and Slayer. This early exposure to rock music sparked Maya's interest, and soon she was learning to play her first song, ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" by Metallica.Maya's multicultural background has played a significant role in shaping her musical identity. Her father, an IT company owner with a background in astrophysics, and her mother, Lorina, an Australian entrepreneur, met in Australia. Maya’s diverse heritage and her family's musical inclinations inspired her to explore various genres, blending them seamlessly in her performances. At nine, she began formal training in Carnatic music with Prasanna Ramaswamy, a renowned Tamil guitarist based in New York. Prasanna's mentorship helped Maya develop a profound understanding of Carnatic music, which she skillfully integrates with her heavy metal renditions.Maya’s talent soon caught the attention of the global music community. In 2022, her cover of ""7empest"" by the Grammy-winning rock band Tool went viral on her YouTube channel, which her father had set up to showcase her skills. This performance impressed Adam Jones, Tool's guitarist, who became an admirer of her work. Jones even gifted Maya a customized Gibson Adam Jones Les Paul guitar, marking a significant milestone in her burgeoning career.In 2024, Maya's exceptional abilities led her to the stage of America's Got Talent (AGT), where she auditioned for the show's 19th season. Her performance was broadcast in June 2024, but the actual audition took place two months earlier when she was just ten years old. Dressed in traditional Indian attire, Maya wowed the audience and judges with a mesmerizing blend of a Carnatic devotional intro and a heavy metal rendition of ""Last Resort"" by Papa Roach. This unique fusion not only earned her a standing ovation but also garnered praise from all the AGT judges. Simon Cowell, known for his critical eye, hailed her as a ""rock goddess,"" while Howie Mandel predicted that her performance would go viral.Beyond her television appearances, Maya has continued to develop her musical style, drawing on her dual love for heavy metal and Carnatic music. She credits her grandmother for introducing her to Carnatic music at the age of two, a genre that has remained close to her heart even as she explored the world of metal. Maya's ambition to merge these two seemingly disparate styles has driven her to create a unique sound that reflects her diverse influences and her desire to push musical boundaries.","Maya Neelakantan is a young guitar prodigy renowned for her unique fusion of heavy metal and Carnatic music.

Early Times American Blended Whiskey

Consumption Volume: In 2022, Americans consumed approximately 75 million 9-liter cases of whiskey, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS). This includes various types of whiskey, such as bourbon, rye, Tennessee whiskey, and blended whiskey. Growth Rate: The whiskey category has seen a consistent growth rate. In 2022, the overall volume of whiskey consumption increased by about 4% compared to the previous year. This growth is partly driven by a rising interest in premium and super-premium whiskey categories, which have seen even higher growth rates. Bourbon, Tennessee, and Rye Whiskey: These specific types of American whiskey are particularly popular. In 2022, the combined sales of Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, and rye whiskey reached over 29 million 9-liter cases, showing a growth of approximately 5.5% from the previous year. Spending on Whiskey: Consumer spending on whiskey also reflects its popularity. In 2022, whiskey sales in the U.S. reached about $5.1 billion, with a significant portion of this revenue coming from premium and super-premium brands. Craft Whiskey: The craft whiskey segment continues to grow rapidly. There are now over 2,000 craft distilleries in the U.S., many of which are focusing on producing high-quality, small-batch whiskeys that cater to a more discerning consumer base. Craft whiskey sales have seen double-digit growth rates in recent years. Exports: U.S. whiskey exports have also been robust. In 2022, American whiskey exports reached nearly $1 billion, showing a strong demand in international markets, particularly in Europe and Asia.

Inspired by the STR process popularized by whiskey consultant Dr. Jim Swan, this method enhances the oak's influence, resulting in a richly complex whisky. At 55.6% ABV, this expression is both powerful and nuanced.The nose is rich and aromatic, featuring dried fruit, caramel, and toasted oak, with subtle hints of spice, dark chocolate, and a touch of citrus adding depth. On the palate, it's full-bodied and intense, delivering bold flavors of toffee, dark chocolate, and roasted nuts. The triple cask aging imparts layers of spice, charred wood, and a slight smokiness, balanced by sweeter notes of vanilla and honey.

Moreover, a brief knowledge about sanitation, nutrition and feeding habits among women and children should form the core focus of government-driven campaigns and policies.It is impossible to attain even a minimal reduction in undernutrition and malnutrition indicators without consistent funding and healthcare system improvements to close the wealth and poverty divides between rich and poor communities, as well as between rural and urban areas, Dawn stated citing the opinion piece.Earlier this month, the Pakistan government and the IMF staff concluded the ninth review of the $6.5 billion bailout package without a staff-level agreement. The Pakistan government had hoped that they would be able to convince the IMF about implementing the conditions in a gradual manner.However, Islamabad's hopes were dashed during the IMF mission's 10-day visit to Pakistan.","Pakistan's lawmakers cannot escape the fact that malnutrition is a major socioeconomic determinant of maternal health, gender empowerment, child marriage and education. 4 out of 10 children under five years of age are stunted, 17.7 per cent suffer from wasting, 28.9 per cent are underweight and 9.5 per cent in same age bracket are overweight.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112967135,imgsize-23132,width-400,resizemode-4/112967135.jpg"

The second case of M-Pox was confirmed last week, with the patient also identified at Peshawar airport, as reported by Dawn.On Thursday, medical personnel at Bacha Khan International Airport detected two travellers displaying symptoms of the M-Pox virus, previously known as monkey pox. They were transferred to the Police and Services Hospital (PSH) for immediate treatment.Documents including the 'Suspected Passengers Data Form' for each individual, indicated that both passengers were on the same flight from Jeddah to Peshawar, reported Dawn News.The confirmed case involved a 51-year-old man from Orakzai, who is currently in stable condition and undergoing treatment at the PSH.""This is the third confirmed case of M-Pox in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the year 2024,"" Roghani stated, adding that no locally transmitted cases had been reported thus far. ""The Rapid Response Team took the patient's samples and sent them to the laboratory.""Meanwhile, samples from the second patient, a 47-year-old man from Peshawar, were also sent to the laboratory for testing, and results are awaited.The Health Director informed that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Department has established an integrated surveillance and response system for M-Pox.The WHO raised its highest level of alert over the outbreak in Africa after cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo spread to neighbouring countries. Since January 2023, there have been 27,000 cases and over 1,100 deaths, primarily among children, in the DRC, Dawn reported.One case each of the Clade 1b variant has been confirmed in Sweden and Thailand, marking the first instances of its spread beyond Africa. However, the WHO has not recommended any travel restrictions to curb the spread of M-Pox.The disease presents with flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions. While typically mild, it can be fatal, particularly for children, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems.","The third case of M-Pox virus in Pakistan was confirmed at the Peshawar airport.

Pakistan: 12 students injured in Khairpur classroom incident after roof plaster collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-12-students-injured-in-khairpur-classroom-incident-after-roof-plaster-collapse/articleshow/112946158.cms,"Twelve eighth-grade students were injured at a government high school in Basiro village, Khairpur district, when a large section of concrete plaster fell from the classroom ceiling, Dawn News reported.The incident happened during a class session, and the large plaster pieces scattered across the classroom, causing severe head injuries to several students.A distressing video that has circulated online shows the chaotic scene, with students having bloodied heads and faces being rushed for medical help.A teacher from the school reported that there were 80 students in the classroom at the time of the incident--56 boys and 24 girls. The plaster fell in the boys' section, and fortunately, no female students were injured.The immediate aftermath saw a frantic rescue operation as teaching and non-teaching staff, along with local villagers, rushed to assist the injured students, reported Dawn News.Many of the students were taken to nearby health facilities in Pacca Chang and Basiro villages for treatment.The students who were hurt have been identified as Jawad Shaikh, Islamuddin, Shafiq Ahmad, Khalid, Faraz Ahmad, Ansar Balouch, Hassan Rajpar, Gulzar Tanwari, Zuhaib, Mubarak, Nawab Ali, and Nadeem.The teacher also mentioned that several officials from the education department had conducted inspections of the classroom since the incident. This inspection is part of a broader investigation into the school's infrastructure, which has been a concern due to the ongoing reconstruction of the upper floors of the building.The school had been forced to hold classes in the lower portion of the building, which was in a deteriorated condition, due to the extensive reconstruction work.This lack of maintenance contributed to the classroom's vulnerability, highlighting systemic issues within the school's infrastructure management, Dawn reported.The incident underscores the urgent need for improved safety measures and maintenance protocols in educational institutions to prevent such tragedies in the future.","A large section of concrete plaster fell from the ceiling of a government high school in Khairpur district, Pakistan.

What Bangladesh's interim govt minister said on Sheikh Hasina's extradition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/what-interim-govt-minister-said-on-sheikh-hasinas-extradition/articleshow/112947205.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's foreign affairs advisor, Touhid Hossain , on Saturday that if the home ministry or law ministry makes a request for Sheikh Hasina 's extradition in the future, India will be obligated to comply with their demand.Hossain said that while he is not the appropriate person to address this matter, if such a request is made, it could create an uncomfortable situation for the Indian government.""Her (Sheikh Hasina) is staying in Delhi, in India...I am not the right person to answer this. If there is a request from there (Ministry of Home and Ministry of Law) we have to ask for her return to Bangladesh,"" Touhid said.If there is a demand from there, and that creates an embarrassing situation for the Indian government, so I think the Indian government knows this and I am sure they will take care of it,"" he added.Currently, Sheikh Hasina is residing in India and has accused the United States of playing a role in her removal from power. Regarding Bangladesh's foreign policy, Hossain explained that their approach is to maintain positive relationships with all countries while prioritizing their national interests.""Our policy is to maintain good relations with all countries while protecting our national interests. We seek friendship with all and enmity with none, aiming to establish balanced relations. Our primary task is to safeguard our interests,"" Touhid said.Hossain also clarified that it would be inaccurate to assume that the interim government is solely focused on any particular direction, as they aim to maintain smooth and positive relations with all countries, including India and China. He hinted at the possibility of general elections in the country, asserting that their primary objective is to ensure a fair and impartial election process, and speculation at this point is unnecessary.According to The Daily Star newspaper, Hasina, who fled to India on August 5 following her forced resignation amid a student-led mass uprising, is eligible for visa-free entry and a stay of up to 45 days under Indian visa policy for Bangladeshi citizens holding diplomatic or official passports.The extradition of Hasina, who faces 51 cases, including 42 for murder, is governed by the extradition treaty signed between Bangladesh and India in 2013 and amended in 2016. The treaty states that ""extradition may be refused if the offence for which it is requested is an offence of a political character."" However, it also specifies that certain offences, such as murder, ""shall not be regarded as offences of a political character"" for the purposes of the treaty. One ground for refusal of extradition is if the charges being pressed have not been ""made in good faith, in the interest of justice,"" according to the BSS report.","Bangladesh's foreign affairs advisor, Touhid Hossain, said India will be obligated to comply with a request for Sheikh Hasina's extradition. He said that if such a request is made, it could create an uncomfortable situation for the Indian government.
