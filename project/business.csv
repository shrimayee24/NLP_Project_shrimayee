IndiGo scrapped 25% of over 17k domestic flights from Dec 1-9

NEW DELHI: In a first-of-its-kind move, DGCA on Wednesday set up an eight-member ""oversight team"" of senior flight operations inspectors to oversee IndiGo's operational aspects, including monitoring flights, crew availability and pilot shortage situation on a daily basis.Two officials (not pilots) will oversee the cancellation and refund status; payment of compensation to passengers for deficiency in services as per norms and status of baggage return. Two senior FOIs (who are pilots) will remain at the airline's Gurgaon office on a daily basis to keep a close vigil. Both teams will submit a daily report to DGCA. The order came as it emerged IndiGo had cancelled a fourth of 17,404 domestic flights it was to operate from Dec 1-9 (both days included), as per govt data released Wednesday.IndiGo had cancelled a fourth of 17,404 domestic flights between Dec 1 and 9, which explains the unprecedented chaos witnessed at Indian airports. On the other hand, just a shade over 2% of the 2,702 international flights it was to operate in the same time were cancelled.The scale of disruption has seen multiple steps taken by DGCA and govt with the airline's CEO Pieter Elbers and his team again summoned to the regulator's office at 3 pm on Thursday to submit ""comprehensive"" data and also state the steps being taken to steady the ship through steps like hiring of pilots to meet crew shortage.SpiceJet and Air India could operate additional 160-170 daily flights.DGCA officials will be carrying out inspections at 11 airports, including Nagpur, Jaipur, Bhopal, Vijaywada, Cochin, Lucknow, Amritsar and Dehradun to assess the operational preparedness of IndiGo at these places and also see the airline's ""responsiveness during the disruption"".Despite inducting a plane every week and increasing its flights, IndiGo has gone slow on pilot hiring leading to the current mismatch between the requirement and availability of crew members. Now the airline has to submit its entire operational details to govt and then its schedule will accordingly be approved to avoid a rerun of the disruption being seen this month.Elbers and his team on Thursday will have to tell the regulator on Thursday the status of flight restoration, how affected passengers are being accommodated and the monitoring mechanism to ensure timely completion of restoration. They will be asked about the status of refunds, baggage return, how is its improving timely communication about delays and cancellations and the policy on re-routing passengers on alternate flights.","IndiGo had cancelled a fourth of 17,404 domestic flights between Dec 1 and 9.

'Detect, Delete, Deport': Amit Shah Blasts Rahul Gandhi Over Infiltrators, Oppn Stages Walkout

CIC has been without a chief since September 13

The three-member selection committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that met on Wednesday to appoint the new Chief Information Commissioner (CIC), eight information commissioners (ICs) and a vigilance commissioner is learnt to have finalised the names. However, Leader of Opposition (LoP) in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have registered his strong dissent to the choices and submitted the same in writing, sources said.Gandhi is said to have strongly objected to the absence of names from Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and OBC communities. The issue raised by the Congress neta is likely to be a key talking point in the upcoming mega rally against ""vote chori"" being organised by Congress on Dec 14.The details of the appointments were not known till late in the evening.The meeting that lasted for nearly one and a half hours was held at the Prime Minister's Office. It was also attended by home minister Amit Shah. Sources said the LoP sought more details of the appointees and also questioned the criteria adopted for the selection of CIC and ICs.According to sources, Gandhi was of the view that the govt's proposal on the names was completely ""biased"".He apparently said that the absence of weaker communities from constitutional positions was unacceptable, given the need to strengthen their participation across the board, including higher positions. The LoP is learnt to have forcefully put forth his differences on the govt proposal.There were three parts to the meeting: One on appointment of CIC, another on choice of eight ICs & third on vigilance commissioner.While Gandhi registered his ""dissent"" in writing separately on the govt's proposal for CIC and vigilance commissioner, he gave his ""observations"" on the eight names for the post of ICs, sources said. The Central Information Commission has been without a chief since incumbent Heeralal Samariya demitted office on Sept 13 on attaining the age of 65 years.Besides the chief, the commission can have up to 10 commissioners. Currently, it is making do with just two - Anandi Ramalingam and Vinod Tiwari. According to commission's website, the pending caseload stands at over 30,800.The eight posts of information commissioners have been vacant since Nov 2023. With Samariya demitting office, the chief's post fell vacant for the seventh time since 2014.There was a total of 53 names in the panels prepared by the govt and presented before the collegium for the 10 positions. On the objection raised, the govt is said to have agreed to include a few from the marginalised communities in the panels. But there was still no clarity about their inclusion in the appointments.Under Section 12 (3) of the RTI Act, the prime minister is the chairperson of the search committee, which also comprises the LoP and a Union minister nominated by the PM.According to the procedure for the appointment of CIC, the particulars of interested candidates are invited through advertisements in newspapers and through the DoPT website.","The Central Information Commission has been without a chief since September 13.

NEW DELHI: Taking strong exception to Haryana govt cutting 40 fully grown trees in a green belt to build a road to make the office of BJP in Karnal accessible, Supreme Court on Wednesday directed it to restore the green belt within three months after the govt and Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) failed to convince it of the legality of the action.A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and K V Viswanathan noted in its order that the explanation given by the state and HSVP was merely an ""eyewash to mislead the court"".The state authority claimed that the trees were felled to widen the road. Additional solicitor general Vikramjit Banerjee, appearing for HSVP, told the bench that Resident Welfare Association of Section 9 was also consulted and its consent taken prior to the felling of trees. He further pointed out that compulsory plantation had been done by the authority.But the bench was not convinced and asked how the green belt could be damaged for widening roads. Though the petitioner had also challenged the allotment of land to BJP to build an office there, the bench said it cannot examine the allotment which was done way back in 2018.The court, however, directed the authority to restore the green belt and made clear that the widening of road to BJP office had to be undone.It granted the authority three months to do the needful and file a report with photographs of the site.The court passed the order on a petition filed by a 1971-War veteran, challenging the dismissal of his plea by the high court on May 3 against the allotment of a plot in a residential area of Karnal to BJP and the subsequent construction of an access road for its office by uprooting 40 fully grown trees situated in a green area.Rajput (79) said he was wounded in the war and a decorated soldier, having been awarded the Vir Chakra for gallantry.

As IndiGo Spirals Into Crisis, PM Modi Stresses Rules Must Ease Citizens’ Lives, Not Burden Them

NEW DELHI: The ministry of civil aviation has constituted an oversight team to monitor IndiGo’s operations amid large-scale disruptions reported across multiple airports.In an order dated December 10, 2025, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) announced that the move aims to address passenger inconvenience caused by flight delays and cancellations.The team comprises senior officials, including deputy and senior flight operations inspectors.Two members from the group will be stationed at IndiGo’s corporate office in Emaar Capital Tower 2, Gurgaon, on a daily basis.They will review key parameters such as total fleet, network details, number of pilots, crew availability, standby crew strength, split duties, training status, and all unplanned leave taken by crew. The officials will also monitor total daily flights, available crew and sectors affected due to manpower shortage.In addition to the oversight team, the DGCA has deployed Aishveer Singh, Deputy Director (AED), and Mani Bhushan, Senior Statistical Officer, to the same office. Their mandate includes tracking domestic and international cancellation status, refund progress through airlines and online travel agents, on-time performance, compensation provided to passengers under Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR), and baggage return timelines.Both teams are required to submit a daily report by 6 pm to the Joint Director General.The instructions have been issued with the approval of the Director General (Civil Aviation), the order stated.The flyers faced severe inconvenience on December 2 when IndiGo cancelled thousands of flights nationwide after failing to adjust operations to tighter safety regulations.The fallout has caused major bottlenecks at airports, sent airfares soaring on other carriers and triggered widespread complaints over poor communication, long queues and baggage chaos.The DGCA has already issued show-cause notices to Elbers and Chief Operating Officer Isidro Proqueras, who is also the airline’s Accountable Manager, while the Civil Aviation Ministry has capped fares and ordered flight curtailment to “stabilise the airline’s operations”.","The team comprises senior officials, including deputy and senior flight operations inspectors.

IndiGo’s 5% Flight Cut Explained: Causes, Impact on Routes, and the Ripple Effects on Passengers

NEW DELHI: Under govt scrutiny for unprecedented flight disruptions, IndiGo chairman Vikram Singh Mehta on Wednesday denied the same were deliberate. Apologising multiple times in his about 8-minute video message, he said “external technical experts (will) work with the management; help determine the root causes, and ensure corrective action so that this level of disruption never occurs again. ”The DGCA is probing IndiGo’s fiasco that unfolded this month. It is examining whether the airline caused the same to avoid abiding by the new pilot rest rules. Mehta denied the same.“Over the past week there has been a ot of criticism. Some fair. Some not. The fair criticism is that the airline let down you down. We owe answers to customers, govt, shareholders, employees. We will examine every aspect of what went wrong. We will learn from it,” he said.“However, there are some allegations that are untrue. That IndiGo engineered the crisis. That we tried to influence govt rules. That we compromised safety. That the board was not involved. These claims are incorrect. IndiGo has followed the pilot fatigue rules as they came into effect. We operated under the new rules throughout, both in July and in Nov. We did not attempt to bypass them.Nor did we anything that impacted our unblemished track record of safety. The disruptions of last week did not happen because of any deliberate actions,” said the former chairman of Shell Group of companies in India.“On Dec 3, an unexpected chain of events led to large scale flight cancellations. This continued into Dec 4 & 5. Thousands of our passengers were left stranded. We did not meet your expectations during those days. This happened because of a combination of of internal and external events including minor technical glitches; schedule changes linked to start of winter; adverse weather conditions; increased congestion in the aviation system and implementation of and operation under the updated crew rostering rules. This is not an excuse, this is simply the truth. This combination of events pushed our systems beyond their limits,” Mehta said.He said the board was constantly involved in tackling the issue and that things are back on track much before expected. The airline operated 1,900 flights to 138 destinations with normal punctuality, he said.Although he admitted: “Last week’s events are a blemish on this company’s pristine record. Our compay has erred. It has to win back your trust. It will not be easy. It will depend on actions and not words.

No adjudication on rights or entitlements can proceed unless this threshold is addressed,"" the statement said.It said the ongoing campaign ""conveniently omits"" the CJI Kant-led bench's categorical affirmation that no person on Indian soil - citizen or foreigner - can be subjected to torture, disappearance or inhuman treatment.""To suppress this, and then accuse the court of 'dehumanisation' is a serious distortion of what was actually said,"" it said.The signatories highlighted Rohingyas have not been admitted to India under any statutory refugee-protection framework, and that India is neither a party to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention nor its 1967 Protocol. The statement said concerns over the illegal procurement of Aadhaar, ration cards and other documents by foreign nationals merit urgent scrutiny.It said an SC-monitored SIT may be necessary to inquire into how illegally entered migrants obtained these documents, and to identify networks facilitating such activities. The complex citizenship status of the Rohingyas in Myanmar further stressed the need for Indian courts ""to proceed on clear legal categories, not slogans or political labels"", the statement said.It said that ""against this backdrop, the judiciary's intervention has been firmly within constitutional bounds"". The CJI Kant-led bench's observations struck a balance between safeguarding national security and upholding human dignity, the statement said.""To convert such a constitutionally compliant approach into a charge of inhumanity is unfair to the CJI and damaging to the institution,"" the former judges cautioned, adding that judicial independence would be at risk if every judicial question on nationality, migration, documentation or border security was met with accusations of hate or prejudice.","Forty-four former judges, including those who were in the Supreme Court and high courts, have issued a joint statement strongly condemning ""a motivated campaign"" against CJI Surya Kant.

Why did you not ensure flight duty norms are implemented in time?

Non-usage of helmets and seatbelts also contributed significantly to fatalities. Despite some dips, these dangerous behaviors continue to pose a major challenge to road safety across the nation.

NEW DELHI: Speed kills - and it claimed nearly 1.2 lakh lives in 2024, around 70% of all road deaths (1.8 lakh). Non-wearing of helmets and seatbelts caused 69,088 deaths (39%), showing how road users' behaviour remains the biggest challenge to making roads safer.Crash and fatality details of past five years, submitted by road transport minister Nitin Gadkari in Rajya Sabha Wednesday, show speeding continues to dominate as the main cause of fatal accidents. Its share in deaths rose from 65% in 2020 to 69% in 2021 and a little over 71% in 2022. It dipped to 68% in 2023 but increased again last year.Tamil Nadu reported the highest number of speed-related fatalities - 12,010 out of 24,118 road deaths. Karnataka saw nearly 92% of its 11,360 fatalities caused by speeding, while Madhya Pradesh recorded nearly 81% (11,970).Globally too, speeding is a key factor. According to WHO, even a small rise in average speed sharply increases crash risk and severity. ""Every 1% increase in mean speed produces a 4% increase in the fatal crash risk and a 3% increase in the serious crash risk. The risk of death for pedestrians hit by car fronts rises rapidly (4.5 times from 50 kmph to 65 kmph).In car-to-car side impacts, the fatality risk for occupants is 85% at 65 kmph,"" WHO states.Govt data showed a slight dip in deaths due to non-wearing of helmets and seatbelts - 69,088 in 2024 compared with 70,518 in 2023.Tamil Nadu again topped in helmet-related deaths with 7,744 fatalities, followed by MP (6,541) and Maharashtra (5,946). Such deaths have declined in UP and Tamil Nadu but increased in Maharashtra, MP and Chhattisgarh.For seatbelt-related deaths, UP recorded the highest number (2,816), followed by MP (1,929) and Maharashtra (1,427). These fatalities have fallen in UP, MP and Rajasthan but risen in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Telangana.WHO notes that wearing a seatbelt can reduce the risk of occupants death by up to 50%.","Tamil Nadu reported the highest number of speed-related fatalities - 12,010 out of 24,118 road deaths.

Tribunals reel under 5L case pendency

Tribunals are meant to deliver faster justice. However, a recent law ministry assessment reveals that these specialised quasi-judicial bodies are reeling with a huge pendency of over 5.24 lakh cases, largely attributed to huge vacancies for members.The Debt Recovery Tribunal and its appellate body together have the highest pendency of 2.5 lakh cases, followed by Customs & Excise Appellate Tribunal with 72,000 pending cases. Others with high pendency include I-T Appellate Tribunal (43,000 cases); Central Administrative Tribunal (69,000 cases), State Administrative Tribunals (28,940 cases); Armed Forces Tribunal (6,900 cases); & NGT (5,301 cases).Tribunals were constituted to address backlogs and deliver faster justice.

NEW DELHI: In a boost to Indo-US space cooperation, Isro will launch its heaviest American commercial communication low-earth orbit satellite, the 6.5-tonne BlueBird-6, from the Sriharikota spaceport on Dec 15. Isro’s ‘Bahubali’ rocket LVM3 will put the US satellite into orbit.AST SpaceMobile, a Texas-based company that has built the space-based cellular broadband network, said, “BlueBird-6, a US licensed satellite, is scheduled to launch on Dec 15. It is the first of AST SpaceMobile’s next-generation satellites. When launched, it will feature the largest commercial phased array in low earth orbit at nearly 2,400 sqft. This represents 3.5 times increase in size over BlueBirds 1-5 and supports ten times the data capacity. ”BlueBird-6 is a “Block-2” satellite and part of a larger plan by AST SpaceMobile to deploy a series of satellites to achieve non-continuous service, with further launches scheduled through 2026. Its aim is to bridge the “digital divide” by offering fast, unhindered direct-to-device mobile broadband service in areas with poor or non-existent terrestrial network coverage.The BlueBird satellites are designed to deliver a high amount of bandwidth, with each unit capable of up to 10,000 MHz. They operate by partnering with existing mobile network carriers to enhance their networks using licensed spectrum.The BlueBird-6 satellite arrived in India from the US on Oct 19. It was later transported by road to Sriharikota for integration with launcher LVM3, fuelling and final checks ahead of its launch.The liftoff is being handled by New Space India Limited (NSIL), Isro’s commercial wing. LVM-3 had recently put India’s heaviest CMS-3 satellite, weighing 4.4 tonnes, into its orbit on Nov 2. A three-stage launch vehicle, LVM3 rocket can carry payloads weighing up to 8,000 kg to low-Earth orbit (LEO) and 4,000 kg to geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). The human-rated version of this vehicle will fly three Indian astronauts to space, as part of the Gaganyaan mission, which is planned for 2027.","Isro will launch its heaviest American commercial communication low-earth orbit satellite, the 6.5-tonne BlueBird-6, from the Sriharikota spaceport on Dec 15.

Sovereign control a valid concern: Satya Nadella,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sovereign-control-a-valid-concern-satya-nadella/articleshow/125897551.cms,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced a significant $17.5 billion investment in India over four years, focusing on AI and cloud.

NEW DELHI; As Microsoft invests $17.5 billion in India over the next four years into AI and cloud, the tech giant's CEO Satya Nadella Wednesday said it was a ""legitimate concern"" of countries like India to talk about sovereign control and local resilience.Asked whether AI and tech prowess were increasingly being used as diplomacy tools and nations needed to build resilience and sovereign stack, Nadella said, ""... it's absolutely a very legitimate question and concern... and I would say a requirement. Which is for a country like India to say that ultimately things that are being deployed here, used here, at scale are effectively resilient and sovereign. In other words, you want to control your own destiny. ""Reaffirming the tech giant's commitment to India's AI ambitions, the India-born CEO - delivering his keynote at the Microsoft Leadership Connection event - praised what he called a ""virtuous cycle"" created by the country's tech policies, digital public infrastructure, and vast domestic market. ""One thing India has done very uniquely is bring together a virtuous cycle from the policies, the programmes, the technology stack, and the market,"" he said.""It's tremendous to see the private sector fully participate, whether in payments, healthcare, or insurance.

Power of contempt is not a sword to silence critics: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/power-of-contempt-is-not-a-sword-to-silence-critics-supreme-court/articleshow/125897526.cms,"The Supreme Court has overturned a Bombay High Court order sentencing a woman to jail for contempt. Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta emphasized that mercy and forgiveness are crucial judicial principles. They stated that sincere remorse and an apology, even if qualified, should be accepted, particularly when a contemnor acknowledges their mistake and seeks atonement.

NEW DELHI: Holding that mercy must remain an integral part of judicial conscience and courts should take a liberal approach when a contemnor accepts a mistake and apologises, Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed a Bombay HC order sentencing a woman to one week's imprisonment for a contemptuous statement on the judiciary pertaining to stray dogs.Quashing the jail term awarded to a former director of a residential complex in Navi Mumbai Seawoods Estates Ltd, a bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta said the HC should have accepted her apology. It said the statutory scheme recognises that once a contemnor expresses sincere remorse, even if the apology is not unqualified in form, the court is competent to accept it and, where necessary, discharge the contemnor or remit the sentence imposed.""The power to punish necessarily carries within it the concomitant power to forgive, where the individual before the court demonstrates genuine remorse and repentance for the act that has brought him to this position. Therefore, in exercise of contempt jurisdiction, courts must remain conscious that this power is not a personal armour for judges, nor a sword to silence criticism. After all, it requires fortitude to acknowledge contrition for one's lapse, and an even greater virtue to extend forgiveness to the erring.Mercy, therefore, must remain an integral part of the judicial conscience, to be extended where the contemnor sincerely acknowledges his lapse and seeks to atone for it,"" SC said.Though the apex court ca-me to the conclusion that the circular issued by her was contemptuous, it let her off after noting that she promptly filed her reply in HC in which she explained the circumstances, expressed unconditional remorse for her conduct and tendered an unqualified apology at the earliest opportunity.""The Explanation to Section 12 (of Contempt Act) further provides that an apology shall not be rejected merely because it is qualified or conditional, if offered bona fide. The scheme of Section 12(1) thus reflects a balance, ie while the majesty of law must be preserved against attempts to malign the institution and those discharging judicial functions, the provision also recognises human fallibility. It is for this reason that the proviso empowers the court, upon being satisfied of genuine remorse, to accept the apology and discharge the contemnor or remit the punishment awarded,"" the bench said.The HC had taken suo motu cognizance after the circular was brought to its notice and proceedings were initiated after the residential society told the court it was not responsible for it. The woman had told HC that she had made a grave error in issuing the circular, which was done upon mental pressure exerted by residents. She further stated that she had also resigned from the board of directors of Seawoods.""Therefore, in our considered view, HC failed to exercise its contempt jurisdiction with due circumspection. Once the contemnor had, from the very first day of her appearance in the suo motu proceedings, expressed remorse and tendered an unconditional apology, HC was required to examine whether such apology satisfied the statutory parameters under Section 12 of the Contempt Act. Thus, in our opinion, in the absence of any material suggesting that the apology was lacking in bona fides, HC ought to have considered remitting the sentence in accordance with law,"" it said.","Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta emphasized that mercy and forgiveness are crucial judicial principles. They stated that sincere remorse and an apology, even if qualified, should be accepted, particularly when a contemnor acknowledges their mistake and seeks atonement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125897526,imgsize-858123,width-400,resizemode-4/125897526.jpg"

Anoushka Shankar Slams Air India After Her Sitar Gets Damaged In Flight!

This week, Anoushka Shankar did what she’s done for most of her life, reached for her sitar to tune it before a performance after flying London to Delhi. What she didn’t expect was to sound out of tune. “I picked it up to play and that’s when I realised (there was a crack)… this was my first time flying Air India in a long time. The country this music belongs to, and this is the first time anything like this has happened to my instrument in 15 or 17 years. How have you done this? I have special cases, you guys charge a handling fee and yet you’ve done this?”Her post ricocheted across timelines. Air India apologised, offered to compensate for repairs and promised a policy review. Shankar shared a video of her sitar undergoing delicate repair by Ajay Rikhiram. “Hopefully they will follow through… it’s not enough if it’s just me who gets the support.”For most musicians — a touring indie artist or a classical stalwart — none of this feels new. India, home to some of the most intricate handmade instruments, still struggles to get them safely from one airport to another.In Kochi last month, Parvinder Singh watched his handpan case thud down the luggage belt.“They had promised it would come by hand,” he says. He had begged IndiGo not to take it at the gate and even paid Rs 1,000 for ‘out of cargo’ handling — meant for delicate items carried by hand. “I always take my handpans in the cabin. This time I trusted them when they said I’d get it back safely.” He didn’t. Each handpan is handmade, tuned to scale, and takes months to build. Only after his social media posts went viral did IndiGo offer Rs 50,000 but he wanted a written assurance. “I lost shows in peak season. Can’t risk this again.”Sarod player Arnab Bhattacharya has learned the same lesson. In June, travelling Kolkata to Tel Aviv on Akasa Air, he picked up his hard-fibre case — plastered with ‘fragile’ stickers — and instantly knew something was wrong. “The case was damaged and the sarod had a clear crack,” he says. At Abu Dhabi, staff insisted there was “no damage” and pointed to the LTA — the Limited Release tag passengers sign — which absolves airlines of responsibility. “I didn’t know it means the airline won’t take responsibility even if they break your instrument.” Only after a TOI report did the airline call back, offering compensation if he deleted his post. “I denied but they eventually compensated.”Sometimes the negotiation borders on the surreal. “Indigo once offered me a Shoppers Stop voucher for a broken instrument,” he says. Even new rules haven’t helped. In November, Air India Express charged him Rs 1,500 as “musical instrument fee”. “If they say they’ll carry it by hand, then carry it by hand,” he says, pointing to another violation musicians rarely discuss: “Instrument boxes opened without permission. ”On paper, airlines list clear rules. In practice, what counts as ‘small’, ‘bulky’ or ‘oversized’ changes from airline to airline.In 2019 sitarist Shubhendra Rao watched a carefully packed sitar emerge damaged from an Air India flight. “It wasn’t broken when I checked in but Air India’s stance was if the case was intact, the damage could not have happened.”His petition drew over 85,000 signatures from Vishwa Mohan Bhatt and Shujaat Husain Khan to Anoushka Shankar. He met the secretary of Civil Aviation in February 2020, but months later the ministry wrote back saying they had found “no evidence”.Airlines still make him sign LTA forms when he travels and they lean on the Montreal/Warsaw Convention, which caps baggage liability at around Rs 1.2 lakh, which he says is “meaningless for instruments worth several lakhs.”Airline officials say the real trouble begins at the check-in counter where enforcement varies. “If a musical instrument generally qualifies as cabin baggage but suddenly one staffer insists it has to be checked in, there’s very little a passenger can do to guarantee its safety,” says one official.Booking an extra seat — “cabin-seat baggage” — isn’t permitted in India for bulky instruments. Even when allowed, it must be strapped in, pre-booked, prepaid, weigh under 75 kg, block no signage or aisle, and comply with seat-safety rules.A cargo-handling official says the usual culprits are belt impacts, unloading shocks, pressure changes and rough transfers. Better packing — rigid cases, loosened strings, padded interiors, detachable parts wrapped separately — helps, but it’s still a gamble. And standard insurance excludes instruments entirely.Handling may be better than the ’90s, Rao says, but one question hangs in the air. “If something still goes wrong despite all the forms and fees, who answers for it?”His appeal to regulators is basic. “If a suitcase breaks, they replace it. Why is an instrument different?...an instrument isn’t just our bread and butter. It’s an artiste’s lifeline.”","Anoushka Shankar's sitar was cracked on a flight from London to Delhi.

Interpol Blue Notice Explained: How CBI Tracks Absconding Luthra Brothers In Goa Nightclub Fire Case

PANAJI: Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, owners of Birch by Romeo Lane at Arpora where 25 people died in a fire on Saturday, filed for transit anticipatory bail before the district and sessions court, Rohini, New Delhi, for four weeks in the event of arrest. The court didn’t grant interim relief to the Luthras, and the matter has been fixed for hearing on Thursday. Goa police strongly objected to the granting of transit anticipatory bail application.The Luthras also sought directions to Goa police to suspend a lookout circular issued against them, and that no coercive action be taken against them. The Luthras claimed that they are in Thailand on “official work”. “On Dec 6, 2025, the applicants travelled to Thailand for a business meeting in connection with their professional engagements and potential restaurant sites,” states the bail applications. Goa police, however, said that investigations have revealed that the Luthras booked tickets to Thailand on an online platform at 1.17am on Dec 7, while Goa police and the directorate of fire services were still battling the blaze and rescuing those trapped.Two applications, filed by family members of Saurabh and Gaurav, state that the brothers are ready and willing to join the investigation.“The present case falls within the category of rare and exceptional cases to grant transit anticipatory bail.The applicant deserves protection to ensure that pre-trial arrest and loss of liberty do not result in a miscarriage of justice,” stated the application.The Luthras also stated that no useful purpose would be served by arresting them upon their return to India, and it is not a case where custodial interrogation is required for the purposes of investigation.Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, senior advocate Tanvir Mir, and advocate Shiv Chopra appeared for Saurabh and Gaurav.“The applicants are permanent residents of Delhi and apprehend arrest in Delhi/upon reaching Delhi airport and hence filing this petition,” states the application. “There is no specific role attributable to them. The incident was purely an accident, and there is no criminal intent.”The Luthras also stated that an offence under Section 105 BNS has not been made out at all, as there was never any intention to commit culpable homicide not amounting to murder. They also stated that Sections 125 and 287 are also not made out against the applicant as they were not in control of operations at the restaurant.The Luthras stated that they have clean antecedents and have never been involved in any other criminal case. The case at Anjuna police station is the first they have ever been involved in, the applications state.“The property already had the requisite fire safety equipment installed in all places, and as a matter of fact, the operational managers had, for further safety on July 4, 2025, Being GS Hospitality Goa Arpora (LLP) purchased a fresh batch of fire safety equipment from a registered vendor in Goa,” said the Luthras.On Tuesday, Interpol issued a blue corner notice against Saurabh and Gaurav, who fled from New Delhi to Thailand early on Sunday morning, hours after a fire at their nightclub.The regional passport office, New Delhi, also issued a notice to the brothers seeking an explanation from both as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days.The Luthras fled to Phuket, Thailand, via IndiGo flight 6E1073, which left India at 5:30 am.The Supreme Court has said that a transit anticipatory bail application can be considered by a sessions court which does not have jurisdiction over the case for granting interim protection of limited duration till such accused approaches the competent sessions court or the high court seeking full-fledged anticipatory bail.","Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, owners of Birch by Romeo Lane at Arpora where 25 people died in a fire on Saturday, filed for transit anticipatory bail before the district and sessions court, Rohini, New Delhi.

Pure mulberry silk, 20/22 denier yarn

Minimum resultant count: 31.5 denier

'Om Namo Venkatesaya’ printed in Sanskrit and Telugu

Sanku, Chakra and Namam symbols

Defined size, weight and border design

Mandatory silk hologram

How the scam came to light

Fresh stocks at a Tirupati warehouse

Approved stocks at Vaibhavotsava Mandapam, Tirumala

What the tests found

Both CSB labs returned the same verdict: The dupattas were polyester, not silk.

Vigilance officers also found no silk hologram on any of the samples.

Scale of the alleged fraud

The same firm had also won a contract for 15,000 more dupattas at Rs 1,389 per piece.

VRS Export and its sister companies supplied fabric worth Rs 54.95 crore to TTD from 2015–2025.

The board has asked the state Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to probe the alleged fraud and fix responsibility.

Why this hits devotees hard

TIRUPATI: A fresh controversy has hit the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), the body managing the Tirumala shrine, barely a year after the laddu-ghee adulteration row rocked the hill shrine.Instead of pure mulberry silk, VRS Export of Andhra Pradesh’s Nagari allegedly sold 100% polyester dupattas to Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) from 2015 to 2025 — and allegedly pocketed crores.The board has referred the “dupatta scam” to the state anti-corruption bureau, asking it to identify those behind the alleged fraud. A copy of the TTD board resolution is with TOI.TTD presents silk dupattas to donors and VIP-break-darshan visitors during Vedasirvachanam in the Ranganayakula Mandapam. Since thousands of devotees pass through the slot, the trust purchases dupattas in very large quantities, spending several crores every year.The specifications are rigid:TTD chairman BR Naidu ordered the vigilance and security wing to verify whether the supplied dupattas met tender norms. Samples were drawn from:These samples — all supplied by VRS Export of Nagari, a long-time TTD vendor — were sent to the Central Silk Board labs in Bengaluru and Dharmavaram.Silk dupattas presented at the shrine carry spiritual and symbolic value, much like the temple’s laddus. Polyester masquerading as silk is seen as both financial fraud and a breach of devotional sentiment — especially after last year’s laddu-ghee adulteration revelations involving animal fats.","Silk dupattas presented at the shrine carry spiritual and symbolic value, much like the temple’s laddus.

Pune land deal: Is police protecting dy CM’s son? asks Bombay HC; Sheetal Tejwani withdraws pre-arrest bail plea,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/pune-land-deal-is-police-protecting-deputy-cms-son-parth-pawar-asks-bombay-hc-sheetal-tejwani-withdraws-pre-arrest-bail-plea/articleshow/125900478.cms,"Ajit Pawar’s son Parth Pawar

Inputs from PTI

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday, while hearing Pune-based real estate businesswoman Sheetal Tejwani’s pre-arrest bail plea in a second FIR against her in the controversial Pune land deal case, orally remarked that the Maharashtra deputy chief minister’s son is not named and asked if he was being protected while police were investigating others.The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Pune city police, which is investigating alleged irregularities involving two separate land parcels in Bopodi and Mundhwa, on Dec 3 arrested Tejwani, who held the power of attorney for the Mundhwa land. The land was sold to Amadea Enterprises in which Parth Pawar , son of Dy CM Ajit Pawar , is a majority partner. Tejwani is in police custody till Dec 11 (Thursday). The land deal was registered in May this year.Justice Madhav Jamdar orally observed during the hearing, “Deputy chief minister’s son is not named in FIR. Is the police protecting the son of the deputy CM and only investigating others?” An official stated that Parth Pawar was not named since his name doesn’t appear on documents. The land parcel in Mundhwa, earlier a hereditary land grant, was in possession of the govt and had been leased to the Botanical Survey of India.The controversy was whether the sale had the necessary nod from the state.Tejwani withdrew her plea for relief, and hence the court passed no order.Tejwani, who is in police custody in an FIR dated Nov 7 registered with Khadak police station over the Rs 300 crore sale of the 40-acre upscale Mundhwa plot, approached HC for pre-arrest bail in a separate FIR registered with Bavdhan police on Nov 6.The FIR discloses no crime, and she “acted only as a duly constituted power of attorney holder of the lawful owners,” said her plea, argued by senior counsel Rajiv Chavan. It added that since “the same transaction and documents are already under investigation by the Economic Offences Wing” in one FIR, the second one was rendered “duplicative and oppressive.”State acting public prosecutor M M Deshmukh sought dismissal of Tejwani’s plea as an “abuse of legal process” and pointed out that she sought similar relief in a local court in Pune on Dec 8, which posted the matter for hearing on Dec 15. Yet, without giving the court any breathing time, she rushed to the high court, he said.Justice Jamdar also then indicated that he might impose heavy costs of Rs 5 lakh on her in his order. Chavan then submitted that they would withdraw the application, which the HC permitted. The plea was thus withdrawn.Meanwhile, asked about HC’s remarks, CM Devendra Fadnavis said in Nagpur, “I have not heard what HC has said, but a proper reply will be submitted in court about what it has asked for. From the very beginning, the govt’s stand is not to protect anyone. And action will be taken against whoever is guilty.”","The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Pune city police, which is investigating alleged irregularities involving two separate land parcels in Bopodi and Mundhwa, on Dec 3 arrested Tejwani.

Rising combined wealth and how their earnings continue to expand each year

Properties, assets and lifestyle choices that continue drawing attention

The growing interest around John Cena and Shay Shariatzadeh’s financial journey has intensified in 2025 as new reports highlight their rising net worth, expanding properties, and steadily increasing earnings, creating wider curiosity about how their individual careers continue shaping their shared financial path. Together, their lifestyle reflects a balance between high earnings, stable investments, and carefully chosen luxury, allowing them to maintain comfort without relying on constant public display or extravagant change. Let’s take a look at where the power couple stands today.Fresh evaluations for 2025 suggest that John Cena holds a personal net worth close to $80 million, supported by his long wrestling career, expanding Hollywood roles and multiple commercial partnerships that continue generating consistent income for him across different categories of the entertainment industry.Shay Shariatzadeh contributes an estimated $2 million, which comes from her engineering work, strategic career moves, and selective investments that reflect a steady approach rather than a public lifestyle focused on expensive displays or high-profile spending choices.Together, their combined worth reaches nearly $82 million, showing how their financial paths complement one another through two very different professional worlds that still manage to work in harmony.Cena’s earnings remain anchored by an annual WWE salary reportedly around $8.5 million, supported by bonuses linked to special appearances and merchandise sales that continue performing strongly across global markets due to his long-standing popularity.John Cena’s well-known Florida property, purchased many years ago for roughly $525,000, has grown significantly in value and now sits near $4 million, featuring spacious interiors, multiple recreational spaces and design upgrades that reflect his preference for calm surroundings rather than extravagant display.The home includes an indoor pool, outdoor pool, cigar room, extended garage, and a guest area, allowing him a private retreat while balancing entertainment commitments and travel schedules across Hollywood and wrestling venues. Cena also owns a residence in San Diego valued within the high-end category, although he maintains a low-key approach toward detailing the property publicly, which matches the couple’s gradually shifting preference for privacy.Shay Shariatzadeh, while less public about real estate, aligns her lifestyle with practical investments and career growth, showing a contrast to Cena’s entertainment-driven earnings but still contributing meaningfully to their shared financial foundation through consistent professional progress.Also Read: John Cena to still be affiliated with WWE after retirement?

What are the disadvantages of the Trump Gold Card?



US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) launched the ""Trump Gold Card,"" offering legal status and an eventual pathway to United States citizenship for individuals and corporations willing to make large financial contributions.Announcing the rollout on Truth Social, Trump wrote, ""The United States Government’s Trump Gold Card is here today! A direct path to citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. So exciting! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!""A website accepting applications went live soon after, as Trump unveiled the program in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, joined by business leaders.Trump said the funds raised through the initiative would ""go to the US government,"" adding that the program could generate ""billions"" for the Treasury Department ""where we can do positive things for the country.""""Very excitingly for me and for the country, we've just launched the Trump Gold Card. The site goes up in about 30 minutes, and all funds go to the United States government.... It's a gift to get somebody great coming into our country, because we think there will be some tremendous people who otherwise wouldn't have been allowed to stay.They graduate from college, they have to go back to India or China or France... The companies will be very happy. The other thing is it'll take in, we think, probably billions of dollars that will go to the Treasury of the United States... Many billions of dollars, even,"" he told reporters further talking about the initiative.The Trump Gold Card is a new US visa-residency programme that costs $1 million for individual applicants. The Trump Gold Card programme effectively provides a pathway to permanent legal residency, similar to a green card but, as Trump claims, ""with big advantages.""""It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card. Companies will be able to go to any school, buy a card, and keep that person in the United States…"" Trump added.It is intended to replace the existing EB-5 investor visa programme, subject to vetting by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).The card resembles a luxury credit card, featuring a gold background along with Donald Trump’s portrait, the Statue of Liberty, and the US flag, with ""Trump Gold Card"" embossed on the left.The Trump Corporate Gold Card allows companies to sponsor one or more foreign employees. Corporations must pay a non-refundable $15,000 DHS fee per employee, and the programme requires a $2 million gift per sponsored employee after vetting is completed.Companies can apply for multiple employees simultaneously.A notable benefit of the corporate version is that companies may stop sponsoring one employee and use the same previously paid $2 million contribution to sponsor a new employee without paying another gift amount.""The Trump Corporate Gold Card is subject to a small, 1% annual maintenance fee and a 5% transfer fee, which includes the cost of a new DHS background check. Small additional fees to the US Department of State may also apply depending on each employee’s circumstances, the website noted.Individual applicants must make a one-time, non-refundable $1 million gift, whereas corporate sponsors pay $2 million per employee. Both require the same DHS processing fee of $15,000.Applicants must first pay a non-refundable $15,000 DHS processing fee. Once the vetting process is complete, the required $1 million ""gift"" from an individual (or $2 million for a corporation per applicant) serves as proof that the applicant will ""substantially benefit the United States.""Additional small fees may be charged by the US Department of State depending on individual circumstances. Once an applicant’s processing fee is received, the process for petition approval and visa adjudication will take place on an expedited basis, assuming applicants submit any additional documents or fees in a timely manner.The $15,000 processing fee can be paid by credit card or ACH (US accounts only). The $1 million or $2 million contribution must be sent via ACH debit or SWIFT wire transfer after vetting.For Visa-related fees - The applicant will receive information directly from the US Department of State on how to submit the visa application fee and payments for the required medical examination.Like other American permanent residents and citizens, Trump Gold Card holders are required to pay US taxes, including on income earned outside the United States.Applicants must be eligible for lawful permanent resident status, admissible to the United States, and have a visa available under the EB-1 or EB-2 categories.Yes. Spouses and unmarried children under 21 can be included in the initial application. Each family member must pay an additional $15,000 DHS fee and a $1 million gift, with the same expedited processing benefits.""This will ensure that these family members receive all of the privileges conferred by the Gold Card Program, including expedited processing,"" the website said.Yes. Since the Trump Gold Card functions as a visa, it can be revoked on grounds of national security concerns or significant criminal activity.Here is the simplified step-by-step process, based on the details provided on the Gold Card website:The programme promises an expedited timeline, with processing expected to take a few weeks, provided applicants respond promptly to interview requests and document submissions, the website said.The upcoming Trump Platinum Card will allow individuals to live in the US for up to 270 days a year without paying US tax on non-US income, eliminating the need for additional travel visas.It is priced at $5 million, plus the $15,000 DHS fee, and has not yet been launched. A waitlist has opened, and applicants are being encouraged to secure their place early.The design for the Trump Platinum Card has not yet been revealed, but the website encourages users to join a waitlist, with applications processed on a first-come, first-served basis.The website warns that the $5 million Platinum Card contribution ""may not remain"" at the current price, leading many to join the waitlist early.""Foreign nationals can sign up now and secure their places on the waiting list for the Trump Platinum Card. When launched, and upon receipt of a $15,000 DHS processing fee and $5 million contribution, they will have the ability to spend up to 270 days in the United States without being subject to US taxes on non-US income,"" the website added.The Platinum Card cannot be obtained by anyone who has previously been subject to US tax on foreign income, such as ""US citizens or resident aliens,"" they said.The Trump Gold Card comes with several limitations that raise questions about its accessibility and long-term impact. Unlike the EB-5 system it replaces, the new programme has no job-creation requirement for investors or employers.Trump’s announcement also made no mention of annual caps, leaving uncertainty around oversight, scalability and how the scheme fits into broader US immigration policy.For businesses, the card does not guarantee lower costs. Each corporate card applies to only one employee, meaning expenses rise with every additional hire. Companies needing to retain multiple foreign-born graduates may end up paying millions.This makes the programme more suitable for wealthy individuals or well-funded corporations, offering little relief to smaller firms facing talent shortages.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) launched the ""Trump Gold Card,"" offering legal status and an eventual pathway to United States citizenship.

Starlink’s India Launch Plans

Starlink's India entry

Elon Musk-led Starlink plans to soon introduce its satellite communication services in India with pricing between Rs 2,500-3,500 for retail customers. The company aims to provide services across multiple sectors including maritime, aviation, retail, and enterprise segments. Earlier, Starlink had briefly displayed pricing of Rs 8,600 monthly on its website, which was subsequently removed. The company later clarified this was due to a technical error.Industry experts considered the initially displayed price point high, suggesting it would have hindered Starlink's competitiveness in India's price-conscious market. Sources told ET that Starlink will announce official pricing after receiving complete regulatory clearances and spectrum allocation from the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).The company has already secured the required Global Mobile Personal Communication by Satellite (GMPCS) licence for retail satellite services. Additionally, it has obtained VSAT licence and permissions for flight and maritime connectivity. These authorisations enable Starlink to deliver satellite-based services across various sectors.Industry experts believe satellite communication will serve as a supplementary service rather than a disruptive force to traditional telecommunications, primarily due to substantial price differences in broadband services.As noted by JM Financial, whilst Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel offer basic fiber and fixed wireless services at Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 monthly (approximately $6 to $12), Starlink's services are expected to cost three to five times more than these conventional providers.The Indian government has not yet assigned spectrum to Starlink for commercial service deployment, and security clearances remain pending.The firm has recruited leadership personnel for its India operations, including a head executive and financial staff. The India operations and governmental relationships at both national and state levels will remain under the supervision of Lauren Dreyer, who serves as Starlink's vice president, according to informed sources.An industry expert suggests that Starlink's initial strategy for India focuses on establishing a presence rather than immediate profitability. ""When the constellation is densified in the coming time, their unit costs will be better. They are coming to India with a long term plan,"" the expert told ET.He emphasised that Starlink's satellite communication services would not directly rival telecommunications companies due to significant differences in service costs.","Elon Musk-led Starlink plans to soon introduce its satellite communication services in India with pricing between Rs 2,500-3,500 for retail customers.

'Best Offers Ever': US Official Reveals India Trade Talks Details, Says It Marks Unusual Opening

India ‘difficult nut to crack’ for US?

India-US trade deal: Calling India a ‘tough nut’ to crack, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Tuesday also said that India gives some of the ‘best offers’. Greer’s comments assume significance at a time when a US delegation is in India for another round of talks for a bilateral trade agreement between the two countries.The Donald Trump administration has imposed a 50% tariff rate on Indian exports to the US. 25% of this tariff is for India’s crude oil imports from Russia, which the US wants brought to a complete halt. Trade deal talks between the two countries have continued, and both sides are looking to seal the first tranche this year.The USTR Jamieson Greer has indicated that India's proposals for the planned trade agreement are the ""best"" they have received, as discussions between both nations commence for a two-day period in India.During a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee session in Washington on Tuesday, Greer noted India's reluctance to open the market for specific row crops, meat and other agricultural products. The US row crops comprise corn, soybeans, wheat and cotton.""They have been very difficult nut to crack...but they have been quite forward leaning....the type of offers that they have been talking to us about ...have been the best we have ever received as a country, so I think that is a viable alternative market,"" he said according to a PTI report.The American team, led by US Deputy Trade Representative Rick Switzer, started discussions with Commerce Secretary Rajesh Agrawal on Wednesday. They assessed the ongoing agreement negotiations, aiming to establish a mutually advantageous trade arrangement.The commerce department said via social media: ""The two sides exchanged views on matters related to India-US trade and economic ties, including on the ongoing negotiations for a mutually beneficial Bilateral Trade Agreement.""Indian manufacturers and exporters anticipate the swift completion of negotiations and subsequent deal announcement, as elevated import duties negatively impact their US-bound shipments.Despite diversifying into alternative markets to sustain export earnings, the United States remains crucial for Indian trade, representing approximately 18 per cent of the nation's total exports.Initially, the US levied a 25 per cent duty on Indian products, citing trade deficit concerns amounting to $46 billion in 2024-25. Subsequently, an additional 25 per cent penalty was applied on India for its Russian oil purchases. India maintains that addressing these tariff issues is essential for finalising the initial phase of the trade agreement.The US seeks reduced duties on agricultural items including almonds, corn and apples, alongside industrial products. India remains firm in its opposition to concessions in agriculture and dairy sectors, asserting its commitment to protect farmers and MSMEs interests.During the Pravasi Rajasthani Divas in Jaipur, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal indicated that discussions with the US regarding the proposed bilateral trade agreement are advancing.""Talks are continuously progressing with them. We are moving forward towards a bilateral trade agreement,"" Goyal informed reporters.Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia Brendan Lynch, the US' chief negotiator, is participating in the US delegation. The Indian side is represented by Joint Secretary Darpan Jain from the Department of Commerce. This marks the US officials' second visit following the implementation of increased tariffs, with their previous visit occurring on September 16.Agrawal previously indicated that whilst the Bilateral Trade Agreement requires time, India continues extensive negotiations with the US regarding a framework trade deal to resolve reciprocal tariff issues affecting Indian exporters.Currently, India and the US are conducting parallel negotiations on two fronts: a framework trade deal focusing on tariffs and a comprehensive trade agreement. Officials were instructed to negotiate an agreement following directions from both nations' leaders in February.The initial phase of the agreement was scheduled for completion by autumn 2025. Currently, six rounds of negotiations have happened. The agreement seeks to increase bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, up from the present $191 billion.In 2024-25, the US maintained its position as India's primary trading partner for the fourth successive year, with bilateral trade reaching $131.84 billion ($86.5 billion exports).The US represents approximately 18 per cent of India's total goods exports, 6.22 per cent of imports, and 10.73 per cent of total merchandise trade.October witnessed a continued decline in India's merchandise exports to the US, decreasing by 8.58 per cent to $6.3 billion, marking the second consecutive monthly reduction.","The USTR Jamieson Greer has indicated that India's proposals for the planned trade agreement are the ""best"" they have received.

US Federal Reserve cuts rate: What does it mean for Indian stock markets? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-federal-reserve-cuts-rate-what-does-it-mean-for-indian-stock-markets-explained/articleshow/125901249.cms,"Most experts believe that a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve is a positive signal for the Indian markets. (AI image)



US Federal Reserve’s rate cut decision:

What it means for Indian stock markets

The US Federal Reserve cut the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in the latest monetary policy review. A split US Federal Reserve announced its third successive interest rate cut of the year, whilst indicating a potential pause in future cuts. The rate cut, reducing the range to between 3.50 percent and 3.75 percent, brings it to the lowest level in approximately three years - matched market predictions.A rate cut by the central bank of the world’s largest economy has implications for markets globally and India is no different. Indian equity benchmarks, Sensex and Nifty , are already down 2.05% and 2.16% from their lifetime highs hit a few days ago. The markets have been bleeding despite a repo rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Continuous outflow of foreign capital, rupee depreciation, and lack of clarity on the India-US trade deal are acting as negative triggers for the stock market. What does the US Fed’s rate cut mean for the Indian stock markets? We take a look:US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank finds itself ""well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves from here."" The Federal Reserve reintroduced specific phrasing from late 2024 in its policy statement, suggesting a temporary halt to rate cuts.Powell emphasised that the committee remains suitably placed to assess the ""extent and timing of additional adjustments based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.""The Federal Reserve projected one rate cut for the upcoming year, whilst highlighting increased employment-related concerns in its latest policy announcement.Most experts believe that a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve is a positive signal for the Indian markets.Vijay Singh Gour, Research Analyst at Mirae Asset Sharekhan explains that the Fed’s monetary policy influences India's financial markets, mainly by driving capital flows.The market had anticipated a 25 basis point rate cut, which would ease global liquidity. Such a cut is generally positive for Indian equities because lower US Treasury yields make dollar-denominated assets less appealing, encouraging Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) to increase allocations to emerging markets like India, thus boosting inflows and strengthening the Rupee, Vijay Singh Gour told TOI.“The 25 bps rate cut from the Federal Reserve is likely to provide some relief to the Indian currency and the FII sell off. This shall ease some pressure on Indian markets which are expecting some positive triggers,” says Sujan Hajra, Chief Economist & Executive Director, Anand Rathi Group. “Also the Fed rate cut further opens up the space for RBI for a rate cut in the current low inflation environment to support growth,” he tells TOI.Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited cautions that the rate cut bodes well for the Indian markets, but the net impact may be muted. “The Fed’s decision to cut rates by 25 bps was on expected lines. The noteworthy part of the decision is the 9-3 vote, which signals a tough road ahead for further rate cuts. The FOMC’s dot plot indicates two more rate cuts - one in 2026 and another in 2027. However, this might change since the Fed chair has clearly indicated that “ we are well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves,” he tells TOI.The Fed decision, though favourable from the market perspective, is unlikely to have a significant impact on the Indian market, which is being weighed down by the sustained selling by FIIs, the huge supply of paper from IPOs and the poor earnings growth of the last six quarters, he feels.“Of these, earnings growth is the most significant, and this is going to change for the better in the coming quarters. A slowdown in IPOs is likely in 2026, and along with this when earnings growth picks up, the market will respond positively. Weakness in the market now presents buying opportunities in high quality stocks, particularly in largecaps and selectively in midcaps,” VK Vijayakumar adds.","US Federal Reserve cut the benchmark rate by 25 basis points in the latest monetary policy review.

Trump FREEZES Green Card, Citizenship Applications From THESE High-Risk Countries After DC Shooting

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled what he called the ""Trump Gold Card,"" announcing that people will be able to apply for Gold Card citizenship starting Wednesday afternoon.In a post on Truth Social, Trump promoted the new immigration pathway, saying, ""THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT’S TRUMP GOLD CARD IS HERE TODAY! A direct path to Citizenship for all qualified and vetted people. SO EXCITING! Our Great American Companies can finally keep their invaluable Talent. Live Site opens in 30 minutes!""Speaking further about the initiative, Trump said, ""Very excitingly for me and for the country, we've just launched the Trump Gold Card. The site goes up in about 30 minutes, and all funds go to the United States government... It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card. Companies will be able to go to any school, buy a card, and keep that person in the United States... It's a gift to get somebody great coming into our country, because we think there will be some tremendous people who otherwise wouldn't have been allowed to stay.They graduate from college, they have to go back to India or China or France... The companies will be very happy. I know Apple is going to be happy. Nobody talked to me more about it than Tim Cook. He said it's a real problem. And it's not going to be a problem anymore... The other thing is it'll take in, we think, probably billions of dollars that will go to the Treasury of the United States... Many billions of dollars, even.""Trump has previously spoken about a Gold Card–style visa program designed to attract wealthy or highly skilled foreign nationals. The broader objective has been to bring top talent and significant foreign investment into the United States by offering a faster pathway to residency.While full details of the newly announced Gold Card are still unclear, earlier proposals included substantial financial thresholds: individual applicants were expected to donate $1 million to the US Treasury, and corporate-sponsored applicants needed to contribute $2 million, in addition to a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee.A third tier, the Platinum Card, had also been proposed, allowing an individual to spend up to 270 days a year in the US without becoming subject to US tax on foreign income, in exchange for $5 million. It remains unclear whether this tier is part of the current rollout.The website clarifies that simply having the money does not guarantee entry into the US, a point that had been less explicit in earlier announcements. Applicants must still qualify for permanent residency, be legally admissible, and have an available visa slot.Under US immigration rules, Gold Card holders will effectively fall under the EB-1 or EB-2 categories. These visas are typically meant for individuals with “extraordinary ability,” including top researchers, distinguished professors, accomplished artists and leading business figures, and they provide a route to permanent residency and eventual citizenship.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled what he called the ""Trump Gold Card"" Trump has previously spoken about a Gold Card–style visa program designed to attract wealthy or highly skilled foreign nationals.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Airport has integrated AI systems, advanced predictive analytics and enhanced runway capabilities this winter to reduce the impact of fog on flight operations.A combination of these upgrades and technology should help ensure safer, more efficient flight operations and minimal disruption during low-visibility conditions (LVPs), Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), the airport operator, said on Wednesday.The Airport Predictive Operations Centre (APOC), which plays a central role, has integrated real-time data, predictive weather models and airside operational inputs into a single command environment. ""It will enable faster decision-making and more accurate resource deployment during fog.It helps optimise runway utilisation, improves gate and stand allocation, prioritises aircraft sequencing, and ensures timely communication with all partners. This coordinated, data-driven approach significantly enhances the airport's ability to maintain operational continuity even during rapid visibility fluctuations,"" DIAL said.The airport has also completed an airside upgrade in association with the Airports Authority of India (AAI). The Dwarka end of runway 10/28 (the second runway) has now been equipped with a CAT III Instrument Landing System. ""With this enhancement, three runways (10/28, 11L/29R, and 11R/29L) at Delhi Airport are now CAT-III compliant at both ends, enabling safe landings even in dense fog. The newly upgraded runway, along with the existing runway, enables around 30 landings per hour during low-visibility conditions,"" DIAL said.The airside upgrade is expected to cut fog-related recovery time by nearly four hours.Delhi Airport will also use the Winter Fog Experiment (WiFEX) data on fog, which claims to provide 85% prediction accuracy.

Where Metaverse budget cuts may go

Wall Street says: We are with you on this

Meta reportedly delays MR glasses

The day Facebook changed its name to Meta





Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to have finally realised that one of the company's biggest bets—Metaverse—is not working (or not working as expected). It is also the technology that the company changed its very name after. In 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus changed its name to Meta. Now according to a report from Bloomberg, Meta is likely to slash its Reality Labs budget, shaving off as much as 30%. The proposed metaverse cuts are reportedly part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound in Hawaii last month.For those unaware, Metaverse unit works on virtual reality headsets and a VR-based social network, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community.Analysts see the move reflecting the overall lack of interest in products like Meta’s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware—both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse vision has posted more than $70 billion in losses over the past four years. Little doubt then that Facebook parent's shares rose 4% as the move eased some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars. ""Smart move, just late,"" told Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber to Bloomberg. He added, ""This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought years ago. ""So, what may really be troubling Metaverse? No one can really pinpoint. But as a report in Fortune says, for many people, the problem is that the value proposition is unclear; Metaverse simply doesn’t yet deliver a must-have reason to ditch their smartphones or laptops.Reality Labs is made up of a Metaverse unit and a wearables unit. Within the Metaverse unit, executives are reportedly considering making cuts to VR jobs. As the report says, cuts in resources that high are most likely to include layoffs as early as January.The report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta has committed as much as $72 billion in capital spending this year. The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, with Zuckerberg said to be personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp with million-dollar pay packages. In fact, Meta's big hiring is said to have triggered a talent war in the Silicon Valley.Last month, Meta Platforms said that it will invest $600 billion in the US infrastructure and jobs over the next three years, including artificial intelligence data centers. Meta has doubled down on AI, with a target of achieving superintelligence. Zuckerberg said Meta is building compute because ""it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load capacity so we're prepared for the most optimistic cases,"" on the company's recent earnings call. Meta has forecast ""notably larger"" capital expenses next year thanks to investments in artificial intelligence, including aggressively building data centers to power its AI push.Incidentally, earlier this week, Zuckerberg announced that Alan Dye, a longtime designer at Apple, is joining Meta to lead a new creative studio inside the Reality Labs division that would focus on design, fashion and technology. Dye will report to Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, who leads Reality Labs. “We’re entering a new era where A.I. glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post to Threads. “With this new studio, we’re focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.”Wall Street sent a clear signal to Meta Platforms that it wants the company to reduce spending on Reality Labs. Wall Street is sending a clear signal to Meta Platforms that it wants the company to reduce spending on Reality Labs. Meta Platforms shares jumped 3.4% on reports that the company was cutting Metaverse spending in favor of AI and smart glasses.Meta has reportedly delayed the launch of its Mixed Reality Glasses (MR Glasses) from the second half of 2026 to the first half of 2027. According to a report in Business Insider, Meta executives announced the delay after meetings with CEO Mark Zuckerberg is said to have told the team to take more time to make the business sustainable and deliver higher quality experiences. The company’s Metaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns reportedly told team that the delay is “going to give us a lot more breathing room to get the details right. ”Facebook already sells VR headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses. The form factor of Meta's upcoming Glasses will reportedly be similar to that of Apple Vision Pro, with may be more power.In October 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking giant behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus got a new name. Facebook’s corporate entity became Meta. Mark Zuckerberg announced the change at the company’s AR/VR-focused Connect event, sharing that the new title captured more of the company’s core ambition: to build the metaverse. Analysts saw name change as the right move, as Instagram was -- and continues to be -- more valuable than Facebook. Along with WhatsApp and Messenger, the four apps are known as Meta's Family of Apps","Reality Labs, Meta's virtual reality unit, is set to be cut by as much as 30%, according to a report from Bloomberg.

Jamie Dimon the CEO of America’s biggest banks JPMorgan and Chase has now warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation. This in turn is creating risks not only for the continent but also for the United States. As reported by Bloomberg, speaking at the Reagan National Defence Forum, Dimon said, “Europe has a real problem. They do some wonderful things on their safety nets. But they’ve driven business out, they’ve driven investment out, they’ve driven innovation out. It’s kind of coming back.”Along with this, Dimon has also cautioned that a fragmented Europe is one of the biggest challenges faced by the world. Earlier this year, in his annual shareholders letter, Dimon noted that Europe has “serious issues to fix.” While praising the creation of the euro and Europe’s pursuit of peace, Dimon warned that reduced military efforts and difficulties in reaching consensus within the European Union threaten the continent’s stability.“If they fragment, then you can say that America first will not be around anymore. It will hurt us more than anybody else because they are a major ally in every single way, including common values, which are really important,” he said, urging Washington to adopt a long-term strategy to strengthen Europe.“A weak Europe is bad for us.”The comments made by Dimon clings with recent announcement made by JPMorgan to funnel $1.5 trillion into industries that bolster US economic security and resiliency over the next decade — $500 billion more than previously planned.The initiative will mainly focus on supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace, energy independence and resilience and also frontier and strategic technologies.Along with this, JPMorgan will also invest up to $10 billion of its own capital to enable combines expand and innovate in strategic manufacturing.Separately, Dimon commended President Trump’s efforts to cut government bureaucracy. “There is no question that this administration is trying to bring an axe to some of the bureaucracy that held back America. That is a good thing and we can do it and still keep the world safe, for safe food and safe banks and all the stuff like that,” he said.","JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that slow bureaucracy of Europe and the economic fragmentation are driving away businesses, investment, and innovation.

Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar has now informed that the state legislative council that around 376 employees of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were laid off at the company’s Pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year. The disclosure was made via a hand written reply during the Vidhan Parishad session, after concerns were raised by members over reports of widespread layoffs in the IT sector.Fundkar further clarified that the layoffs were not linked to artificial intelligence or automation, addressing speculation that job losses were part of a broader restructuring driven by new technologies. In the Vidhan Parishad, Fundkar revealed that the company fired 376 employees from its Pune campus and the round of layoffs mainly impacted middle and senior-level managers.As reported by new agency PTI, during the Question Hour, the legislators including Uma Khare and Prasad Lad raised questions about increasing job losses in the technology sector and the impact of AI adoption on employment. The reply by the minister is sought to provide transparency by citing official data received directly from TCS.The Maharashtra government also stressed in the fact that while the layoffs have occurred, they are not on the scale suggested by media reports of mass layoffs across multiple cities.The minister further assured the council that the government is monitoring developments in the IT sector closely, given its importance to employment and state’s economy.Recently, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant. Speaking during the company’s Q2 earnings call earlier this month, Kunnumal said that TCS is not “chasing a target” when it comes to job cuts. Instead, the IT firm said it will evaluate “everyone”.During the earnings call, analyst Surendra Goyal from Citi asked: “The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal replied to the question saying: “So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition. So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”",Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) laid off 376 employees from its Pune campus.

The carrier apologised and told affected passengers to update their contact details and use its assistance channels for rebooking.A massive nationwide general strike in Portugal has caused significant disruption to international air travel, forcing major UAE carriers Etihad Airways and Emirates to cancel all scheduled flights to and from Lisbon on Thursday, December 11. The industrial action, which paralyzed airport operations across Portugal, including Lisbon Portela International Airport (also known as Humberto Delgado Airport), marked the country’s most impactful walkout since 2013.The cancellations affected two primary routes:The timing of the strike created a severe logistical headache, coinciding with December's peak holiday travel season, where Dubai International Airport alone was expecting over 10 million passengers. Emirates confirmed that travelers connecting through Dubai on the cancelled outbound flights (EK191 and EK193) would not be accepted for travel at their point of origin.The cancellations are part of a much larger national strike called by Portugal’s two main unions, CGTP and UGT, the country’s first general strike of this scale since 2013.The industrial action targets proposed labour-law reforms (including changes to dismissal rules and working hours) and has drawn participation from teachers, health workers, municipal staff and transport employees, and crucially airline cabin and ground crews represented by SNPVAC. Union action at Lisbon (and Porto) airports meant only minimum services could run, making it “very difficult to operate flights” on December 11.The airline cited “national industrial action affecting all airlines at Lisbon Airport” as the reason for the suspension. The management added, “We apologise for the inconvenience. Our teams are doing their best to assist with your travel arrangements,” while emphasising that “the safety and comfort of our guests and crew is our number one priority.”Thousands of travellers faced disruption during a peak travel period. Etihad emphasised that “the safety and comfort of our guests and crew is our number one priority” and apologised for the inconvenience while offering assistance and urging passengers to check etihad.com/contactme for updates.Emirates and other carriers also suspended or reduced services to Lisbon on the same date, compounding rebooking pressure at busy UAE hubs. Airlines have been offering rebooking, refunds or vouchers depending on fare rules and availability.","A nationwide general strike in Portugal has caused significant disruption to international air travel.

Bengaluru cybercrime gang dupes American and UK victims through fake Microsoft support scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/bengaluru-cybercrime-gang-dupes-american-and-uk-victims-through-fake-microsoft-support-scam/articleshow/125902490.cms,"Representative image

BENGALURU: Investigations into the transnational cybercrime syndicate involving technical staff from Bengaluru duping American citizens revealed that the accused targeted at least 150 victims and robbed them of $10,000 each (Rs 13.5 crores) on average since this August.The police last month raided Musk Communications in Whitefield and arrested 21 suspects. The fraudsters impersonated Microsoft technical support staff and cited fake 'Federal Trade Commission (FTC)' violations to extort money. Additionally, the police arrested an individual identified as Ravi Chouhan from Ahmedabad, who recruited around 85 staffers in the city.A senior IPS officer said the accused made the victims deposit money in bitcoins by depositing them in Bitcoin ATMs. (Bitcoin ATMs are kiosks that connect to the Bitcoin network, allowing transactions with cryptocurrencies.)""We are in the process of extracting the bank details of the victim customers, and as of now, we have found that at least 150 victims from the US and UK were made to deposit around $10,000 into various Bitcoin ATMs,"" he said.Meanwhile, police arrested a youth from Ahmedabad, identified as Ravi Chauhan, for recruiting the staffers at Musk Communication.With Chowhan landing in police custody, the number of arrested persons rises to 22.""Three kingpins are yet to be found. They have been targeting the victims in the UK and USA since 2022,"" an investigating officer said.Acting on a credible tip-off, teams from Cyber Command's special cell and sleuths of the cybercrime police station, Whitefield division, raided the office of Musk Communications on the 6th floor of the Delta building in Sigma Soft Tech Park, Whitefield Main Road, on November 14 and November 15. The two-day operation—with a search warrant—resulted in the seizure of computers, laptops, hard disks, mobile phones, and other devices. All 21 staffers present in the office were arrested and produced before a local court, which remanded them in police custody.Investigations revealed that Musk Communications rented a sprawling 4,500 sqft office space in August this year for a monthly rent of Rs 5 lakhs. The gang allegedly deployed malicious Facebook advertisements targeted specifically at US users. These ads contained embedded code masquerading as legitimate security alerts or service links. ""Once a user clicked on the ad, the code froze the computer and triggered a pop-up claiming to be from Microsoft global technical support, displaying a fake helpline number,"" police explained.When victims called the number, the fraudsters—posing as Microsoft technicians—claimed that the user's computer was hacked, the IP address compromised, and banking data at serious risk. They further frightened victims by citing fabricated 'FTC violations'. Under this pretext, they coerced the users into paying large sums for bogus security fixes or compliance procedures.There were a total of 83 employees in the firm, and the technical staff, around 21 in number, were aware of the scam, police said. They were paid a monthly salary of Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000.","The police last month raided Musk Communications in Whitefield and arrested 21 suspects.
