Single dose of Covid-19 vaccine sufficient for already infected people: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/single-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-sufficient-for-already-infected-people-study/articleshow/83513073.cms,"HYDERABAD: A single dose of Covid-19 vaccine is sufficient for an infected person as there was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection, according to a study released by AIG Hospitals on Monday.The city-based AIG Hospitals recently published a study conducted on 260 healthcare workers, who got vaccinated between January 16 and February 5, in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases (a peer-reviewed journal).The study was designed to assess the immunological memory response in all those patients.All patients were given the Covishield vaccine.The study also said Memory T-cell responses elicited by a single dose of vaccine were significantly higher in the previously infected group compared with those who had no prior infection.Commenting on the impact that this study can have on the overall vaccine administration strategy, Dr. D Nageshwar Reddy , Chairman, AIG Hospitals, and one of the co-authors of the study, said the results show that people who got infected with Covid-19 need not take two doses of vaccine as a single dose can develop robust antibody and memory cell response at par with two-doses for those who didnt get the infection.This will significantly help at a time when theres a shortage of vaccine in the country and more people can be covered using the saved doses, Dr Reddy said.Once the requisite number of people are vaccinated for achieving herd immunity, these patients who got infected and received only one dose can take the second dose of the vaccine, he further said.At this point, all our strategies should be directed at the widespread distribution of available vaccines and to include the maximum number of people at least with a single dose, Dr Reddy added.",There was a greater antibody response when compared with those who have had no prior infection.

Mami Mizutori

tells

Pradeep Thakur

Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people. Excerpts from the interview:

The

estimates 150 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty in 2021 due to Covid-19. How can India minimise the impact?

The US and some other countries reserved enough shots for their citizens. Should India have done the same?

How much success has the UN’s Covax programme achieved?

The second wave of Covid-19 has caused more deaths in India. Where did it go wrong?

Your idea of a ‘global response for future pandemics’ and vaccine distribution?

With Covid disruptions, can countries like India meet the UN’s

target?

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the people and government of India on the tragic loss of life that is taking place across the country.All major disasters which affect low- and middle-income countries result in economic losses on a scale which has a damaging effect on their ability to eradicate poverty and meet other basic needs, including health services and access to education. In the case of Covid-19, we have seen how it has pushed millions into extreme poverty globally, and has contributed to rising levels of hunger in many parts of the world where the informal economy that poor people depend on has been decimated. For all member states, the eradication of poverty cannot be achieved without reducing disaster risk and improved prevention as nothing undermines development like disasters.Much of the world looks to India for vaccine supply but the pharmaceutical supply chain is very complex and specialised to a degree that serving a population the size of India’s was always going to be a gargantuan task. The numbers already vaccinated in India are enormous but manufacturing enough doses to reach over one billion people will take time.The Covax facility portfolio, administered by Gavi, currently consists of agreements related to eight vaccines, including those developed with the Serum Institute of India . Coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance , the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the WHO, Covax is making steady progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high risk and vulnerable people, as well as frontline healthcare workers.Covid-19 demonstrates the systemic nature of disaster risk, how a biological hazard can ravage all areas of life starting from public health to all socio-economic aspects of our societies. Unfortunately, many countries, including India, are learning the hard way that prevention requires more patience than previously thought and, in the case of biological hazards, a longer game plan. WHO has warned that when there are mass gatherings, more contagious variants and the vaccination coverage is still low, this can create a perfect storm for the virus to spread in any country. India has done an admirable job in harnessing technology and communication to ensure effective early warning leads to early action in the case of cyclones. The challenge for the government now is to communicate effectively on the continued need for face masks, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings while at the same time rolling out an effective vaccination programme.If the global level of preparedness for this pandemic had matched the warnings, much of the impact could have been reduced. An adequate level of pandemic preparedness would have cost billions instead of the trillions that it is now costing. The loss of life and the economic disruption could have been significantly reduced if we had been adequately prepared from the moment biological hazards were included in the Sendai Framework in 2015. Given the transboundary nature of biological hazards it is obvious that a global response plan is required for future pandemics. A patchwork response is not working for Covid-19, and it will not work against any newly emerging diseases and viruses in the future. It is not acceptable that developing countries should have to wait so long for Covid vaccines. This inequality and lack of solidarity to access affordable vaccines only fuels the spread of the virus, allows the emergence of new variants and prolongs the pandemic. None of us is safe until we are all safe.It is clear that the death toll and economic loss from Covid-19 means that Sendai Framework targets on reducing mortality, numbers of disaster affected people and economic losses has suffered a great setback. However, we are still making significant progress on other targets. Asia and the Pacific are not on track to achieve any of the SDGs.","Covax is making progress towards having 2 billion doses available by the end of 2021, which should be enough to protect high-risk and vulnerable people.

Goa may relax JEE criteria for engineering seats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goa-may-relax-jee-criteria-for-engineering-seats/articleshow/111306792.cms,"'Admission to IT engg in 1st round'

PANAJI: On Wednesday, the first round of admissions to engineering degree programme seats in the five engineering colleges in Goa ended. Of the over 1,500 seats in the five colleges, around 400 were left vacant at the end of the first round. Following this, the directorate of technical education ( DTE ) is set to allow students, who had not appeared for the JEE, to apply for the vacant seats .A file with the proposal will be moved for the state's approval soon, sources said. The second round of admissions are expected to take place in mid-July.""For the second round, students who have not appeared for JEE will be able to apply for admissions, once state govt approves the proposal. They can seek admissions provided they meet all other criteria for admissions set by the All India Council for Technical Education ( AICTE ), like minimum score of 45% in physics-chemistry-mathematics (PCM) at their Class XII board exams for general students and 40% for those in reserved categories,"" said a source.For the first time in 2024 after around two decades, the criteria for admissions to engineering programme degree programmes in Goa was altered.The Goa Common Entrance Test ( GCET ) was retired and JEE was made the criteria to apply for engineering seats in Goa.""The GCET or the JEE score is only to draw the merit list. Eligibility criteria set by the AICTE is different like PCM score. So, if students meet the eligibility criteria, there is no harm in allowing them to apply for the vacant seats. This was the first time students were appearing for JEE for state seats and some may have not appeared due to feeling intimidated over appearing for the national test. So, the second round will be an opportunity for them,"" said the source.Officials said that, at the first round of admissions, students showed a preference for engineering programmes in the streams of information technology and of computer engineering, in keeping with the trend in recent years. The stream of mechanical engineering did not seem to find favour with students.""IT and computer engineering streams in all colleges are taken in the first round. As usual, almost all seats in the state-run Goa Engineering College at Farmagudi were filled, while most seats were vacant in the Shiroda-based Shree Rayeshwar Institute of Engineering and Information Technology (SRIEIT),"" said the official.","Of the over 1,500 seats in the five colleges, around 400 were left vacant at the end of the first round.

"3 new criminal laws kick in today, data ousts 'danda' as policing tool",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/3-new-criminal-laws-kick-in-today-data-ousts-danda-as-policing-tool/articleshow/111387621.cms,"Top Picks For You New criminal laws to change the way justice is delivered

NEW DELHI: The criminal justice system is set for a major overhaul with the three new criminal laws - Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA) - coming into force on Monday, replacing the British-era Indian Penal Code , Criminal Procedure Code and the Indian Evidence Act .Starting Monday, all FIRs will be registered under the provisions of BNS.However, all cases registered before July 1 will continue to be tried under IPC, CrPC and Indian Evidence Act until final disposal.BNS has 358 sections, down from 511 in IPC. As many as 21 new crimes have been added in BNS compared to IPC, duration of imprisonment extended in 41 crimes, fines increased in 82 crimes, minimum punishment introduced in 25 crimes, community service introduced as penalty in six crimes and 19 sections removed.BNSS has 531 sections as against 484 in CrPC, with changes in 177 sections, addition of nine sections and 39 sub-sections and deletion of 14 sections. The Indian Evidence Act, with 166 sections, is being replaced with BSA having 170 sections, with change in 24 sections, addition of two new sub-sections and deletion of six sections.BNS, BNSS and BSA are being implemented six months after they were enacted based on protracted and detailed consultations with all stakeholders including SC and HC judges, governors, chief ministers, civil servants, police officers, collectorates and Members of Parliament and legislative assemblies. Around 3,200 suggestions were received and examined over several rounds of talks, with home minister Amit Shah having taken 158 such meetings, leading to the drafting of a whole new set ofcriminal laws that seek to leverage technology to make India's criminal justice system one of the most modern in the world. The BNS, BNSS and BSA bills were referred to a parliamentary standing committee and most of its recommendations were accepted by the govt before bringing the bills to Parliament for approval.The underlying spirit of the new criminal laws , as PM Modi had stated at the All-India DGPs conference in Jan, is ""citizen first, dignity first and justice first"", with emphasis on the 'danda' (baton) being replaced by 'data' as a policing tool.While replying to the debate in Parliament on BNS, BNSS and BSA bills, Shah had underlined that the focus of the new laws was on justice delivery, while safeguarding the rights of victims as well as accused, rather than on punishment. Also, the colonial mindset apparent behind ordering of IPC sections - with those dealing with 'rajdroh' (treason) preceding ones related to serious offences like 'murder' and 'rape' - was being done away with.Under the , a person may report crime online, without having to visit a police station (online FIR) and also file a zero-FIR at any police station. A free copy of the FIR will be provided to the victim. In the event of arrest, the individual will have the right to inform a person of his choice. Arrest details will need to be prominently displayed within police stations and district headquarters.The new laws prioritise investigation for offences against women and children, ensuring timely completion within two months of recording information. Victims shall be entitled to updates on the progress of their case within 90 days.Courts may now grant a maximum of two adjournments to avoid unnecessary delays in case hearings.","Three new criminal laws come into force on Monday.

Commissioned into the J&K Rifles in 1984, he had a two-year tenure as the GoC-in-C of the crucial Northern Command before becoming the vice-chief in Feb this year. ""While China has mastered salami-slicing and grey zone warfare, Pakistan continues with its proxy war,"" a top official said.In a statement announcing Gen Dwivedi's taking over the top post, the Army said, ""The global geo-strategic environment remains dynamic, with the challenges in the security domain becoming more pronounced due to technological advancements and ever-changing character of modern warfare.""""Operational preparedness to counter security threats to a rising nation, therefore would figure prominently, as a key focus area for the chief. Concurrently, a focused response strategy to myriad non-traditional security challenges, too, shall be a priority towards augmenting the nation's defence,"" it said.Gen Dwivedi will have to push hard to fast-track modernisation and transformation of the Army during his two-year tenure.Despite emergency procurements, the force is still grappling with major operational voids in several areas, ranging from modern air defence weapons and fourth-generation anti-tank guided missiles to attack and light utility helicopters and night-fighting capabilities.This is especially critical for the Northern and Eastern Commands along the 3,488-km LAC. There are 50,000 to 60,000 Chinese troops with heavy weaponry deployed along the western (Ladakh) and central sectors (Uttarakhand, Himachal) of the LAC. China has upped the ante in the eastern sector (Sikkim, Arunachal) as well, with another 90,000 soldiers deployed there.Then, there is the entire question of the short-term recruitment of soldiers under the controversial Agnipath scheme rolled out in June 2022. The armed forces want the retention rate of Agniveers to be raised from the existing 25% after their four-year tenures to at least 50%.","Gen Dwivedi will have to push hard to fast-track modernisation and transformation of the Army during his two-year tenure.

The meeting is significant as it is the first time that the Taliban are attending the talks.However, the UN has denied that the latest round of talks in Doha are meant to pave the way for international recognition for the Taliban.The conference has also come under strong criticism from rights groups for not engaging Afghan women and civil society members.India is being represented in the meeting by MEA joint secretary of the Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran (PAI) division J P Singh. The official, who visited Kabul in March this year, also met Taliban leaders in Doha.India continues to tread carefully on the Taliban, as it works closely with them for Afghanistan’s humanitarian needs and its own security needs but without doing anything that might be seen as a step towards official recognition for the regime in Kabul.The conference in Doha is also seeing participation by the EU, OIC and SCO, the Eurasian bloc which will be hosting its summit meeting this week in Astana, where one of the main focus areas again will be the situation in Afghanistan. With PM Narendra Modi skipping participation, although he may still address it virtually on July 4, foreign minister S Jaishankar will represent India at the SCO summit Both in Doha and Astana, government will look to further hammer its point that as a contiguous neighbor, India has legitimate economic and security interests in Afghanistan, and that the international community must focus on combating terrorism, humanitarian assistance, formation of a truly inclusive government and preserving the rights of women, girls and minorities. The focus on girls and women is important as the Taliban continue to deny them access to schools and colleges, in line with their interpretation of Islamic laws.Securing its investments in Afghanistan is also a priority for India as it working on close to 500 projects in the country spread across all 34 provinces in areas like power, water supply, road connectivity, healthcare, education and agriculture. In all, India has invested more than $ 3 billion in Afghanistan.Ensuring that Afghan territory is not used for sheltering terrorists or financing terrorist acts, however, tops the list of Indian priorities. This is particularly so in the case of terrorists proscribed by the UN Security Council, including those belonging to Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad. India will look to again make the point that any instability in Afghanistan is a threat to the whole region.","India is among the 25 countries participating in the third UN-led conference on Afghanistan in Doha.

Online registration of police complaints and electronic service of summons.

Mandatory videography of crime scenes for all heinous crimes to strengthen investigations.

Faster justice delivery, with judgments required within 45 days of trial completion and charges framed within 60 days of first hearing.

Sensitive handling of crimes against women and children, including recording victim statements by female officers and faster medical reports.

New provisions to address emerging crimes like false promise of marriage, gang rape of minors, and mob lynching.

Definition of terrorism for the first time, with expanded scope to include ""economic security"" of the country.

Reduction in the number of sections from 511 in IPC to 358 in Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.

Merging of overlapping sections and simplification of language

Criticism by opposition



The new laws significantly expand the maximum duration of police custody from 15 days to 60-90 days, increasing the risk of police excesses and coerced evidence.

The laws give police officers broad discretion to choose whether to prosecute under the new laws or the existing UAPA, without clear guidelines.

The new laws introduce vaguely worded offences related to ""terrorism"", ""organized crime"", and ""acts endangering sovereignty"", which can be arbitrarily applied.

The definition of ""terrorism"" is expanded beyond the existing UAPA to include acts that ""disturb public order"" or ""destabilize the country"", giving wide scope for misuse.

The expanded police powers and vague offences pose a threat to fundamental rights like freedom of speech and personal liberty.

The removal of the legal aid provision from the point of arrest is seen as particularly problematic for protecting the rights of the accused.

NEW DELHI: The three new criminal laws - the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita , Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita , and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam -- which will replace the British-era Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure, and Indian Evidence Act, respectively, will come into effect from July 1 , 2024.The new laws, which were passed by the previous NDA government, aims to modernise India's criminal justice system by incorporating provisions such as:The laws aim to prioritise justice and fairness over just punishment, with an Indian ethos, as opposed to the colonial-era laws, Union home minister Amit Shah had said in Lok Sabha when the laws were being debated.The government recently said that extensive preparations, including training programs and technological upgrades, have been undertaken to ensure smooth implementation of these new criminal laws across the country.Though the new laws have been widely hailed as much-needed update to the Colonial-era legislations, the opposition has cited several issues.","The three new criminal laws will replace the British-era Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure, and Indian Evidence Act.

A police team is working on identifying them.A police note said the first officer arrested, Lt Commander Vipin Dagar (28), would prepare forged documents, forward them to the South Korean consulate in Mumbai and visit it on Jyoti's instructions.

An examination of Jyoti's bank account showed that he had accumulated Rs 1.6 crore in the last eight years, which was beyond his known sources of income.Investigations showed that the gang would entice people seeking opportunities abroad, particularly in South Korea, to apply for visas even if they were ineligible. The two naval officers would visit the consulate in Mumbai in uniform, claiming to be close relatives of the applicants, to ensure that certain discrepancies were overlooked, said police. They even forced the consulate employees to expedite visa applications, they added.Police said Teji (26) had established a fictitious company, Tosha International, through which she would send people abroad.","Mumbai police crime branch probing human smuggling to South Korea has arrested a second naval officer and suspected kingpin of the racket.

Additionally, an access road will be constructed providing direct connectivity from the west end of Bandra station to Western Express Highway.The rehabilitation project had been stalled since 2002 and locals, along with Khan, had approached courts, seeking permission to renew their agreements under the new slum scheme that offered them more benefits.The developer has been paying monthly rents to the eligible families for transit accommodation after they vacated their shanties.Earlier, the slumdwellers had locked horns with the authorities over their rehabilitation after receiving multiple demolition notices from BMC to allow it to undertake road widening.The slumdwellers had signed the agreement with the builder in 2002, but over the last two decades, govt has changed the eligibility criteria . After the residents approached courts—the issue went till SC—the builder accepted the demand to execute a fresh agreement as per the new rules.","The vacant plot will be used to build several towers to rehabilitate 1,400 eligible slum families.

Unveiling Kerala's Unique Duryodhan Temple: A Taxpaying Tribute to Mahabharat's Arch Villain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/a-temple-for-mahabharats-arch-villain-now-a-taxpayer/articleshow/111325091.cms,"A village where Duryodhan's a benign

, is called 'grandpa'

Even in a land of temples, and more deities than even the most pious can name, a temple for the arch villain of India's greatest epic is unusual. But what really makes the Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala 's Kollam district a standout is an aspect of modernity - per govt records, the eldest Kaurav prince pays taxes.Local lore has it that the prince was tired and thirsty during his travels.Drinking water was scarce, but a woman of a so-called low caste offered him a drink of toddy. Duryodhan, who also famously elevated the supposedly low-born Karna to kingship, accepted happily, blessed the woman and her village, and gave them land. The temple for him was the village saying thank you. Ritual offerings here include a good measure of intoxicants.At the Peruviruthy Malanada temple, the daily offering of toddy to Duryodhan, who's not represented by an idol in the temple but by a polished mace, the Kaurav prince's weapon of choice. In Mahabharat , he's the man who hoots with delight as he orders Draupadi disrobed, the prince who plotted to steal the kingdom that rightfully belonged to the good guys - Pandavs. But in this village, he's a benign, protective deity. Villagers call him 'appoopa' (grandpa).That sharp departure from Mahabharat's narrative treatment of Duryodhan, the fact that there's no idol and the votive offering of toddy are similar to other non-Vedic practices in many southern temples. Villagers have a more interesting take on the toddy offering - a tipple keeps the deity in a mild and cheerful mood, they say.As for those taxes Duryodhan pays diligently, it will be wise to first point out that the tax is not on the temple's income - all temples are tax free in India. The levy is on the 15 acres of temple land at the Poruvazhy village surrounding the temple.""When the pattayam was issued for the temple, the land was registered in the deity's name. The thandaper (land deed) number and survey details show the land is owned by Duryodhan. Ever since taxes were introduced in Kerala, this land tax has been paid in Duryodhan's name,"" a local administrator said. Of the 15 acres of temple land, eight acres are paddy fields, the rest is forested land, said temple committee secretary Rajaneesh R.When in Puruvazhy, don't diss Duryodhan.","Duryodhan temple in a remote village in Kerala's Kollam district is a standout.

No justification to charge toll if roads are in disrepair: Nitin Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-justification-to-charge-toll-if-roads-are-in-disrepair-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/111267453.cms,"NEW DELHI: Echoing the sentiment of many highway commuters, Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said there is no justification of highway agencies charging toll, if roads are not in good condition and people continue to face problems. He was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling, which will be rolled out across 5,000 km during this financial year.Known for not mincing his words, Gadkari said, “If you don’t provide good services, you should not charge toll...We are in a hurry to start tolling to collect user fees and protect our interest.When the condition of any road is not good I get numerous complaints and there are social media posts all over...You should collect the user fee where you provide the best quality road. If you collect toll on roads with potholes, mud, then there will be a backlash from people. We (political leaders) face people’s ire.”The minister said the field officers of NH agencies must be more sensitive towards the pain that people face waiting for long at toll plazas and there must be a mechanism for lodging grievances and their quick redressal.Though govt made the use of FASTag for paying toll on highways mandatory in 2021 for seamless travel through toll lanes and currently around 98% transactions are through these smart tags fixed on vehicles, there have been numerous reports of queues at plazas from across the country. In its bid to put an end to this, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is working on the roll out and expansion of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based toll collection. This aims to remove toll gates from the NH network in the next few years.The highway authority proposes to roll this out in a phased manner, starting with only commercial vehicles and dedicating one lane on each side of toll plazas for them to pass without stopping. It’s mandatory for commercial vehicles to install vehicle tracker system (VTS), an on board unit, which is necessary for GNSS-based tolling.Govt plans to bring private vehicles under this tolling system at a subsequent phase.The road transport ministry has finalised a series of amendments in Central Motor Vehicle Rules and NH Fee Rules, which don’t need legislation, for roll out of the system. While vehicle owners will be incentivised to get a discount in toll charge for complying with their vehicles having OBUs for paying toll without stopping, there will be disincentives for those who don't opt for this.Gadkari said the system (GNSS)-based toll collection will add Rs 10,000 crore to govt’s toll revenue. “We need to put in place a transparent, qualitative and a leak proof system of GNSS-based toll collection in India to ensure no inconvenience to toll users,” he added. The GNSS-based toll collection is expected to enhance efficiency, bring down logistics cost and major relief for the highway users as they will have to pay only for the distance travelled.","Gadkari was speaking at a global workshop on satellite-based tolling.

Scientific research : The detailed inventory of India's fauna will serve as an invaluable resource for scientists, researchers, and policymakers to better understand the country's rich ecological diversity and make informed decisions about sustainable management of natural resources. International leadership: India is the first country in the world to prepare such a comprehensive national-level checklist of its entire fauna. This positions India as a global leader in biodiversity documentation and conservation, setting an example for other countries to follow. Informing policy and planning: The fauna checklist will help the government develop more effective policies and programs for wildlife protection, habitat preservation, and environmental management across India.

NEW DELHI: India has made history by preparing a comprehensive checklist of its entire fauna, covering 1,04,561 species, becoming the first country in the world to achieve this feat.The 'Fauna of India Checklist Portal' was launched on the occasion of the 109th Foundation Day of the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) in Kolkata on Sunday by Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav.The launch marks a significant milestone in biodiversity documentation, positioning India as a global leader in this field.The faunal checklist includes 121 checklists of all known taxa, encompassing 36 phyla. It also highlights endemic, threatened, and scheduled species.The comprehensive fauna checklist is important for several reasons:The environment minister said that the checklist will serve as an invaluable reference for taxonomists, researchers, academicians, conservation managers, and policymakers.He noted that this document showcases India's commitment to biodiversity conservation and will enhance the country's role in global environmental stewardship.“India is a global champion in biodiversity conservation,” Yadav said, referencing the ""Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam"" initiative as a testament to the country's dedication to environmental preservation. This program was one of the first major initiatives undertaken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi after his re-election.Additionally, Yadav highlighted other government initiatives aimed at preserving biodiversity, such as the International Big Cat Alliance. He pointed to the successful relocation of cheetahs to India as an example of the country's effective conservation efforts.","The 'Fauna of India Checklist Portal' was launched on the occasion of the 109th Foundation Day of the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) in Kolkata on Sunday.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
Increase in juvenile crimes: The shocking way China is reacting to brutal murders of little girls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/increase-in-juvenile-crimes-the-shocking-way-china-is-reacting-to-brutal-murders-of-little-girls/articleshow/111391229.cms,"China is grappling with a series of horrific murders of young girls perpetrated by boys as young as 12 years old. However, the way the communist country handles juvenile killers is almost as shocking, often allowing them to avoid jail time and instead sending them to mental institutions for brief periods. In some instances, the young offenders are even permitted to return to school shortly after committing their crimes, according to a news report from New York Post.As China attempts to address the issue of holding children accountable for these heinous acts, which are most notoriously committed against other children, the parents of the victims frequently find themselves waiting for justice that may never arrive.For many years, nations across the globe have grappled with the challenge of striking a balance between imposing penalties and extending mercy to young lawbreakers. This discussion is particularly significant in China, where the historical approach of showing relative clemency to juvenile offenders sharply contrasts with the restricted rights afforded to adult criminal defendants. The Chinese government has long prioritized the education and rehabilitation of young offenders over incarceration.However, in recent times, there has been a growing public outcry in response to this approach. A series of high-profile murders allegedly perpetrated by minors in the past few years has prompted many Chinese citizens to demand stricter measures against juvenile crime . The government has taken notice of these calls for change and has begun to take action in response to the shifting public sentiment.Gong Junli, whose 8-year-old daughter was brutally stabbed to death by a 13-year-old boy, is one of the latest grieving parents awaiting the Supreme People's Court 's (SPC) decision on whether to sentence his child's killer to prison.In March, the story of a single father's ordeal gained attention when authorities decided to file criminal charges against a teenage boy. Red Star News reported that the boy allegedly lured the man's daughter into a wooded area in Xinjing Township in September 2022.Once in the woods, the boy reportedly stabbed the girl several times and left her body among a group of poplar trees, according to officials.The authorities reported that the 13-year-old suspect had allegedly gathered various items, including knives, blades, disposable gloves, and plastic ropes, in preparation for the crime. These tools were strategically hidden in a wooded area where the suspect had asked the victim to join him for play.Authorities reported that the teenage suspect displayed a lack of remorse and spoke about the incident in a casual manner during police questioning.In 2021, China reduced the age of criminal responsibility from 14 to 12. However, unlike in the United States, children are not sent to detention centres, and adult-level punishments are seldom imposed for murder. The lenient sentencing practices were common even before the 2021 amendment, with young offenders often being sent to juvenile rehabilitation centres or psychological correction facilities for short periods.Despite the new law, China continues to witness increased cases against juveniles. Between 2020 and 2023, prosecutors charged 243,000 minors, with an average case increase of 5% per year. The SPC recently announced that it had handed down sentences against 12,000 minors in the first three months of 2024 and issued new guidelines on preventing juvenile crime, suggesting that courts could hold parents and guardians responsible for their children's actions.The court specifically noted that 30% of those who committed violent crimes between 2021 and 2013 were from ""left-behind"" or single-parent families. Left-behind children, who remain in rural areas while their parents work in cities, also make up a significant portion of bullying victims in China. The recent spate of violent incidents has prompted calls for parents to return home and focus on raising their children, with the Supreme People's Court urging communities to work together to address the issue.","China is grappling with a series of horrific murders of young girls perpetrated by boys as young as 12 years old.

"Australia foreign student visa policy changes: Fees doubled, extension gets difficult",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-foreign-student-visa-policy-changes-fees-doubled-extension-gets-difficult/articleshow/111391412.cms,"Gets difficult to extend stay

NEW DELHI: Australia has significantly increased the visa fee for international students, more than doubling the cost from A$710 to A$1,600. This new fee structure, effective from July 1, aims to manage record migration numbers that have exacerbated housing market pressures.Furthermore, recent regulations prohibit visitor visa holders and students with temporary graduate visas from applying onshore for a student visa.""The changes coming into force today will help restore integrity to our international education system, and create a migration system which is fairer, smaller and better able to deliver for Australia,"" said home affairs minister Clare O'Neil in a statement.Official data released in March indicated that net immigration surged by 60%, reaching a record-high of 548,800 people in the year leading up to September 30, 2023. This new fee places Australia significantly higher than its competitors, with the US charging approximately $185 and Canada around C$150 ($110) for student visas.In addition to the fee hike, the government is closing existing loopholes that allow foreign students to extend their stay in Australia continuously. The number of students holding a second or subsequent student visa rose by over 30% to exceed 150,000 in the 2022-23 period.This move adds to a series of policy changes since late last year aimed at tightening student visa rules. The removal of Covid-19 restrictions in 2022 has contributed to a substantial increase in annual migration.In March, English language requirements for these visas were made more stringent. In May, the requisite amount of savings international students needed to secure a visa was increased to A$29,710 from A$24,505, marking the second hike in less than a year.International education is a significant export industry for Australia, contributing A$36.4 billion to the economy during the 2022-2023 financial year. These policy changes may impact the sector's strength going forward.","Australia has significantly increased the visa fee for international students, more than doubling the cost from A$710 to A$1,600.

More storms than usual anticipated

The US National Hurricane Center reported that Hurricane Beryl , a Category 4 storm classified as ""extremely dangerous,"" was moving across the Atlantic Ocean towards the Caribbean 's Windward Islands . The hurricane is anticipated to bring life-threatening winds and flash flooding to the region on Monday.According to the NHC advisory , Hurricane Beryl was situated approximately 250 miles (400 km) southeast of Barbados on Sunday afternoon, with maximum sustained winds reaching 130 mph (215 kph).The hurricane's center is expected to pass through the Windward Islands on Monday morning, maintaining its Category 4 status.The NHC advisory warned, ""Potentially catastrophic wind damage is expected where the eyewall of Beryl moves through portions of the Windward Islands, with the highest risk of the core in St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada""It is uncommon for a major hurricane to form this early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which spans from June 1 to November 30. Hurricane Beryl has set a new record, becoming the earliest Category 4 hurricane, surpassing Hurricane Dennis, which reached Category 4 status on July 8, 2005.Several Caribbean islands, including Barbados, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadine Islands, Grenada, and Tobago, have been issued hurricane warnings. Dominica, Trinidad, and parts of the Dominican Republic and Haiti are under a tropical storm watch. Authorities and residents in the affected areas are making preparations for the storm's arrival, with Tobago opening shelters, closing schools for Monday, and canceling elective surgeries in hospitals.The NHC has warned that the hurricane is expected to bring 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm) of rain across Barbados and the Windward Islands throughout Monday, potentially causing flash flooding in vulnerable areas. Large, dangerous swells are also anticipated to impact the southern coasts of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola.The hurricane warning also caused uncertainty regarding the return plans of the Indian cricket team who were there for the World Cup final. The severe weather alert has disrupted the scheduled itinerary, with the BCCI actively working on contingency plans to mitigate the potential impact of the hurricane on the return journey.Experts are cautioning that the Atlantic hurricane season in 2024 may be significantly more intense compared to typical years. ""Above-normal"" activity is anticipated, according to a late May forecast by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which projects 17 to 25 named storms throughout the season.This outlook aligns with predictions made earlier in the year by various institutions, including universities, private organizations, and government agencies. Typically, an average hurricane season sees around 14 named storms.The consensus among forecasters suggests that the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season could pose a greater threat than usual, with the potential for a higher number of storms developing and impacting coastal regions.","Hurricane Beryl is moving across the Atlantic Ocean towards the Caribbean's Windward Islands.

In 1955, more than 20 Asian and African countries attended the Bandung Conference"", Xi further recalled in his address.""The Five Principles have set a historic benchmark for international relations and international rule of law,"" he added.The Panchsheel pointers were first formally enunciated in the Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet region of China and India signed on April 29, 1954, according to the Ministry of External Affairs.The five principles formed part of the legacy of the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and his Chinese counterpart Zhou Enlai in their unsuccessful attempt to find a solution to the complicated boundary issue.Xi's advocacy comes as he begins an unprecedented third term as China's President. Under his tenure, China has actively promoted initiatives like the belt and road infrastructure investment scheme to enhance its global influence, though facing allegations of debt-trap diplomacy from some recipient nations.Confronting strategic rivalry with the US and Europe, Beijing has prioritized consolidating ties across Asia, Africa and Latin America under the ""Global South"" banner.",The Panchsheel pointers were first formally enunciated in the Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet region of China and India in 1954.

This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years, a Newsweek report said.Melania Trump's former friend, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff , weighed in on the evolving dynamics within the Trump family. Wolkoff, who has previously published a tell-all book about her time with the former first lady, described some of the recent claims about Melania and Ivanka's relationship as ""ridiculous."" Wolkoff's comments suggest that the public may not have the full picture of the intricate relationships within the Trump family.This development comes as Donald Trump faces various legal challenges, which have undoubtedly impacted the family's interactions. The former president's conviction in New York has led to increased media attention on his personal life, including his relationships with Melania and Ivanka.Historically, there have been reports of tension between Melania and Ivanka. Ivanka, who served as a senior advisor during Donald Trump's presidency, often took on a prominent role, leading to speculation about her influence and relationship with her stepmother. However, the current situation appears to show a thawing of relations between the two women, perhaps brought on by the pressures of their shared circumstances.Melania Trump has largely remained out of the public eye since leaving the White House, making few public statements and maintaining a low profile. Ivanka, on the other hand, has also stepped back from the political spotlight but continues to be a figure of interest due to her high-profile role during her father's administration.As the Trump family navigates these legal and personal challenges, the evolving relationships within the family continue to be a topic of public fascination. The reported improvement in Melania and Ivanka's relationship adds a new layer to the complex narrative of the Trump family's public and private lives.","A source close to the family noted that ""Melania and Ivanka are rumored to be getting along better since Donald Trump was convicted in New York"" This marks a significant shift in their relationship, which has been the subject of much speculation and public interest over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111292941,imgsize-10050,width-400,resizemode-4/111292941.jpg"

The National Assembly of Pakistan approved the government's finance bill for the upcoming fiscal year on Friday, which includes significant tax increases, the bill was passed ahead of further negotiations with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) regarding a new bailout package, as the country seeks to prevent a debt default amidst the slowest economic growth in South Asia.Despite facing strong opposition from rival political parties, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented the tax-heavy budget in parliament, which was subsequently endorsed by the ruling alliance under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq announced the bill's passage during a live television broadcast.The government has set an ambitious tax revenue target of 13 trillion rupees ($46.66 billion) for the fiscal year beginning July 1, representing a nearly 40% increase from the current year. This target was outlined in the national budget presented on July 12, which aimed to bolster Pakistan's case for a new IMF rescue package, with the country currently in discussions for a loan ranging from $6 billion to $8 billion.The tax increases include a 48% rise in direct taxes and a 35% increase in indirect taxes compared to the revised estimates for the current year. Non-tax revenue, such as petroleum levies, is expected to surge by an astonishing 64%. Textile and leather products, as well as mobile phones, will face an 18% tax, and there will be an increase in the tax on capital gains from real estate transactions. Workers will also be subject to higher direct taxes on their income.Pakistan has forecasted a significant reduction in its fiscal deficit for the new financial year, aiming for 5.9% of gross domestic product (GDP), down from an upwardly revised estimate of 7.4% for the current year. However, the central bank has cautioned about the potential inflationary impact of the budget, noting that limited progress in structural reforms to expand the tax base means that increased revenue must come from tax hikes.

Melting ice due to climate change unmasks Everest's hidden tragedies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/melting-ice-due-to-climate-change-unmasks-everests-hidden-tragedies/articleshow/111302957.cms,"The sacred slopes of Mount Everest are witnessing the effects of climate change as the snow and ice cover thins, exposing the bodies of hundreds of mountaineers who lost their lives pursuing their dream of reaching the world's highest peak. This year, a team of climbers and military personnel embarked on a mission not to summit the 8,849-metre (29,032-foot) mountain, but to retrieve some of the corpses, risking their own lives in the process.As part of Nepal's mountain clean-up campaign on Everest, Lhotse, and Nuptse, the team successfully recovered five frozen bodies, including one that was reduced to skeletal remains.The task was arduous, dangerous, and emotionally challenging.Rescuers spent hours chipping away at the ice with axes and sometimes using boiling water to release the bodies from the frozen grip. Major Aditya Karki, who led the team, said, ""Because of the effects of global warming , (the bodies and trash) are becoming more visible as the snow cover thins.""Over 300 people have died on Everest since expeditions began in the 1920s, with eight fatalities in this season alone. Many bodies remain on the mountain, some hidden by snow or lost in deep crevasses, while others have become landmarks along the route to the summit, earning nicknames such as ""Green Boots"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"".The presence of these bodies can have a psychological impact on climbers, as they believe they are entering a sacred space.Retrieving bodies from the ""death zone,"" where thin air and low oxygen levels increase the risk of altitude sickness, is a controversial and challenging task. It requires significant financial resources, with each body requiring up to eight rescuers and weighing over 100 kilograms (220 pounds).However, Major Karki emphasised the necessity of the rescue effort, saying, ""We have to bring them back as much as possible. If we keep leaving them behind, our mountains will turn into a graveyard.""The retrieved bodies, once brought down from the mountain, are transported to Kathmandu. Two of the bodies have been preliminarily identified, and authorities are awaiting detailed tests for final confirmation. Those that remain unidentified will likely be cremated.Despite the recovery efforts, the mountain still holds its secrets. The body of British climber George Mallory, who went missing during a 1924 summit attempt, was only discovered in 1999. His climbing partner, Andrew Irvine, and their camera, which could provide evidence of a successful summit and rewrite mountaineering history, have never been found.In addition to the body retrieval mission, the clean-up campaign, with a budget of over $600,000, employed 171 Nepali guides and porters to remove 11 tonnes of rubbish from the mountain.The well-trodden route to the summit is littered with fluorescent tents, discarded climbing equipment, empty gas canisters, and even human excreta. While current expeditions are under pressure to remove their waste, historic rubbish remains a challenge.As Tshiring Jangbu Sherpa, who led the body retrieval expedition, said, ""The mountains have given us mountaineers so many opportunities. I feel that we have to give back to them, we have to remove the trash and bodies to clean the mountains.""","Mount Everest is witnessing the effects of climate change as the snow and ice cover thins.

In those incidents, 14 people have lost their lives, 8 were due to landslides, 5 due to lightning, and 1 in flooding. 2 people are still unaccounted for in the incident of landslide while 10 people have sustained injuries,"" Dijan Bhattarai , spokesperson at the NDRMA told ANI over the phone.On Wednesday, a landslide claimed the lives of five people in Lamjung, two in Kaski, one in Okhaldhunga, and one death due to flooding, according to the home ministry.A total of 28 people have lost lives and 147 incidents have been recorded in the past 17 days (till June 26, 2024), since the beginning of the monsoon climatic effect in the Himalayan nation. As per the record from the home ministry, landslides have claimed 14 lives followed by 13 deaths due to the lightning in the same period of time.Nepal has a high mortality rate due to landslides and flooding during monsoons on an annual basis, because of the terrain and unplanned urbanization as well as settlement in the slopes prone to landslides.The monsoon season in the Himalayan nation usually starts on June 13 and ends on September 23. Last year, it began on June 14, which was one day later than the usual start date.Nepal is expecting the monsoon to formally arrive on June 13 and will remain active for approximately three months. Over time, the government has estimated that up to 1.8 million people could be affected by rain-related incidents during the season.According to a statement by the 28th Session of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum released on April 29, above-normal rainfall is expected during the monsoon season over most parts of South Asia. However, some areas over northern, eastern, and northeastern parts of the region may experience below-normal rainfall.Landslides triggered by heavy rains in Nepal cause extreme damage to life, property, infrastructure, and the environment.In Tarai, tens of thousands of people are affected by floods every year. In the hills, landslides are the main natural disaster occurring very frequently, mostly during monsoon.This year, South Asian meteorologists say, there is a strong agreement among the experts that La Nina conditions are likely to develop over the equatorial Pacific during the second half of the southwest monsoon season.It is also recognised that the La Nina conditions are generally associated with the normal to above-normal southwest monsoon rainfall over most parts of South Asia.(With inputs from agency)","Eight people have been killed by landslides, five due to lightning, and one due to floods.

The agreement marks a key step in the country's economic recovery after defaulting on debt repayment in 2022.Sri Lanka is under an International Monetary Fund bailout program, and the debt treatment deal is expected to reopen the doors to bilateral transactions and the resumption of foreign projects stalled when the island nation defaulted.""This morning in Paris, Sri Lanka reached a final agreement with our official bilateral creditors . Similarly, we signed another agreement with China's exim bank today in Beijing. ... Sri Lanka won,"" Wickremesinghe said.Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 and suspended repayments on some $83 billion in domestic and foreign loans amid a severe foreign exchange crisis that led to a severe shortage of essentials such as food, medicine, fuel and cooking gas, and hours-long power cuts.Sri Lanka's crisis was largely the result of staggering economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which along with 2019 terrorism attacks devastated its important tourism industry. The coronavirus crisis also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad.Additionally, the then-government slashed taxes in 2019, depleting the treasury just as the virus hit. Foreign exchange reserves plummeted, leaving Sri Lanka unable to pay for imports or defend its beleaguered currency, the rupee.Wickremesinghe said with these agreements, Sri Lanka will be able to defer all bilateral loan instalment payments until 2028. Furthermore, Sri Lanka will be able to repay all the loans on concessional terms, with an extended period until 2043.According to a previous president's office statement, the agreements would cover $10 billion, but further details on the mode of restructuring were not immediately announced.By 2022, Sri Lanka had to repay about $6 billion in foreign debt every year, amounting to about 9.2 per cent of gross domestic product. The agreement would enable Sri Lanka to maintain debt payments at less than 4.5 per cent of GDP between 2027 and 2032.As Wickremesinghe addressed the nation, his supporters the watched the speech on a giant screen in the capital Colombo and celebrated the announcement by lighting firecrackers and partaking traditional milk rice.The economic upheaval led to a political crisis that forced then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign in 2022. The Parliament then elected Wickremesinghe as president.Sri Lanka suspended repayment of its debt as it ran short of foreign currency needed to pay for imports of fuel and other essentials. Shortages led to street protests that changed the country's leadership. The IMF approved a four-year bailout program last March.The economic situation has improved under Wickremesinghe, and severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine have largely abated. But public dissatisfaction has grown over the government's effort to increase revenue by raising electricity bills and imposing heavy new income taxes on professionals and businesses, as part of the government's efforts to meet the IMF conditions.After Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy, all projects funded by foreign loans were also halted.On Wednesday, Wickremesinghe said the new agreements would pave the way to resume the foreign funded projects such as highways, light railway and airport development and also initiate new projects too.",Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 and suspended repayments on some $83 billion in domestic and foreign loans.

They write: ""Today, in Wakefield Prison , Maudsley is kept in confinement for twenty-three hours of the day.

It'd have been more humane to just put him down.""Levi and French also explored the various descriptions of the ""perspex cell"" provided by different contributors.
