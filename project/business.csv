BENGALURU: Researchers in India have developed a new way to generate truly random numbers using quantum computers, a breakthrough that could make digital security systems harder to crack.The work was done by scientists at the Raman Research Institute (RRI) in Bengaluru, working with colleagues from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and the University of Calgary. Their findings were published this year.Random numbers are vital for digital security. They protect bank accounts, encrypt messages, and secure online transactions. But regular computers cannot make truly random numbers. They follow set rules, which means their “random” numbers can theoretically be predicted.Quantum mechanics, however, is inherently random. The researchers found a way to harness this randomness using quantum computers.Previous methods for generating certified random numbers required complex laboratory setups with multiple particles separated over long distances. The Indian team simplified this. They used just one qubit—the basic unit of a quantum computer—and measured it at different times rather than separating particles in space.This approach worked on IBM’s quantum computer, which is available through the cloud. Anyone with internet access could potentially use it.The research builds on work the team started in 2022. That year, they proved quantum mechanics was correct by testing how single particles of light behaved over time. They closed all possible loopholes in their experiment, making their results conclusive.In 2024, they built a quantum random number generator that produced nearly 1 million certified random bits. Now, in 2025, they have shown the same process works on commercial quantum computers, not just in specialised laboratories.“The trilogy advances one idea across three frontiers—rigorous foundational validation, practical certification of randomness, and deployment—culminating in certified randomness running on quantum computers in the cloud,” Prof Urbasi Sinha, who heads the Quantum Information and Computing (QuIC) lab at RRI, said.The simplicity of the new method is its main advantage. Current quantum computers are small and prone to errors, but they can still generate certified random numbers using this technique.This matters for cryptography, where security depends on digital keys being completely unguessable. The new method makes such systems more practical to implement. It also helps test how well individual qubits in quantum computers are working, providing a way to check the quality of quantum hardware.RRI is funded by India's department of science and technology. The work shows quantum computers can do more than solve specialised mathematical problems. They can now provide practical tools for secure communications.","Researchers in India have developed a new way to generate truly random numbers using quantum computers.

National Medical Commission still to act on junketeering doctors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/national-medical-commission-still-to-act-on-junketeering-doctors/articleshow/124300408.cms,"Representative photo

National Medical Commission (NMC) is yet to act against 30 doctors found guilty of accepting a foreign trip funded by pharma company AbbVie as the matter is still “under consideration”. An audit committee of the department of pharmaceuticals had in Dec last year found them guilty, and their names were sent in July to the commission for action.New chairperson of NMC, Dr Abhijat Sheth, confirmed to TOI that matters pending before the Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) could not be taken up. Four out of five posts in the board, including that of its president, are vacant.Speaking to TOI, Sheth said NMC was considering constituting a temporary board of NMC members to take up matters pending before EMRB. “Since this (the charge against 30 doctors) is a serious matter, it will be taken up as soon as possible,” he said. “Govt has reassured us that the vacant posts will be filled up soon. Until then, there is little we can do. We are aware that a lot of matters are pending,” said Sheth, who added he was out of the country and would be back by Oct 12.Of the four autonomous boards in NMC, EMRB, which deals with regulation of the medical profession, has only one part-time member, Dr Surinder Pal Singh, from Punjab Medical Council, who was appointed in July.Many of the posts have been vacant for more than one year though the NMC Act stipulates that three months before the end of a member’s tenure, the matter must be referred to a search committee for filling up the vacancy. NMC had issued a circular inviting applicants for the vacant posts in 2023 and again in Aug 2024.The list of 30 doctors has not been made public by the department of pharmaceuticals though its audit committee and later apex committee had found them guilty of accepting foreign vacations to Monaco and Paris funded by AbbVie. Despite the apex committee stating in Dec 2024 that NMC should be requested to take action against the guilty doctors, the department had failed to forward the names of the doctors to NMC till July.","NMC yet to act against 30 doctors found guilty of accepting foreign trip funded by AbbVie.

Poll Do you agree with the Delhi high court's ruling on personal use of luxury items? Agree Disagree





NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court recently clarified that a single Rolex watch cannot be deemed a commercial quantity and allowed the redemption of the detained item, while emphasising caution in future adjudications.A division bench of Justices Pratibha M Singh and Sahil Jain was hearing a petition challenging an order passed by the office of the Commissioner of Customs, IGI Airport , New Delhi, regarding the detention and proposed confiscation of a Rolex watch belonging to a Dubai resident.The bench observed that while the order by the Customs Commissioner correctly allowed redemption of the detained goods, it erred in concluding that a single Rolex watch constituted a commercial quantity.The court said, “Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity, and there is no reason why the same cannot be kept for personal use.”The petitioner, a Dubai resident, had travelled to India and, upon arrival at the airport, his single Rolex watch was detained for alleged non-declaration.He approached the high court, challenging the order—particularly the classification of a single watch as a commercial quantity—and sought clarity on the redemption procedure.Counsel for the petitioner argued that a single Rolex watch could not be considered a commercial quantity and could legitimately be kept for personal use.The petitioner requested the court to allow redemption without dispute over the personal use claim, while upholding the payment of the previously imposed redemption fine.Highlighting the need for careful adjudication, the court allowed the petition, directing the petitioner to pay the redemption fine by October 31 and redeem the detained Rolex watch in accordance with the original order.","The Delhi high court recently clarified that a single Rolex watch cannot be deemed a commercial quantity.

Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad among top biz destinations



Room boom

Faith rules, and so does Rishikesh when it comes to remaining the priciest desi destination in terms of average hotel room rates. Though business travel gathered steam last fiscal — Mumbai and Delhi knocked off Srinagar and Udaipur from the second and third spots — leisure was the buzz, with 10 out of top 15 on the list being non-business destinations.Leading hospitality consulting firm Hotelivate’s recent report for 2024-25 shows the holy town in Uttarakhand on top of the pile for the second consecutive year, though its revenue per available room (RevPAR) declined marginally by about 4% to Rs 9,691 from Rs 10,086 in FY 24.The top 10 leisure destinations are: Rishikesh, Ranthambore, Udaipur, Srinagar, Goa, Varanasi, Jodhpur, Mussoorie, Lonavala and Agra. The five business destinations are Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Gurgaon and Bengaluru. “In recent years, rising demand for leisure destinations, particularly emerging ones with limited supply, has propelled these locations to the top of the country’s RevPAR (revenue per available room) rankings. The broader top 15 reflects similar trends: leisure markets like Coorg and Srinagar have dropped in rank due to the arrival of new, lower-tier hotels, whereas established urban markets such as Hyderabad, and Gurgaon have posted robust RevPAR growth,” says Hotelivate.Indian hospitality industry was on a roll last fiscal thanks to a booming economy and domestic travel, even as international inbound continues below pre-Covid 2019 levels. The report says India’s proposed supply crossed the 1 lakh-room mark for the first time in over a decade and the average room occupancy in April 2024-March 2025 “stood at 68.0%, the highest in recent memory and comfortably above the pre-pandemic levels. ”The fallout of the Pahalgam terror attack, including impact on commercial flights both in India and international ones due to prolonged airspace closures, did affect travel. The overall travel industry remains confident of coming out of that and continue their best post-Covid success story seen last fiscal. “Despite turbulence — economic slowdowns, geopolitical headwinds, and investor caution — India has kept its pace strong. Domestic demand has been powering the industry forward, even when international arrivals remained inconsistent.” While leisure “markets found a rhythm, posting records in performance” last fiscal, places like Goa are “showing signs of fatigue.”“Mumbai secured pole position yet again, leading the country in room revenue per key and ranking on the podium in all other key metrics. Bengaluru and New Delhi complete the top three by inventory.” Existing hotels outperformed on both occupancy and rate last fiscal, but their strength tends to get diluted when averaged with newer supply. Properties operational before March 2021 saw an occupancy of 71.9% versus the overall average of 68%. And their average daily rate was Rs 8,701 compared to nationwide ADR of Rs 8,432.The proposed supply pipeline “reflects a bold strategy introducing branded hotels into 177 new markets.” As of March 2025, the total branded pipeline, regardless of construction status, stands at 1,14,151 rooms.",Rishikesh remains the priciest desi destination in terms of average hotel room rates.

Who Cut the Fuel? Inside the Mystery of the Air India 171 Cockpit Audio

NEW DELHI: The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) has declined a request from the pilots’ body ALPA India to include its representative in the team probing the June 12 Air India crash that killed 260 people.“AAIB expressed its inability to include pilots from ALPA as subject matter experts in the team probing the Air India plane crash, citing government norms,” Airline Pilots Association (ALPA) India president Sam Thomas told PTI after the group’s representatives met AAIB DG GVG Yugandhar in the national capital.“There was not much discussion on the Air India plane crash due to the ongoing investigation. We have been given assurance that we would be invited for the quarterly meetings in the future,” Thomas added.ALPA India, an associate member of the global pilots’ body IFALPA, has been demanding that its representative be included in the probe into the aviation disaster that occurred in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. On Thursday, it said the meeting was meant to deliberate on its role as a “subject matter expert” in accident investigations.“ALPA India is optimistic of a positive outcome from this engagement, particularly with regard to participation as part of the investigation into the AI 171 crash.Such collaboration is expected to strengthen investigative processes by incorporating the critical perspective of pilots, thereby contributing to safer skies for all,” the body had stated.The Air India Boeing 787-8 operating flight AI 171 to London Gatwick crashed soon after takeoff from Ahmedabad, killing 260 people, including 241 passengers. In its preliminary report released on July 12, AAIB said, “Fuel supply to both engines of the plane was cut off within a gap of one second, causing confusion in the cockpit soon after take-off.”On September 22, the Supreme Court called the selective publication of the preliminary report—which outlined lapses on the part of pilots—a “media narrative” and described it as “unfortunate and irresponsible.”","The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) declined a request from the pilots’ body ALPA India to include its representative in the team probing the June 12 Air India crash.

Indulging in fraudulent land deals

NEW DELHI: Prashant Kishor , election strategist-turned-politician and the founder of Jan Suraaj Party, has triggered a political storm in poll-bound Bihar with his explosive corruption allegations against several state leaders. Interestingly, Prashant Kishor, who has often been accused by opposition parties of helping the BJP, has unleashed his tirade against the members of ruling NDA in the state. His targets till now include Bihar's deputy chief minister Samrat Choudhary, ministers Ashok Choudhary, Mangal Pandey and BJP MP Sanjay Jaiswal.The Jun Suraaj chief has levelled serious allegations against these leaders. The charges against BJP leader and deputy CM Samrat Choudhary include:Minister Ashok Choudhary, whom Prashant Kishor has called ""Bihar’s most corrupt leader"", has been accused of:The leaders in question have denied the charges, but Prashant Kishor has claimed he has papers to prove his allegations against them. The BJP's Bihar unit launched a counter-offensive against Prashant Kishor describing his Jan Suraaj party as ""a political startup based on fraud"". The state BJP has accused PK of raising ""hundreds of crores of rupees"" through ""shell companies"".BJP's state media in-charge Danish Iqbal accused Kishor with indirectly helping the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan and asked, ""Why is his party is still receiving funds from states ruled by INDIA bloc parties which had sought his professional help during elections.""""More than Rs 370 crore have come from West Bengal where he had worked for Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress in 2021 assembly polls. Besides, Kishor is getting huge funds from states like Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka,"" he alleged.Responding to these charges, Prashant Kishor has dared the NDA leaders to unleash investigative agencies against him. ""The Union home minister and the Prime Minister are from the BJP, let them send investigative agencies to probe charges against me,"" the Jan Suraaj chief said. The Jan Suraaj chief also shared details of his finances to counter funding charges against him and his party.Interestingly, the top BJP leadership has maintained a silence on Prashant Kishor's allegations. Political analyst NK Choudhary feels that the BJP does not want to give credence to PK's allegations by opening a front against him.""For the BJP, the principal opponent in the state as of now remains Lalu and his party the RJD, so they are focussed in their attacks on them. Prashant Kishor has managed to gain a lot of traction, support and also media attention but he is still far away from emerging as the principal challenger to the BJP politically. Any counter action or reaction to Prashant Kishor now would give credence to his allegations and that is perhaps why the top BJP leadership is not reacting to his campaign,"" NK Choudhary says.However, he has a word of caution for the BJP insofar Prashant Kishor's attacks against Nitish Kumar are concerned. ""Nitish Kumar remains the best bet for BJP in Bihar. The electoral gains that NDA makes in Bihar is courtesy the strong image of Prime Minister Modi and the popularity of chief minister Nitish Kumar. If any campaign weakens the chief minister, the NDA as a whole may suffer electorally.""Now, this could be a tricky proposition for the BJP leadership, which may want its own chief minister in the state after playing second fiddle to Nitish Kumar for nearly two decades. In the 2020 elections, the saffron party for the first time became the senior partner in the state alliance winning 75 seats. But the BJP allowed Nitish Kumar, whose party was reduced to 45 seats in the assembly, to continue as the chief minister.However, that may change this time around if the BJP manages to repeat or better its performance. As the NDA partners gear up for the upcoming assembly elections, the top BJP leadership has been reluctant to announce that the next government will be formed under Nitish Kumar. For now, the BJP leaders say that they will contest the elections under Nitish Kumar, which is quite natural as the JDU chief is the chief minister of the coalition government.By levelling corruption allegations against Ashok Choudhary, who is viewed as the right-hand man of Nitish Kumar, Prashant Kishor may be actually piling pressure on the chief minister, who anyway is battling reports of his ill health. Nitish, whose clean image has always stood him in good stead electorally, stands to suffer if a leader of his party and who is perceived very close to him is accused of corruption.Little wonder, the JD(U) immediately swung into action to defend Nitish Kumar. “Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has redefined politics with his honesty and integrity throughout his 20-year tenure. No one has been born who can prove even a single allegation of corruption against him. Those who have been accused of graft should respond. Nitish Kumar is equal to 'Zero Tolerance',” JD(U) chief spokesperson Neeraj Kumar posted on social media a day after after Kishor levelled allegations against Ashok Choudhary.The Jan Suraaj Party has dropped enough hints that it will take these allegations to their logical conclusion. It has submitted a memorandum to the Bihar governor seeking the removal of Samrat Choudhary. Party's national president Uday Singh and Bihar unit chief Manoj Bharti said they have also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who claims to be a firm believer in probity in public life. ""We have no hopes from the Nitish Kumar government in the state. If no action is taken by the PM or the Governor, we will move the court as a last resort,"" the Jan Suraaj Party leaders have warned.Clearly, Prashant Kishor has made the Bihar elections interesting by highlighting corruption cases against leaders of the ruling combine. There is a strong possibility that in the run up to elections, he could be targeting more leaders, perhaps from the Mahagathbandhan also. So, the suspense over who is next in his line of fire is unlikely to end anytime soon.(With inputs from agencies)","Prashant Kishor, the founder of Jan Suraaj Party, has triggered a political storm in poll-bound Bihar.

Rs 23k crore lost in 2024

Poll Have you or someone you know ever fallen victim to online investment fraud? Yes No

Some transactions layered via ‘fake import of services’

NEW DELHI: Its promoters are based in Russia, technical support in Georgia, its India operations are handled from Dubai and the servers are in Barcelona.Illegal online trading platform OctaFX, which is being investigated by ED for laundering thousands of crores of rupees from India to tax havens over the past few years, has become part of a unique study by the agency into transcontinental operations that convert proceeds of crime into cryptocurrencies and use services of international payment gateways.A multi-agency probe has revealed that OctaFX, which deals in forex, commodities and cryptocurrencies and is incorporated in Cyprus, made Rs 800 crore of alleged proceeds of crime from its India operations in just nine months.Some of the transactions were layered through “fake import of services” from Singapore to launder duped funds generated in India.In a particular case, ED has attached Rs 172 crore worth of assets in India and abroad, including a yacht, a villa in Spain, Rs 36 crore in banks, 39,000 cryptocurrency (USDT), land and Demat holdings of Rs 80 crore.OctaFX, being investigated by the ED’s Mumbai zonal unit, is not the only illegal online platform indulging in investment frauds. The others under probe include Power Bank, being investigated by the Bengaluru zonal unit; Angel One, TM Traders and Vivan Li, being investigated by the Kolkata zonal unit; and Zara FX, being investigated by the Kochi unit. The ED’s cases are based on several FIRs registered by police in different cities.“Cyber frauds in the name of cryptocurrency included Birfa IT and related firms acting as brokers, converting huge amounts of money to and from crypto to help clients send money to China for under-invoiced imports, laundering the PoC (proceeds of crime) through cryptocurrency,” the ED study revealed. The probe further found that in the Birfa case “remittances of Rs 4,818 crore were sent to Hong Kong and Canadian entities controlled by scammers, under the pretext of paying for leasing servers, escrow services, etc” on fake invoices.The ED document estimated that Indians have lost more than Rs 22,800 crore in around 36.4 lakh financial frauds reported in 2024 — a more than 206% jump in estimated losses from Rs 7,465 crore in 2023 and an over 50% jump in number of cases from 24.4 lakh in that year.Investigation against a similar cyber investment fraud found that the masterminds, operating from Laos, Hong Kong and Thailand, hired agents in India to set up shell entities using forged documents and issued fake IPO allotments, stock market investments and indulged in fake digital arrests.PoC was collected in shell companies, converted into cryptocurrencies and remitted overseas as payment for fake “import of services”.While international payment gateways act as intermediaries for many of these illegal transactions, a part of the booty is laundered using hawala channels. In some cases, Enforcement Directorate has found PoC are brought back to India “disguised as legitimate investments” into stock markets.",Illegal online trading platform OctaFX is being investigated by ED for laundering thousands of crores of rupees from India to tax havens.

'Not cantaminated'

No contamination found in 9 of 19 cough syrups: Govt

Rajasthan halts supply of all 19 Kaysans meds

BHOPAL/JAIPUR: Alarm bells are ringing over the deaths of 12 children in MP and Rajasthan following complications after use of cough syrups, prompting the Centre to issue an advisory on Friday against prescribing cold and cough medications to children aged below 2.The advisory to all states and UTs by Directorate General of Health Services came even as the Union health ministry claimed that none of samples picked up from MP contained diethylene glycol or ethylene glycol — toxins known to cause severe kidney damage. The samples were collected after there were reports linking the deaths of children from renal failure to consumption of contaminated cough syrups.With the Centre ruling out contamination in the cough syrup samples from MP, the mystery over the cause of kidney failure in children continues. Nine children have died in Chhindwara district over a month, while five are undergoing specialised treatment in Nagpur in neighbouring Maharashtra, said district collector Harendra Narayan Singh.Following deaths of children who consumend cough syrups, Union health ministry claimed that none of samples picked up from MP contained diethylene glycol or ethylene glycol — toxins known to cause severe kidney damage.The suspected link between the deaths and cough syrup had earlier prompted the district administration to impose a ban on two brands as a precaution. Dr Sanjay Mishra, joint director, health services, told TOI that the stock with a Jabalpur distributor, who was supplying the suspected cough syrups, had been sealed.State officials said lab tests of nine out of 19 samples, collected by ICMR and state teams, have shown no signs of contamination, but the report of 10 samples, which include two medicines whose sale has been prohibited for now in Chhindwara, are yet to be received. Authorities are awaiting detailed forensic and biochemical analysis before reaching a final conclusion.The cases, first reported in late Aug, were largely concentrated in Parasia and surrounding villages in the district. Children, mostly under the age of five, initially showed symptoms of cold and mild fever. They were administered cough syrup along with routine medicines. Within days, their condition worsened with reduced urine output and subsequent kidney-related complications.In Rajasthan, three deaths have been reported in the past one week, with many other children developing complications after taking a cough syrup distributed under the state govt’s free medicine scheme. The state health department denies the deaths were linked to the dextromethorphan-based formulation, even though it has banned the syrup’s distribution/sale pending test results and a formal investigation by a three-member committee.While a five-year-old boy died in Sikar district on Sept 29 after his condition deteriorated upon taking the cough syrup, another death was reported from Bharatpur. At least five other children in the two districts also reported similar symptoms — vomiting, drowsiness, anxiety, dizziness, restlessness and unconsciousness.The third case has been reported from Weir town in Bharatpur district, where a two-and-a-half-year-old died on Sep 27 at Jaipur’s JK Lone Hospital. He had been prescribed Amodroxol cough syrup.While the family alleges that their child died after consuming the cough syrup, a fact-finding report by Bharatpur’s chief medical officer says the boy had a previous history of febrile seizures — a convulsive event that accompanies fever and viral infections in children aged between 6 months and five years.The health department is also investigating reports of at children in Banswara reporting complications after consuming cough syrup, between Sept 16 and Sept 30.Since 2012, a total of 10,119 samples of medicines manufactured by Jaipur-based Kaysans Pharma, which supplied the dextromethorphan-based cough syrup that has been blamed for three deaths, have been subjected to quality test, of which 42 have been found to be sub-standard, Rajasthan Medical Services Corporation Limited’s managing director Pukhraj Sen revealed on Friday.As a precaution, the state health department has stopped the supply of all 19 types of medicines being provided by this company until further orders.",12 children have died in MP and Rajasthan following complications after use of cough syrups. Centre issues advisory against prescribing cold and cough medications to children aged below 2.

Undertrails as % of total inmates

Occupancy & duration of stay

Around three-fourth of all prison inmates in India in 2023 were undertrials, according to the latest report released by NCRB. The numbers are staggering: India has 5.3 lakh people in jail; of them, 3.9 lakh are yet to be convicted — they are on trial.But this is actually an improvement over the previous years. The percentage of incarcerated undertrials in 2021 was 77%. This fell to 76% in 2022, and then to 74% in 2023.Of these undertrials, 150 died while in jail; 64% of them were suicides.The share of undertrials in jail keeps fluctuating, but an analysis of the data for the past 25 years shows it has never dropped below 65%. Several studies have suggested that delays in investigation, shortage of judges, and lack of access to legal aid because of poverty are the main reasons why undertrials end up spending a long time in prisons. There are 3.6 crore pending criminal cases in district courts, 17.5 lakh cases in high courts and 14,667 cases in the Supreme Court.In answer to a Parliament question last Feb, it was revealed that the judge-to-population ratio in India is estimated at 21 judges per million population, which is less than half of what the Law Commission recommended in its 120th report.With so many undertrials in jail, our prisons have also become overcrowded. Although the occupancy rate has improved from 131% in 2022 to 121% in 2023, jails have more inmates than their sanctioned capacity and this has been the case for the past 25 years. Twenty years ago, the situation was even worse as the occupancy rate had touched 145% in 2005. Since then, jails have been equipped to handle 1.9 lakh more prisoners, but that has clearly not been enough.","India has 5.3 lakh people in jail; of them, 3.9 lakh are yet to be convicted.

JAIPUR: Rajasthan HC Thursday ordered the commercial taxes department to release within seven days the full salary and arrears of one of its officers who has been without pay for over a year since slipping into a coma in Aug 2023.HC passed the order after hearing a plea by the officer’s wife. The petitioner’s counsel said the officer, Surendra Singh Chawra from Bhilwara, had been appointed to the department in 2006. He went on to become an assistant commercial tax officer, Pratapgarh circle, after several promotions.“On Aug 7, 2023, he suffered a brain haemorrhage and underwent surgery. He slipped into a coma soon after and remains in that state to this day,” the petitioner’s counsel told HC. The department paid Chawra’s salary for a year after the mishap, until Aug 2024, against pending leaves and other administrative entitlements. Following this, the salary was stopped, and he was classified as “on leave without pay”, the counsel added.Chawra was the sole breadwinner of his family, which included his wife, two kids, and parents, the counsel told HC. Concerned about the family’ plight, a single-judge bench of Justice Ravi Chiraniya told the dept to clear any administrative hurdles in the process of releasing Chawra’s salary.“If one month’s salary is not paid, the whole family suffers adversely. In this case, the employee is in a coma, and the family also faces heavy medical expenses. How will they survive in such circumstances?” the judge asked. “...Since Diwali is ahead, ensure outstanding payment in this case in next 7 days”, the HC order read.","HC passed the order after hearing a plea by the officer’s wife.

MUMBAI: Bombay HC dismissed Friday a writ petition filed by Anil Ambani against SBI, challenging its decision to classify the loan account of Reliance Communications as “fraud”.

He said that SBI’s action was arbitrary and in violation of all known canons of fairness and transparency by not providing copies of documents the bank was relying on.Ambani’s plea named RBI as respondent too.A division bench of justices Revati Mohite Dere and Neela Gokhale orally said the petition lacked merit and dismissed it. The detailed order would be uploaded later.Ambani may now approach Supreme Court.A spokesperson for Ambani said: “We are awaiting the order. Once we have reviewed it, we will evaluate the next course of action, as legally advised.”For Ambani, senior counsel Darius Khambata argued that in response to the bank’s showcause notice dated Dec 20, 2023, the bank sent an incomplete report.SBI said it issued notices to RCom and Ambani to make submissions in writing in 15 days as to why the account and name should not be categorised and reported as “fraud”.Its reply in HC said it received no explanation.In July, in a separate petition filed by Ambani against public sector lender Canara Bank over similar action, the bank informed HC of the withdrawal of its order.","Anil Ambani’s petition lacks merit, says bench, dismisses it.

'Put Swadeshi Boards Outside Shops': PM Modi's Local Push As More US Tariffs Loom | Ahmedabad

NEW DELHI: The NCERT has rolled out special classroom modules on ‘swadeshi’, tracing its roots from 1905 anti-partition agitation in Bengal to PM Narendra Modi ’s call for a self-reliant India.The publications, ‘Swadeshi: Vocal for Local’ (for middle stage) and ‘Swadeshi: For a Self-Reliant India’ (for secondary stage), revisits the historic movement that urged Indians to shun imported British goods and connects it with govt’s contemporary programmes such as ‘Make-in-India’, ‘Startup India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Vocal for Local’, & ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.The modules cite the PM’s Independence Day address this year, where he described ‘self-reliant Bharat’ as the bedrock of a developed India. They also include his recent interactions with national awardee teachers, where he quipped that while teachers usually assign homework to students, he wished to reverse roles and give teachers “one homework” — to mobilise campaigns with students promoting ‘swadeshi’ products, in line with ‘Make-in-India’ and ‘Vocal for Local’.“The ‘Swadeshi’ movement began during India’s freedom struggle when the British divided Bengal in 1905... ‘Swadeshi’ was not just about boycott but also about creating Indian alternatives such as Bengal Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works (1901, Prafulla Chandra Ray) and Tata Iron and Steel Company (1907, Jamsetji Tata),” one module explains.“In 1905, it gave strength to fight colonial exploitation. In 2025, it guides us towards ‘Atmanirbharta’ in a globalised, technology-driven world,” the modules notes, urging research-driven innovation and robust domestic industries in semiconductors, renewable energy, agriculture and AI. Significantly, the texts also introduce a contemporary twist by placing AI at the heart of modern ‘swadeshi’.NCERT underscores that ‘swadeshi’ today is not just a relic of history but a framework for navigating global uncertainties and positioning India as a leading economy.",NCERT rolls out special classroom modules on ‘swadeshi’ tracing its roots from 1905 anti-partition agitation in Bengal to PM Narendra Modi’s call for a self- reliant India. ‘Swadeshi: Vocal for Local’ (for middle stage) and ‘ swadeshi for a Self-Reliant India' (for secondary stage) revisit historic movement that urged Indians to shun imported British goods.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124298274,imgsize-19298,width-400,resizemode-4/books.jpg"

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Reveals How India Thwarted Pakistan’s Attempt During Op Sindoor

Our fight against terror continues: Min

NEW DELHI: Warning Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region, defence minister Rajnath Singh Thursday said this shows its “true intentions”. Any misadventure by the neighbour would result in a response “so strong it will change both history and geography” of the area, he warned.“In 1965 (war), Indian Army showed courage by reaching Lahore. In 2025, Pakistan must remember that the road to Karachi also passes through the Creek,” Singh said after performing shastra (arms) puja at Bhuj military station in Gujarat.The marshlands of Sir Creek, a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Rann of Kutch and Pakistan’s Sindh, have been a bone of contention between the neighbours due to differing interpretations of the maritime boundary in the region. The long-standing dispute has implications for access to fishing rights and potential natural resources like oil and gas in the region and affects drawing of maritime boundaries and EEZs in Arabian Sea.Talking about the intense cross-border hostilities under Operation Sindoor from May 7 to 10, Rajnath said Pakistan made failed attempts to penetrate India’s defences along the LoCand International Border stretching from Leh to the Sir Creek region by launching multiple waves of drones and some missiles.The Indian response “exposed the weaknesses of Pakistan’s air defence”, Rajnath said. Despite its superior capability, India showed restraint because its military action was targeted against terrorism and its training hubs.“The objective of Operation Sindoor was not to escalate and start a war. I am happy that the Indian armed forces successfully achieved all the military objectives of Operation Sindoor.However, our fight against terrorismcontinues,” he said.","Rajnath Singh warns Pakistan about its recent military infrastructure build-up near the sensitive Sir Creek region.

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has made history as the first person ever to surpass a net worth of $500 billion, highlighting his unrivaled influence in the global technology and business arena. This unprecedented milestone is driven largely by the soaring value of Tesla, his electric vehicle company, whose shares have surged due to strong sales, innovation, and investor confidence. Beyond Tesla, Musk’s wealth is bolstered by his space exploration venture SpaceX, which continues to secure contracts and expand its satellite operations, and his artificial intelligence startup xAI, which is gaining traction in the AI sector. Musk’s diversified portfolio, visionary leadership, and relentless focus on technological breakthroughs have positioned him as the world’s richest individual, reshaping industries along the way.On Wednesday afternoon, Forbes reported that Musk’s net worth briefly reached $500.1 billion before settling slightly above $499 billion later in the day. This exceptional wealth cements Musk’s position as the world’s richest person, significantly ahead of his closest competitors in the technology sector.The billionaire’s wealth is closely tied to his 12%+ stake in Tesla, which has experienced a remarkable surge in stock value over the past year. Tesla shares were up more than 3.3% at the end of trading on Wednesday and have risen over 20% year-to-date, reflecting growing investor confidence in Musk’s leadership and strategic vision. While Tesla remains the cornerstone of Musk’s fortune, his other ventures have contributed substantially to his net worth. The space exploration company SpaceX has seen increased valuation due to ongoing satellite and launch contracts, while his AI-focused startup, xAI, has gained attention in the tech world for cutting-edge developments.Recent months have also seen Musk redirecting his focus toward business rather than politics, a move that investors have welcomed. This strategic pivot is seen as a key factor behind Tesla’s stock gains and the corresponding growth of his personal wealth.According to Forbes’ billionaires index, Oracle founder Larry Ellison holds the second spot globally with a fortune of roughly $350.7 billion. Ellison briefly overtook Musk last month after Oracle shares jumped more than 40%, driven by positive forecasts for its cloud infrastructure, AI initiatives, and enterprise software growth.Despite occasional competition from rivals, Musk’s diversified portfolio, including Tesla, SpaceX, and other innovative ventures, and his leadership across multiple high-growth sectors have reinforced his long-term wealth trajectory, placing him comfortably ahead in the billionaire rankings and maintaining his influence in global business and technology markets.Musk’s influence at Tesla is now more pronounced than ever. In September 2025, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm highlighted that Musk is “front and centre” in guiding the company’s strategy.Tesla’s board has also approved a potential pay package exceeding $1 trillion for Musk, contingent upon achieving highly ambitious targets over the next decade. These goals include boosting Tesla’s valuation eightfold, selling one million AI robots, delivering 12 million additional Tesla cars, and reaching several other business milestones.Musk’s recent $1 billion purchase of Tesla shares has been interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the company’s future prospects.Tesla has faced multiple challenges in recent years, including intensified competition from global electric vehicle makers such as China’s BYD. However, Musk continues to diversify Tesla’s portfolio, transitioning the company into AI and robotics, and expanding into digital currencies and other emerging technologies.Musk is also known for his outspoken views on social and political issues, including immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. While he faced criticism earlier this year over his involvement with the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), he has consistently emphasized that his business pursuits are driven by societal and technological impact rather than personal profit.Musk’s relentless work ethic and focus on transformative projects have become hallmarks of his career. As Tesla investor Ross Gerber notes, “Elon only involves himself with things he believes are important for society or humanity,” a principle that underscores his broader mission beyond financial gain. By combining innovation across electric vehicles, space exploration, AI, and digital technologies, Musk has not only become the first half-trillionaire but has also reshaped the global technology landscape, inspiring entrepreneurs worldwide.","Elon Musk is the first person ever to surpass a net worth of $500 billion.

Microsoft frees up CEO Satya Nadella from some duties; read Nadella's email to employees company-wide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-frees-up-ceo-satya-nadella-from-some-duties-read-nadellas-email-to-employees-company-wide/articleshow/124272687.cms,"Google Photos AI Update: Hands-Free Photo Editing

Here's CEO Satya Nadella's email to Microsoft employees on the restructuring:

We are in the midst of a tectonic AI platform shift, one that requires us to both manage and grow our at-scale commercial business today, while building the new frontier and executing flawlessly across both.

An image of Judson Althoff, chief executive officer of the commercial business at Microsoft.

History shows that general purpose technologies like AI drive step changes in productivity and GDP growth, and we have a unique opportunity to help our customers and the world realize this promise.

Our success depends on enabling commercial and public sector customers and partners to combine their human capital with new AI capabilities to change the frontier of how they operate. To accelerate this, we will increasingly need to bring together sales, marketing, operations, and engineering to drive growth and strengthen our position as the partner of choice for AI transformation.

With this context, I have asked Judson Althoff to take on an expanded role as CEO of our commercial business. Over the past nine years, Judson has led our global sales organization and was the architect behind designing and building Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) into what it is today: the “number one seed” in the industry and our company’s most important growth engine.

Takeshi Numoto and his marketing team will join this new organization, with Takeshi reporting directly to Judson as CMO, while also continuing to report directly to me on all-up business models, planning, consumer marketing, and corporate brand and communications.

Our operations organization will also move to report to Judson. By bringing operations into the commercial business, we can tighten the feedback loop between what customers need and how we deliver and support them. Carolina Dybeck Happe will continue to report to me, as she works on our overall company transformation and continues to closely partner with Judson.

Additionally, Judson will lead a new commercial leadership team that brings together leaders from engineering, sales, marketing, operations, and finance to drive our product strategy and governance, GTM readiness, and sales motions with shared accountability for the rigor and executional excellence our customers expect.

This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work—across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation—to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift. Each one of us needs to be at our very best in terms of rapidly learning new skills, adopting new ways to work, and staying close to the metal to drive innovation across the entire stack!!

This isn’t just evolution, it’s reinvention, for each of us professionally and for Microsoft.

Satya

How Pavel Durov became Dubai's richest





In a country where royal families and oil tycoons dominate the wealth landscape, the richest man in Dubai is a tech billionaire. Meet Telegram CEO Pavel Durov who is the richest man in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with a net worth of over $17 billion, according to Forbes Billionaires list. Durov is followed by Hussain Sajwani – chairman of Dubai-based luxury real estate developer Damac Properties, with a net worth of $10.2 billion. Globally, Pavel Durov ranks at number 118 in the Forbes global list. His rise reflects not only the global reach of his messaging app but also Dubai’s growing status as a hub for technology and innovation.Born in St. Petersburg in 1984, Pavel Durov is often referred to as “Mark Zuckerberg of Russia”. Durov first made his name by co-founding VKontakte, Russia’s largest social network. But after clashes with authorities, he sold his stake and left the country in 2014. That same year, he shifted focus to Telegram, which has since exploded into a global platform with over 1 billion monthly active users worldwide.Durov left Russia after refusing to cooperate with the secret service and provide encrypted data of his first social network's users.Telegram was banned in Russia from 2018 to 2021.In 2018 Pavel, with his brother Nikolai, raised $1.7 billion from investors to create TON, a blockchain system; it was shut down after the SEC banned it.Pavel Durov became a French citizen in 2021 but lives in Dubai. As per information available on Forbes billionaires website, he has five children that he shares with two ex-girlfriends. In the past, Durov has claimed to have donated sperm that led to him fathering 100 children.Durov relocated to Dubai, where Telegram is now headquartered. He later acquired UAE citizenship in February 2021.Relocating to Dubai gave Durov not only a strategic base for expansion but also UAE citizenship, placing him in a unique spot among the country’s wealthiest. Though Telegram app remains free to use, Durov introduced Telegram Premium in 2022, offering paid features to power users. This, combined with the platform’s high valuation, cemented his billionaire status.","Pavel Durov is the richest man in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with a net worth of over $17 billion, according to Forbes Billionaires list.

Jensen Huang says high costs risk driving talent and investment overseas

'Brightest minds' essential to America's future argues Huang







Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has welcomed President Donald Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program but warned that the new $100,000 application fee may be prohibitively expensive, potentially driving tech investment and talent away from the United States.Speaking on the ""BG2 Pod"" podcast published Friday, Huang described the policy changes as ""a great start"" that addresses illegal immigration and visa system abuse. However, he cautioned that the steep fee ""probably sets the bar a little too high"" and could make foreign students uncomfortable about pursuing opportunities in America.The Taiwan-born executive, who has frequently cited his own experience as an embodiment of the American dream, emphasised that talent inflow serves as a key performance indicator for the country's future success. ""Smart people's desire to come to America and smart students' desire to stay, those are what I would call KPIs,"" Huang said on the podcast.Huang agreed with tech investor and podcaster Brad Gerstner that the substantial fee tilts the playing field toward large technology companies that can easily afford visa sponsorships, placing startups at a competitive disadvantage. He warned that the policy could prompt increased investment outside the US and affect global talent flows.The Nvidia chief also addressed concerns about Chinese researchers, separating America's competition with China as a nation from policies affecting Chinese individuals. ""We need to make sure that that slippery slope isn't crossed,"" he said.In a separate CNBC interview Monday, Huang reinforced his position on immigration reform. ""We want all the brightest minds to come to the United States. Remember immigration is the foundation of the American dream, and we represent the American dream,"" he told CNBC, expressing support for Trump's efforts to address the immigration system.Nvidia employed 1,519 H-1B visa holders out of 36,000 employees worldwide at the end of fiscal year 2025, making it one of the largest tech employers of H-1B workers in the United States, according to a Business Insider analysis from March. The White House clarified earlier this month that the $100,000 fee applies only to new applicants, not visa renewals.","Jensen Huang says high costs risk driving talent and investment overseas.

There are questions about where Zoho is developed and where the data is hosted and who hosts it. There is a lot of false information we want to correct.

Poll Should companies clarify the data storage and hosting practices to the public? Yes, it's critical. No, it's not necessary.

1. All the products are developed in India. Our

global headquarters

is in Chennai and we pay taxes in India on our global income. As a global corporation headquartered in India, we have offices in over 80 countries and have a strong presence in the US which is a big market for us.

2. Indian customer data is hosted in India (Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, soon Odissa). We have over 18 data centers globally and they host the respective country or regional data. We are committed to hosting each country data in their own jurisdiction.

3. All our services run on hardware we own and software frameworks we developed, on top of open source like

Linux

OS and Postgres database.

4. We do not host our products on AWS or Azure. Arattai, specifically, is not hosted on AWS or Azure or GCloud. We use some of those services for regional switching nodes to speed up traffic but data is not stored in them. We are adding many such ""points of presence"" (POPs) as we speak.

5. Our Zoho Developer account in the App Store and Play Store lists our US office address because the account was registered in the very early days of those stores by one of our employees in the US just to test them out. We never changed that.

We are proudly ""Made in India, Made for the World"" and we mean it.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has once again made an urgent appeal to Washington, arguing that allowing American technology companies to compete openly in China serves the best interests of both the countries. On the tech podcast BG2, a podcast hosted by tech investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley, Huang emphasized that a competitive presence in China would enable the US to ""proliferate the technology around the world"" and ""maximise America’s economic success and geopolitical influence.""Huang also expressed hope that China would remain open to outside investment, noting Beijing's pledges to maintain an ""open market."" ""What’s in the best interest of China is for foreign companies to invest in China, compete in China and for them to also have vibrant competition themselves,"" he said.Huang highlighted the rapid advances and robust potential of China's chipmaking industry, cautioning that the country is ""nanoseconds behind"" the US. ""We’ve got to go compete,"" he asserted, pointing to China's deep talent pool, hustling work culture, and intense internal competition across its provinces.He described the environment as a ""vibrant, entrepreneurial, hi-tech, modern industry.""Nvidia's Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are the essential backbone for training and running artificial intelligence (AI) models, a factor that has propelled the company's market capitalization to record highs. However, this success has been complicated by escalating geopolitical tensions, which have severely disrupted sales in China, one of the world's largest markets.Earlier this year, the US temporarily blocked exports of the H20, a downgraded chip designed to comply with restrictions, before relenting after a 15% levy to the US government was agreed upon. In August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal under which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of Chinese sales of the H20 going to the US government.In a related news, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang welcomed President Donald Trump's overhaul of the H-1B visa program but warned that the new $100,000 application fee may be prohibitively expensive, potentially driving tech investment and talent away from the United States.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says U.S. companies should be able to compete openly in China.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Paramount to buy Free Press: Who is Bari Weiss?

Paramount Skydance is set to appoint Bari Weiss as editor in chief of CBS News in the coming days, providing the journalist with significant authority to overhaul the network as it acquires her independent news site, the Free Press, The Post has learned.Weiss, a 41-year-old former New York Times opinion writer who developed the Free Press into a prominent platform with a contrarian perspective, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement. However, negotiations remain uncertain, and the timeline may change, a source close to the matter stated.In a notable restructuring of CBS News’ longstanding management framework, Weiss will report directly to Paramount Skydance Chief Executive David Ellison as she assists in defining the editorial direction of the Tiffany Network’s third-largest news division, a source indicated.Weiss’s direct reporting line to Ellison means she will not answer to CBS News President Tom Cibrowski, who currently reports to George Cheeks, Chair of TV Media at Paramount Skydance.Insiders mentioned that Weiss’s hiring raises doubts about the potential return of former CBS President David Rhodes to the network, with one source describing their job prospects as an “either/or” scenario.Sources informed The Post that Weiss could serve as a strong counterpart to Cibrowski, a former “Good Morning America” executive who is viewed more as a production expert than a journalist.Others anticipate that it will soon be clear whether Weiss—who has become a leading voice against antisemitism and the “woke” elites in mainstream media—will challenge Cibrowski’s position.Weiss, 40, made her name as a sharp-tongued opinion columnist at The New York Times. Her pieces took aim at the MeToo movement, campus activism, and what she described as “illiberalism on the left.”In 2020, she quit in spectacular fashion, publishing a viral resignation letter accusing the paper of silencing ideological diversity.She then launched The Free Press in 2022, billing it as “fiercely independent.”The outlet quickly drew attention, and controversy, with stories that platformed conservative voices, a friendly sit-down with venture capitalist Peter Thiel, and essays that critics said downplayed the famine in Gaza.","Bari Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement.

Taliban FM to visit India next week? Muttaqi gets travel exemption; first high-level trip since 2021 takeover,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-fm-to-visit-india-next-week-muttaqi-gets-travel-exemption-first-high-level-trip-since-2021-takeover/articleshow/124275380.cms,"Amir Khan Muttaqi (File photo)





Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi has been granted a temporary travel exemption to visit India next week. This marks the first high-level visit by a Taliban leader to New Delhi since the group took power in Afghanistan in 2021.According to officials, the UN Security Council sanctions committee has authorised Muttaqi to travel to New Delhi between October 9 and 16.The visit is expected to revive earlier plans that were delayed after sanctions restrictions prevented him from travelling, according to news agency Afghanistan International.Before arriving in India, Muttaqi will attend the seventh round of the “Moscow Format” talks in Russia on October 6 at the invitation of Russian officials. This will be the first time the Taliban participates as a member, rather than a guest in the multilateral forum.Describing the development as an “important step,” Muttaqi said he hoped such platforms would help strengthen trust and improve ties with neighbouring countries.The planned trip to India comes after months of speculation. In August, reports suggested that New Delhi was considering inviting Muttaqi, but government sources had clarified that India would approach the UN for a waiver only once the visit was finalised.Afghan media had then reported that the absence of approval had delayed the plan.India’s engagement with the Taliban has steadily increased in recent years, largely built around humanitarian assistance and developmental aid.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has twice spoken with Muttaqi, including last week when he conveyed condolences over the recent earthquake in Afghanistan and announced India’s relief assistance.Earlier this year, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri also met Muttaqi in Dubai to discuss Afghanistan’s urgent developmental needs.India has consistently maintained that while it is aligned with the international community on the question of formal recognition of the Taliban regime, it will continue to provide humanitarian aid and support to the Afghan people.New Delhi has delivered large quantities of food, medicines and relief material and has over 500 development projects running across Afghanistan.Taliban officials have also called for stronger ties with India. Suhail Shaheen, head of the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, recently said high-level visits such as Muttaqi’s were essential to explore cooperation in trade and other areas, adding that the Taliban valued India’s assistance and historical friendship with the Afghan people.If the visit goes ahead, it will mark a landmark moment in India-Afghanistan relations, signalling New Delhi’s intention to cautiously deepen engagement with the Taliban regime while balancing global concerns about recognition and sanctions.",Amir Khan Muttaqi has been granted a temporary travel exemption to visit India next week.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

How Indian nationals are snapping up British buy-to-lets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-indian-nationals-are-snapping-up-british-buy-to-lets/articleshow/124261789.cms,"TOI Correspondent from London:





Indian nationals are the largest non-UK shareholders of buy-to-let companies in Britain this year, according to analysis by estate agency Hamptons.Analysis of data by Hamptons shows that Indian investors are followed by Nigerians, Poles and Irish. Indians have made up the largest group since 2023; in 2022, they were the second-largest.In the first half of this year, Indian nationals founded 684 new buy-to-let companies, with more registered in Hillingdon than in any other area. Nigerian investors follow closely with 647 new incorporations. This shift reflects wider post-Brexit migration patterns.Buy-to-let companies are special-purpose companies set up to buy and manage residential rental properties.EU nationals now account for 49% of non-UK shareholders, down from 65% in 2016. There has been a general fall in shareholders from the Anglosphere, too. In 2016, Irish, Americans, South Africans and Australians all featured in the top 10. By 2025, only Irish nationals remained, ranking fourth. Instead, Indian and Nigerian investors are stepping into the spotlight, despite rents falling this year for the first time in five years.There were approximately 127,000 more Nigerian nationals and 178,000 more Indian nationals immigrating to the UK in 2023 compared with 2019, according to the Office of National Statistics.Twenty per cent of buy-to-let companies set up in the UK so far this year are owned by non-UK national shareholders, up from 13% in 2016. The remaining 80% are owned by UK shareholders. Seven per cent of Indian nationals who own UK buy-to-let companies set up over the past decade live in India.At current rates, around 67,000 new companies will be set up by the end of 2025, with around 13,500 owned, at least in part, by non-UK nationals. Companies are a more tax-efficient way of managing rental properties in Britain.Whilst London has always been an attractive investment choice for foreign landlords, between 2016 and 2025 the share of new non-UK national landlords has more than doubled in the East Midlands, West Midlands and Scotland.Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons, said: “While overseas-based investors are part of the picture, the majority of purchases by non-UK nationals reflect domestic demand. Up until 2021, this demand was most likely to come from EU nationals based in the UK, but since then it has shifted to reflect changes in broader migration patterns. Indian and Nigerian nationals are increasingly likely to buy UK buy-to-let property in a limited company structure. ”","Analysis of data by Hamptons shows that Indian investors are followed by Nigerians, Poles and Irish.

How Germany plans to fix its drone problem,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/how-germany-plans-to-fix-its-drone-problem/articleshow/124291088.cms,"A police man demonstrates the new police drone defence unit (Image credits: AP)

Closer cooperation between German army and police needed



First combat drones to be purchased



Learning from Ukraine



Rapid innovation and arms procurement







""We're really behind when it comes to defending against drones,"" defense minister Boris Pistorius recently admitted. Uncertainty is high after Russian drones invaded the airspace of several Nato countries in recent weeks. Suspected Russian drones have even been supposedly spotted over Germany. On the German television channel ZDF, Pistorius assured viewers that everything was being done ""to make up for this shortcoming.""Why is Germany so poorly equipped to defend itself against drones? One of the reasons for is has to do with the equipment needed to defend against drones. Shooting down incoming drones with fighter jets, as Poland recently did, is possible but also expensive and dangerous over populated areas.More suitable for this tast is Rheinmetall's Skyranger anti-aircraft tank, which can be deployed quickly and can also combat swarms of drones. The Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces, has ordered 19 of these, which will not be delivered until 2027. However, military experts estimate that the demand is significantly higher.Its predecessor, the Gepard anti-aircraft tank, was decommissioned by the Bundeswehr years ago and later given to the Ukrainian armed forces.It has proved extremely effective in repelling Russian drone attacks.In addition to jammers, drones are also an effective means of defense against drones. The Bundeswehr has recently acquired German-made interceptor drones that capture enemy drones with nets.""We need to develop a multi-layered defense system that provides various options for shooting down or disabling drones — electronic countermeasures, kinetic devices, and then low-tech solutions such as net launchers,"" drone expert Ulrike Franke from the European Council on Foreign Relations told DW.Another challenge that Germany faces in defending against drones has to do with the distribution of responsibilities. At the moment, responsibility for countering drone threats is divided between the Bundeswehr and the police forces of Germany's 16 federal states.Defending against external attacks, such as those from fighter jets or large drones, falls within the remit of the military. The Bundeswehr is also authorised to take action if drones appear over military sites.In all other cases, drone defense is the responsibility of the police, who are responsible for internal security. If a drone is spying on a German airport or industrial facility, for example, the Bundeswehr cannot be called in.Although the police do have means of defending against drones, the challenge they face is getting them to the location where the drone has been spotted quickly enough. Security experts think that setting up a comprehensive ""drone defense shield"" over Germany is unrealistic.The separation of military and police duties has developed over time and is enshrined in the constitution. Given the current threats, the Bundeswehr will now be granted more powers to defend against drones. Interior minister Alexander Dobrindt plans to allow the military to assist the police, for example, by shooting down drones. The Air Security Act is to be amended accordingly. Dobrindt is also proposing the creation of a new drone defense center to coordinate the work of the federal and state governments.The Bundeswehr is not only stepping up its efforts in drone defense but also arming itself with drones. Recently, inspector general Carsten Breuer, the highest-ranking German soldier, announced that they would conduct their first live-fire exercises with armed drones at the end of the year.In March, Germany decided to procure so-called kamikaze drones for the troops. These are aircraft equipped with warheads that explode upon hitting their target. This is something quite new for Germany.It is no longer possible to wage war without drones, this became quickly apparent in Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion in February 2022. Hundreds of thousands of drones are being deployed there. On the front lines, small kamikaze drones loaded with explosives are destroying expensive military equipment. The widespread use of reconnaissance drones means that no enemy movement goes unnoticed. This ""transparent battlefield"" has radically changed the nature of warfare.Drone expert Ulrike Franke recommends following Ukraine's example: ""It is absolutely clear that Nato countries need to look to Ukraine and learn from Ukraine when it comes to the ability to deploy, manufacture and modify drones quickly,"" she told DW.The Bundeswehr must now keep pace with these developments. Due to political concerns, it has long refrained from procuring attack drones. Critics feared that unmanned, remotely controlled aircraft could lower the threshold for the use of military force. There has also been much suspicion about the autonomous functions that many drones have.It was not until the war in Ukraine that this changed. In 2022, the German government decided to arm Bundeswehr drones for the first time. It ordered guided missiles for five Heron TP drones, aircraft-sized drones manufactured in Israel. Until then, the Bundeswehr had used only unarmed reconnaissance drones.It took until the beginning of this year for the decision to purchase kamikaze drones. According to the Ministry of Defense, this marked ""the beginning of a new era for the German Armed Forces."" The small disposable drones are known as ""loitering munitions."" This refers to the drone circling above the target before diving down and exploding.The categorisation of kamikaze drones as ""ammunition"" has very practical reasons: ammunition is fired and, therefore, consumed. A larger drone, on the other hand, is considered an unmanned aerial vehicle. With regard to flight safety and personnel certification, aircraft are subject to significantly higher technical requirements, thereby circumventing them.The German armed forces have already begun conducting training exercises on the deployment and defense against drones. This is now considered an ""everyman-skill"" that every soldier must master. A specific number of drones are being procured for this purpose and for immediate needs.What's more, the Bundeswehr is keen to avoid having to keep thousands of drones in storage. Technology in this field is advancing so rapidly that the usual approach to arms procurement, long lead times, long periods of use, would be counterproductive. So new contractual agreements are being made with manufacturers to ensure they can quickly deliver large quantities of the latest standard models when needed.German AI start-ups are the first choice now. Among them is Helsing, a Munich-based company founded in 2021, which has already produced several thousand combat drones for Ukraine.","Germany's armed forces have ordered 19 combat drones, which will not be delivered until 2027. The Bundeswehr is not only stepping up its efforts in drone defense but also arming itself with drones.

Babis pledges to run Czechia like a company



The billionaire rebel underdog?



Success in the 1990s



The move into politics



The Stork's Nest case



Babis in the headlines



Agent 'Bures'



The opportunistic populist







Andrej Babis has been dressing down for this election campaign trail, opting for jeans and sneakers instead of tailored suits and handmade shoes.He sometimes appears at these events wearing a wool sweater, sometimes in a black hoodie featuring his initials, AB, and sometimes in a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ""Czechia, everything for you"" or ""Czechia — against the green madness. ""Babis has rarely been seen on big stages during this election campaign, preferring to address small groups or speak from the platform of his election vehicle.He signs autographs, shakes hands, poses and smiles for selfies and seems to get chirpier the longer the events go on.This is 71-year-old Andrej Babis, billionaire, populist and controversial former prime minister of the Czech Republic.Andrej Babis has often been compared with US President Donald Trump , former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi or Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban. In reality, however, he stands for his very own, Czech brand of populism.Czechia goes to the polls on Friday and Saturday to elect a new parliament, and opinion polls suggest that Babis will be Czechia's next prime minister with his ANO party.When Babis appears on the campaign trail, he generally speaks out against ""the system"" and ""corrupt politicians,"" saying that the political establishment is incapable, bureaucratic and inefficient, that it disregards the people, divides up posts among its own, lies, cheats and wastes money.He claims that as a successful entrepreneur, he would do things very differently, running the state like a company. He also pledges to listen to the people, clean up the country in their name and help them to lead good and dignified lives.But although the billionaire likes to portray himself as the rebellious underdog in a hoodie and as the spokesperson of the poor and downtrodden, he has been part of the country's establishment all his life.Born in what is now Slovakia, he grew up in a family that belonged to the powerful elite of the communist dictatorship of Czechoslovakia.Due to his father's work as a trade representative, Babis lived for a time both in Switzerland and in France.After finishing high school in Geneva, he studied economics in Bratislava and later worked in foreign trade himself in a number of places, including Morocco.His mysterious rise to the ranks of the super-rich in the Czech Republic began in the ""wild 1990s,"" the period after the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.In 1995, he assumed ownership of the agricultural and chemical holding Agrofert, which he had previously run as director.Babis tells a number of different versions of the story of how he came to own Agrofert, though many critics see them as vague and sometimes implausible. Today, Agrofert encompasses about 250 companies worldwide, and Babis is currently estimated to be worth about $3.5 billion (€3 billion).He says that it was what he calls the intolerable state of the country: corruption, bureaucracy and lack of reforms, that motivated him to enter politics.In 2011, he founded the ANO movement, which stands for Action of Dissatisfied Citizens and is, at the same time, the Czech word for ""yes.""Ever since, ANO's most important slogan has been ""Yes, things will get better!"" and its promise that Babis will set things to rights in the country.The voters gave him the opportunity to do just that: Babis was first finance minister from 2014 to 2017 and then prime minister from 2017 to 2021.But his tenure became mired in endless debates about his alleged involvement in cases of fraud and corruption. The Stork's Nest was one such case.The Stork's Nest is a wellness resort near Prague for which Babis was granted EU subsidies. It is alleged that he formally took a company out of the Agrofert Holding for a time to make it eligible for subsidies.Investigations into the Stork's Nest have been ongoing for almost a decade now. There have already been a number of rulings in the case, and in June of this year, a court in Prague ruled that the entire case had to be reopened.But the Stork's Nest is just one among many stories about Babis' alleged financial irregularities. For years, he has been in the headlines because of allegations of conflicts of interest, tax evasion, corruption, influencing the media and his past in the secret service of communist Czechoslovakia.He put his Agrofert Holding into trust funds in 2017. A court later determined that in doing so, he had obscured his role as owner. Babis was forced to sell his media companies in 2023 because of a law governing conflicts of interest.Like many populist leaders elsewhere, he has long been agitating against migrants and, more recently, against Ukrainian refugees. Nevertheless, it has been reported that his business empire employs numerous workers from non-EU countries such as Vietnam or Ukraine, sometimes under inhuman conditions.A court in Slovakia found that Babis once worked as an agent for the Czechoslovak secret service, the StB, under the code name ""Bures,"" though Babis denies this, and the issue has been the subject of numerous lawsuits between him and the Slovakian government.Whenever such a controversy pops up, Babis either says that he has ""done nothing illegal"" or that ""the system"" wants to take revenge and destroy him.While he was prime minister, there were mass protests in response to the scandals involving Babis and demonstrations for a ""clean country."" According to Babis, these were all propaganda activities organised by his enemies.Unlike his friend Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Babis does not view the European Union as the enemy.Although he is not the mouthpiece of Russian President Vladimir Putin , whenever there is talk of military support for Ukraine, he like to deflect the conversation, saying that he is ""a diplomat, not a soldier.""He has not so far had the political opportunity to reorganise Czechia, but it is not clear whether he actually wants to. It is possible that he is seeking the immunity that would come with being prime minister and would mean he no longer has to be questioned or appear in court.Babis is a smooth, some observers would even say opportunistic, version of a populist, a restless man with a huge ego.Babis once told the author of this article that he rarely sleeps, that he ""always has to be doing something"" and that he actually regrets having entered politics. At the same time, he said, the people in Czechia need him and he cannot let them down.","Andrej Babis is a 71-year-old billionaire, populist and controversial former prime minister of the Czech Republic. Babis was first finance minister from 2014 to 2017 and then prime minister from 2017 to 2021. His tenure became mired in endless debates about his alleged involvement in cases of fraud and corruption. He is currently estimated to be worth about $3.5 billion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124290812,imgsize-623499,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

First combat drones to be purchased



Learning from Ukraine



Rapid innovation and arms procurement







""We're really behind when it comes to defending against drones,"" defense minister Boris Pistorius recently admitted. Uncertainty is high after Russian drones invaded the airspace of several Nato countries in recent weeks. Suspected Russian drones have even been supposedly spotted over Germany. On the German television channel ZDF, Pistorius assured viewers that everything was being done ""to make up for this shortcoming.""Why is Germany so poorly equipped to defend itself against drones? One of the reasons for is has to do with the equipment needed to defend against drones. Shooting down incoming drones with fighter jets, as Poland recently did, is possible but also expensive and dangerous over populated areas.More suitable for this tast is Rheinmetall's Skyranger anti-aircraft tank, which can be deployed quickly and can also combat swarms of drones. The Bundeswehr, Germany's Armed Forces, has ordered 19 of these, which will not be delivered until 2027. However, military experts estimate that the demand is significantly higher.Its predecessor, the Gepard anti-aircraft tank, was decommissioned by the Bundeswehr years ago and later given to the Ukrainian armed forces.It has proved extremely effective in repelling Russian drone attacks.In addition to jammers, drones are also an effective means of defense against drones. The Bundeswehr has recently acquired German-made interceptor drones that capture enemy drones with nets.""We need to develop a multi-layered defense system that provides various options for shooting down or disabling drones electronic countermeasures, kinetic devices, and then low-tech solutions such as net launchers,"" drone expert Ulrike Franke from the European Council on Foreign Relations told DW.Another challenge that Germany faces in defending against drones has to do with the distribution of responsibilities. At the moment, responsibility for countering drone threats is divided between the Bundeswehr and the police forces of Germany's 16 federal states.Defending against external attacks, such as those from fighter jets or large drones, falls within the remit of the military. The Bundeswehr is also authorized to take action if drones appear over military sites.In all other cases, drone defense is the responsibility of the police, who are responsible for internal security. If a drone is spying on a German airport or industrial facility, for example, the Bundeswehr cannot be called in.Although the police do have means of defending against drones, the challenge they face is getting them to the location where the drone has been spotted quickly enough. Security experts think that setting up a comprehensive ""drone defense shield"" over Germany is unrealistic.The separation of military and police duties has developed over time and is enshrined in the constitution. Given the current threats, the Bundeswehr will now be granted more powers to defend against drones. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt plans to allow the military to assist the police, for example, by shooting down drones. The Air Security Act is to be amended accordingly. Dobrindt is also proposing the creation of a new drone defense center to coordinate the work of the federal and state governments.The Bundeswehr is not only stepping up its efforts in drone defense but also arming itself with drones. Recently, Inspector General Carsten Breuer, the highest-ranking German soldier, announced that they would conduct their first live-fire exercises with armed drones at the end of the year.In March, Germany decided to procure so-called kamikaze drones for the troops. These are aircraft equipped with warheads that explode upon hitting their target. This is something quite new for Germany.It is no longer possible to wage war without drones this became quickly apparent in Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion in February 2022. Hundreds of thousands of drones are being deployed there. On the front lines, small kamikaze drones loaded with explosives are destroying expensive military equipment. The widespread use of reconnaissance drones means that no enemy movement goes unnoticed. This ""transparent battlefield"" has radically changed the nature of warfare.Drone expert Ulrike Franke recommends following Ukraine's example: ""It is absolutely clear that Nato countries need to look to Ukraine and learn from Ukraine when it comes to the ability to deploy, manufacture and modify drones quickly,"" she told DW.The Bundeswehr must now keep pace with these developments. Due to political concerns, it has long refrained from procuring attack drones. Critics feared that unmanned, remotely controlled aircraft could lower the threshold for the use of military force. There has also been much suspicion about the autonomous functions that many drones have.It was not until the war in Ukraine that this changed. In 2022, the German government decided to arm Bundeswehr drones for the first time. It ordered guided missiles for five Heron TP drones, aircraft-sized drones manufactured in Israel. Until then, the Bundeswehr had used only unarmed reconnaissance drones.It took until the beginning of this year for the decision to purchase kamikaze drones. According to the Ministry of Defense, this marked ""the beginning of a new era for the German Armed Forces."" The small disposable drones are known as ""loitering munitions."" This refers to the drone circling above the target before diving down and exploding.The categorization of kamikaze drones as ""ammunition"" has very practical reasons: ammunition is fired and, therefore, consumed. A larger drone, on the other hand, is considered an unmanned aerial vehicle. With regard to flight safety and personnel certification, aircraft are subject to significantly higher technical requirements, thereby circumventing them.The German Armed Forces have already begun conducting training exercises on the deployment and defense against drones. This is now considered an ""everyman-skill"" that every soldier must master. A specific number of drones are being procured for this purpose and for immediate needs.What's more, the Bundeswehr is keen to avoid having to keep thousands of drones in storage. Technology in this field is advancing so rapidly that the usual approach to arms procurement long lead times, long periods of use would be counterproductive. So new contractual agreements are being made with manufacturers to ensure they can quickly deliver large quantities of the latest standard models when needed.German AI start-ups are the first choice now. Among them is Helsing, a Munich-based company founded in 2021, which has already produced several thousand combat drones for Ukraine.","Russia has been accused of using drones to spy on Nato countries. The Bundeswehr has ordered 19 combat drones, which will not be delivered until 2027. Expert Ulrike Franke recommends following Ukraine's example when it comes to drones. Germany is also arming itself with drones.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124288810,imgsize-992574,width-400,resizemode-4/image-91.jpg"
'Block Everything': Paris' Eiffel Tower closed amid nationwide protests; demonstrators call for higher taxes on rich,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/block-everything-paris-eiffel-tower-closed-amid-nationwide-protests-demonstrators-call-for-higher-taxes-on-rich/articleshow/124276842.cms,"Eiffel tower closed due to nationwide protests (AP image)

The Eiffel Tower in Paris was closed on Thursday as nationwide strikes disrupted daily life across France.Thousands of protesters marched through more than 200 towns and cities, denouncing proposed spending cuts and demanding higher taxes on the wealthy.In Paris, workers, retirees and students rallied from Place d’Italie, with heightened security measures affecting major tourist sites, news agency AFP reported.The demonstrations, organised by France’s major unions, are part of an ongoing wave of protests that began last month amid political uncertainty and heated budget discussions.Unions are urging Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu to abandon draft measures proposed by his predecessor, François Bayrou.These measures include freezes on social welfare and austerity policies, which critics argue would diminish the purchasing power of low- and middle-income workers. The unions have also called for higher taxes on the wealthy.Lecornu, who assumed office last month, has not yet announced his budget plans or appointed government ministers, which is expected in the coming days. Parliament is set to debate the budget bill by the end of the year.Sophie Binet, head of the CGT union, said: “It’s true, it’s the first time that there are three days of strikes and protests in a month without a government or budget. It shows the level of social anger.”Speaking to BFM TV, she explained that the protests are taking place now because decisions are being made and the unions want their voices to be heard.According to the French interior ministry, 195,000 people protested nationwide, including 24,000 in Paris. Transport services were affected, with regional trains and commuter services operating at reduced capacity, though high-speed trains ran normally.Teachers and health care workers also joined the strikes, but turnout appeared lower than last month, when over 500,000 demonstrators marched across France.Earlier protests included a day of anti-government action that saw streets filled with smoke, barricades set ablaze and tear gas deployed as part of the “Block Everything” campaign.","Thousands of protesters marched through more than 200 towns and cities.
