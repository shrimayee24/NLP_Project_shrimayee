NEW DELHI: As the launch of “Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana” completed nine years this month, BJP on Thursday claimed that the welfare measures of the Modi govt have resulted in empowerment of all sections and buoyancy in Indian economy. Party’s spokesperson Tuhin Sinha noted that the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, a scheme providing LPG connections to poor households, has provided 10.3 crore connections so far, with nearly nine crore beneficiaries turning out to be sustained users of the programme.“This negates opposition’s claim that many beneficiaries did not opt for refills after utilising the initial free gas cylinders,” Sinha told reporters. The scheme has led to an expansion in the LPG network with 7,959 more distributorships, overwhelmingly in the rural areas, he said, adding that the per capita consumption was 3.9 cylinders.Sinha said the beneficiaries include 1.8 crore in Uttar Pradesh, 1.2 crore in West Bengal and 1.1 crore in Bihar, adding that it shows the wide popularity of the welfare programme that also led to a drop in the country’s carbon footprint. He also cited several case studies to assert the scheme led to the mitigation of pulmonary diseases among women.",BJP claims welfare measures of Modi govt have resulted in empowerment of all sections.

NEW DELHI: The 27 Naxalites killed in Wednesday’s anti-Maoist operation in Narayanpur, Chhattisgarh — including top CPI (Maoist) leader Nambala Keshava Rao alias Basavaraju — carried a total bounty of over Rs 12.3 crore, which is likely to be distributed among personnel of the District Reserve Guard (DRG) who executed the operation.Among the 27 Maoist cadres neutralised — all now identified — 15 were men and 12 women. As many as 25 were part of the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army’s (PLGA) Company No.7, the dedicated armed wing of CPI (Maoist) that handles protection of top central committee leaders like Basavaraju and former general secretary Mupalla Laxman Rao alias Ganapathy.“PLGA Company No.7 is estimated to have a total strength of 60. Of these, 25 were in Basavaraju’s security detail. All the 25, including 12 women cadres, one of whom was deputy commander of Company No.7, were neutralised on Wednesday,” a top intelligence officer told TOI.The large women’s component in PLGA units is not unusual. Among the 31 Maoists killed in the operation at Karregutta Hills on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border, 16 were women, most of them part of CPI (Maoist)’s most lethal armed wing, the PLGA Battalion No.1. The women guerrillas go through the same rigorous training as their male counterparts, their tough bodies and steely resolve easing their transition into brutal sharp-shooters.There was one important casualty in the Narayanpur operation other than Basavaraju. Jangu Naveen alias Madhu, a senior leader of the Dandkaranya Zone Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC), who was likely heading the CPI (Maoist) central committee secretariat, was with Basavaraju when they were challenged by DRG personnel. Hailing from Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh, Naveen, 45, was secretary to central committee and central regional bureau (CRB).While Basavaraju carried a total reward of Rs 10 crore, announced by NIA and various state govts, Jangu Naveen had a bounty of Rs 25 lakh. A Rs 10 lakh reward each was declared against four other senior cadres — Sangeeta, Bhoomika, Company No.7 commander Roshan and his deputy Somli. All four were Company Party Company (CYPC) members.The remaining 21 members — all from PLGA Company No.7 — carried a reward of Rs 8 lakh each, with their total bounty adding up to Rs 1.7 crore.“Since this was exclusively a DRG operation, the bounties declared on the 27 killed Maoists will be split among the DRG personnel who were part of it. This will follow the due process, which includes a magisterial inquiry. Since the operation was in Chhattisgarh, the state DGP may write to the other state govts to give the rewards declared by them, to the DRG personnel,” Bastar IG P Sundarraj told TOI.The age profile of the 26 Maoists killed with Basavaraju show that 15 of them were less than 25 years old, with the youngest being a woman barely 20 years of age.Only five of the 26 Maoists eliminated in Narayanpur hailed from Andhra Pradesh or Telangana; the rest were all from Chhattisgarh, hailing from Bijapur, Sukma, Indravati, West Bastar, South Bastar and Narayanpur.","The 27 Naxalites killed in Wednesday’s anti-Maoist operation in Narayanpur, Chhattisgarh carried a total bounty of over Rs 12.3 crore.

NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday filed the chargesheet against former Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik and five others in connection with the Kiru hydropower corruption case, PTI reported quoting officials.In 2024, the CBI had carried out searches at eight locations across Delhi and Jammu as part of a probe into alleged corruption involving the awarding of civil contracts worth Rs 2,200 crore for the Kiru Hydro Electric Power Project.The investigation stems from a request made by the Jammu and Kashmir government in 2022, seeking a CBI inquiry into suspected irregularities in the awarding of two major contracts. These concerns were initially raised by Satya Pal Malik, who served as the governor of J&K from August 23, 2018, to October 30, 2019. Malik had publicly alleged that he was offered a Rs 300 crore bribe to approve two files, one of which related to the Kiru project.After a CBI search at his residence last year, he denied all corruption allegations. Malik stated that instead of investigating those he accused of corruption, the agency targeted him. “They will not get anything except 4-5 kurtas and pyjamas. The dictator is trying to scare me by misusing government agencies.I am a farmer's son, I will neither be afraid nor bow down,” he posted online.The CBI has booked Navin Kumar Choudhary, then chairman of Chenab Valley Power Projects Private Limited (CVPPPL), along with officials M S Babu, M K Mittal, and Arun Kumar Mishra, and Patel Engineering Limited. The FIR alleges a re-tender decision taken in the 47th board meeting was not followed through, and the contract was eventually awarded improperly.","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed the chargesheet against former Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik and five others in connection with the Kiru hydropower corruption case.

Poll What is more important when managing religious endowment boards? Ensuring minority community representation Maintaining secular management of properties

After countering the Muslim side's argument that non-Muslims could theoretically form a majority in the Central Waqf Council and Auqaf Boards, Centre told Supreme Court Wednesday that an ill-founded attempt was made to project discrimination of Muslims by comparing composition of waqf bodies with religious endowment boards of Hindus, Sikhs and Christians.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta exhibited documents, including the minority affairs ministry's written assurance to the Joint Parliamentary Committee and its affidavit in SC, to apprise a bench of CJI B R Gavai and Justice A G Masih that the council and boards would never lose their minority character as an overwhelming majority of members would always be Muslims.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal had taken nearly 30 minutes on Tuesday to highlight apprehension among Muslims about the council and boards losing their minority character by claiming that the govt, through the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025, at least theoretically intended to make non-Muslims the majority in these two bodies. He had asked when the govt never attempted to make non-believers in Hinduism, Sikhism and Christianity members in their religious endowment boards, why were waqfs of Muslims singled out. He termed it discrimination on the ground of religion, which violated the fundamental right to non-discrimination guaranteed under Article 15.Mehta said Hindu religious endowment board members entered temples and even supervised rituals.The charity commissioner, who can be non-Hindu, can appoint archakas (pujaris) and remove them for not performing rituals or for immoral activities, and SC had upheld this by terming appointment of archakas as a secular activity, he added.The SG said Hindu personal laws were codified in 1956, but Muslims continued to be governed by Sharia law. Adjudicating a petition highlighting this discrimination, SC in 1996 had said such a comparison was not possible and reforms in personal law and religious activities were a gradual process.""There cannot be any comparison with Hindu religious endowment boards as they deal with religion and rituals. But the boards deal with management of waqf properties, which is a secular activity, and the state has the power to regulate it through legislation. None of the petitioners has challenged Parliament's legislative competence to enact the Waqf Amendment Act, 2025,"" the SG said.He said the JPC had consulted Archaeological Survey of India on ancient monuments being taken out of the purview of waqf. ASI said while religious activities, which have been going on for years, had not been stopped in protected and ancient monuments, waqf boards managing these monuments as waqfs had unilaterally allowed commercial activities in these ancient spaces, hindering preservation and conservation works.Mehta said in certain cases, waqf boards had restrained ASI from carrying out repair and restoration work in ancient monuments.","Centre says attempt was made to project discrimination of Muslims by comparing composition of waqf bodies with religious endowment boards of Hindus, Sikhs and Christians.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order after arguments over three days between the Centre and petitioners for and against the validity of Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, reports Dhananjay Mahapatra. Responding to the petitioners' objection to the provision that only a practising Muslim for five years could dedicate properties for waqf, SG Tushar Mehta said it was in sync with the requirement of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.Given the widespread misuse of waqf properties and their usurpation for personal purposes noted from 1870s, registration of waqf properties, including 'waqf by user', needed to be mandatorily registered under the 1923 and 1995 Waqf Acts, he said. Mehta said a person could be governed by the 1937 Act only if he satisfied the prescribed authority that he was a Muslim and filled a form before that authority declaring that he desired to follow Sharia law and be governed by its provisions - ranging from marriage to waqfs. ""So, what is the problem in the new law asking a person to be mandatorily a Muslim for the purpose of making a waqf?"" he asked.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, supported by A M Singhvi, Rajeev Dhavan and Huzefa Ahmadi, said the way the new waqf law was drafted, it would allow govt to take over 'waqf by user' properties, which were not registered for decades because of fault of state govts, an eventuality which would result in punishing the community for no fault of its.Sibal said waqf was part of zakat, one of the 5 cardinal principles intrinsic to Islam. ""Waqf was purely religious, and no authority could interfere in this as the Constitution guarantees that every religious denomination has the absolute right to manage its religious institutions, which in this case is waqf,"" he added.Appearing for Rajasthan, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi said 'waqf by user' was a term evolved by Privy Council and did not find mention in the 1923 Waqf Act. There was no dedication to Allah in case of 'waqf by user', he said. For ST Muslim organisation, Odisha, and a waqf board, senior advocates Ranjit Kumar, Maninder Singh and Gopal Sankaranarayanan supported Centre's stand.An advocate brought to the court's notice that in Tamil Nadu's Tiruchendurai, its 1,500-year-old Chola-era temple and the surrounding area had been declared waqf property by TN waqf board. She said the board's claim was met with resistance from villagers, who were unable to sell their land without the board's approval. She said the new law would curb such practices.","Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its verdict on the ambit, contours and necessity of an interim order.

However, the allotment of 'zudpi' jungle land for commercial purposes after Oct 25, 1980, would be treated as encroachment and removed, said a bench of CJI B R Gavai and A G Masih.Writing the judgment, CJI Gavai said exempting residential houses, govt buildings and public utilities, which got land prior to Dec 1996, from removal is a one-time exception carved out in adherence with the concept of sustainable development and economic democracy as espoused by Dr B R Ambedkar in his speech in the Constituent Assembly.SC was concerned with 'zudpi' forest land in Nagpur, Wardha, Bandara, Gondia, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts. CJI Gavai said the Maharashtra govt shall seek approval under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act for the deletion of such land from the 'List of Forest Areas'.However, to compensate for the loss of these shrub forest lands, the bench said that 'zudpi' land will not be permitted to be used for compensatory afforestation unless there is a certificate of the chief secretary regarding non-availability of non-forest land for the purposes of afforestation. In such cases, compensatory afforestation must be carried out on double the area of 'zudpi' jungle land.

Rahul took an identical stand, refusing to acknowledge the controversial transactions that have become the prime money laundering charges slapped by the agency against the two.Young Indian took over AJL's loan liability towards Congress for a mere Rs 50 lakh, and in the process took over the company that owned assets across India estimated at over Rs 2,000 crore, according to ED.Both Sonia and Rahul were directors in Young Indian when these transactions happened, the agency said while accusing them of being involved in the conspiracy to siphon off assets of AJL that actually belonged to the Congress party.Based on details of Rahul's interrogation by ED investigators, TOI had in June 16, 2022 exclusively reported that the Congress functionary had blamed the AJL-YI transactions to the late Motilal Vora. The agency was sceptical of the identical statements of mother and son as Sonia was then Congress president and Rahul was a general secretary in the party, besides being the majority shareholders in Young Indian and directors of the company. Vora was the party's treasurer for decades.Significantly, ED noted in its chargesheet that at the time it was transferred to Young Indian for Rs 50 lakh, AJL had an annual rental income of Rs 75 lakh. AJL's annual income shot up significantly after it was owned by the Gandhi family: from Rs 75 lakh to Rs 15 crore per annum by 2021-22.AJL, publisher of Congress mouthpiece National Herald and Quami Awaz, folded operations in 2008 after providing VRS to its remaining staff. However, it continued to make revenue by renting out its premises in Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow and other cities. Later, after taking over the company, the promoters/directors of Young Indian further developed these properties and raised the annual rental income to Rs 15 crore.While Sonia told ED that ""she was not aware why a new entity Young Indian was incorporated for assignment of the alleged loan of Rs 90 crore so as to do away with the non-recoverable loan of AJL when the same could have been achieved simply by writing off the loan"", Rahul had said he was not aware where the Rs 50 lakh came from in Young Indian to settle the AJL loan (with Congress).Both Sonia and Rahul refused to produce documentary evidence to support their claim that late Vora was authorised to take the decision of assigning AJL's loan to YI and in return, transferring the entire company and its properties to the new entity privately owned by them.","Sonia and Rahul were directors in Young Indian when these transactions happened. Young Indian took over AJL's loan liability towards Congress for a mere Rs 50 lakh. In the process took over the company that owned assets across India estimated at over Rs 2,000 crore.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121348631,imgsize-48876,width-400,resizemode-4/121348631.jpg"
Supreme Court stay on Tasmac probe a setback for ED,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-stay-on-tasmac-probe-a-setback-for-ed/articleshow/121348249.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court's stay on ED investigation against Tasmac, Tamil Nadu govt entity responsible for distribution of liquor in the state, has come as a setback and surprise for the agency which, validated by Madras high court order, had intensified its probe into the case leading to ""discovery of evidence"" of alleged collusion of distilleries and bottlers with officials in selling liquor above the maximum retail price as part of a scam.SC faulted the agency for conducting searches on Tasmac when no 'predicate offence' had been registered against state govt undertaking. ED sources pointed out that Madras HC, in a detailed order, had struck down the challenge made on the same ground. In its order, HC had addressed the state govt's objection and held that a predicate offence, or FIR, was not mandatory to initiate an investigation under PMLA.Sources also said the two-judge HC bench of Justices S M Subramaniam and K Rajasekar, in its April 23 order, had rejected Tamil Nadu govt's plea that ED, before carrying out any search and seizure operation on a state-owned entity, must take ""prior consent"" from state govt to maintain sanctity of the federal structure.The bench had dismissed three writ petitions filed by TN govt and Tasmac seeking to stop ED investigation into the alleged liquor scam.The HC bench had said the precondition of getting consent from the state before conducting search was ""completely illogical and bereft of conscience"". ""How can a raid or search be conducted on a state-owned company in a surprise manner if permission is to be obtained beforehand? How can a search by an investigating agency even hold good if such absurd conditions are made?"" the two judges had asked.On Thursday, SC observed that the agency had transgressed the federal structure.Sources said in searches at various premises of Tasmac on March 6, ED found ""evidence"" of manipulation in supply orders, payment of bribes for allowing sale of liquor above MRP, grant of bar licences and transfer and posting of officials. The documents seized during the raids also revealed collusion of officials where excess charges of Rs 10-30 per bottle was illegally levied at retail outlets, sources said.","SC faulted the agency for conducting searches on Tasmac when no 'predicate offence' had been registered against state govt undertaking.

"Yamuna dirtier in May, pollution load in major drains increases too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/yamuna-dirtier-in-may-pollution-load-in-major-drains-increases-too/articleshow/121348245.cms,"NEW DELHI: The pollution in the Yamuna spiked in May with a substantial rise in fecal levels, phosphates and ammonia. Delhi Pollution Control Committee's monthly analysis shows that while the river was more polluted at its exit from the city at Asgarpur, it also entered the city at Palla with substantial pollution levels. The samples of the river were collected on May 1, a day before the city recorded heavy rains. The pollution load in major drains like Maharani Bagh, Shahdara and Najafgarh also increased in May.According to DPCC, while fecal coliform has increased since last month, the river also recorded a spike in ammonia, with the ammoniacal nitrogen levels doubling to 5.7mg/litre from 2.3mg/l last month. The fecal coliform level reading was 23 lakh MPN/100ml in May, much higher than the 15 lakh MPN/100ml in April.Experts, however, were concerned about the various test readings published by DPCC. Pankaj Kumar, environmentalist and founder of Earth Warrior, said, ""If fecal coliform is high, then biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) must also increase. However, we see that BOD at Nizamuddin Bridge is 37mg/l and fecal level is 2.4 lakh MPN/100ml. At the next station at Okhla barrage, BOD drops to 23 and fecal coliform increases to 3.3 lakh.DPCC must recheck this rather big anomaly. At Palla, the dissolved oxygen (DO) level is 9.8mg/l and BOD is 4, which seems a bit unlikely because for DO as high as 9.8, BOD must be 1-2mg/l.""Another expert pointed out that high DO levels upstream of Wazirabad could depict algal growth. ""If there is algal growth, then DO increases during the day and drops at night due to respiration. A DO of 9.8 mg/l appears out of proportion. Or it means there are nutrients like phosphate and nitrogen in the water. It is necessary, therefore, to carry out more testing,"" the expert said.A Delhi govt official added, ""Also, at Wazirabad BOD in Feb was 9mg/l, 7mg/l in March and 6mg/l in April and May; these are not even standards for bathing water. Is Delhi Jal Board also monitoring this?"" The permissible BOD for the Yamuna is 3mg/l.","Pollution in the Yamuna spiked in May with a substantial rise in fecal levels, phosphates and ammonia.

NEW DELHI: In order to infuse transparency and prevent the malpractice of seat-blocking in PG admission in medical colleges, Supreme Court has directed that the raw scores, answer keys and normalisation formulae of NEET-PG examinations must be published and said that strict penalties for seat blocking be enforced.The court said the counselling process was conceived as a transparent, merit-based national mechanism for allocating post-graduate medical seats but over time it has come under increasing scrutiny for facilitating widespread seat blocking. tnnSeat blocking is when candidates temporarily accept seats, only to abandon them later after securing more preferred options. This leads to those seats remaining unavailable in earlier rounds and opening up only in later stages, disadvantaging higher-ranked aspirants, who may have already committed to less preferred choices.""This malpractice distorts the actual availability of seats, fosters inequity among aspirants, and often reduces the process to one governed more by chance than merit. Seat blocking is not merely an isolated wrongdoing - it reflects deeper systemic flaws rooted in fragmented governance, lack of transparency, and weak policy enforcement,"" the bench said.Court directed implementation of a nationally synchronised counselling calendar to align the all-India quota and state rounds and prevent seat blocking across systems. It also said a centralised fee regulation framework under National Medical Commission and pre-counselling fee disclosure by all private/deemed universities, detailing tuition, hostel, caution deposit, and miscellaneous charges be made mandatory.""Enforce strict penalties for seat blocking including forfeiture of security deposit, disqualification from future NEET-PG exams, blacklisting of complicit colleges.

Indigo, Air India Cancel Flights Amid Drone Scare Even After Ceasefire | Is Flying Still Safe?

NEW DELHI: The pilot operating IndiGo ’s Delhi-Srinagar flight on Wednesday had sought Lahore air traffic control (ATC) permission to briefly venture into Pakistan airspace to avoid turbulence after encountering a sudden hailstorm.People in the know say Lahore ATC denied this permission and pilot flying the Airbus A321 with 220 people on board declared emergency to Srinagar ATC. The aircraft with over 220 people on board, including Trinamool Congress MPs, finally landed safely in Srinagar but with its radome or nose cone badly damaged in the hailstorm.A senior Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) official said, “We have sought details from IndiGo” and a probe is on. The aircraft (VT-IMD) is now grounded in Srinagar. The pilots are being widely applauded for handling the situation well and ensuring everyone’s safety.In a statement, the airline said: “IndiGo flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar on May 21, 2025, navigated a sudden hailstorm and landed safely at Srinagar International Airport. All customers were attended to upon landing and no injuries were reported. The aircraft is currently undergoing necessary inspection and maintenance in Srinagar and will resume operations once all clearances have been secured.We sincerely thank our customers for their cooperation in ensuring the safe completion of this flight. As always, the safety of our customers and crew remains our highest priority.”The plane had taken off from Delhi at 5 pm on Wednesday and landed in Srinagar safely at 6.46 pm. While Pakistan airspace remains closed for Indian aircraft, in emergency circumstances such permission as sought by the IndiGo pilot should not have been denied for a commercial airline due to safety reasons, say multiple senior pilots.","Lahore ATC refused IndiGo Delhi-Srinagar pilot request to enter airspace & avoid turbulence: Sources.

Lionel Messi and Riqui Puig are the top two highest-paid players at the club in 2025, along with other players like Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets. This is a testament to the players’ playing ability and global market appeal.Lionel Messi, of Inter Miami, is the top earner in the M.L.S with a guaranteed compensation of $20.4 million for the 2025 season. That includes a base of $12 million, plus marketing bonuses and agent fees. Not only would Messi’s salary be the highest in MLS history, but it would also exceed the total payrolls of 22 other MLS teams.In addition to his club salary, Messi’s overall income includes endorsement deals and a revenue-sharing pact with Apple TV; annually, he will earn roughly $60 million playing soccer and an estimated $75 million from endorsements. His contract with Inter Miami is valid until December 2025, an extension is currently being negotiated.LA Galaxy hotshot midfielder Riqui Puig has solidified his status as one of the top earners in MLS. Puig earns a guaranteed salary of $4 million in 2025, as he is one of the highest-paid midfielders in MLS. Overall, this extension is a testament to his belief in our club and the operation we have in place here in LA. The move to sign a new contract with the LA Galaxy before the 2025 season is a testament to his investment in both our club and the league.There is no question that Puig is making an impact on the field, which also can’t be overlooked on the field in LA’s strong Western Conference performance. His technical acumen and vision have been instrumental in whatever the team plans on doing, and he is paid the amount he deserves to be paid by the club.The MLS Players Association (MLSPA) recently released the 2025 salary guide, revealing the top earners across the league. Here's a breakdown of the highest-paid players this season:These amounts are for guaranteed pay, which includes base salary and all bonuses and marketing deals for the year.

'I Settled It Trough Trade': Donald Trump Once Again Claims Credit for India Pakistan Ceasefire Deal

Why did stock market fall today? Top reasons

1) Treasury Yields in United States

2) US Fiscal Issues Following Moody's Assessment

3) Subdued U.S. Bond Performance

4) Market Adjustment Post Strong Gains

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Stock market today: Indian equity benchmark indices, Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , tanked in trade on Thursday. While Nifty50 went below 24,550, BSE Sensex was down over 1,100 points intraday. Nifty50 ended at 24,609.70, down 204 points or 0.82%. BSE Sensex closed at 80,951.99, down 645 points or 0.79%. The stock markets reflected the global market weakness due to higher bond yields and US debt issues.Among Sensex companies, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Finserv, Tech Mahindra, Power Grid, ITC, Hindustan Unilever, Reliance Industries and Maruti were the major losers.IndusInd Bank, Bharti Airtel and UltraTech Cement showed positive performance.""The key benchmark indices witnessed declines amid US fiscal concerns that the proposed budget bill could significantly increase the national debt, pushing US treasury yields higher due to tepid long-term bond demand. Adding to the pressure, a major credit rating agency's downgrade of the US credit outlook sparked broad-based selloffs across Asian markets,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Investments Limited, said.Long-term US Treasury yields reached peak levels not seen since 18 months ago. The 30-year Treasury bond yield stayed above 5% following an 18-month peak during Asian trading hours.The elevated yields are causing funds to shift away from stocks, particularly affecting emerging economies such as India.The financial community remains cautious after Moody's reduced the United States' credit rating last Friday, pointing to the nation's escalating debt obligations. This credit assessment has led to increased global caution, affecting both American and Asian financial markets.Financial observers are monitoring the proposed taxation legislation, scheduled for voting this week, which analysts suggest could increase American debt by $3.8 trillion, on top of the existing $36 trillion.""The fundamental issue is the high fiscal deficit of the US, which the market feels is unsustainable,"" said Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.A lacklustre response to Wednesday's $16 billion auction of 20-year bonds demonstrated investors' hesitation towards U.S. assets, resulting in elevated yields.""The weak US 20-year bond auction and the spike in yields of 5-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds indicate the declining confidence in US bonds,"" Vijayakumar said.This impacted Asian markets negatively, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan declining 0.5%. Japan's Nikkei decreased 0.7% due to yen appreciation. Chinese benchmark indices reduced by 0.2%, whilst Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.8% during early trading.In the previous session, the Dow declined 1.9%, S&P 500 fell 1.6%, and Nasdaq decreased 1.4% following the disappointing bond auction.Sameet Chavan, Head of Research (Technical and Derivative) at Angel One, observed that recent substantial gains have led to overbought market conditions, with values significantly exceeding short-term moving averages. Despite an overall positive trend, a period of stabilisation is likely in the immediate future. ""A sustained move below the recent matching lows near 24,700 could trigger further profit booking, potentially dragging prices towards 24,600 and the 20-day EMA near 24,500,"" he added.","Nifty50 ended at 24,609.70, down 204 points or 0.82%.

The age of digital travel has officially arrived in India. Now that the government is implementing chip-enabled e-passports in a few places, Indian tourists will now be able to experience improved security, quicker immigration, and worldwide compatibility. The introduction promises a safer and more intelligent method of crossing foreign borders, marking a major improvement over the conventional passport booklet. What is an e-passport, though, and is it necessary for existing passport holders to convert? Here's all that you need to know.An Indian e-passport is a modern travel document that combines the traditional paper booklet with an embedded Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip and antenna. The passport holder's biometric and personal data, including fingerprints and photos, are safely stored on this chip. These passports are recognised by a unique gold-colored insignia on the front cover. Processing at immigration checkpoints is made faster and more secure by the use of this technology.: Digitally signed biometric data, secured by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), is stored on the integrated chip in e-passports.This security framework ensures the legitimacy and integrity of the data, making it difficult to fabricate or change the passport.: e-Passports enable automated and contactless verification at border controls, which will likely reduce wait times significantly and enhance the overall travel experience.: Indian e-passports, which adhere to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards, will allow Indian nationals to enjoy hassle-free travel abroad, as these chip-based passports are recognised and acknowledged at immigration checkpoints in most parts of the world.: By discouraging counterfeiting and unauthorised changes, advanced security elements in e-passports shield users against fraud and identity theft.Read more: Beginner’s guide: 10 countries first-time solo travellers can visit No, holders of valid passports are not obliged to switch to electronic passports.

US-China tech tensions 'escalate'



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly praised President Donald Trump while sharply criticising the Biden administration ’s export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, calling the policy 'a failure' that cost US companies billions. Speaking at the Computex 2025 tech conference in Taipei, Huang applauded Trump’s plan to roll back the Biden-era AI export restrictions, saying the prior policy was based on “fundamentally flawed” assumptions.“President Trump realises it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said, referencing the Biden administration’s approach that blocked exports to China entirely and categorised countries into three tiers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump officials are now considering replacing that system with a global licensing regime aimed at preserving US leverage in trade talks.Under the Biden rules, Huang said Nvidia’s share of the Chinese AI market plummeted from 95% to 50%, while Chinese firms like Huawei capitalised, accelerating the country’s domestic semiconductor industry.“All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang stated.“The assumptions that led to the AI diffusion rule have been proven to be fundamentally flawed,” he added.Despite US efforts to slow Chinese AI development, Huang noted that research there continues at scale, powered by massive domestic investment. He estimated China’s AI market could hit $50 billion in 2025—representing a critical opportunity for Nvidia, if re-entry is allowed.“The competition in China is really intense. They would love for us never to go back,” Huang added.Nvidia has already taken a $5.5 billion hit due to the chip restrictions and projects an additional $15 billion in revenue loss related to its restricted H20 AI chips . The company is now designing a version of its next-generation Blackwell chip with slower memory to comply with current rules.Earlier this week, Beijing slammed Washington for what it called “discriminatory” measures after US authorities warned firms against using Chinese chips like Huawei’s Ascend.","N Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang blasts Biden-era AI chip export policy.

Viral video captures confrontation at SBI Branch in Bengaluru

Social media outrage and public response



#RespectKannada

#LanguageImposition

“This is not just about language. It’s about dignity and respect for the people of Karnataka. An officer of a public sector bank refusing to speak Kannada is unacceptable.”

“Is this a bank in Karnataka or Delhi? Why is Hindi being imposed on us in our own state?”

SBI’s response: Apology and transfer of officer

“If I have hurt anyone, I sincerely apologise. I will try to conduct business in Kannada going forward.”

Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah’s statement

“The behaviour of the SBI Branch Manager in Surya Nagara, Anekal Taluk, refusing to speak in Kannada and English and showing disregard to citizens is strongly condemnable.”

“Such incidents must not recur. All bank employees must treat customers with dignity and make every effort to speak in the local language. I urge the Finance Ministry and the Department of Financial Services to mandate cultural and language sensitisation training for all bank staff across India,”

“Respecting local language is respecting the people.”

A language-related controversy has ignited widespread debate in Karnataka after a State Bank of India (SBI) official was seen in a viral video refusing to communicate in Kannada with a customer. The incident, which took place at the SBI Surya Nagar branch in Anekal Taluk, has drawn criticism from local citizens, social media users, and political leaders alike. The video depicts a customer requesting the official to speak Kannada, the state’s official language, only to be met with a defiant response from the staffer who insisted on speaking Hindi. The confrontation, which quickly went viral, has reignited discussions about linguistic respect, official communication in public institutions, and cultural sensitivity within India’s federal framework.The incident also drew a swift response from Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and prompted a broader conversation about the role of language in public service delivery in multilingual India. While the bank has since transferred the official and issued an apology video, the matter continues to stir strong emotions online and offline, reflecting deeper concerns around language imposition and regional identity.The controversy began with a video filmed inside the Surya Nagar SBI branch, where a woman officer is seen dismissing a customer's repeated requests to conduct the conversation in Kannada. The customer is heard stating, “This is Karnataka, madam,” to which the staffer retorts, “This is India.” When urged again to use the local language, she responds sharply: “I will not speak Kannada for you… I will speak Hindi,” before walking away with the statement, “I will never speak Kannada.”The video, recorded by another customer, rapidly spread on social media platforms, triggering immediate backlash. Users accused the officer of disrespecting Karnataka’s official language, violating basic customer service norms, and breaching RBI-mandated linguistic guidelines for public-facing roles in banks.As the video gained traction, hashtags such asandbegan trending on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Facebook. Thousands of users tagged SBI, the Union Finance Ministry, and the Reserve Bank of India, demanding disciplinary action against the employee.One user wrote,Another post read,Numerous citizens also highlighted that RBI regulations encourage bank staff to communicate in regional languages to ensure accessibility and respectful service, especially in public-sector institutions.In response to the escalating controversy, the State Bank of India took prompt administrative action.

She says,While some appreciated the apology, others questioned its authenticity, suggesting it was prompted only after the incident went viral.Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah took a strong stance on the issue, releasing a public statement via social media platform X. He condemned the SBI officer’s conduct, stating:The Chief Minister acknowledged the bank’s move to transfer the official but stressed the need for systemic changes to avoid similar incidents in the future.he added.His post concluded with the statement:","Viral video captures confrontation at SBI Branch in Bengaluru.

Supporting healthy longevity with modern science





In a world where everyone searches for the secret to living a long and fulfilling life, the wisdom of those who have actually achieved extraordinary longevity is invaluable. Ethel Caterham, the world’s oldest living woman at the age of 115, offers a simple yet powerful insight into how she has managed to live such a remarkable life. Born in 1909, Ethel has witnessed immense global changes—from world wars to technological revolutions—and through it all, she has maintained a philosophy that has kept her peaceful, healthy, and vibrant. Her secret? One straightforward rule that she believes has helped her live over a century: “Never argue with anyone. I listen and I do what I like.” This rule, rooted in calmness and self-respect, reveals much about the connection between emotional well-being and longevity.When asked about her secret to living beyond a century, Ethel’s answer was refreshingly simple: avoiding arguments and listening more. She said,This philosophy centers on emotional calmness and self-control, avoiding unnecessary conflicts that can drain energy and increase stress.Scientific research confirms the wisdom in Ethel’s words. Chronic stress and emotional turmoil are linked to an increased risk of heart disease, weakened immune function, and accelerated aging.By choosing to avoid arguments, Ethel likely protected her body and mind from these harmful effects, creating an environment where health and happiness could flourish.Ethel Caterham was born on August 21, 1909, in the village of Shipton Bellinger, England. Growing up as the second youngest in a family of eight siblings, her early years were shaped by simplicity and traditional values. Life at that time was markedly different — horse-drawn carriages, handwritten letters, and a world on the brink of World War I.Despite the many historical upheavals she experienced, Ethel maintained a steady and calm disposition throughout her life. This ability to remain composed and adaptable was a foundation that supported her health and longevity.Emotional health is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in overall longevity. Studies show that people who manage their emotions well and maintain stable, positive relationships tend to live longer and healthier lives. Chronic emotional conflict can lead to inflammation in the body, which is associated with many age-related diseases.Ethel’s ability to listen and remain composed reflects an emotional resilience that scientific studies link to longevity. By conserving her energy for positive experiences rather than arguments, she helped her body maintain a healthier internal balance.Ethel’s long life was also marked by boldness and curiosity. At 18, she traveled to India to work as a nanny, embracing new cultures and challenges. Later, she lived in Hong Kong and Gibraltar with her husband, a British army major. These experiences likely enriched her life and kept her mentally engaged, another important factor linked to healthy aging.Despite frequent moves and changes, Ethel’s calm demeanor never wavered. She raised two daughters in the UK and continued to live with strength and grace, even after the loss of her husband.Ethel recently celebrated her 115th birthday surrounded by friends, family, and caregivers. Beyond the impressive number, her story is a reminder that longevity is about quality as much as quantity. Her life teaches us that peace of mind, emotional balance, and simple joy can be the most effective ingredients for a long life.While we cannot all control our genetics or the eras we live through, Ethel’s simple rule offers actionable wisdom:Ethel’s philosophy aligns with scientific recommendations for longevity, which emphasize emotional health alongside physical health. Regular exercise, hydration, stress management, a balanced diet, and strong social connections are all essential. Emotional calmness and happiness have been shown to enhance immune function, reduce the risk of chronic disease, and improve overall life satisfaction.","Ethel Caterham is the world’s oldest living woman at the age of 115.

Michael Jordan’s reported $40 million NBC salary debunked,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/michael-jordans-reported-40-million-nbc-salary-debunked/articleshow/121346918.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Michael Jordan’s new NBC role and What’s has been confirmed so far

When Michael Jordan declared his return to the NBA scene —not as a player, but as a special contributor for NBC’s upcoming NBA coverage — rumors began to swirl. The most outrageous? That NBC had enticed the Chicago Bulls legend back with an unbelievable $40 million per year deal, making him the highest-paid sports analyst ever. But is that figure correct? Let’s distinguish fact from fiction.NBC revealed on May 12, 2025, that Michael Jordan will be part of its NBA broadcast team as a special contributor when the network gets back the NBA broadcasting rights for the 2025–26 season through an 11-year, $76 billion agreement. Jordan shared his enthusiasm, saying, “I am so excited to see the NBA back on NBC.”Another thing to note is that the specifics of Jordan's position are not entirely clear. Reports suggest that his main contributions will be pre-recorded segments shown during pregame and halftime, rather than live commentary. This limited role has sparked questions about the legitimacy of the reported $40 million annual pay.If the $40 million number is right, it would beat Tom Brady’s $37.5 million yearly deal with Fox Sports, making Jordan the highest-paid sports analyst ever. But, neither NBC nor Jordan’s team has verified this figure.Considering Jordan’s small role and his lack of experience in broadcasting, experts in the industry are doubtful about how accurate this number really is.Additionally, with Jordan's impressive net worth—around $3.5 billion, thanks to his thriving partnership with Nike's Air Jordan brand and various other business endeavors—the financial aspect might not be the main reason he's coming back to the NBA limelight.It looks like NBC is using Jordan to attract old fans and grow their audience for NBA games. Since he spent a large part of his playing career with NBC, watching the network replay all six of his Chicago Bulls titles feels nostalgic for fans who have followed him closely.Even though the precise information regarding Jordan's role and salary is not public, his engagement is likely to improve NBC's NBA coverage, which will also showcase notable figures like Mike Tirico, Noah Eagle, Jamal Crawford, Reggie Miller, and Carmelo Anthony.Michael Jordan's return to the NBA as a special contributor for NBC has created a lot of excitement. However, the claim that he's making $40 million a year hasn't been verified and seems a bit off considering his expected role.Also Read: LeBron James and Luka Doncic could get the center they desperately need and Celtics fans won’t like it While fans are eager to see his contributions to the broadcasts, the actual details of his contract are still a bit of a mystery. Right now, Jordan's return is a symbol of the link between the NBA's legendary past and its lively future, reigniting passion among basketball lovers.","Michael Jordan's return to the NBA as a special contributor for NBC has created a lot of excitement.

Chaos in the cabin: Viral video captures terrifying moments

Cyclonic system behind the storm

No injuries, but a frightening Experience

In a harrowing mid-air episode on May 21, 2025, IndiGo flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar encountered a violent hailstorm that left the aircraft’s nose visibly damaged. The Airbus A321, carrying 227 passengers, was battered by sudden turbulence that sparked panic in the cabin. A now-viral video from inside the aircraft captured terrified passengers, including children, screaming as the plane shook intensely and lightning flashed outside. The pilot declared an emergency but managed to land the aircraft safely in Srinagar around 6:30 PM. Thankfully, no injuries were reported, and the aircraft has since been grounded for inspection.Although IndiGo did not initially confirm the extent of the damage, viral photos have revealed that the aircraft's nose cone suffered significant structural damage. The damage is consistent with impact from large hailstones during the flight’s traversal of the storm system. The aircraft has since been grounded at Srinagar Airport for thorough inspection and repairs.The footage, widely circulated on social media, shows passengers in a state of fear and confusion as the aircraft shudders violently mid-air. Screams and cries from children dominate the audio, while flashes of lightning are visible through the windows. The cabin crew is seen attempting to maintain calm and ensure passenger safety as the aircraft fights through the intense weather.According to airline officials, the pilot of flight 6E 2142 reported an emergency to Srinagar Air Traffic Control upon encountering the hailstorm. Despite the hazardous conditions, the flight landed safely at approximately 6:30 PM. IndiGo stated that all protocols were followed and that the airport team attended to passengers' needs upon arrival.The incident coincided with a powerful storm that swept across Delhi-NCR on Wednesday evening, with wind speeds reaching up to 79 kmph. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported 12.2 mm of rainfall at Safdarjung between 5:30 PM and 8:30 PM. The sudden weather shift disrupted flight operations at Delhi Airport, left Metro services stranded, and caused chaos across the region.IMD attributed the turbulent weather to a cyclonic circulation over Haryana, embedded in a larger trough extending from Punjab to Bangladesh. Moisture influx from both the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal intensified the system, resulting in hailstorms and gusty winds across northern India.While there were no physical injuries reported among the 227 passengers, many described the experience as deeply unsettling. Trinamool Congress MPs, who were reportedly on board, later referred to the incident as a ""near-death experience."" IndiGo emphasized that customer well-being was prioritised upon landing.This incident serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictability of weather patterns and the challenges faced by pilots and crew during extreme conditions. While no one was harmed, the mental toll and the visible damage to the aircraft highlight the seriousness of such mid-air encounters.","IndiGo flight 6E 2142 from Delhi to Srinagar encountered a violent hailstorm that left the aircraft’s nose visibly damaged.

Indian-American Vaibhav Taneja , Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has garnered significant media attention for his extraordinary compensation package. In 2024, Taneja earned a staggering $139 million (approximately Rs 1,195.4 crore), surpassing top tech CEOs such as Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Sundar Pichai of Google, and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta. His pay package, which places him among the highest-paid finance executives in history, includes substantial stock options and equity grants granted after his promotion as CFO in 2023. Taneja's remarkable earnings reflect his pivotal role at Tesla, especially during a challenging period for the company.Vaibhav Taneja's overall compensation for 2024 is the highest among CFOs worldwide, according to reports. This compensation package not only eclipsed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Google CEO Sundar Pichai but also broke the previous quarterly CFO compensation record of $86 million by Nikola's previous CFO in 2020. Much of Taneja's compensation package is made up of stock options and equity grants, which were issued upon his promotion as CFO in August 2023. While his base pay was $400,000 (Rs 3.44 crore roughly), most of his compensation was performance-based to shares, aligning his fiscal interests with Tesla's long-term success.Taneja's compensation package places him far above his colleagues in the tech industry. For instance, Satya Nadella took home a total salary package of $79.1 million (approximately Rs 680 crore) in 2024, and Sundar Pichai took home $10.7 million (approximately Rs 92 crore). Taneja's compensation is orders of magnitude higher than that, an indicator of his business-critical significance at Tesla during a challenging period for the company.Vaibhav Taneja kick-started his career in business in India with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Delhi University in 1999. He then went on to become a Chartered Accountant (CA) from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) in 2000. In 2006, he also became the illustrious Certified Public Accountant (CPA) of the United States, once again establishing himself as an accounting and finance expert.Taneja spent close to 17 years in PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and bridged both India and the United States. He acquired valuable experience in auditing, regulation compliance, and financial services during his time working for PwC, which laid a solid foundation for his subsequent career in the corporate sector.In 2016, Taneja broke into the industry when he joined SolarCity, a solar energy firm that later merged with Tesla. This was the start of his association with Elon Musk's electric car firm. After Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2017, Taneja became Assistant Corporate Controller. He advanced within the company and was later appointed Corporate Controller in 2018 and Chief Accounting Officer in 2019.In August 2023, Taneja was promoted to Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Zach Kirkhorn. Taneja, in his position as Chief Financial Officer, manages the finances of Tesla and is also a senior member of the company's strategic decision-making groups.Besides his international roles, Vaibhav Taneja serves as a director at Tesla India Motors and Energy Private Limited. In this role, Taneja has a key responsibility of charting the expansion of Tesla in India, a country with immense potential for the growth of electric vehicles (EVs). His contribution to Tesla's efforts to enter the Indian market is significant since the company is trying to build a bigger presence in one of the world's fastest-growing car markets.Although Taneja's pay is certainly generous, it is occurring at a tough time for Tesla. The firm has several concerns that it has to address, such as declining profit margins, enhanced competition in the EV space, and declining vehicle deliveries. In the first quarter of 2025, Tesla posted a decline of 13% in worldwide deliveries and its net profit fell by 71%, its first annual decline in deliveries in more than a decade. Despite all these challenges, Taneja's leadership and vision of guidance are considered essential in steering through these rough waters.Vaibhav Taneja an Indian-origin executive and Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer net worth in 2025, received a jaw-dropping paycheck worth $139 million in 2024. His financial success is driven by his experience at Tesla and the extremely valuable stock options he has accumulated over the years. His better returns reflect his top-level financial expertise and his skill level in a complex finance environment, both in his present role at Tesla and overall.Vaibhav Taneja's ascension to the position of prominence as Tesla's CFO is an inspirational rags-to-riches story, one that encapsulates the colossal benefits of leadership positions in corporate life. With more than two decades as part of a shining career marked by turning points at PwC, SolarCity, and Tesla, Taneja has emerged as one of the most distinguished finance executives of today. His record-breaking compensation package, along with his visionary role in Tesla's international expansion, cements his reputation as a powerful player in the electric vehicle and corporate finance circles. As Tesla battles on in the crowded EV market, Taneja's leadership and experience will be a deciding element in the company's ongoing success.","Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has garnered significant media attention for his extraordinary compensation package.

Xbox and PlayStation Price Hikes Explained

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the US federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines. Musk quoted a post by DOGE aka the Department of Government Efficiency which revealed that nearly 20% of the phone lines at a federal agency were unused. DOGE shared a post on X that reads “Unused phone lines! Of the 1048 @USOPM phone lines, 198 (19%) were either unused or duplicated.”It further added: “OPM (Office of Personnel Management) cancelled these lines (took 1 hour), resulting in ~$100k/yr in savings. Since OPM is ~0.1% of the federal government, this suggests that ~$100M/yr is wasted on unused lines”.The tech billionaire responded to the post, statingThe revelation could have broader implications for telecom providers supplying services to federal agencies. According to a 2023 Washington Post report, only 2% of U.S. adults use landlines exclusively. As legacy landline usage continues to decline—the cost and necessity of maintaining unused infrastructure is under increasing scrutiny.In 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed regulations that had previously required telecom providers to run copper landline connections to every home. The move marked a significant shift toward modernizing telecommunications infrastructure in favor of wireless and fiber-optic networks.According to a report, Verizon Communications Inc. remains the dominant landline service provider in the Northeastern United States, maintaining a strong regional presence even as overall landline use continues to decline nationwide.",Tesla CEO Elon Musk highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the US federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines.

What and Why of Walmart Boycott

Walmart on Walmart Boycott

As one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the country, not only do we pay our fair share, we are an economic force multiplier strengthening communities nationwide through job creation, supplier growth, and over $1.7 billion in cash and in-kind donations last year,'' it read. "" We remain dedicated to earning the business of all Americans and giving our time and resources to causes that uplift and unite communities who rely on us every day.""

Dates of other planned boycotts

June 3-9: Target

June 24-30: McDonald's

July 4: Independence Day Blackout

The Walmart Boycott is back. The world’s largest retailer faces renewed calls for a nationwide boycott led by The People’s Union USA , the same group behind the weeklong protest in April. The organizers are urging consumers to shun Walmart and its subsidiaries, including Sam’s Club, Walmart Pharmacy, and Walmart+, citing ongoing concerns over the company’s labor practices and community impact. The organisers of the nationwide protests are same.Walmart Boycott starts on May 20 and ends on May 26.The People’s Union USA group encouraged consumers to boycott Walmart because it believes the retailer has contributed to economic corruption. They are protesting against companies that have rolled back their Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) efforts after President Donald Trump's efforts to eliminate federal DEI programs since taking office.According to the group’s website, it aims to “expose corruption and exploitation” and “hold corporations accountable” for unethical business practices that have kept Americans “divided, distracted, and struggling for decades.”“We’re using the one tool that always makes them listen, money,” said The People’s Union USA on its website. “Economic resistance is our frontline weapon. And behind that, we’ve got something they’ll never understand: resilience, strength, and the will to endure. They raise prices, we stop spending. They ignore our voices, we cut their profits. They divide, we unite.” “What we can do is hold these companies accountable for not paying their fair share of taxes, for price gouging and for inequality,” said John Schwarz, the group's founder.In a statement to USA TODAY, Walmart spokesperson said, ""The group has been organizing “economic blackouts” of large corporations since February this year. So far, it has organized specific boycotts aimed at Amazon and General Mills. After the current Walmart boycott concludes, Target and McDonald’s are next on its list.In related news, Walmart has responded to Donald Trump’s criticism where he suggested that the retailer should “Eat The Tariffs” rather than passing the increased prices onto consumers. Walmart spokesperson Joe Pennington told USA Today that the company has always worked to keep prices as low as possible and will continue doing so as long as it can. “We have always worked to keep our prices as low as possible and we won’t stop,” Pennington said, adding “We'll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins.”","The People’s Union USA group encouraged consumers to boycott Walmart because it believes the retailer has contributed to economic corruption.

Asian markets stabilise as US bond yields retreat after tax-cutting budget clears key hurdle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/asian-markets-stabilise-as-us-bond-yields-retreat-after-tax-cutting-budget-clears-key-hurdle/articleshow/121352653.cms,"Key market figures at 02:30 GMT:

Asian stock markets calmed on Friday after a rough day, helped by a drop in US bond yields and hopes for more economic stability. Investors were watching closely after US President Donald Trump 's new tax-cutting budget passed a key vote in the House of Representatives.The bill, called the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,” extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts for another 10 years. It also cuts funding to some social programmes, which has caused concern. Experts say the plan could increase the US deficit by up to $4 trillion over the next decade, though the White House argues it will help the economy grow fast enough to cover the costs.US markets were shaken earlier in the week after weak demand for a 20-year government bond sale and credit rating agency Moody's downgraded the country's top credit rating. These events raised fears about the growing US debt, now at $36 trillion.However, US bond yields pulled back after the tax bill passed the House, giving a boost to stocks. Better-than-expected data on jobs, home sales, and factory activity also supported market confidence.In Asia, markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul and Manila all rose. However, Singapore, Jakarta, Taipei, and Wellington struggled to keep up.There was also some optimism from US federal reserve governor Christopher Waller, who said interest rates could be cut later this year if Trump's tariffs on imports are reduced.In Japan, the yen rose slightly against the US dollar after inflation data showed a rise in food prices, especially rice. This puts pressure on the Bank of Japan as it considers what to do next with interest rates.Meanwhile, bitcoin continued to surge, reaching a new record high of $111,980.33. Investors are hopeful about a new law that could bring clearer rules to the cryptocurrency world, especially for stablecoins, digital currencies tied to the US dollar.Tokyo - Nikkei 225: Up 0.8% at 37,280.84Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: Up 0.3% at 23,624.64Shanghai - Composite: Up 0.1% at 3,383.81Dollar/yen: Down at 143.88 from 143.99Euro/dollar: Up at $1.1295 from $1.1281Pound/dollar: Up at $1.3432 from $1.3419West Texas Intermediate: Down 0.6% at $60.86 per barrelBrent North Sea Crude: Down 0.5% at $64.12 per barrelNew York - Dow Jones: Flat at 41,859.09London - FTSE 100: Down 0.5% at 8,739.26","Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Seoul and Manila all rose.

Stock market today: Nifty50 and BSE Sensex , the Indian equity benchmark indices, opened in green on Friday. While Nifty50 was above 24,600, BSE Sensex was up marginally. At 9:16 AM, Nifty50 was trading at 24,636.30, up 27 points or 0.11%. BSE Sensex was at 80,967.34, up 15 points or 0.019%.Indian equity markets declined on Thursday, influenced by negative signals from US markets. Despite global pressures, analysts indicate that a possible India-US trade agreement and strong domestic economic indicators could maintain market stability within ranges.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Investments Limited says, “After the 14 percent pull back from the March lows the market is struggling to find direction. It appears that the sustained FII buying which played the important role in this rally has run out of steam. The big FII selling on 20th and 22nd of this month indicates that the FIIs may again turn sellers if the global environment turns unfavourable. There are some global concerns arising out of the sharp rise in bond yields in US and Japan. Particularly the sharp spike in US bond yields with the 30-year yield touching 5.14 % and the 10-year yield at 4.52% reflect concerns surrounding the US debt levels and its fall out on global financial markets.It remains to be seen how this pans out.”“The silver lining from the market perspective is India’s strong macros particularly the resilient growth and declining inflation and interest rates. Even when the market turns weak domestic demand driven segments like financials, telecom, aviation etc are resilient and this is reflected in the strength in the stock prices of the big boys in these segments like ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel and Interglobe Aviation. This message from the market is important.""US markets ended Thursday's volatile session relatively unchanged, recovering from early losses as Treasury yields decreased following House approval of the President's fiscal legislation.Asian markets opened cautiously on Friday, with Treasury bonds maintaining Thursday's gains, indicating reduced concerns about US fiscal matters that affected markets earlier.Gold prices are heading towards their strongest weekly performance in more than a month this Friday, driven by a weakening dollar and increasing worries about the financial outlook of the United States, enhancing its status as a reliable investment.Oil prices declined on Friday due to a strengthening US dollar and potential increases in OPEC+ oil production.
