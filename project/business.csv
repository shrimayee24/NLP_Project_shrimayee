NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday agreed to adjudicate three petitions which allege that amendment to Right to Information (RTI) Act through the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act has rendered the former legislation toothless by providing a handle to authorities to deny information on the ground that it is ""personal"", but turned down the plea for staying the provision in DPDP Act that puts the right to privacy above the right to information.Senior advocates A M Singhvi, Vrinda Grover and counsel Prashant Bhushan, appearing for three PIL petitioners, told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that while the RTI Act had originally exempted personal information which did not have any correlation with the person's public activity, the present amendment to RTI Act through DPDP Act bars all ""information which relates to personal matters"".The bench said it would examine the concern of petitioners while keeping in mind the need to balance the right to privacy with the right to information.""To some extent, it is a complex, sensitive yet interesting issue which needs balancing,"" the bench said while firmly rejecting Bhushan's plea for a stay on the amended Section 8(1)(j) of RTI Act.""The unamended Section 8(1)(j) was not a mere statutory exception; it embodied a legislatively mandated proportionality mechanism.

“Deal Is A Key Priority For Both Sides” Us Expert Lauds India-Us Trade Pact

Parliamentary approval process underway

Double contributions convention to be implemented in parallel

Tariff reductions and market access

The India-UK free trade agreement signed in July last year is expected to be implemented from April 2026, a government official said.India and the United Kingdom signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on July 24, 2025, under which 99 per cent of Indian exports will enter the British market at zero duty, while India will reduce tariffs on a range of British goods including cars and whisky.“We are expecting the pact to be implemented from April this year,” the official said, as quoted by news agency PTI.The agreement requires approval from the UK Parliament before it can take effect. In India, such trade agreements are cleared by the Union Cabinet.According to PTI, after ratification by the British Parliament, the pact will be implemented on a mutually agreed date. The House of Commons held a debate on the India-UK CETA earlier this week.Chris Bryant, minister of state in the UK Department for Business and Trade, responded during the debate on behalf of the Labour government, describing CETA as a significant achievement that goes “well beyond India's precedent in opening the door for UK businesses”.The British Parliament is currently ratifying the agreement, including debates in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, along with committee reviews, before implementation in the coming months.Alongside CETA, the two countries have signed a Double Contributions Convention (DCC) pact to prevent temporary workers from having to pay social security contributions in both countries.The official said both CETA and the DCC are likely to be implemented in parallel, as per PTI.CETA aims to double bilateral trade, currently estimated at $56 billion, between the world’s fifth and sixth largest economies by 2030.Under the agreement, India will reduce import duties on Scotch whisky from 150 per cent to 75 per cent immediately, with a further reduction to 40 per cent by 2035.Also read| India-UK trade deal: From 99% duty-free access to benefits for Indian professionals - Here’s the FTA in 10 big numbers Import duties on automobiles will be cut to 10 per cent over five years from the current levels of up to 110 per cent, under a quota-based liberalisation system.In return, Indian exporters are set to gain improved access to the UK market for goods such as textiles, footwear, gems and jewellery, sports goods and toys.India has also agreed to lower tariffs on British consumer products including chocolates, biscuits and cosmetics.During his visit to India in 2025, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed the desire for the agreement to be implemented as soon as “humanly possible.”Speaking in Mumbai in October last year, Starmer described the trade deal as Britain’s largest post-Brexit trade achievement and said he had instructed his team to ensure it is executed “as quickly as humanly possible”.Also read| India-UK trade deal: Starmer wants FTA implementation as soon as 'humanly possible'! The agreement was signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to London in July 2025.Economists estimate the pact could increase trade between the two countries by about £25.5 billion ($34 billion) by 2040, with UK officials describing that figure as a starting point for further growth.If implemented as expected in April 2026, the agreement would mark a significant step in expanding bilateral economic ties and reducing tariff barriers across key sectors.","India and the United Kingdom signed the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) on July 24, 2025.

India Speeds Up Chenab Hydropower Projects, Redrawing Indus Rivers Water Control Lines For Pakistan

JAMMU: India is preparing to stop surplus water from the Ravi flowing into Pakistan once the Shahpur Kandi dam on Punjab-J&K border becomes operational, marking a long-awaited shift in use of eastern river waters of Indus basin.J&K minister Javed Ahmed Rana said Monday the dam is expected to be completed by March 31 and is a priority for drought-prone Kathua and Samba districts. Officials said the project will irrigate about 5,000 hectares in Punjab and more than 32,173 hectares across Kathua and Samba in J&K. Central assistance of Rs 485.38 crore was approved for the irrigation component.Former irrigation minister Taj Mohideen said the dam falls outside Indus Waters Treaty because India has exclusive rights over the Ravi. Rana added that suspension of the treaty has accelerated power and dam projects in J&K.The 1960 treaty divides the Indus system’s waters, designating eastern rivers (Sutlej, Beas, Ravi) to India and western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab) to Pakistan. India put the treaty in abeyance after the April 2025 terrorist attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 people, a sharp policy shift aimed at pressuring Pakistan over cross-border terrorism.The move halted data sharing and opened the door for greater use of western river waters.Part of the Ravi flows unused through Madhopur into Pakistan despite demand in Punjab and J&K, Rana said, stressing that the dam would curb such wastage. Projects like Shahpur Kandi are critical to reallocating flows towards domestic irrigation and away from downstream discharge.The project was first cleared in Nov 2001 but stalled for years amid interstate disputes. After a series of bilateral and central meetings, Punjab and J&K reached an agreement in Sept 2018. Union cabinet chaired by PM Narendra Modi approved implementation on Dec 6 that year.Bani MLA Dr Rameshwar Singh said residents had waited years for completion. “Once it is completed, the water will no longer flow into Pakistan but will instead be used to irrigate our own vast areas in Kathua,” he said.","India is preparing to stop surplus water from the Ravi flowing into Pakistan once the Shahpur Kandi dam on Punjab-J&K border becomes operational.

‘Crucial Role For India In AI Governance’: Duncan Cass-Beggs At AI Summit

‘Tech Produces Great Value, But Also Turmoil’

BENGALURU: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said even as artificial intelligence technology produces great value, it will also bring big economic turmoil. So it is important, he said, to ensure everyone shares in the benefits, and urged India, as the world's largest democracy, to use AI to make governance more efficient and citizen-centric. ""That's a really valuable use of the technology,"" Amodei said at the maiden edition of Anthropic's Builder Summit in Bengaluru on Monday.Anthropic, valued at $380 billion and whose AI products are used widely by enterprises to make coding more efficient, recently launched a slew of new tools for other enterprise functions like legal, sales and marketing that caused a collapse in the share prices of software and IT services companies around the world.Amodei's visit coincided with the AI company launching its Bengaluru operations. Speaking to some 250 developers and entrepreneurs, he noted that the technical intensity of AI adoption in India tends to be higher than elsewhere. He said he's heard ministry of statistics is building an AI system to query economic data and statistics. ""Generally, govt bodies elsewhere don't move this fast,"" he said.Anthropic's business run rate revenue in India, he said, has doubled over the past four months.""It's just really incredible... It mirrors the general progress and explosion in Claude models and coding models. But I think it's even more extreme in India than we've seen in other places of the world.""Amodei also pointed to India's extraordinary scale as a catalyst for innovation. ""You can run experiments with hundreds of millions of people. That scale allows entrepreneurs and builders to pivot quickly and learn faster in ways that simply aren't possible in smaller markets.""He said India's linguistic diversity as a powerful driver for AI innovation. It enables, he said, building tools interoperate across languages, make translation easier, and enable true multilingual capabilities. Claude, he said, is working hard to support the long tail of languages, and ""with so many regional languages in India, I've seen some cool applications, including in the non-profit and social benefit space. ""On the philosophy of his 38-page essay 'The Adolescence of Technology', Amodei said, ""We need to understand that this technology is really going to change the world at a speed and to a degree that we haven't seen with any other technology before. That may sound hyperbolic, but if we look at the rate of improvement, diffusion, and adoption, it's something that has no real precedent in modern history."" The essay emphasises core principles aimed at protecting against the worst-case risks posed by AI.Amodei highlighted the transformative potential of AI in specialised fields such as medicine and biology, noting that innovations rooted in the physical world are likely to create the most defensible businesses. ""I really encourage people to build where AI intersects with areas like medicine and health. The biggest moats will come from applications tied to the physical world - things that aren't easy to do and require specialised skills. Biology and medicine fit all of those criteria. It's a complex, knowledge-heavy space that involves navigating regulatory systems, but that hard work will lead to durable businesses. So I strongly encourage builders to move in that direction.""",Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei urges India to use AI to make governance more efficient and citizen-centric.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Navy is gearing up to mark a defining moment in India's maritime story as Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25, placing the 'City of Destiny' once again at the heart of India's Indo-Pacific strategy.“The current edition of IFR and MILAN exercise will be larger in scope and deeper in meaning as navies of 72 countries, including US and Russia, will participate and the mega joint naval events will feature over 60 warships and naval aircraft of three countries,” said a Navy source. The IFR will position India’s eastern seaboard as a focal point for naval diplomacy and multilateral maritime engagement. Warships and assets from Germany, Philippines, and UAE are participating for the first time, including the Philippines' ‘BRP Miguel Malvar’ (FFG-06) and a UAE Navy warship, Al Emarat. Since 2001, India has used IFRs and opened its ports to allied navies to project maritime strength, foster international cooperation, and establish its role in blue water operations.The star of Operation Sindoor’s naval leg, aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, is all set to be the centre of attraction at the fleet review. The Vikrant carrier battle group deployed in the northern Arabian Sea, played a key role in the strategy of compellence, thereby forcing the Pakistan Navy to be in a defensive posture and requesting an urgent ceasefire.For the IFR, it will sail to the Bay of Bengal. China and Turkey have not been invited for the event and the decision is reportedly linked to their military support to Pakistan during last year’s conflict in May.President Droupadi Murmu, Governor S Abdul Nazeer and Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu will attend the IFR on Feb 18, while defence minister Rajnath Singh will participate in Milan-2026 on Feb 19.MILAN 26 will bring together navies from friendly foreign countries to strengthen professional bonds, share best practices and enhance cooperation at sea. Milan’s sea and harbour phases will focus on interoperability, maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, air defence, and search-and-rescue operations.Significantly, the IFR will coincide with the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium's conclave of chiefs, showcasing India's convening power in a contested region. Beyond the warships at sea, the International City Parade will carry naval camaraderie into the streets, while a high-level maritime seminar will sharpen the intellectual edge of the gathering. These events promise to elevate IFR and MILAN 2026 beyond ritual, transforming them into platforms for strategic dialogue, operational trust and enduring people-to-people engagement.Technology will feature prominently at IFR 2026, but with a clear lesson: technology amplifies capacity, but governance shapes effects. Drones, autonomous surface and subsurface vehicles, and AI-enabled maritime domain awareness tools can multiply the reach of a modest fleet.The fleet review is a time-honoured naval tradition that assembles ships and sailors from friendly foreign navies, serving as a platform for confidence-building, mutual respect, and operational familiarity.end","Visakhapatnam will host both the International Fleet Review (IFR) and Exercise MILAN from Feb 15 to 25.

NEW DELHI: The legal battle over Sonam Wangchuk 's detention seems to be stuck at the transcript of his speech. Pointing out discrepancies in the speech of the climate activist in Ladakhi language and the translated transcript relied upon by govt authorities, his wife Gitanjali Angmo Monday told the court the alleged words on the basis of which the detention order was passed were never uttered by him.A bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and PB Varale prima facie found merit in the allegation and said there seems to be variance. ""If the speech is of 3 minutes and your transcription goes on for 7-8 minutes, there is certainly malice in that,"" it said.Taking note of the submission by senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for Wangchuk's wife, the bench said: ""In a lighter vein, there's this couplet, ""humne woh sun liya jo unhone kaha hi nahi (we heard what they didn't say at all)"". To which Sibal responded, ""Aur jo hum keh rahe hain unhone suna hi nahi (and they haven't heard what we are saying)"".Challenging the detention, Sibal told the bench that the detaining authority relied upon an incorrect transcript of Wangchuk's speech and the authority's decision was based on non-existent material. He placed before the bench a comparative analysis of what the activist had said and the translated version relied upon by the govt to buttress his submission to the bench.After going through the chart, the bench told additional solicitor general K M Natraj, ""The tabular list you have filed, some of these things don't even find a place in the detention order. There should be at least the correct transcript of what he (Wangchuk) says! There should not be a variance."" The ASG replied that the translation was done by a govt department. The bench said AI could be used for translation with 98% accuracy, at least.Sibal then moved to another point of submission and contended that the videos which were relied upon by the detaining authority were not provided to the activist which is also violation of law, making the detention illegal.He told the court that the four videos of his speeches, which were cited by the detaining authority in the detention order, were not there in the pendrive which was handed over to him on Sept 29.The bench directed the Jodhpur jail superintendent to produce in a sealed box the pendrive given by the govt authority to Wangchuk. ""The learned senior counsel would submit that the pendrive furnished to detenu on 29th Sept 2025, is in his custody... we direct the same pendrive... shall be obtained in a sealed box...,"" the bench said in its order.",The legal battle over Sonam Wangchuk's detention seems to be stuck at the transcript of his speech.

NEW DELHI: The AI Impact Summit 2026 marks a shift in India's AI story - from cloud-heavy, software-led narratives to physical, deployable AI embedded in machines, devices and infrastructure.Spread across 70,000 square metres at Bharat Mandapam at the national capital, the summit is less about future promises and more about AI already at work: robots in healthcare and factories, drones in farms, and wearables in public services.Inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the five-day summit, from Feb 16 to 20, brings together over 300 curated pavilions and over 600 startups cutting across sectors. The emphasis throughout the exhibition floor is on deployment rather than demos. Autonomous drones scan crops for disease, wearable devices assist frontline health workers, industrial robots demonstrate predictive maintenance, and AI-powered tools translate court judgments and govt documents into Indian languages.Global technology giants have mounted some of the largest and most crowded showcases. Google's pavilion highlights applications ranging from climate modelling and extreme weather prediction to language tools and its AI cricket coach, tailored for Indian users.Microsoft is showcasing secure AI platforms for governance, public services and enterprise adoption, while Nvidia has drawn steady crowds with live demonstrations of GPU-powered robotics, real-time simulations and industrial AI systems, underlining the growing importance of high-performance computing. Open AI, Qualcomm, Amazon Web Services, and Schneider Electric are also present, positioning their platforms for large, diverse markets such as India, with a sharp focus on scale, cost efficiency and compliance.Equally prominent is the presence of India's own tech majors. Tata Group's showcase spans manufacturing, mobility and digital public infrastructure, demonstrating how AI is being integrated into traditional industries. HCL Tech has focused on enterprise AI, secure data systems and responsible deployment frameworks, while Reliance Industries is highlighting applications in telecom, retail and cloud infrastructure.The summit's international character is reinforced by country pavilions from Japan, the UK, and Germany, hosting live demonstrations and bilateral discussions. Senior members of global technology firms are attending closed door sessions and public interactions, using the platform to explore partnerships and policy alignment in one of the world's fastest-growing AI markets.Despite the heavy presence of big tech, the energy on the floor is driven just as much by startups, students and young innovators. Youth zones are packed with school and college teams presenting solutions for precision farming, healthcare diagnostics, climate resilience and education, many designed to work offline or in regional languages. ""Cost is our biggest constraint,"" said Shashwat Ranjan, a computer science student developing an AI-based mental health tool. ""Running models for college projects is expensive. Being here helps us understand how to build affordable systems that can actually scale.""Several pavilions highlight indigenous foundation models trained on Indian datasets and designed to support all 22 official languages, backed by domestic compute infrastructure and governed by local data protection frameworks. Officials say the aim is to ensure AI systems reflect Indian realities and remain accessible to startups, researchers and public institutions.","The AI Impact Summit 2026 marks a shift in India's AI story. The emphasis throughout the exhibition floor is on deployment rather than demos. The five-day summit, from Feb 16 to 20, brings together over 300 curated pavilions and over 600 startups.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128438921,imgsize-52894,width-400,resizemode-4/from-robots-in-healthcare-to-drones-scanning-crops-its-india-story-at-work.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a significant step towards regulating and scaling artificial intelligence in public healthcare, Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda will on Tuesday launch two landmark national initiatives — a policy roadmap and a testing platform — aimed at ensuring AI tools are safe, accountable and ready for real-world deployment.At the India AI Summit at Bharat Mandapam, Nadda will unveil the Strategy for Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare for India (SAHI) and BODH, the Benchmarking Open Data Platform for Health AI.SAHI lays down the country’s first structured framework to guide how AI should be integrated into hospitals, public health programmes and digital health systems. The strategy makes clear that AI must assist doctors and health workers, not replace them, and should operate within clear guardrails of transparency, accountability and equity. It sets out a national direction on governance, data stewardship, validation standards and responsible deployment, while encouraging innovation aligned with public health priorities.Alongside it, BODH is designed as a national evaluation platform to test AI tools before they are rolled out at scale. Developed by IIT Kanpur in collaboration with the National Health Authority under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, the platform allows AI models to be benchmarked on diverse, real-world health data without sharing or exposing patient information.The aim is to ensure that AI systems perform reliably across different hospitals, regions and patient populations.Officials say the twin initiatives mark a shift from experimentation to structured oversight, as AI tools increasingly enter areas such as diagnostics, clinical decision support, claims management and disease surveillance. By combining a national policy framework with a privacy-preserving testing mechanism, the government is seeking to balance innovation with safety in one of the most sensitive sectors — healthcare.The launches come amid the five-day India AI Summit 2026, being hosted in the Global South for the first time, where health AI has emerged as a key pillar of India’s digital public infrastructure push.","Union Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda will on Tuesday launch two landmark national initiatives.

Addressing a programme to mark the occasion in the national Capital, the President said that the Santhal community has its own language, literature and culture.“However, due to the lack of its own script, the Santhali language was initially written in the Roman, Devanagari, Oriya, and Bengali scripts. Members of the Santal community living in Nepal, Bhutan, and Mauritius also used to write in the scripts prevalent in those countries. These scripts were not able to correctly pronounce the original words of the Santhali language. In 1925, Pandit Raghunath Murmu invented the Ol Chiki script,” she highlighted.“Since then, it has been used for the Santhali language. Now, this script is a powerful symbol of Santhal identity worldwide.It is also an effective means of establishing unity among the Santhal community,” Murmu said.The President said that the centenary celebrations of Ol Chiki should be an occasion to resolve for promoting this script. “While children can get education in Hindi, English, Oriya and Bengali, or any other language, they should also learn their mother tongue, Santhali, in the Ol Chiki script,” she added.The President was happy to note that many writers are enriching Santhali literature through their works. She advised them to awaken people through their writings. She also expressed happiness over the Santhali language growing in the digital medium.“Language and literature are the threads that uphold unity within the communities. The exchange of literature can enrich languages. Efforts should be made to make Santhali literature accessible to students of other languages through translation and writing and vice versa,” the President said.On the occasion, Murmu released a commemorative coin and postage stamp on the completion of 100 years of Ol Chiki. She also felicitated 10 achievers from the Santal community for promoting wide use of Ol Chiki script among the Santhali people.Union minister for tribal affairs, Jual Oram, culture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, and culture secretary, Vivek Aggarwal, were present at the event.Last year in December, the President had participated in a centenary celebration of the script in Jamshedpur in Jharkhand. To expand constitutional awareness and accessibility, the Constitution of India was officially translated into the Santhali language using the Ol Chiki script and released in December 2025 by President Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Published by the legislative department of the ministry of law and justice, this marked the first time that the nation’s foundational legal text became available in Santhali in its own indigenous script.Santhali language, one of India’s prominent tribal languages spoken widely across Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Assam, and Bihar. Belonging to the Austroasiatic language family, Santhali has historically thrived through these oral traditions. However, while this strength ensured cultural continuity, the absence of a standardised script posed significant challenges for documentation, formal education, and literary development.Ol Chiki script was developed in 1925 by Pandit Raghunath Murmu specifically for the Santhali language, which was later included in the Constitution of India’s Eighth Schedule in 2003. The script consists of 30 letters designed to accurately represent Santhali phonetics.","President of India Droupadi Murmu described the Ol Chiki script as a ""powerful symbol"" of the Santhali identity. “It is also an effective means of establishing unity among the Santhal community,” she added.

‘I Challenge Rahul Gandhi’: Amit Shah Slams Cong For ‘Misleading Farmers’ On India-US Trade Deal

NEW DELHI: Not ruling out a nationwide movement against the Indo-US trade deal and accepting home minister Amit Shah’s challenge for a debate, Congress said the US production of jowar, maize, soybean and cotton is at such a higher scale that their import will completely overwhelm the farmers of India.AICC spokesman and MP Randeep Surjewala told a press conference that India produces 43 million metric tonnes of maize annually compared to the US’ 425 million MT; India’s annual sorghum output of 5.2 million MT is lower than 8.7 million MT in the US; and India produces 15.3 million tonnes of Soybean as compared to 120 million tonnes by the US.Surjewala said the US has been looking for a market for its vast production of these grains which the Modi govt has accepted by agreeing to import DDG (processed maize), Soya oil and red sorghum. “What will the farmers of Central India, northern India, western India and some southern states do when these imports come at reduced or zero tariffs,” he asked.He called the deal a “one-sided and unequal agreement” that undermines India’s sovereignty and domestic economic priorities.To the challenge thrown by home minister Shah on the trade deal, Surjewala said Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge has nominated him to debate the trade deal with the minister and BJP, and urged the ruling party to decide the time and venue.The Congress MP said cotton poses an equally serious challenge after commerce minister Piyush Goyal’s remark that India too would get Bangladesh-type zero-tariff access to US on textiles in exchange for importing cotton.Stating that India has surplus cotton produce which it exports to Bangladesh while also satisfying its domestic demand, Surjewala said importing cotton from the US would hurt the cotton producing farmers of Maharashtra, Gujarat, MP, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. Additionally, he said Bangladesh, which buys 50% of its cotton requirement from India, will now stop those imports and source cotton from the US. “This is called a double whammy,” he remarked.He said the commitment to remove “non-tariff barriers” means India may allow import of GM agricultural products, and weaken procurement and subsidies for farmers.","AICC spokesman and MP Randeep Surjewala said the US production of jowar, maize, soybean and cotton is at such a higher scale that their import will completely overwhelm the farmers of India.

He argued that a satisfactory justification for the 259-day delay had been placed before the high court, but it was incorrectly rejected.Agreeing to examine the issues raised by the state, the bench issued notice to the contractor and sought his response.In the legal dispute between the government and a Kota-based contractor, a trial court in September 2023 held that the state had breached the contract for road construction and directed the refund of ₹6.35 lakh to the company along with 6% annual interest. The state filed an appeal in the Rajasthan High Court in July 2024, well after the mandatory limitation period had expired in November 2023.The high court refused to condone the delay and dismissed the appeal in August 2024 without examining the merits of the case. Challenging the high court’s order, advocate Asthana told the Supreme Court that the High Court had wrongly dismissed the state’s well-reasoned condonation of delay application. The application had clearly explained that the appeal could not be filed within the statutory period due to unforeseen reasons, including a change in the state government and the delayed process of appointing lawyers.“The high court failed to appreciate that there were three main reasons cited for the delay in the condonation application: (1) change in lawyers following the change in state government, (2) concerned officials being deputed due to the state assembly elections and subsequently the 2024 parliamentary elections, and (3) the enforcement of the model code of conduct during the election period,” the state said in its plea.As the court was informed that attachment warrants had been issued against government properties by the executing court — and movable property, including furniture and vehicles, had already been seized and attached — the Supreme Court decided to pass an interim order staying the attachment proceedings.“The high court erroneously dismissed the condonation of delay application and, consequently, the petitioners’ appeal itself through a wholly arbitrary, unreasonable, and erroneous final order. It gravely erred in observing that there was falsity in either the condonation of delay application or the additional affidavit. The High Court order suffers from arbitrariness and non-application of mind and ought to be set aside,” the petition stated.","The top court stayed the proceedings against it.

Build next-gen propulsion systems: Defence minister tells GTRE; India-France Joint Dialogue in B’luru tomorrow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/build-next-gen-propulsion-systems-defence-minister-tells-gtre-india-france-joint-dialogue-in-bluru-tomorrow/articleshow/128423260.cms,"Photo credit: Rajnath Singh post on X

BENGALURU: Defence minister Rajnath Singh Monday visited DRDO’s Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE) in Bengaluru, where he reviewed the progress of indigenous military gas turbine engine programmes, including the long-running, much-delayed Kaveri engine project.On Tuesday, Singh, along with French minister of defence Catherine Vautrin, will inaugurate the Tata Advanced Systems’ final assembly line for the Airbus H125 helicopter in Kolar. Vautrin, who is arriving in Bengaluru early Tuesday for the “India France Annual Bilateral Dailogue”, is expected to receive a formal guard of honour along with Singh at the HAL airport here.During the visit on Monday, Singh called on GTRE to focus on next-generation propulsion systems and build a nationwide ecosystem to support advanced engine development. Referring to India’s plans for the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), he said the country must move beyond fifth-generation capabilities.“We cannot limit ourselves to only 5th generation engines. We must begin the development of 6th generation, advanced technologies as soon as possible,” he said, highlighting the growing role of AI, machine learning and new materials in propulsion technologies.Describing aero engine development as a complex integration of thermodynamics, materials science, fluid mechanics and advanced mechanical engineering, Singh noted that even advanced nations take 25 to 30 years to develop next-generation engines.He urged Indian scientists to compress timelines in view of strategic requirements.“We must assume that 20 years have already passed and we now have only 5–7 years left,” he said. Referring to Operation Sindoor, he said the armed forces had demonstrated growing self-reliance through the use of indigenous communication systems, surveillance equipment and weapon platforms. He also welcomed joint studies with the UK and France under the National Aero Engine Mission, stating that such partnerships would help India understand technological challenges while building domestic capability.Singh was briefed on ongoing engine development efforts, collaboration with Indian industry, academia and research institutions, and the technical support extended to the armed forces. Singh toured an exhibition of indigenously developed engines and components and witnessed a full afterburner engine test of the Kaveri engine, a key milestone in India’s push for aero engine self-reliance.Interacting with scientists and officials, Singh described DRDO as the foundation of India’s strategic capability and stressed the need to achieve Aatmanirbharta in aero engine technology amid a shifting geopolitical landscape. “Supply chains are breaking and new ecosystems are developing. Nations possessing indigenous critical technologies will remain safe, secure and sustain themselves,” he said, reiterating the govt’s commitment to self-reliance.Secretary, department of defence R&D and DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat, along with senior GTRE scientists and officials, were present during the visit.","Defence minister Rajnath Singh Monday visited DRDO’s Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE) in Bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Akhilesh Prasad Singh made a stark remark against Om Birla 's Bangladesh visit calling it a reward from the Centre for not letting the Leader of Opposition, Rahul Gandhi , speak in the Lok Sabha. Om Birla will be visiting Dhaka for the swearing-in ceremony of Bangladesh PM-elect Tarique Rahman.Speaking to ANI, Singh said, ""Om Birla must have been rewarded by the government for not allowing the LoP to speak in the Lok Sabha. At the same time, now that a new government has been formed (in Bangladesh), the Indian government should go there and strongly raise the issue of the atrocities being committed against minority Hindus and end the tension there.""The Congress leader also endorsed remarks made earlier by Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge, who questioned the legal and financial status of the RSS . Kharge had described the BJP as a “devil’s shadow” and raised concerns about the RSS’s registration, funding sources and tax compliance.""His question is valid because the RSS hasn't been registered for a long time. Regarding the money issue, it's true that when electoral bonds were introduced, there was some kind of fraud. It evolved a certain party in such a way that a level playing field no longer existed,"" he said.Earlier, Priyank Kharge asked why the RSS had not registered itself despite operating extensively in India and abroad.""They're unregistered. They don't want to register. All I'm asking is to follow the law of the land.If you're an individual, that does not mean that you should not be registered. Which law says that? You should be registered. I'm asking how you're getting the donations? Where are you getting the donations from? Who is donating? How come you're running such large operations domestically and internationally, and you're still not paying taxes?"" he said.Citing media reports, Kharge claimed that over 2,500 organisations were responsible for funding the RSS and called for greater transparency. “This is a question the government should be asking,” he said.He also referred to statements by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat about the organisation functioning on “Guru Dakshina”, traditionally offered to a guru. Kharge questioned whether collecting funds in the name of the RSS’s symbolic saffron flag — which the organisation considers its “guru” — exempted it from financial scrutiny. Drawing a comparison with religious institutions, he argued that even temple donations are subject to audits and asked whether the RSS considered itself “above the law. ”Kharge further cited Bhagwat’s past remarks linking the BJP’s political success to the RSS’s support, reiterating his claim that the BJP functioned as the “shadow” of the RSS.","Om Birla will be visiting Dhaka for the swearing-in ceremony of Bangladesh PM- elect Tarique Rahman.

End Of MGNREGA? What VB–G Ram G Means For Rural Workers, Farmers And Viksit Bharat Plan

Allocation pattern across key schemes

Sharp cut in MGNREGS allocation

Fund-sharing pattern and fiscal implications

Employment trends under MGNREGS

PMAY-G progress and challenges

VB-G RAM G, the scheme set to replace Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), has received the highest share in this year’s Budget for the department of rural development, accounting for about 40 per cent of its total allocation, according to an analysis by PRS Legislative Research.The PRS analysis said VB-G RAM G has been allocated Rs 95,692 crore in the Budget, making up around 40 per cent of the Department of Rural Development’s total outlay.The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) accounts for 23 per cent of the department’s Budget. This is followed by MGNREGS at 12 per cent, the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) at 8 per cent, the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) at 8 per cent, and the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) at 4 per cent, as per news agency PTI.In 2026–27, VB-G RAM G (40 per cent) and PMAY-G (23 per cent) together account for 63 per cent of the ministry’s total gross expenditure, followed by MGNREGS (12 per cent), NRLM (8 per cent), PMGSY (8 per cent) and NSAP (4 per cent), the report said.The ministry of rural development has been allocated Rs 1,97,023 crore in 2026–27, which is 4 per cent higher than the revised estimates for 2025–26.Within this, the department of rural development has been allocated Rs 1,94,369 crore, 4 per cent higher than the revised estimates of 2025–26.The department of land resources has been allocated Rs 2,654 crore, marking a 51 per cent increase over last year’s revised estimates.The allocation for MGNREGS this year stands at Rs 30,000 crore, 66 per cent lower than the revised estimate of Rs 88,000 crore last year, as per PTI.In contrast, most other schemes have seen higher allocations. PMAY-G has been allocated Rs 54,917 crore, reflecting a 66 per cent increase over the previous fiscal year’s revised estimate.PMGSY has received Rs 19,000 crore, a 73 per cent rise compared to last year’s revised estimate.The report noted that under MGNREGS, wage payments accounted for around 70 per cent of total expenditure over the last five years. Material costs made up about 26 per cent of expenditure, of which roughly 20 per cent was borne by the Centre. Overall, the Centre bore around 90 per cent of the total expenditure under the scheme.“With the change in fund sharing pattern under the VB-G RAM G Act, the expenditure by state governments on the scheme may increase,” the report said.Under the VB-G RAM G Act, which guarantees 125 days of work, the Centre and states will share expenditure in a 60:40 ratio. For northeastern and Himalayan states, the ratio will be 90:10, as per PTI.According to the analysis, over the past decade, employment under MGNREGS averaged around 48 days per household per year.Less than 10 per cent of participating households completed 100 days of work. In 2020–21, average days of employment rose to 52 days per household due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Employment generation moderated thereafter, recording 50 days per household in 2024–25, reported PTI.On average, seven crore households demanded work during 2017–25, of which six crore households, around 90 per cent, were able to avail employment.The report also highlighted that actual wages paid to workers have often been lower than the notified rates. In 2025–26 (as of December 2025), wages received by workers were below the notified wage rate in 20 out of 31 states and Union Territories.For instance, in Andhra Pradesh, workers received Rs 268 against a notified Rs 307. In Chhattisgarh, workers were paid Rs 245 compared to Rs 261, and in Gujarat, Rs 264 against Rs 288.In Karnataka, workers received Rs 342 compared to the notified Rs 370. The gap was wider in Rajasthan (Rs 221 versus Rs 281) and Tamil Nadu (Rs 268 versus Rs 336), while in Telangana workers received Rs 259 against a notified Rs 307.Under rural housing, PMAY-G has been allocated Rs 54,917 crore, a 69 per cent increase, according to the report.However, only around 70 per cent of the targeted houses across phases have been completed so far.Delays have been attributed to issues such as land availability, migration, Covid-related disruptions and beneficiary-level constraints, the report said.","VB-G RAM G has been allocated Rs 95,692 crore in the Budget, making up around 40 per cent of the Department of Rural Development’s total outlay.

"MacKenzie Scott donates $26 billion in seven years, surpassing Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos in lifetime giving",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mackenzie-scott-donates-26-billion-in-seven-years-surpassing-elon-musk-and-jeff-bezos-in-lifetime-giving/articleshow/128392783.cms,"



MacKenzie Scott donated $26 billion over the past seven years, including a record $7.2 billion in 2025, a pace of giving that makes her the third-largest philanthropist of all time by total lifetime donations, according to Forbes.Scott is a novelist and the former spouse of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. She has distributed the funds primarily through large, unrestricted grants to non-profit organisations across the United States and internationally. Her total giving since 2019 now stands at $26 billion, according to publicly disclosed figures compiled by philanthropy trackers and financial publications.The $7.2 billion she gave in 2025 marks the largest single-year amount of her philanthropic career. The record year accelerated her overall total and pushed her ahead of most living donors in cumulative lifetime contributions.With $26 billion in lifetime giving, Scott ranks as the third-biggest philanthropist of all time in absolute dollars donated. Only two individuals in modern history have given more in total lifetime contributions.Her 2025 giving alone exceeded the combined lifetime donations of several prominent billionaires, including Tesla and SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk, Google co-founder Larry Page, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, and her former husband Jeff Bezos.Scott’s philanthropic strategy has differed from many large-scale donors. Rather than establishing a traditional foundation with extensive application processes, she has relied on advisory teams to identify organisations and has provided grants with few restrictions on how the money must be used. Recipients have included charities focused on education, racial equity, public health, housing, food security and community development.Since announcing her intention in 2019 to give away the majority of her wealth, Scott has moved at an unusually rapid pace compared with other billionaires. The $26 billion total represents one of the fastest large-scale philanthropic distributions in modern history.Most of her wealth comes from her divorce settlement with Jeff Bezos in 2019, when she received a stake in Amazon. She has since sold portions of those shares to fund her charitable donations.The comparison is based on the total amounts Musk, Page, Ellison and Bezos have publicly donated over their lifetimes. Although they have promised large sums and set up charity foundations, the money they have actually given so far is still less than what Scott donated in 2025 alone.Scott has not publicly indicated a fixed end date for her giving. However, her pace over the past seven years suggests she intends to continue distributing large portions of her wealth.","Scott is a novelist and the former spouse of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Under the proposed framework, the Railway Board is expected to offer partial funding, technical support, and access to testing facilities to manufacturers.The policy is part of the government’s rail modernisation drive and aims to reduce dependence on imported railway technology, including from China.""A new Rail Tech policy will give much needed impetus to innovation for mass transport,"" a senior official told ET, noting that is would encourage collaboration between domestic firms and research institutions.India’s imports of railway and tramway locomotives, rolling stock, and equipment stood at about Rs 6,098 crore in FY25, with locomotive components forming the bulk of the import basket, reflecting reliance on imported sub-systems.Trade data and project reports for 2024–25 estimate that around 55% of railway component imports are for Indian Railways, with 45% for metro and rapid rail systems. Imports account for a limited share of India’s overall railway component requirements.The FY27 Union Budget allocated Rs 52,108.73 crore for rolling stock capital expenditure, up from Rs 50,007.77 crore this fiscal year, primarily for new locomotives, coaches, including Vande Bharat train sets, and wagons as part of fleet modernisation.The government’s proposed rail technology policy builds on the Indian Railway Innovation Policy launched in June 2022, which offered grant support of up to Rs 1.5 crore on a 50:50 cost-sharing basis for startups and smaller companies to develop functional prototypes.The earlier policy focused on improving safety, efficiency, and maintenance, and provided innovators with ownership of their solutions, access to a secure testing environment, and assured procurement for successful low-cost technologies.India plans to be entirely self-sufficient in building seven new bullet train networks, the railway minister said. Currently, China dominates India’s railway equipment imports, followed by Germany and Austria for engineering systems, and the US and Japan for specialised propulsion and signalling components.","India plans to unveil a new ‘rail tech’ policy to boost domestic manufacturing of next-generation railway technology and equipment.

Draft Income Tax Rules 2026: The Income Tax Department has released a new set of draft income tax rules, which once finalised, will be applicable for financial year 2026-27. There are several changes in the draft income tax rules that impact the way you pay income tax, withdraw cash, pay in cash etc. and the need to quote your PAN card number for a variety of transactions.Following the release of the draft rules, the government has invited comments and suggestions from stakeholders, with February 22, 2026 set as the deadline for submitting feedback. After reviewing the responses received, the revised rules will be finalised, formally notified, and are expected to take effect from April 1, 2026.Under the proposed framework, the threshold limits for several transactions requiring PAN Card details to be disclosed have undergone a change.One of the main changes related to mandatory quoting of PAN Card relates to the limit for quoting PAN in transactions involving the purchase or sale of immovable property has been raised from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh.Also Read | Draft Income Tax Rules 2026 explained: How you can save Rs 1.41 lakh tax outgo - top points on HRA, PAN changes Similarly, the requirement to disclose PAN for cash deposits has been modified, increasing the threshold from Rs 50,000 in a single day to cash deposits of Rs 10 lakh or more during a financial year in a bank, cooperative bank, or post office.The draft also proposes that PAN Card details be shared if the total cash withdrawals reach Rs 10 lakh or more in a financial year across one or multiple accounts held by an individual.Under the current rules, PAN must be quoted when cash deposits of more than Rs 50,000 in a single day at a bank or post office are made. The draft income tax rules seek to revise this by introducing a higher threshold, requiring PAN details to be shared when total cash deposits are of Rs 10 lakh or more during a financial year across multiple accounts. The same annual limit has also been proposed for cash withdrawals, making PAN mandatory once withdrawals reach Rs 10 lakh in a financial year.If you buy a motor vehicle at present, the PAN Card details are required for all, excluding motorcycles. However, as per the proposed new income tax rules, PAN disclosure is compulsory only when the value of your motor vehicle or motorcycle is over Rs 5 lakh.Currently, PAN must be provided for payments made towards hotel or restaurant bills of over Rs 50,000. The draft rules suggest increasing this threshold to Rs 1 lakh.Existing regulations require PAN to be quoted for property transactions valued above Rs 10 lakh. The proposal recommends raising this limit to Rs 20 lakh.At present, PAN Card details are required when insurance premium payments are made above Rs 50,000. The draft income tax rules broaden this requirement. They extend the need for PAN Card to any account-based relationship maintained with insurance companies.","The draft income tax rules have been released by the Income Tax Department.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.
