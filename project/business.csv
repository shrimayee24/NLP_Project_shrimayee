Adani’s Mundra Port welcomes largest ever container ship to dock in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/adanis-mundra-port-welcomes-largest-ever-container-ship-to-dock-in-india/articleshow/110443007.cms,"NEW DELHI: Adani Group ’s Mundra Port on Sunday saw the largest ever container ship to dock at an Indian port when the almost 400-metre-long MSC Anna came visiting. This vessel is a metre longer than the earlier biggest one — MV MSC Hamburg — that docked here last July.

“MSC Anna is an impressive vessel, boasting an overall length of 399.98 m (roughly the length of four football fields) and a staggering capacity of 19,200 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), which makes it the largest container ship by capacity to ever visit an Indian port. Its arrival draft is 16.3 m, which can be accommodated only at Adani Ports, Mundra, as no other port in India is capable of berthing a deep-draft vessel. During its stay, the expected exchange is 12,500 TEUs,” Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) said in a statement.

Last July 2023, Adani Ports, Mundra, had berthed the 399-metre-long MV MSC Hamburg, one of the longest container ships in the world, with a capacity of 16,652 TEUs. This had set the stage for the arrival of MSC Anna.

“The arrival of MSC Anna at Mundra not only highlights the port’s capacity to handle mega ships but also reflects its role in enhancing India’s maritime trade capabilities. As APSEZ continues to expand and upgrade its facilities, the port is set to play an increasingly significant role in the global shipping and logistics landscape,” the statement added.

Gupta brothers of SA fame held for role in Doon builder's suicide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/gupta-brothers-of-sa-fame-held-for-role-in-doon-builders-suicide/articleshow/110407230.cms,"DEHRADUN: Police on Friday arrested Ajay Kumar Gupta , one of the “Gupta brothers of South Africa”, along with his brother-in-law, Anil Kumar Gupta , on charges of abetment of suicide. The arrest comes after a prominent city-based builder, Satinder Singh Sawhney, 52, named the two in a suicide note which he penned before he ended his life by jumping off the terrace of a seven-floor apartment complex on Friday morning.Originally hailing from Saharanpur, the Gupta family had gained notoriety for their extensive business ventures in South Africa where they were accused of large-scale corruption. A few years ago, the family's involvement in a significant political scandal in the country, involving president Jacob Zuma, had made headlines across the globe. The family had also stirred controversy by hosting the weddings of two of their children in the environmentally-fragile meadows of Auli in the Garhwal Himalayas in 2019. The big ticket weddings, said to have cost Rs 200 cr, left behind a trail of garbage in the eco-sensitive area, leading to widespread criticism of the festivities.Following the controversy in South Africa, the family came to India and reconnected with their roots in Saharanpur.The dead builder's suicide note, addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Pushkar Singh Dhami, accused the brothers of ""coercion and interference in his projects.""Police sources said Sawhney had accused Anil and Ajay of “threatening him and his business partner to hand over two major construction projects in the city”. These allegations were reiterated in both the suicide note recovered by authorities and a formal complaint lodged by Sawhney's son, Ranbir.""My father was under immense stress as the UP police demanded his presence regarding a false case lodged by the Guptas in Saharanpur. However, due to the tension, he refrained from going there. The police then set a deadline of Friday for his appearance. Meanwhile, the two pressured my father to transfer ownership of his two construction companies to them, threatening both him and his son-in-law with imprisonment if he refused. They vowed to create circumstances compelling enough for him to take his own life, which tragically occurred on Friday morning,"" Ranbir said in the complaint.In his suicide note, Sawhney said that he and his business partner, Sanjay Garg, undertook two projects in the city based on their market reputation. “However, we lacked sufficient funds to sustain such large projects managed by our companies, Sawhney Structure LLP and Sawhney Infra LLP. A mutual friend, Baljeet Singh Soni, introduced us to Anil Gupta as Anil was seeking investment opportunities. Following our meeting, Anil agreed to invest 85% of the total project funds as a silent partner, with the promise of minimal interference in the projects’ operations,” the note read.Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh confirmed the detention and subsequent arrest of the Guptas from their residence in Dalanwala area of Dehradun. ""Sawhney had lodged a complaint with the police on May 16 as well, which was under investigation. The two accused will be brought before a local court on Saturday morning, and further action will be taken thereafter,"" he said.","Ajay Kumar Gupta, one of the “Gupta brothers of South Africa’, along with his brother-in-law, Anil Kumar Gupta, on charges of abetment of suicide.

The young filmmaker , whose 'All We Imagine as Light' clinched the Grand Prix at Cannes Saturday, was a student at the country's cradle of cinema and TV when she braved chants of ""go to Pakistan"" for participating in a 139-day protest in 2015 against the appointment of actor Gajendra Chauhan as the institute's chairperson.She, along with 34 other former students, continue to wage a legal battle over a case filed by the then institute's director, Prashant Pathrabe, alleging their involvement in gheraoing him and vandalising his office that year.But a day after conquering Cannes, there was not a trace of rancour in Payal's words. All she reflected was the afterglow of an unprecedented triumph that she gracefully shared with fellow filmmakers from India.""It's a great feeling to receive this prize because there are so many good films from India alongside ours, and we feel a part of the larger family of filmmakers. We have three films from FTII directors this time. My FTII batchmate Maisam Ali's film 'In Retreat' is the first Indian entry to Cannes' ACID sidebar (Association for the Diffusion of Independent Cinema),"" she told TOI from the French Riviera.Payal’s film on 2015 FTII stir had also won Cannes laurelAlso, an FTII student’s (Chidananda Naik) film, titled ‘Sunflowers Were the First to Know’, won the main prize in La Cinef section. It’s fantastic for us and FTII.” Payal’s batchmates and other alumni recall that the 2015 protest was “against the appointment of people who had no achievement in filmmaking” but were allegedly included in FTII’s governing council for political reasons.Harishankar Nachimuthu, ex-president of FTII Students’ Association and spearhead of the agitation, said Payal always had a vision about where she wanted to go and was willing to fight it out. “She was denied a scholarship and a foreign exchange opportunity for participating in the four-month protest. But even she would agree that FTII made us better filmmakers, better human beings, and responsible citizens,” he said.Payal credited her teachers and students at FTII for her success, saying that while not everyone needed to go to a film school, the institute benefited her with a structure that facilitates the dissemination of different cinematic ideas. “It is also a great place to meet people who share a love for cinema. My batchmates were instrumental in shaping my ideas. At FTII, we got to see films from all over the world and this exposure helped me make my film.”Payal’s peers and seniors see her as a film aficionado perpetually behind the camera, documenting various subjects, and relentlessly pursuing any project she takes up to fruition.Ajayan Adat, winner of the 53rd Kerala State Film Awards for best sound design, was Payal’s senior by two years in college. He said her big qualities were patience and diligence. “She was pained by the then govt’s attitude against the students’ protest. So she took out a camera and started filming everything. She made hours of footage into a documentary titled ‘Night of Knowing Nothing’. It won the L’Oeil d’Or at Cannes in 2021.”","Payal Kapadia's 'All We Imagine as Light' clinched the Grand Prix at Cannes Saturday.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), also known as GLP-1 agonists , are a class of medications used to treat Type 2 diabetes and obesity.The study, presented at a medical conference - Digestive Disease Week 2024 - in Washington on Saturday, is based on an analysis of the records of more than three lakh persons with diabetes and obesity of which 1.65 lakh were prescribed GLP-1 agonists that are known to slow stomach emptying and stimulate insulin production among other things.Dr Prateek Sharma, professor of medicine at the University of Kansas, who led the study, told TOI that abdominal paralysis is a rare side-effect of these drugs but given the high usage of GLP-1 drugs, or weight-loss drugs as it is commonly referred to, it's important too warn people about it. ""These drugs are new and while the positive effects are well-established and talked about, we are yet to discover the full extent of its long-term side-effects and that's why I feel people who are taking them should be careful,"" he said.Wegovy and Ozempic are not legally available in India. However, reports suggest that these drugs are being sourced by many through the grey market at premium. Recently, a Denmark-based company called Novo Nordisk has launched 'Rybelsus' which has semaglutide - the main ingredient of Ozempic - in tablet form in India. It has been approved for diabetes management but, doctors say, the drug is also being used 'off-label' for weight loss.Wegovy and Ozempic were also initially approved for diabetes management. But when reports emerged that it could help lose 10-15% weight within a year, the US FDA allowed its limited use in people with obesity as well. Soon, the drug group took the world by storm as people, including celebrities such as Elon Musk and Oprah Winfrey, said they were using it.Dr Anoop Misra, chairman, Fortis C-Doc, said Rybelsus is quite expensive with one month's prescription amount costing over Rs 10,000. ""Given the popularity of these drugs, it is likely that we may have easy availability of the drug in near future and that too at lesser costs which is good as these drugs have proven to be effective in managing blood sugar, reducing weight, and even in managing chronic kidney disease. But the medical community as well as the public needs to be aware of its side-effects,"" he said.According to Dr Randhir Sud, chairman of the department of digestive and hepatobiliary sciences at Medanta hospital, drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic work by slowing the stomach movement and thus reducing appetite. ""Users can feel nausea and vomiting when they start taking the drug but in most cases these side-effects are likely to subside. I haven't come across any case of abdominal paralysis yet but these are early days of its usage in India,"" he said.In the US study, Sharma and his colleagues used a large database to analyze healthcare records of over 120 million patients, focusing on those with diabetes and obesity. They compared patients taking GLP-1 drugs to a control group, matching them by demographics and health factors. Over one year, they found that 32% of GLP-1 users experienced gastrointestinal issues like nausea, GERD, and stomach paralysis . While GLP-1 users had more GI-related procedures, they had slightly fewer ER visits and hospital admissions. This suggests that while GLP-1 drugs increase GI side effects, they don't lead to more severe health crises requiring emergency care or hospitalisation, the Kansas University professor said.""We aren't saying that one shouldn't use them. But our research clearly underscores the need for medical monitoring of gastro-intestinal side-effects such as abdominal paralysis that can impact quality of life,"" he added.","Abdominal paralysis can cause unintended weight loss, malnutrition and other complications. People who took Wegovy and Ozempic were 30% more at risk of developing abdominal paralysis.

Gold Smuggling: '80 crore smuggling booty possible murder motive',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/80-crore-smuggling-booty-possible-murder-motive/articleshow/110429720.cms,"KOLKATA: A fallout between Bangladesh MP Anwarul Azim Anar and his associate and friend Md Akhtaruzzaman alias Shaheen over huge proceeds from a gold smuggling racket may have been the motive behind the former’s cold-blooded murder and subsequent gruesome disposal of the body to hide the crime.According to intelligence officials in Bangladesh as reported by the country’s media, the MP who represents Jhenaidah-4 in Khulna division of Bangladesh and Shaheen, the younger brother of the mayor of Kotchandpur Municipality in Jhenaidah, were partners in the trans-border racket that involved smuggling gold bars into India. Nadia in Bengal borders Khulna district.But a rift appeared between the two sometime last year when Aziz demanded a bigger cut in the pie. While Shaheen rejected the proposal then, things came to a head when he later learnt that Aziz had taken control of the entire smuggling booty estimated around Rs 80 crore. The friendship turned into deep-seated anger and hatred.Bangladeshi police also suspect other influential people involved in the racket may have also been party to the plan to murder Azim who had taken control of the entire gold smuggling business. According to sources, Azim had staked his claim in the gold smuggling in Jhenaidah as soon as he became MP in 2014 and had gradually elbowed out a political leader from Jessore and two influential businessmen from Jhenaidah who were into the lucrative smuggled gold trade. Police are probing if they too had joined Shaheen in planning Azim’s murder.The plan to bump Azim off was hatched between Feb and April this year. It is Shaheen who is believed to have got an execution squad together with Shimul Bhuiyan Aman alias Amanullah Syed at the helm. The others were Celesty Rahman, a woman who police suspect honey-trapped Azim into visiting the New Town apartment that Shaheen had rented on April 30; Tanvir Bhuiyan who assisted in smothering Azim to death; and Jihad Hawladar, a Bangladeshi butcher illegally working in Mumbai who had been brought in to dismember the body and dispose it off.Shaheen is believed to have paid Tk 5 crore or around Rs 4 crore to the group to execute Azim and make him disappear from the face of the earth.Some other names have cropped up in the investigation: Siam, Faisal Shaji and Mostafiz. But their roles are still not clear.Bangladeshi investigators said Azim’s acquaintance and subsequent friendship with Kolkata’s Gopal Biswas was on account of the illegal gold trade. It was in Biswas’ house in Sinthi that Azim had put up on his arrival in Kolkata on May 12. Biswas, a gold trader, has denied his involvement in illegal gold transactions.",Bangladeshi police suspect other influential people involved in the racket may have also been party to the plan to murder Anwarul Azim Anar.

However, the number of women in mid and senior-level positions remains significantly lower, creating a talent void.With a mere 6.7% of women in executive roles in GCCs, there is a considerable decrease in the available talent pool of women as they move up the career ladder, showed a Pure Storage and Zinnov report. At the senior level (9-12 years of experience), the representation was at 15.7%, the report said. India has nearly 1,600 GCCs. In 2022-23, GCCs added 2.8 lakh employees, taking its talent base to over 1.6 million. The report stated that family and caregiving responsibilities, limited access to career advancement and leadership opportunities, and poor work-life balance are some of the key factors influencing women's attrition.Vidya Munirathnam, HR head of Lowe's India, attributes the skill gap and difficulty in upskilling after a maternity break as reasons for women leaving the workforce. ""When a woman comes back from maternity leave, which is usually for 6 months, they find that suddenly things have changed from a technology point of view.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

Aftermath and safety protocols

Investigations and future precautions

A Singapore Airlines flight from London to Singapore encountered severe turbulence, causing a rapid ascent and descent of 400 feet within a minute, resulting in the death of one passenger and injuries to at least 30 others. The Boeing 777-300ER, which departed from London’s Heathrow Airport, was diverted to Bangkok, where it made an emergency landing.The turbulence hit about 10 hours into the flight, as the plane flew over the Irrawaddy Basin in Myanmar, a region known for severe weather conditions.The aircraft, carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew members, was at an altitude of 37,000 feet when it suddenly encountered ""sudden extreme turbulence,"" causing it to drop 6,000 feet in about three minutes.Andrew Davies, a 54-year-old passenger from London, recounted his experience during the turbulence to the Wall Street Journal. He was deciding between taking a nap and watching a movie when the seatbelt sign flashed on. Just as he secured his seatbelt, the plane began to drop violently. ""Pillows, plates and cups were thrown in the air. His seat belt tugged at his waist, and he found himself covered in his neighbor’s coffee. Oxygen masks dropped down,"" Davies told the WSJ.The chaos in the cabin was immediate and severe. ""I saw a woman with a deep gash on her head, covered in blood. Flight crew members also appeared bloody and injured, hobbling around trying to help passengers,"" Davies added. An elderly passenger, identified as Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old British national with a history of heart problems, likely suffered a cardiac arrest. Despite efforts by the crew to perform CPR for 20 minutes, they were unable to revive him.The plane's abrupt altitude change was documented by FlightRadar24, which reported a ""rapid change in vertical rate, consistent with a sudden turbulence event."" The turbulence was likely clear-air turbulence (CAT), which is difficult to detect and can occur without warning. ""Developing thunderstorms often have strong updrafts, a zone of upward moving air, that rises very rapidly, sometimes at more than 100 mph, and can leave pilots little time to react if it occurs directly in front of the plane,"" explained Dan DePodwin, Senior Director of Forecasting Operations at AccuWeather.Former pilot Marco Chan noted the turbulence likely occurred within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, notorious for thunderstorms. ""With turbulence of such magnitude, it is likely the [Singapore Airlines] flight was navigating through difficult thunderstorms,"" he said.Following the incident, Singapore Airlines CEO Goh Choon Phong expressed condolences and assured that the airline was providing necessary support to affected passengers and their families. ""We are very sorry for the traumatic experience that everyone on board SQ321 went through,"" Goh said.Of the injured, 18 were hospitalized, with seven in critical condition. The Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok treated 71 passengers. The incident has renewed calls for strict adherence to safety protocols, emphasizing the importance of wearing seatbelts at all times during a flight. ""It is a matter of life and death,"" said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.This event marked the first fatal incident involving Singapore Airlines in almost 25 years. The airline, recognized as one of the world's leading carriers, has a strong safety record, with its last major accident occurring in October 2000.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the US and Singapore's Transport Safety Investigation Bureau are investigating the incident. Preliminary findings suggest that climate change may be increasing the frequency and intensity of turbulence events. ""For clear-air turbulence, climate change is increasing the temperature difference across the jet stream between the cold poles and the warm tropics,"" explained Dr Paul Williams, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading.As investigations continue, the aviation industry is urged to enhance real-time weather data sharing and improve safety protocols to better prepare for such unpredictable turbulence events.(With inputs from agencies)","Singapore Airlines Flight SQ321 was flying from London’s Heathrow airport to Singapore.

It has always helped Pakistan in difficult times for which the entire nation, including me, is grateful to the Chinese leadership and the people,"" he said.He assured the Chinese firms that the security and protection of Chinese workers and citizens was the top priority of the government.Thousands of Chinese personnel are working in Pakistan on several projects being carried out under the aegis of the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Some have been attacked in recent years by militants who accuse them of exploiting mineral resources.""The government has taken all possible measures to ensure foolproof security of the Chinese citizens in Pakistan,"" he told the meeting, adding that a comprehensive plan had been prepared on this.Sharif said that Pakistan was an agricultural country and wanted to utilise China's modern technology in this sector. He invited Chinese companies to invest in Pakistan's electric, hybrid auto sector and other sectors.Meanwhile, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported that Minister for Planning, Development Ahsan Iqbal and China's Vice Chairman of the National Development Reform Commission Li Chunlin co-chaired a meeting of the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC), where the Pakistan side appreciated the vision of Chinese leadership to upgrade the second phase of CPEC with the inclusion of new corridors.Speaking at the JCC meeting, Iqbal said: ""We are ready to work with NDRC to finalise the scope and implementation plan on these corridors.""The minister said that last year China's Vice Premier He Lifeng unveiled five new corridors proposed by President Xi Jinping , including the Growth Corridor, Livelihood Enhancing Corridor, Innovation Corridor, Green Corridor, and Opening Up/Regional Connectivity Corridor.He said the second phase of CPEC had already begun, but much work remained to ensure its success.""We are progressing on developing four priority SEZs, including Rashakai SEZ, Allama Iqbal Industrial City, Dhabeji SEZ, and Bostan SEZ. But we need to replicate the Chinese experience in this area,"" he said.The CPEC was launched a decade ago and several projects related to energy and infrastructure had been already completed.","Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will visit China in the first week of next month. He will join the formal launching of the second phase of the USD 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.

The India Meteorological Department said it is expected to reach maximum wind speeds of up to 120 kilometers per hour (75 mph), with gusts up to 135 kph (85 mph) hitting West Bengal’s Sagar Island and Bangladesh’s Khepupara region on Sunday night.Bangladesh’s junior minister for disaster management and relief, Mohibur Rahman, said volunteers have been deployed to evacuate people to 4,000 cyclone shelters across the country's coastal region. The government also closed all schools in the region until further notice.India's Kolkata airport will be closed for 21 hours from midnight Sunday. Bangladesh shut down the airport in the southeastern city of Chattogram and canceled all domestic flights to and from Cox’s Bazar.Bangladeshi authorities also suspended loading and unloading in the country’s largest main seaport in Chittagong and started moving more than a dozen ships from the jetties to the deep sea as a precaution.This is the first cyclone in the Bay of Bengal ahead of this year's monsoon season, which runs from June to September.Moderate to heavy rainfall is expected in most places over coastal districts in India's West Bengal state. A storm surge about 1 meter (3.1 feet) high is expected to flood low-lying areas of coastal West Bengal and Bangladesh.Such storms can uproot trees and cause major damage to thatched homes and power and communication lines, the statement said.India’s coasts are often hit by cyclones, but changing climate patterns have caused them to become more intense, making preparations for natural disasters more urgent.",The storm is expected to cross Bangladesh and India’s West Bengal coasts around midnight Sunday.

PATUAKHALI: Tens of thousands of Bangladeshis left their coastal villages Sunday for concrete storm shelters further inland as the low-lying nation prepared for the expected landfall of an intense cyclone , officials said.Cyclone Remal is set to hit the southern coast and parts of neighbouring India on Sunday evening, with Bangladesh 's weather department predicting crashing waves and howling gales with gusts of up to 130 kilometres (81 miles) per hour.Cyclones have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades, but the number of superstorms hitting its low-lying, densely populated coast have increased sharply from one a year to as many as three due to the impact of climate change .""The cyclone could unleash a storm surge of up to 12 feet (four metres) above normal astronomical tide, which can be dangerous,"" senior weather official Muhammad Abul Kalam Mallik told AFP.Most of Bangladesh's coastal areas are a metre or two above sea level and high storm surges can devastate villages.Authorities have raised the danger signal to its highest level, warning fishermen against going to the sea and triggering an evacuation order for those in at-risk areas.As people fled, police said that a heavily laden ferry carrying more than 50 passengers double its capacity was swamped by rough waters and sank near Mongla, a port in the expected path of the storm.""At least 13 people were injured and were taken to a hospital,"" local police chief Mushfiqur Rahman Tushar told AFP, adding that other boats plucked the passengers to safety.""Our plan is to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from unsafe and vulnerable homes to the cyclone shelters ,"" the government's disaster management secretary Kamrul Hasan told AFP.The authorities have mobilised tens of thousands of volunteers to alert people to the danger.He said some 4,000 cyclone shelters have been readied along the country's lengthy coast on the Bay of Bengal, with the cyclone expected to hit a 220-kilometre stretch from India's Sagar Island to Khepupara in Bangladesh.The state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department said Cyclone Remal would make landfall Sunday between 6:00 pm and midnight (1200-1800 GMT).In addition to the villagers and fishermen, many of the multi-storey centres have space to shelter their cattle, buffaloes and goats, as well as their pets.""Some 78,000 volunteers have been mobilised to alert coastal people and evacuate the vulnerable people,"" Hasan said.Helal Mahmud Sharif, the chief government administrator of Khulna province, told AFP some 20,000 people had been evacuated to shelters in the most vulnerable coastal regions.Another 15,000 people and about 400 domesticated animals have been evacuated in the coastal Patuakhali and Bhola districts.On the low-lying Bhashan Char island, which is home to 36,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, 57 cyclone centres have been readied, deputy refugee commissioner Mohammad Rafiqul Haque told AFP.The country's three seaports and the airport in the second-largest city Chittagong were closed, officials said.India's Kolkata airport closed from noon Sunday until Monday morning ""predicted heavy winds and heavy to very heavy rainfall"", airport authorities said, while beaches near the area have been ordered shut.While scientists say climate change is fuelling more storms, better forecasting and more effective evacuation planning have dramatically reduced the death toll.In the Great Bhola Cyclone in November 1970 an estimated half a million people died -- mostly drowned by the storm surge.In May last year, Cyclone Mocha became the most powerful storm to hit Bangladesh since Cyclone Sidr in November 2007.Sidr killed more than 3,000 people and caused billions of dollars in damage.Last October, at least two people were killed and nearly 300,000 fled their homes for storm shelters when Cyclone Hamoon hit the country's southeastern coast.","Cyclone Remal is set to hit the southern coast and parts of neighbouring India on Sunday evening.

According to a family friend in Kolkata's Bidhannagar, the MP mentioned he would be travelling to Delhi, but there was no direct contact with him since May 13. Only mobile messages were exchanged with his family in Dhaka and his friend in Bidhannagar, indicating his intended journey to Delhi.Azim, a three-time parliamentarian from Jhenaidah-4, was the president of Awami League's Kaliganj sub-district unit.According to PTI, West Bengal CID sources said Anar was first strangulated after which his body was chopped into pieces by a Bangladeshi butcher (identified as Jihad Hawladar). Later, Jihad along with two others dumped the pieces of the flesh at different areas in South 24-Parganas district. His body parts are yet to be found.So far, four persons - three from Bangladesh and one from Bongaon in West Bengal - have been arrested in this case.","Bangladesh home minister Asaduzzaman Khan said that his government is actively working with India, Nepal and US on the ongoing probe of the murder of parliamentarian Anwarul Azim Anar.

How Rishi Sunak’s small circle forged vote plan that shocked cabinet,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-rishi-sunaks-small-circle-forged-vote-plan-that-shocked-cabinet/articleshow/110424814.cms,"LONDON: Rishi Sunak gave his most senior ministers little more than an hour’s notice of what he was about to tell the country and had already told King Charles III, that he had decided to call a snap UK general election for July 4.Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt was among those caught unaware. Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who’d had to cancel a visit to Albania just to make the meeting in Downing Street, expressed surprise, but said the decision “seizes the initiative, sets the agenda and forces the choice,” according to people familiar with the conversation.Others were less convinced. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps shared reservations, the people said. Detecting the shock later in a meeting of the full Cabinet, Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho — a Sunak loyalist since their Treasury days — intervened to say the premier wasn’t a politician who follows the consensus, whether on Brexit, pandemic lockdowns or net zero. Communities Secretary Michael Gove praised the move, quoting the Special Air Service motto: “Who dares wins.”Rishi Sunak kept his decision to call an early general election from all but a select few until just before his rain-soaked announcement outside Downing Street.Sunak ultimately headed into a downpour in Downing Street to speak the cameras. But the fact he presented it as a fait accompli signed off by the monarch, which the people said he did to ensure ministers couldn’t make him change his mind, underscores the scale of the gamble he knew he was taking. Little more than 48 hours later, Gove had joined the scores of Tory MPs announcing that they were standing down after the election.Spokespeople for Sunak, Cameron, Shapps, Hunt and Coutinho declined to comment.The announcement was weeks in the making, and piecing together how it came about reveals that it’s not only the Cabinet with reservations. The premier’s closest aides argued opposing sides, and, while people familiar with the matter say everyone is now on the same page, some still don’t want to be seen as responsible for pushing the snap election idea.It’s far from the ideal basis for what will be a bruising six-week campaign against Keir Starmer’s poll-leading opposition Labour Party. He’s already faced criticism for a presidential style that leaves little room for other Tory voices. If he doesn’t deliver on his strategy to narrow the poll gap early in the campaign, the recriminations will likely engulf him alone.Sunak’s gamble on a summer election on Wednesday stunned British politics. Prime ministers don’t go to the polls when they’re tailing by 20 points, as the Tories are, unless forced to. Sunak could have waited until as late as January, but was widely likely expected to call an election in the autumn to allow more time for voters to notice the UK’s gradual economic recovery.Outside of Cabinet, Tory MPs are openly critical. Going to the polls now instead of holding out hope for a Starmer slip-up has, they say, cemented a defeat. A stuttering campaign, including the drenched launch on Wednesday and the awkward clip of Sunak in the Titanic Quarter in Belfast on Friday, have reinforced the sense that it’s all been a bit rushed.“This is surprising given he had the advantage of deciding when to call the election,” said Will Jennings, associate dean at Southampton University. “He is deeply unpopular with the public, and polls suggest considerable public appetite for change. Turning things around would require something truly dramatic.”The timing has had a tangible impact. Sunak’s signature plan to deport asylum-seekers to Rwanda, which the Tories regard as critical to holding off the right-wing Reform UK party, will not begin until after the election. The government also ran out of time to get a landmark smoking ban, predicted to be one of Sunak’s main achievements in office, through Parliament.That’s just the first few days of campaigning. Conflicting briefings by advisers about who was responsible for the snap election idea add to the dangerous backdrop for the weeks ahead.The premier’s inner circle of his 10 or so closest confidants had privately been considering an early election as far back as the turn of the year, people familiar with the matter said. Their “Plan A” had been to use tax breaks, falling inflation and interest rate cuts to hold the vote in the autumn, a strategy devised by the Tory campaign chief Isaac Levido.Yet a “Plan B” was kept on the table: a possible snap election if the right moment presented itself. The idea was discussed seriously in February, though some senior aides were strongly opposed.Around the beginning of April, the thinking began to shift toward a summer vote, people close to Sunak said. That set off weeks of agonizing conversations, with most aides recognizing the choice was far from clearcut. Some vacillated as they weighed the merits of waiting for an improvement against the risk of Tory support tanking further.Sunak himself was the driving force for a snap election, people familiar with the matter said. The premier and his chief of staff, Liam Booth-Smith, had become frustrated that nothing the government did, such as tax cuts at two successive fiscal events, was moving the polls.It was also increasingly clear that more tax cuts, which were part of the plan for an autumn election, were not doable. That reinforced their view that the polls were not going to shift until they called the election, people familiar with their thinking said, at which point they would become less of a referendum on the Tories’ record in office, and more a decision about the future.That’s a line that Sunak started using days before his election announcement.Another key factor in Sunak’s thinking was the expectation that inflation would fall back toward the Bank of England’s 2% target in the summer.By around the end of April, Sunak’s decision was coming into view, the people said. He was backed by Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden. Levido and James Forsyth, Sunak’s close friend and adviser, were eventually convinced.Over the next six weeks, Sunak and his aides will find out if they were right. They are planning imminent manifesto announcements to try to demonstrate, per the Tory election slogan, that Sunak is willing to take “bold action.”Yet some Tories are starting the blame game early, unconvinced that Sunak’s team has hit on a winning formula. Meanwhile close to 80 Conservative MPs have said they’re calling it quits at the election — more than before Labour’s 1997 landslide victory — a number that is expected to keep on rising.","Rishi Sunak kept his decision to call an early general election from all but a select few until just before his rain-soaked announcement outside Downing Street.

Millions of Britons set for lower energy bills after 7% price cap cut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/millions-of-britons-set-for-lower-energy-bills-after-7-price-cap-cut/articleshow/110388525.cms,"Most British household energy bills will fall from July after regulator Ofgem cut its domestic price cap by 7%, largely thanks to a fall in wholesale energy prices , but analysts warned the reduction could be temporary.The drop could help to curb inflation further after it eased to 2.3% in April, its lowest since July 2021 but still above the central bank's 2% target.Ofgem's new cap of 1,568 pounds ($1,988.38) a year for average use of electricity and gas is down 122 pounds, or 7%, from the previous cap of 1,690 pounds and at its lowest since the winter of 2021/2022.However, analysts at Cornwall Insight said the cap is expected to rise again in October because wholesale energy prices have begun to rise again.The front-month wholesale British gas price has risen by about 30% since the beginning of April, LSEG data shows, partly owing to lower supply from Norway.Cornwall Insight forecast the October cap at 1,762 pounds a year, up 12% from July.""The anticipated rise in bills as we move into the winter months emphasises the continued volatility of the market and the importance of providing protection for vulnerable households,"" said Cornwall Insight's Craig Lowrey.Consumer groups warned that prices remain unmanageable for many households and called on the next government to provide better protection for vulnerable people.British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Wednesday called a national election to be held on July 4.Campaign group National Energy Action said that 5.6 million households would remain in fuel poverty despite the price cap reduction from July. Fuel poverty is defined as being unable to afford to heat homes to temperatures needed to stay warm and healthy.About 28 million customers are on standard rate tariffs covered by the price cap, which was introduced in 2019 to protect consumers.The cap is set using factors such as network fees and social and environmental costs as well as wholesale energy prices. It is updated every quarter to reflect changes to those costs.","Ofgem's new cap of 1,568 pounds ($1,988.38) a year for average use of electricity and gas is down 122 pounds, or 7%, from the previous cap.
