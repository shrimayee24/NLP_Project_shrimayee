Panel: States' bonuses on top of paddy MSP distorting markets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/panel-states-bonuses-on-top-of-paddy-msp-distorting-markets/articleshow/111213627.cms,"NEW DELHI: Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices ( CACP ), which recommends MSP for different agri-produce, has urged states not to announce bonus over MSP fixed by Centre for paddy as this ""distorts the market"". The recommendations have come at a time when several states are offering bonus over MSP or political parties have made this poll promise before getting elected.It made these recommendations in its latest 'Price Policy for Kharif Crop' report, which contains MSP for summer crops. It recommended that procurement of rice and wheat should be restricted in those states that impose high charges and pay bonus, in order to bring parity among states. Odisha is the latest state to announce bonus on MSP for paddy after BJP came to office this month.""Unsustainable and uneconomical practice of offering bonus over and above MSP for paddy procurement by state govts creates distortions in the market. This restrains private trade participation and potentially discourages competition, which, otherwise could be advantageous for farmers,"" CACP said.The report referred to how Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Maharashtra have declared a bonus for paddy in the past.Chhattisgarh last season announced to purchase paddy at Rs 3,100 a quintal against MSP of Rs 2,183 a quintal for the current marketing season (Oct-Sept). BJP, in its manifesto for Odisha, had promised to buy paddy at Rs 3,100 per quintal while Centre recently announced MSP of Rs 2,300 for 2024-25 season.CCPA has also highlighted how several states levy charges including market fee, commission to societies and 'arhatias' besides paying bonus over MSP announced by Centre.While CCPA has recommended concerted efforts for area expansion and yield improvement, and procurement of pulses to become self-sufficient, it also said that to tackle the problem of large imports of edible oils, there should be a dynamic import duty structure based on MSP of oilseeds and domestic and world prices of vegetable oils. In addition, the duty differential between crude and refined oil should be kept at 10-15%.","Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) has urged states not to announce bonus over MSP fixed by Centre for paddy as this ""distorts the market"" Odisha is the latest state to announced bonus on MSP for paddle after BJP came to office this month.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-111213711,imgsize-1184298,width-400,resizemode-4/111213711.jpg"

37 students, including 9 from Mumbai, scored 100th percentile in MHT-CET for engineering and pharmacy courses in Maharashtra. CAP schedule to be declared soon. CET Cell results showed a drop in cut-offs for popular courses like computer engineering. Principal Hari Vasudevan of DJ Sanghvi College of Engineering mentioned the job scenario is bleak.

MUMBAI: The state has decided to hold another CET for BMS , BBA and BCA admissions . Admitting to teething problems since a CET for the courses was held for the first time this year, an official said the centralised admission process (CAP) rounds will commence only after the results of the second exam are out. Students have been asked to visit the CET cell’s portal regularly for updates on the exam.CET is not applicable to colleges that have opted for a change in nomenclature of the courses — for instance, BMS to BCom (Management Studies). Students who have appeared for the first CET can take the test again to improve their scores .A principal from a city college, however, expressed concern about the development affecting academic schedule. “For BMS and BBA, we will now have to follow a completely different schedule since most other admissions are almost coming to an end. Also, after two months of studying other courses, if students move out to secure admissions in BMS or in a better college, then many will be left with vacant seats in the middle of the term,” the principal said.Several students were not aware of the first CET. It was only after HSC results were announced and students started queuing up at colleges for admissions to these courses did they realise that a CET had been conducted on May 29, a principal said.(Inputs by Hemali Chhapia)","Most engineering aspirants who took the MHT-CET exam scored between 60-70 percentile, impacting admission cutoffs.

"Amid 'darknet' threat, NTA now in complete meltdown",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-darknet-threat-nta-now-in-complete-meltdown/articleshow/111212936.cms,"Big shake-up in tech needed to secure exams: Official

NEW DELHI: The National Testing Agency ( NTA ) is experiencing a complete meltdown , with staff unsure about safe delivery of any exam due to the 'darknet' threat. Despite the challenges, there is still an expectation to conduct and announce results on time to prevent delays in the academic calendar, which managed to get back on track last year after the Covid-19 disruptions in 2020.Another major concern is keeping the agency together amid rumours of officials on deputation looking to leave.Veteran staff members believe that whether exams are computer-based or offline, it will be difficult to regain confidence until the agency's fundamentals are regrouped. The NTA has had to cancel three national-level tests, including two - National Common Entrance Test (NCET) 2024 for admission to the four-year integrated teacher education program (ITEP) and the University Grants Commission-National Eligibility Test (UGC-NET) - after the exams were conducted. CSIR-UGC-NET was postponed days before the exam.""A big shake-up in technology and capacity building is needed,"" said a senior official. He noted that merely looking at exam models proposed by the forthcoming high-powered committee will not be enough. For example, the computer-based ITEP had to be cancelled ""despite having a comparatively smaller number of candidates. Each file was around 5GB, and when downloaded at the centres, they received distorted question papers"".ITEP is the entrance test for select central and state universities, IITs, NITs, RIEs, and govt colleges for integrated teacher education programmes.Sources in the IT department are confident that CUET-UG results could be ready by June 30, but they are uncertain about the rescheduling of the cancelled and postponed exams. Citing the example of the All India Pre-Medical Test (AIPMT) paper leak in 2004, where CBSE managed to hold the exam within a week, an NTA source said the agency's secrecy department, IT, and administrative staff ""don't feel it's possible now"" due to fears that organisations using the 'dark web' have completely hacked into NTA'ssecurity protocols and ""have decided to expose the chinks this year"".""They are not going to stop. The dark web is used by terrorist organisations. We are not sure how safe even our black box (where question papers are stored) is,"" said a worried official, indicating that NTA doesn't have the capacity to thwart such ""organised attacks"". A source in the govt added, ""A national level think tank needs to work on such threats.""While questioning the recent functioning of the agency, insiders insist there have been no ""paper leaks in Bihar"". ""Two days ago, Bihar Police asked for details of six candidates, sharing their roll numbers. Two of the roll numbers don't exist, in another two, the names and roll numbers don't match. There are so many contradictions, including the timing of the seizures, which was post-exam when all the question papers are already in the public domain,"" said an official from NTA's computer section.Within the autonomous organisation, there are strong rumours of a ""big exodus"" of officials on deputation who feel their careers are at stake.","Staff unsure about safe delivery of any exam due to the 'darknet' threat.

The minister's remarks came in the middle of the diplomatic strife between India and Canada over what the former calls political space given by Canadian authorities to extremists who advocate violence against India.Another Union minister, Hardeep Puri, called the bombing one of the most reprehensible acts of terror committed against India.The bombing of the Montreal-New Delhi Air India flight 182 was blamed on Sikh militants who did it in retaliation to 'Operation Bluestar'.""Today marks the 39th anniversary of one of the worst acts of terrorism in history,"" Jaishankar said on X.

files FIR over

alleged irregularities

in NEET-UG

Key developments since May 5 NEET exam

The CBI's involvement follows the education ministry's announcement to hand over the probe, a move that some protesting students had demanded. The CBI has registered a new case against unidentified individuals under Indian Penal Code sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating), among others.

The development comes after widespread protests and student litigation regarding paper leak claims. The accusations of irregularities led to protests in various cities, legal battles, and political disputes, with the opposition accusing the government of jeopardising students' futures.

Ten students have approached the Supreme Court, seeking directions for the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to investigate the alleged irregularities in NEET-UG. Their petition also requests that the Bihar Police expedite their investigation and submit a report to the apex court.

In another instance, the Supreme Court has asked the Center, the National Testing Agency (NTA), and others to respond to multiple petitions, including those calling for the cancellation of the NEET-UG 2024 exam and a court-monitored probe. The court has also paused proceedings on similar petitions in various high courts.

Following criticism over alleged discrepancies in various competitive exams, the central government has replaced NTA Director General Subodh Singh. Additionally, a seven-member panel led by former ISRO chief K Radhakrishnan has been established to review the NTA's functioning and suggest exam reforms.

NEW DELHI: National Testing Agency (NTA) on Sunday said that 750 of 1,563 students who were awarded grace marks skipped the retest conducted for NEET-UG candidates. Meanwhile,813 appeared for the retest after an order from the Supreme Court.The retest took place at seven centers. An official reported, “As many as 813 of the 1,563 candidates who were earlier awarded grace marks in NEET-UG appeared for a retest on Sunday.”Among them was an exam center in Chandigarh which was set up with all necessary arrangements including police and invigilators. However, it closed its gates after two students scheduled for the NEET-UG retest on Sunday did not show up.The NEET-UG exam, administered by the NTA on May 5, took place across 4,750 centers in 571 cities, including 14 international locations. Over 23 lakh candidates participated in the examination.An unprecedented number of students—67—scored a perfect 720, raising concerns about potential irregularities. Among these, six students from a center in Faridabad, Haryana, have attracted particular suspicion.Controversy also arose over grace marks awarded to students affected by time loss at six centers due to a late start. The Center informed the Supreme Court that these grace marks would be scrapped, and 1,563 affected students would be offered a retest.The NEET-UG examination is a critical pathway for admissions to MBBS, BDS, AYUSH, and other related courses in both government and private institutions nationally.The NEET-PG entrance exam has also been postponed, marking the fourth entrance exam affected recently.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed an FIR over alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG exam conducted on May 5, following a reference from the Union education ministry. CBI sent dispatched special teams to Godhra in Gujarat and Patna in Bihar to take over existing police investigations.The ministry's complaint to the CBI cited 'certain isolated incidents' in a few states during the examination, prompting the agency to investigate allegations of irregularities, conspiracy, cheating, impersonation, breach of trust, and evidence destruction.","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed an FIR over alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG exam conducted on May 5.

PATNA: When it comes to job description, the versatility of a ""handler"" is no longer limited to airport cargo, the police dog squad, political campaigns, or even a spy ring.Investigators piecing together the conspiracy behind the NEET-UG paper leak have a handle on how "" handlers "" operate in the shady realm of the nationwide exam racket whose roots have been traced to Bihar and Jharkhand ""The nine handlers arrested in the NEET-UG case so far - six in Jharkhand and three in Bihar - are tech-savvy individuals who played a crucial role in orchestrating the leak of question papers, training examinees who paid for these to memorise the answers, and even escorting them to their respective centres,"" a senior police officer said.The six handlers arrested from Jharkhand's Deoghar used to reside in rented accommodation, masquerading as labourers. Their brief was to ensure the leaked papers reached the intended recipients while maintaining high secrecy and anonymity.""Once a particular exam got over, they would get to work on identifying the chinks in the system for the next one,"" the officer said.To expand their client base, these handlers would look for opportunities to connect with coaching centres, schools and colleges on some pretext. They would seek out individuals associated with the exam process, aiming to bribe them into getting useful information.Bihar Police's raid on a safe house based on a tip-off on the morning of the May 5 NEET-UG exam threw up evidence of these handlers herding around 30 candidates into this meeting place at Ram Krishna Nagar on Patna's outskirts on the eve of the test.""The examinees were there through the night to memorise answers to the leaked question papers. The handlers then transported them to their exam centres in private vehicles, taking all necessary precautions to ensure their safety,"" the officer said.Online form submission for entrance exams was introduced nationwide around 2010, replacing the earlier method of sending applications by mail. The older system had loopholes that fraudsters and corrupt officials would easily exploit.""Before the introduction of online forms, examination conducting agencies would assign roll numbers based on when they received the application envelopes. Criminals exploited this system by sending multiple application forms in a single envelope, using codes like 'bogie' and 'engine' to refer to candidates and their proxies, respectively,"" said an IPS officer of the Bihar cadre.""This strategy ensured that all these candidates were allocated roll numbers for the same examination centre and hall, facilitating cheating.""Another senior IPS officer said paper leaks could occur at various stages-from when these papers are compiled to their storage in bank currency chests before being transported to the exam centres.He said the older cheating methods included replacing candidates with proxies after videography verification at the exam centres and altering optical mark recognition (OMR) sheets later. ""Handlers gathering their clients in one place to memorise answers under their guidance is a new trend. This is meant to eliminate a paper trail.""Vishal Kumar, an IPS officer formerly with the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) probing the NEET-UG paper leak in Bihar, said three significant gangs were active in the state. One is suspected to be led by Ranjit Kumar Singh, alias Ranjit Don, accused of masterminding multiple paper leaks before foraying into politics.","Nine handlers arrested in the NEET-UG case so far - six in Jharkhand and three in Bihar.

Around 35% of the investment will come from the private sector.TOI has learnt that the master plan for highway development has been proposed in two phases. Officials participating in the inter-ministerial meeting chaired by road transport secretary Anurag Jain said the ministry has finalised the roadmap to tender all projects under phase-1 by 2028-29 and complete them by 2031-32. The Rs 22 lakh crore estimate is for projects to be taken up in the first phase.The ministry has requested 10% annual increase in budgetary allocation for project implementation. In the interim budget, govt had allocated Rs 2,78,000 crore for the ministry, marking a 2.7% increase from the previous financial year.The financial estimate in the second phase to develop 28,400 km will be determined later. As per the plan, sanctioning and awarding of stretches under phase-2 will be completed by 2033-34, with construction finishing by 2036-37.The ministry highlighted how it has planned the development of NH and expressways after carrying out assessment of GSTN data, including commodities transported from point to point and has also taken into account transportation of cargo by trains.The analysis of GSTN data showed nearly 73% of freight was transported by road in 2021-22, with railways accounting for around 23%. The data also showed that for commodities transported less than 350 km, 82% was moved by road, and for distances over 600 km, 62% was transported by road.Once completed, the average travel speed of trucks on the national highway network will go up to 85 kmph from the current 47 kmph. The average travel speed on highways is over 100 kmph in the US and 90 kmph in China. Govt expects that increasing the average speed will help India achieve its target of reducing logistics costs to 9-10% of GDP.High-speed corridors have been identified to ensure that such stretches are accessible within 100-150 km from any part of India. Currently, only 3,900 km of high-speed corridors are operational, and by 2026-27, this figure is expected to rise to around 11,000 km.","Road transport and highways ministry has sought Cabinet approval for Rs 22 lakh crore investment in a highway development plan covering around 30,600 km by 2031-32.

17 aspirants who appeared earlier in Bihar centres barred from NEET-UG,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/17-aspirants-who-appeared-earlier-in-bihar-centres-barred-from-neet-ug/articleshow/111212981.cms,"NEW DELHI: Seventeen candidates who had appeared for the NEET-UG exam on May 5 from centres in Bihar have been barred from taking the test, the National Testing Agency said based on inputs.

""This takes the number of total candidates barred from the exam this year to 110,"" an NTA official added.

The agency had earlier barred 63 candidates for adopting unfair means in the exam. On Saturday, 30 additional candidates from Gujarat's Godhra were debarred. As many as 67 students had scored a perfect 720 in the NEET-UG exam, unprecedented in the NTA's history, with six from a centre in Haryana's Faridabad figuring in the list, raising suspicions about irregularities. It was alleged that grace marks contributed to 67 students sharing the top rank. Later, the Supreme Court ordered cancellation of grace marks and provided the option of retest.

Close to 24 lakh candidates sat for the NEET-UG exam, held on May 5 across 4,750 centres. Initially expected on June 14, the results were announced on June 4 due to early completion of answer sheet evaluations.

Computer-based tests more secure than pen-paper mode exams: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/computer-based-tests-more-secure-than-pen-paper-mode-exams-experts/articleshow/111212925.cms,"NEW DELHI: Amid controversies surrounding irregularities in NEET-UG and the cancellation of UGC-NET due to question paper leaks on ""darknet"", experts are debating the pros and cons of offline versus digital exam delivery . The ministry of education has announced the formation of a high-powered committee to review all aspects of the examination process and functioning of NTA. Some experts argue that computer-based tests (CBT) are more secure than traditional pen-and-paper exams.Under scanner, NTA officials acknowledged challenges of conducting exams securely in both formats despite adhering to all security protocols. They suggested a year-round exam model similar to scholastic aptitude test (SAT) conducted by college board, educational testing service in the US, allowing candidates to appear multiple times and use their best score for college admissions.While NEET-UG has traditionally been a single-sitting pen-and-paper exam, UGC-NET, which has been computer-based since 2018, reverted to a pen-and-paper OMR mode on Tuesday. However, the exam was cancelled following inputs from national cybercrime threat analytics unit of Indian cybercrime coordination centre (I4C) indicating it had been compromised.Some believe that computer-based testing is the future due to reduced human involvement. Dr Arun Gupta, president of the Delhi Medical Council, said: ""it may be a good idea to make the NEET-UG exam computer-based. The govt can allow the exam to be taken twice a year to make the process more efficient and avoid any shortage of computers or other infrastructure related problems.""A senior official from Greater Noida Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) also supports adopting CBT models to minimise paper leak risks, stating that such allegations undermine integrity of the examination process and the medical profession.In 2018-19, the education ministry proposed a computer-based multi-session mode for NEET-UG, similar to the JEE (Main), but this did not gain traction within the health ministry. Former HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal had mentioned the possibility of biannual and digital NEET-UG exams, but he later retracted his statement.A senior govt official said CBT spread over multiple days or sessions would limit impact of single-day/ session leak and would make it easier to track due to digital footprints, as seen in 2021 JEE (Main). S Vaidhyasubramaniam, vice-chancellor of SASTRA deemed university, Chennai, advocated for combination of CBT and board exam marks weightage. He said ""not only is CBT more reliable, but mixed weightage for class XII and NEET scores will reduce coaching class syndrome and provide balance.""",The ministry of education has announced the formation of a high-powered committee to review all aspects of the examination process and functioning of NTA.

NEW DELHI: Only 52%, or 813, of the 1,563 candidates across seven centres, who were earlier awarded grace marks due to loss of time in the NEET-UG exam, appeared for the retest on Sunday, officials said. The others have opted for their original score without the grace marks.In Chandigarh, where just two candidates had registered for the retest, neither turned up. The Jhajjar centre, which was under the scanner as several high rankers had emerged from there, registered 58% attendance, with 287 of the 494 candidates taking the retest.A senior NTA official said, ""At least 52%, 813 out of 1,563 candidates, appeared for the retest on Sunday.

Initially expected on June 14, the results were announced on June 4 due to early completion of answer sheet evaluations.Some were unaware, some were unsure what to believe so they reached the venues anyway, and some hoped to find answers to their immediate next question — what would the next date of the exam be?There was no clarity whatsoever on offer. At the venues, each candidate echoed the other’s confusion and anxiety, and distress building up over days in the academic calendar slipping away. Indignation was directed at the National Testing Agency (NTA), which many candidates called “irresponsible”.Among the 2 lakh candidates who were to sit for NEET-PG, there were many who had travelled long distances and following carefully nurtured dreams to reach the exam centres — like Neha Tabassum, who came to Noida from Jammu with her husband, spending Rs 12,000 on tickets and a hotel, money that went down the drain. “I discovered the exam was postponed only when I was on my way to the centre in the morning. It took two years of preparation, and this would have been my second attempt. What kind of exam arrangement is this? It’s frustrating,” she said.Sunanda Pansari, who came to an exam centre in Bhubaneswar from Kalahandi in Odisha, 600km away, said it was exasperating that the exam’s dates had been changed four times. “This is extremely wrong. I have travelled 600km to attend the exam. We should have been informed at least 24 hours in advance about the decision. There is also no information (from govt) on the paper leak as of now,” she said, referring to the NEET-UG fiasco.K Nageswara Rao, whose son was to take the exam in Visakhapatnam, travelled 200km to reach the Andhra Pradesh capital from East Godavari. “It was a bolt from the blue,” he said of the sudden cancellation. “No one has a clue when the exam will be held next. My son quit his job to prepare for a year. Now, he is not sure what to do, go back to working immediately or wait till the exam dates are announced again,” he said.Sankha Mandal, a medical officer with the railways who was to appear for NEET-PG at a centre in Kolkata, was similarly distraught. “It’s very tough to prepare for such a tough competitive exam while working a full-time job. The indefinite wait for the next date is painful,” he said.Outside iON Digital Zone in Noida, one of the exam venues in Delhi-NCR, K Murli from Bangalore, who has been staying in Delhi to prepare for NEET PG, said the exam’s dates had anyway been changed three times already and the uncertainty has driven up stress levels. “The first date for NEET PG this year was March 3, then it was postponed to July 7 and again advanced to June 23. Now, it has been postponed till further notice, this time just 12 hours before the exam. This uncertainty is extremely stressful. The exam system and management need to think from a student’s perspective,” he said.Lambasting NTA, whose director-general Subodh Singh was removed by govt on Saturday evening as the nodal examination body battles a crisis, Atul, an MBBS graduate from Delhi, asked, “How does one pursue academics in such a shaky and mismanaged scenario? This is the third major exam to be cancelled within a week after UGC-NET and CSIR-UGC NET.”Another MBBS grad, Ankit, who lives in Ghaziabad, said he left his job just to prepare for NEET PG. “I am shocked by the uncertainty over a national exam like NEET,” he said.Neelam Upadhyay, a Delhi resident, knew about the postponement, but felt she could not trust anything till she saw for herself because of the amount of misinformation that swirls around. So, she landed up at the Noida centre. “I came just to check if the notification about the exam cancellation was real or fake news,” she said.Renu Aggarwal, the chief medical superintendent of the district hospital in Noida was there too, not as a govt representative but as a mother. Her son was to appear for NEET PG. “If they wanted to postpone the exam for security reasons, they should have done it earlier, giving time to students. Many students got harassed due to this sudden change,” she said.Ankita, a candidate from Gurgaon, said postponement was annoying, but “it is better this way than to rewrite the paper, if a paper leak were to be found”.Outside an exam centre in Jaipur, Yash Dubey, a practising doctor, pointed out that the delay would prove costly for some candidates. “There are many candidates who are opting for Institute of National Importance Combined Entrance Test (INI-CET) counselling to get a PG seat at AIIMS. Those who get a seat via INI-CET but give it up have to pay Rs 3 lakh. Now, with a delay in NEET-PG, candidates who thought of bettering their rank and landing a seat in their desired course at AIIMS will have to take up seats in whichever courses they have got at present through INI-CET. This will at least assure them of a PG seat. Later, however, if they get their desired course through NEET-PG, they will have to vacate the INI-CET seat, and for this, have to pay Rs 3 lakh. How is this fair?” he asked.(With inputs from Uma Mahesh in Vizag, Nirupa Vatyam in Hyderabad, Suparna Roy in Jaipur and Poulami Roy in Kolkata)","Only 52%, or 813, of the 1,563 candidates across seven centres, who were earlier awarded grace marks due to loss of time in the NEET-UG exam, appeared for the retest on Sunday.

The team is scheduled to visit various dam sites in the region over the next few days. This visit marks is a step towards bilateral efforts to address and manage water resources shared by India and Pakistan under the treaty, which governs the use of the Indus River and its tributaries. The delegation's itinerary includes inspections of key dam projects to facilitate discussions on water management and treaty compliance.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed by then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and former Pakistan President Ayub Khan in 1960, establishes a framework for cooperation and information exchange on the use of the Indus River system. The treaty is overseen by the Permanent Indus Commission (PIC), a bilateral body with commissioners from both countries tasked with implementing and managing treaty provisions, and resolving any questions, differences, or disputes that may arise.The PIC, which includes Indus Commissioners from India and Pakistan, has been a crucial platform for technical discussions and treaty compliance. Despite the treaty's framework, India and Pakistan have faced ongoing disagreements over hydroelectric projects. Pakistan has raised objections to India's construction of the Kishanganga (330 megawatts) and Ratle (850 megawatts) hydroelectric plants, arguing they violate treaty provisions. India, however, maintains that the projects are compliant with the treaty's guidelines and asserts its right to develop them.Efforts to resolve these disputes have been ongoing, with the World Bank encouraging both nations to explore alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. In 2015, Pakistan requested the appointment of a Neutral Expert to review its technical objections to India's projects but later sought arbitration in 2016. Despite five meetings of the PIC from 2017 to 2022, Pakistan has refrained from discussing the issue, complicating efforts to reach a consensus.The arrival of the Pakistani delegation signals a continued commitment to dialogue and cooperation under the Indus Waters Treaty, with the upcoming site visits expected to further discussions on water management and treaty implementation.",Pakistani delegation arrives in Jammu as part of ongoing discussions concerning Indus Water Treaty.

Bengaluru: The Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka plans to send an advisory to all its members on exercising caution while inviting movie and TV stars as chief guests for school functions.It is a common practice among schools to invite movie actors as chief guests for functions like annual day. “There are several issues with inviting them as chief guests. Some of them charge hefty fees for their appearance in schools. Once they come, they try to promote their movies in their speeches, which doesn’t add any value to a school atmosphere. Their backgrounds also need to be checked as some of them are into illegal activities like drugs and might not be the best role models for students,” association secretary D Shashi Kumar said.

No stay on NEET counselling

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Thursday issued notice on petition filed by National Testing Agency (NTA) seeking transfer of pleas relating to NEET-UG, 2024 from high court to the apex court and stayed all proceedings before different high courts on alleged leak of NEET-UG exam question paper.The apex court also issued fresh notices to Centre and National Testing Agency seeking their responses on new petitions filed by students against NEET-UG and said that all petition so far filed would be taken up together on July 8.It refused to pass any interim order on the case.The announcement of the NEET-UG 2024 results on June 4 sparked significant backlash from both students and their parents. The results were met with legal challenges, which focused on three primary concerns. Firstly, there were allegations that certain students were awarded grace marks. There were also assertions that the question paper had been leaked prior to the examination. Suspicions were raised about potential malpractices at particular exam centres.SC once again declined to halt the counselling process for admissions based on the results of the NEET-UG examination. The court said that if the petitioning students were to succeed in their legal challenges, it would lead to the cancellation of the 2024 exam and the subsequent counselling process.This development follows the hearing on Tuesday, during which a petition seeking the cancellation of NEET UG 2024 was considered. During the proceedings, the court remarked that the 'sanctity of the exam has been affected' and requested a response from the National Testing Agency (NTA) regarding the matter.","Supreme Court issues notice on petition filed by National Testing Agency (NTA) seeking transfer of pleas relating to NEET-UG, 2024 from high court to apex court.

Vice president NA Haris was always “entering airports, travelling, not serious enough (about football),” while secretary general M Satyanarayan, he said, astounded him by proposing an Inter-Continental Cup in July, a time when clubs start their pre-season.Even the legendary IM Vijayan wasn’t spared. In his words, “a great footballer and legend but not the right person to be chairman of a technical committee.”Then there was the customary stick reserved for FSDL, the body that owns and runs the Indian Super League (ISL), India’s top-tier league. Stimac said the contract between AIFF and FSDL started in good faith but remains questionable. “The league and top tier cannot be run by corporate business,” he said.Handed an extension seven months ago, Stimac was sacked this week after a poor AFC Asian Cup campaign and an even poorer Fifa World Cup qualifying run. The sacking, Stimac suggested, came less than 24 hours after he had told the AIFF that he was negotiating with two potential employers and needed time to resign.“I told (AIFF secretary general) Satya I am negotiating with two parties for jobs in the future, so until the end of the month, I will accept one of the offers and you won’t have to pay more than one (month’s) salary. The next day I received the termination letter on email. I could not believe it. This happened only half a day after telling him to be patient and not get influenced with social media,” said Stimac.A bronze medal winner at the Fifa World Cup in 1998 with Croatia, Stimac got the India job in 2019 after convincing the technical committee that he could help Indian footballers punch above their weight. Five years later, while India are playing more attractive football and won a record three trophies last year, the Croat is leaving with a bitter taste in his mouth.“I came here with open arms, but your football is imprisoned. Without the law being changed and allowing PIO players to represent India, nothing will change. It’s a slow process. Will take another two decades or so to make progress,” said Stimac.The AIFF has started the process to look for Stimac’s successor. On the first day itself, there were 45 applications from coaches across the world. But given the negative publicity surrounding the sport here, Stimac felt the job wouldn’t attract bigger profiles.“The new coach will know immediately (what awaits him),” he said. “You cannot get a big-name coach. Everyone knows what kind of things we deal with in Indian football. How we operate, you might get someone who is desperate for a job. Don’t think there will be any success.”Asked what he would have done differently during his five-year tenure, Stimac said he should have resigned after the SAFF Championship in July last year, winning his third trophy of the year.“I shouldn’t have trusted these people,” said Stimac. “After winning three trophies in 2023, I had huge support among the media and fans. As much as they wanted me out, they could do nothing. The only way they knew of running was through social media. They don’t care about other things. It’s a wrong approach to run any serious institution.”","Igor Stimac says he was planning to resign even if India had made it to the third round of the Fifa World Cup qualifiers for the first time.

‘Only 10% needed’

Vacant posts

BENGALURU: Chief minister Siddaramaiah ’s cup appears to be overflowing as strident demand to raise salaries of state govt employees as per recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission has added to immense economic challenges he faces, chief of which is to ramp up revenue .The govt is already facing the heat for hiking taxes on petrol and diesel and a proposal to increase additional excise duty on low priced liquor. Now, govt employees are on the warpath. They want their salaries hiked from July.Employees had expected the cabinet to discuss the issue at Thursday’s meeting but are now incensed since the subject, allegedly, wasn’t even on the agenda.The issue has been hanging fire since May 2022 when the previous BJP govt formed the pay panel headed by retired IAS officer K Sudhakar Rao. Last year, the tenure of the panel was extended by six months because of assembly elections. The govt’s perceived indifference is now stoking employees’ anger.“The govt must immediately implement recommendations of the pay commission and hike our salaries with arrears from April last year,” said Sadananda Nelkudri, secretary,Karnataka State Govt Employees Association (KSGEA). “We will wait till the end of the month. If there is no action, then our state executive will meet and discuss the protest we are planning.”In March last year, the outgoing BJP govt announced a 17% hike in salaries as interim relief. Employees had demanded a 40% increment. The panel submitted its final report earlier this year, recommending a 27.5% hike. This means the minimum salary of a govt employee will increase to 27,000 from the present Rs 17,000.“The CM has, in principle, agreed to implement the 7th Pay Commission. Since the previous govt already hiked salaries by 17%, we need to only raise it by 10%,” said Basavaraj Rayareddi, economic advisor to the chief minister.But funds are a big hurdle. While a 10% raise will entail an outlay of a minimum Rs 17,500 crore, Siddaramaiah, in his budget, had allocated only Rs 15,000 crore for the purpose, increasing allocation for salaries to Rs 80,434 crore from Rs 65,003 crore in 2023-24. This means a shortfall of Rs 2,500 crore.Besides this, about 40% posts across departments are vacant and if the govt fills them up — an election promise — it will need another Rs 20,000 crore more.Rayareddi admitted the govt is caught between a rock and a hard place. “We know the salary bill will touch Rs 1.1 lakh crore if we simultaneously hike salaries and fill vacancies,” he said. “But the govt is committed to fulfilling both.

3 Biggest challenges that India's Deep Tech startups are facing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/3-biggest-challenges-that-indias-deep-tech-startup-sector-is-facing/articleshow/111211643.cms,"AI is the star of India's Depp Tech startup segment

India's Deep Tech sector is flourishing, with a record number of startups emerging in 2023. A report by NASSCOM and Zinnov reveals that 480 new Deep Tech ventures were established, nearly double the number in 2022, making India the world's third-largest Deep Tech hub.However, this promising growth is threatened by a funding crunch. The report highlights a 77% decline in funding in 2023 compared to 2022, with the total raised dropping to $850 million. The number of funding deals also fell by 25%.This funding gap is a major obstacle for Indian Deep Tech startups . The report identifies three key challenges: Securing funding for scaling operations; attracting and retaining talent, and achieving global expansion.Artificial intelligence (AI) is reported to be the star of the show, attracting the most interest from both founders and investors. In 2023, 74% of new deep tech startups focused on AI, and 86% of funded startups had an AI focus. AI is also leading the way in patent filings, accounting for 41% of all deep tech patents.Venture capitalists cite the long development timelines inherent to deep tech as a major barrier to investment. The report suggests that government initiatives, such as co-investment programs and support for patient capital, are crucial to attracting more investors.The investor pool has shrunk significantly, with a 60% drop in participation compared to 2022. The absence of large global investors is a key factor. Investors are currently favoring smaller, seed-stage deep tech ventures with lower risk profiles, further limiting overall funding.NASSCOM recommends a multi-pronged approach to address these challenges. The report calls for government action to strengthen innovation clusters, provide access to patient capital and computing infrastructure, expedite the National Deep Tech Startup Policy, improve intellectual property frameworks, and develop a robust talent pipeline.Despite the funding hurdles, India's Deep Tech sector is said to hold immense potential. With continued support, these innovative startups can overcome these challenges and become global leaders.","India's Deep Tech sector is flourishing, with a record number of startups emerging in 2023.

Nvidia lost its position as the world's most valuable company on Friday (June 22). The shares in chipmaker Nvidia have tumbled over 6% in the past two trading days, shedding more than $200 billion in market value and relinquishing its crown as the world's most valuable company. According to Bloomberg data, Nvidia's market cap sits at roughly $3.1 trillion, trailing behind Apple 's $3.2 trillion and Microsoft 's $3.3 trillion.This sharp reversal follows an earlier surge that saw Nvidia overtake its megacap rivals. Analysts point to no specific negative news driving the selloff, but rather a correction following the stock's blistering year-long run, nearly tripling in price. This rapid ascent makes it susceptible to such sudden drops.""It's just standard market fluctuations,"" told Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell to Bloomberg, ""which can have a significant impact on valuations of large companies,"" he added. He, at the same time, emphasised that Nvidia's fundamentals remain strong.While some short-term volatility was anticipated, Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya believe ""any volatility is likely short-lived"" despite acknowledging the stock's vulnerability to profit-taking. They maintain their buy rating, $150 price target, and top pick designation for Nvidia.Bullish sentiment persists, with Melius Research analysts led by Ben Reitzes raising their price target to $160 from $125, marking their fifth increase this year. Reitzes argues that Nvidia is ""better positioned than some SaaS 'leaders' who haven't proven AI's impact,"" suggesting Nvidia could capture a larger share of the enterprise software market.The decline is reported to coincide with a broader market pullback coinciding with a ""triple-witching session,"" where options and futures contracts expire simultaneously, along with index rebalancing by S&P Dow Jones Indices and related ETF adjustments. This confluence of events can trigger market turbulence, affecting individual stocks.","N Nvidia's market cap now sits at roughly $3.1 trillion, trailing behind Apple and Microsoft.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations. These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class. The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
'What are the odds': Space debris crashes into Florida home; what family did next,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-are-the-odds-space-debris-crashes-into-florida-home-heres-what-the-family-did-next/articleshow/111217922.cms,"Alejandro Otero and his family from Florida 's Naples, have filed a lawsuit against Nasa , seeking $80,000 in compensation for damages caused by a piece of space junk that crashed into their home on March 8. The incident occurred while Otero was on vacation, and his son informed him about the crashing object.The cylindrical metal object, weighing 1.6lb and measuring 4in by 1.6in, tore through the Otero family's house, causing significant damage. Otero expressed his disbelief and gratitude that no one was injured in the incident, saying, ""I was shaking. I was completely in disbelief. What are the chances of something landing on my house with such force to cause so much damage,"" and ""I'm super grateful that nobody got hurt.""Nasa later confirmed that the object was a metal support used to mount old batteries on a cargo pallet for disposal, which was jettisoned from the space station in 2021. Although the load was expected to burn up entirely upon entering Earth's atmosphere, one piece survived and landed on the Otero family's property.The family, represented by the law firm Cranfill Sumner, is seeking compensation for non-insured property, business interruption, emotional and mental anguish, and the cost of assistance from third-party agencies. Attorney Mica Nguyen Worthy emphasised the seriousness of the space debris issue, saying, ""My clients are seeking adequate compensation to account for the stress and impact that this event had on their lives,"" and ""they are grateful that no one sustained physical injuries from this incident, but a 'near miss' situation such as this could have been catastrophic. If the debris had hit a few feet in another direction, there could have been serious injury or a fatality.""Worthy also highlighted that this case aims to set a precedent for space debris claims in both private and public sectors. Nasa has been given a six-month period to respond to the claims filed by the Otero family.","Alejandro Otero and his family from Florida's Naples, have filed a lawsuit against Nasa.

Taxing the super-rich? 74% of Indians support it – Here’s why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/taxing-the-super-rich-74-of-indians-support-wealth-tax/articleshow/111216913.cms,"As G20 finance ministers prepare to meet next month, a new survey reveals overwhelming public support for a wealth tax on the super-rich. The survey, conducted by the Earth4All initiative and Global Commons Alliance , found that 68 per cent of people in G20 countries support the idea as a means to address global hunger, inequality, and the climate crisis. The support is particularly strong in India, where 74 per cent of respondents are in favor.The survey covered 22,000 citizens across the world's largest economies, highlighting a growing international consensus for progressive taxation . This proposal, under discussion since at least 2013, has garnered increasing support over the years.Brazil, currently presiding over the G20, aims to build a consensus on wealth taxation and is expected to push for a joint declaration at the upcoming meeting of G20 finance ministers in July. A key advocate behind Brazil's initiative is French economist Gabriel Zucman, who is set to release a report on Tuesday detailing how a global minimum tax on the ultra-rich could be implemented and its potential revenue.Zucman argues that the super-rich pay significantly less tax compared to ordinary citizens. His proposal seeks to establish a new international standard, requiring billionaires in every country to pay at least 2 per cent of their wealth in taxes annually.Owen Gaffney, co-lead of Earth4All, emphasized the strong support for significant reforms among Indians. ""Indians want a giant leap on climate and nature -- 68 per cent demand dramatic reforms across all economic sectors within the next decade. This is a strong mandate for planetary stewardship that cannot be ignored,"" he said.The survey reveals that 74 per cent of Indians support taxing wealth. There is also strong backing for taxing high incomes and corporations to fund climate initiatives, along with a 'polluter pays' approach and income redistribution.Additionally, 71 per cent of Indians endorse universal basic income, 74 per cent support policies that promote healthy diets to reduce emissions, and 76 per cent seek a better work-life balance. Furthermore, 68 per cent believe that dramatic action is needed across all sectors of the economy within the next decade, including electricity generation, transport, buildings, industry, and food.An impressive 81 per cent of Indian respondents support a shift to ""wellbeing economies"" that prioritize health and the environment over narrow economic growth.The upcoming G20 finance ministers' meeting will be closely watched as nations debate this transformative approach to wealth taxation, with the potential to reshape global economic policies and address critical challenges facing the planet.","A new survey reveals overwhelming public support for a wealth tax on the super- rich. 68 per cent of people in G20 countries support the idea as a means to address global hunger, inequality, and the climate crisis.

Where is Melania Trump? Former first lady's elusive presence on US 2024 campaign trail sparks curiosity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/where-is-melania-trump-former-first-ladys-elusive-presence-on-us-2024-campaign-trail-sparks-curiosity/articleshow/111216727.cms,"Following her conspicuous absence from pivotal events in her husband's presidential bid , former First Lady Melania Trump has become the center of media speculation. Her minimal public appearances this year have fueled curiosity about her role in Donald Trump 's 2024 campaign.Earlier in the year, Melania missed key events such as the campaign kickoff in Iowa and the Super Tuesday victory party. When asked in March about her future involvement, she coyly responded, “Stay tuned.” Since then, she has kept a low profile, only attending a few fundraisers in April and her son Barron's high school graduation.Significantly, Melania was absent during Donald Trump’s hush money trial in New York. She did not accompany him on any of the trial days, was absent for the guilty verdict, his subsequent remarks at Trump Tower, his 78th birthday celebration, and several campaign rallies.Katherine Jellison, a history professor at Ohio University specializing in first ladies, remarked that Melania's behavior, while unusual, is not entirely surprising. “As First Lady, she kept a low profile and was not very active in his 2020 campaign,” Jellison noted. She highlighted that the Trumps often deviate from traditional political norms.Unlike Melania, other political spouses have been active in supporting their partners' campaigns. Casey DeSantis, wife of Florida Gov Ron DeSantis, was heavily involved in his primary bid, and Dr Apoorva Ramaswamy, wife of Vivek Ramaswamy, often appeared on the campaign trail with their children.Efforts to reach Melania Trump for comments have been unsuccessful. She has made only one recent public statement regarding her son's selection as a delegate for the Republican National Convention, citing his prior commitments as the reason he could not attend.During Donald Trump’s trial, reporters repeatedly questioned his wife’s absence. Trump’s attorney, Todd Blanche, avoided the topic, focusing instead on the challenging nature of the case. Testimony during the trial included sensitive details about Trump's alleged affair with Stormy Daniels, which reportedly concerned him more for its potential impact on his 2016 campaign than on his marriage.Despite her absence, Trump frequently mentions Melania in his speeches, portraying her as an active, albeit behind-the-scenes, supporter. Larry Snowden, president of the “Club 47” fan group, recounted his brief interaction with Melania at a February gala, describing her as “charming” and “accommodating.”Snowden expressed optimism about Melania's future involvement in the campaign, anticipating that she will make key appearances and speeches while remaining protected by the former president.As the campaign progresses, Melania Trump's enigmatic presence continues to intrigue both supporters and critics, leaving many wondering if she will step into a more public role or continue to support her husband from the shadows.","The former First Lady has kept a low profile this year, only attending a few fundraisers in April and her son Barron's high school graduation.

Donald Trump 's automatic Green Card for foreign students graduated in America was not an off the top of his head idea. Trump indicated the policy at a business roundtable meeting last week where Apple CEO Tim Cook was present, Politico reported. ""And when he talked about finding ways to keep American-educated talent at home, some top CEOs, like Apple’s Tim Cook, were seen nodding their heads,"" the report said.""When he spoke to the Business Roundtable last week, some of the titans of the tech industry seemed to breathe a sigh of relief when Trump appeared to support keeping high-skilled immigrants in the United States,"" the report said.Tim Cook has always been a staunch critic of Trump's immigration policy as he terminated DACA, the Obama-era program that shielded some immigrants without documentation from being deported. In 2019, Apple moved the court and said it employed 443 dreamers who were protected by DACA. “Every one of these talented Dreamers should have the same opportunities as Steve did to create, work hard, and help change the world for the better,” Apple said at that time.Come 2024, Donald Trump has taken a considerate view of the immigration situation and announced on ""The all-in podcast"" that foreign nationals who graduate from US colleges and universities should automatically be given a Green Card upon graduation so that the best brains are retained in the US. He mentioned India and China as he rued that fact that bright students from US universities go back to India and China without getting a Green Card in the US and then they become multibillionaires, generate huge employment.Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued a statement after Trump's claim explaining that there will an aggressive vetting process to select the candidates for the Green card-- excluding all communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters and public charges. Only the most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America will get the automatic Green Card.The State Department estimated that the United States hosted roughly 1 million international students in the academic year that ended in 2022 -- a majority of whom came from China and India.

'Spent more on pet dog than servant'

A Swiss court has sentenced four members of the wealthy Hinduja family to up to four years and six months in jail on Friday for exploiting their domestic workers.The Hinduja family, known for their vast business empire spanning various sectors, tops the Sunday Times list of the UK's 350 richest people with an estimated fortune of £37 billion. However, Gopi Hinduja himself was not named in the case.The Hinduja Group, controlled by the family, has diverse business interests ranging from trucks and lubricants to banking and cable television.The group was founded by Parmanand Deepchand Hinduja, who started his merchant banking and trade businesses in British India before moving to Bombay in 1914 and expanding internationally to Iran in 1919.The brothers later shifted their base to London in 1979, where it remains today, with the group claiming to employ 200,000 people worldwide.Srichand P Hinduja, the eldest son, took over the reins in 1935 and is credited with founding IndusInd Bank. Following his death in May 2023, Gopichand Hinduja assumed the role of Chairman and is recognized for the Group's ventures into the power and infrastructure sectors.The family's wealth and influence have been significant, with Forbes ranking them as the seventh richest in India and the 146th richest globally in recent years.In a recent court case in Switzerland, Indian-born businessman Prakash Hinduja and his family members were found guilty of exploiting workers and providing unauthorized employment. The court dismissed the human trafficking charges, saying that the staff understood the conditions they were agreeing to.The Hinduja family, long-time residents of Switzerland, faced accusations of confiscating workers' passports, paying them in rupees instead of Swiss francs, restricting their movement, and forcing them to work excessively long hours for low wages. This was not Prakash Hinduja's first offense, as he had been convicted on similar, though less severe, charges in 2007. Prosecutors alleged that he continued to employ people without proper documentation despite the previous conviction.It was disclosed last week that the family had reached an undisclosed settlement with the plaintiffs. Swiss authorities have already seized various assets, including precious stones and jewelry, which could be used to cover legal fees and potential penalties resulting from the case.According to Swiss prosecutor Yves Bertossa, the family spent more money on their pet dog than they paid one of their servants.The prosecutor delivered a scathing critique of the Hinduja family's actions, recommending jail sentences of up to five and a half years for those involved. Bertossa's arguments were based on testimonies provided by the staff and the Hindujas themselves, as well as evidence gathered during his investigation into the matter.""They spent more for one dog than one of their servants,"" he said. The prosecutor revealed that the woman was paid as little as 7 Swiss francs ($7.84) for a working day that lasted up to 18 hours, seven days a week. He also pointed to a budget document titled ""Pets"", which demonstrated that the family spent 8,584 Swiss francs in a year on their family dog.","Four members of the Hinduja family sentenced to up to four years and six months in jail for exploiting domestic workers.
