From class struggle to Samajik Samrasta: How BMS redefined India’s trade union politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/from-class-struggle-to-samajik-samrasta-how-bms-redefined-indias-trade-union-politics/articleshow/122871648.cms,"Union Minister Mansukh L. Mandaviya addresses the 70th Foundation Day programme of the 'Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh'

NEW DELHI: As the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) celebrates its 70th anniversary, the highlight is its rise as India’s largest trade union — a position secured by eclipsing Left-leaning organisations like Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), which once dominated India’s labour movement. Rooted in the RSS ’ philosophy of “samajik samrasta” (social harmony), the BMS has consistently rejected class conflict in favour of cooperation, a theme RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat amplified in his address that blended pride, caution and a global vision.“This saffron flag was once dismissed as unsuited for India’s labour landscape. Today, it is not just fluttering but commanding attention across the world,” Bhagwat declared. Framing the union’s seven-decade journey as a vindication of the RSS’s worldview, he added: “After 70 years of sacrifice and effort, we have become the largest trade union in the country and a significant one globally. But this is not the time for complacency. ”Founded in 1955 by Dattopant Thengadi under the guidance of RSS Sarsanghchalak M S Golwalkar, the BMS was the last of India’s central trade unions to be formed but swiftly overtook its older rivals. Its rallying cry — “Desh ke hit mein karenge kaam, kaam ke lenge poore daam” (We shall work in the nation’s interest and earn full wages for it) — underscored its nationalist ethos and helped it carve a space distinct from Left-leaning unions.Rejecting the Marxist notion of class struggle, Bhagwat reiterated the Sangh’s alternative vision: “It is not workers on one side and owners on the other. The industry is a family. When workers and employers both act with responsibility, society benefits.” This philosophy has guided BMS’s engagement over decades, from resisting the Emergency — when over 5,000 activists were arrested — to advocating labour-friendly provisions in the new labour codes, even while distancing itself from policies it deems anti-worker.Calling for “Yuganukul” (era-appropriate) models to meet contemporary challenges, Bhagwat urged BMS to adapt to disruptions like automation and globalisation without compromising its “shashwat vichar” (eternal values). “In our early years, we were like square pegs forced into round holes. But the time has come to shape a system that reflects our ideology,” he said, highlighting the need to modernise without abandoning core principles. On the impact of technology, Bhagwat cautioned that while innovation and machines are inevitable, they must serve humanity and not displace it. “Technology should assist human workers, not replace them. The dignity of labour must remain central even in an age of artificial intelligence,” he added, signalling concerns about the social costs of unchecked technological adoption.Politically, BMS has positioned itself as a constructive force, eschewing frequent strikes for dialogue and negotiation. It has taken a policy of “responsive cooperation” with successive governments, including under Narendra Modi, and yet asserted its independence when needed.Bhagwat’s tone, however, carried an internal warning. “An organisation gains prestige when workers embrace anonymity and collective spirit — ‘not I, but thou.’ Success brings its own traps. We must guard against hubris and remember our core purpose,” he cautioned.Seventy years on, the saffron flag that once seemed an unlikely contender in India’s labour movement is now a global symbol, with Bhagwat projecting it as a model for worker movements worldwide. “Countries around the world are studying our methods. We must ensure workers’ interests, industries’ interests, and national interest align for global welfare,” he said, positioning BMS as a standard-bearer for a new vision of labour rooted in Indian ethos.","The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) celebrates its 70th anniversary.

AJMER: A public notice issued by the nazim (chief executive officer) of Ajmer Dargah disowning responsibility for accidents caused by dilapidated structures within the shrine complex, has triggered widespread anger among Muslim organisations and the community's religious heads.The notice, dated July 21, was pasted inside Dargah premises, warning devotees to avoid old or structurally weak buildings that may collapse during heavy rains. It stated, ""In case of any accident or untoward incident, the individual will be solely responsible. The nazim office will not accept any legal liability.""The language and tone of the notice have been condemned by organisations from Delhi to Hyderabad, including the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind, All India Muslim Council and the Muslim Progressive Front (Rajasthan). Several groups have demanded an immediate withdrawal of the notice and called on the ministry of minority affairs to launch an inquiry into the matter.TOI texted and called Nazim Bilal Khan for a statement, but received no response. The Ajmer Dargah Committee functions under the ministry of minority affairs and the episode has renewed calls for greater accountability, transparency and professional oversight in the management of India's major religious heritage sites.Sohail Khandwani, managing trustee of Haji Ali and Mahim Dargah in Mumbai, who is currently overseeing renovation work at Haji Ali, expressed dismay: ""I came across the letter. I was shocked to learn that the nazim hasn't even identified which buildings are structurally unsafe, nor have any warning signs been placed. Simply issuing a letter will spark fear among devotees.""The Dargah receives 20,000 devotees on normal days, which jumps up to a lakh on Thursdays and Fridays.Syed Nadeem Hasan Nizami, chief in-charge of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya Dargah in Delhi, called the notice a ""hallmark of shamelessness and administrative negligence."" He said, ""Asking devotees to survey the complex, identify weak structures and then decide whether to proceed with ziyarat (visit the shrine) is absurd. What exactly is the Dargah nazim's role then? He should resign. I appeal to PM Narendra Modi to appoint qualified professionals with experience in management, auditing and public safety. ""The notice follows incidents of roof collapse and water seepage in at least three mosques within the Dargah complex in the past week.","A public notice issued by the nazim of Ajmer Dargah disowns responsibility for accidents caused by dilapidated structures.

NEW DELHI: In a boost to India's military capabilities close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, the crucial Mudh airfield project in the high-altitude Nyoma area in eastern Ladakh is all set to be completed by Oct.The upgrade work by (BRO) at the airfield, among the world's highest at an altitude of 13,710 feet, included extending and strengthening the original airstrip into a 2.7km 'rigid pavement' runway with a dispersal area and turning pads, among other things.The Rs 230 crore upgrade will allow operations by all kinds of fixed-wing aircraft like heavy-lift transport planes and fighter jets from both directions. ""The runway, with 46m width, is fully ready. The allied infrastructure, including the ATC complex, hangar, crash bay, watch towers, accommodation and the likes, is also more or less complete,"" an official told TOI.""Nyoma will prove crucial as a forward staging ground for troops deployed in the region and transporting supplies quickly to them. The airfield will also be available for fighter operations by early 2026, though high altitude will be a limiting factor, much like what Chinese air force faces across LAC,"" he said.China, in fact, has systematically worked over the last five years to offset terrain constraints at its airbases facing India due to high altitude and rarefied air, which limits weapon and fuel-carrying capacity of aircraft.With new and extended runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities, China has managed to deploy additional jets, including advanced J-20 stealth fighters as well as bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones, at its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping. It has also built many new heliports along the 3,488km LAC, stretching from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh.India is trying to play catch-up. Located about 35km from LAC, Nyoma will be another operational base for IAF in Ladakh after the Leh, Kargil and Thoise airfields and Daulat Beg Oldie ALG (advanced landing ground). Nyoma was reactivated as an ALG when a medium-lift AN-32 transport aircraft first landed there in Sept 2009. The upgrade project began during the military confrontation with China that erupted after the People's Liberation Army made multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh in April-May 2020.In addition to strengthening the capacity of existing airbases to handle more aircraft, India has progressively upgraded the infrastructure at ALGs like Fukche and DBO in Ladakh, as well as Pasighat, Mechuka, Walong, Tuting, Along and Ziro in Arunachal Pradesh.

Poll How do you feel about the current state of traffic management in Delhi during heavy rains? Much improved, it flows smoothly. Still chaotic, needs more work.

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday hailed the Rekha Gupta-led Delhi government after ""traffic moved smoothly"" despite heavy rain at Minto Bridge which was first to flood every time.BJP IT cell head Amit Malviya shared visuals of Minto Bridge, where vehicles were seen crossing without any hassle.""Despite heavy rain, traffic moved smoothly at Minto Bridge, once the first to flood with even a drizzle. That’s the change Delhi is witnessing under the BJP government in just a few months! From waterlogged roads to smooth flow, from chaos to order — a real transformation has begun,"" Malviya said in a social media post on X.""Delhi will now become the capital India truly deserves. Arvind Kejriwal had reduced it to a dustbin. BJP is cleaning up the mess and rebuilding the future.""The underpass, situated at the junction of Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg and Connaught Place, is infamous for waterlogging every monsoon season. The issue gained national attention in 2020 when a 56-year-old man died after his mini-truck became submerged during a heavy downpour at the same location. In response, the government initiated new protocols to prevent similar incidents, but recurring waterlogging suggests these measures remain inadequate.Meanwhile, several low-lying areas in the capital reported knee-deep water following the downpour.Waterlogging and traffic disruptions affected several parts of Delhi, including South Delhi, South East Delhi, North Delhi, ITO, South Extension, NH-8, Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, Nehru Place, East of Kailash, Colony Road, and several other areas.The Aam Aadmi Party accused the government of making false claims in the media about tackling the problem of waterlogging.""After the rain this morning, the road (NH-24) in the Western Vinod Nagar area is completely waterlogged.

"India develops personnel sphere, completes welding on submersible after 700 trials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-develops-personnel-sphere-completes-welding-on-submersible-after-700-trials/articleshow/122867246.cms,"MATSYA-6000

NEW DELHI: In a landmark achievement for India’s Deep Ocean Mission, Isro has successfully developed the personnel sphere for the submersible vessel MATSYA-6000, designed to carry humans up to 6,000 metres (6km) below the ocean surface, by completing a critical welding process after 700 weld trials.‘Samudrayaan', a project under the Deep Ocean Mission of the ministry of earth sciences (MoES), aims to strengthen India’s capabilities in deep-sea exploration. The National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), under MoES, collaborated with Isro’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) to design and fabricate the spherical crew compartment. The Deep Ocean mission will allow scientists to explore unexplored deep-sea areas, assess mineral resources like nickel, cobalt and rare earth elements, and study marine biodiversity. The mission is expected to be realised by 2026.Central to the Samudrayaan effort is the creation of a human occupied vehicle (HOV) that can withstand extreme pressure and temperature conditions on the seafloor. “At the heart of the HOV is a titanium personnel sphere, a 2,260mm diameter enclosure with 80mm thick walls, made from a high-strength alloy. Designed by VSSC, the sphere is built to endure pressure up to 600 bar and temperatures as low as -3°C,” Isro said Wednesday.One of the biggest challenges scientists faced in creating this weld lay in the properties of titanium as a metal. While titanium is known for its strength, it can be difficult to weld. The technical challenge was developing a reliable electron beam welding process capable of fusing thick (80-102 mm) titanium plates. Isro’s Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), Bengaluru, took charge of augmenting its welding facility from a 15kW to a 40kW EBW capacity.LPSC developed the process and infrastructure for the welding process and non-destructive evaluation (NDE). While LPSC had the expertise to carry out welding up to 20mm thickness, it augmented the EBW machine from a 15kW rating to 40kW, while also making alterations to the chemical cleaning and handling equipment to accommodate the increased size and mass.Over 700 weld trials were conducted to optimise the process parameters, ensuring high quality and structural integrity. For quality assurance, Isro enhanced its X-ray radiography capability, one of the highest energy levels used in India, allowing detailed non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of the welded joints.The breakthrough came with the successful completion of the first high-penetration weld on the actual sphere hardware. This involved 80mm thick welds over a 7,100mm length, achieved in a continuous 32-minute operation, “a national first in scale and precision” as per Isro.The milestone marks a significant leap for India’s underwater exploration ambitions and brings Matsya-6000 closer to sea trials. Once complete, the vehicle will be among the very few human submersibles in the world capable of reaching such depths, opening new frontiers for deep sea science, resource exploration and technology development.","Isro has successfully developed the personnel sphere for the submersible vessel MATSYA-6000.

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over death of five tigers in MM Hills sanctuary last month, Supreme Court on Wednesday sought Karnataka govt's response and asked the Union ministry of environment and forests to frame policy in consultation with states to end human-animal conflict, resulting in such avoidable tragic incidents.Amicus curiae and senior advocate P Parameshwaran placed the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) report before a three-judge bench led by CJI B R Gavai and said it was a clear case of human-animal conflict as villagers poisoned a cattle carcass which was consumed by a tigress and her four cubs, resulting in their death. He said many cattle of surrounding villages strayed into the sanctuary and were attacked by wild animals, including tigers. It required robust patrolling by forest staff, but it was not being done as the majority of forest staff were hired by contractors.The contractors did not provide these outsourced forest guards, employed in most tiger reserves and sanctuaries, any weapon or scientific equipment to effectively patrol the sanctuary and protect it from stray cattle and poachers, resulting in such unfortunate incidents, Parameshwaran said.The bench asked additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati to ask the MoEF take the initiative by consulting all states and stakeholders to solve this staff issue. Bhati assured the court that it would be done. ""This tragic incident underscores the urgent need for stronger preventive measures, including intensified patrolling, robust surveillance mechanisms like camera traps, community engagement to address human-wildlife conflict, rapid response protocols for carcass monitoring, and stricter enforcement of laws against wildlife poisoning to prevent recurrence of such deliberate killings,"" the CEC said in its report.

NEW DELHI: After a 5-year hiatus, and ahead of a possible visit by PM Narendra Modi to China next month for the SCO summit, India announced resumption of tourist visas for Chinese nationals. Both sides have looked to facilitate people-to-people exchanges to normalise ties and China, which has been keen to resume direct air services, welcomed the decision as a positive move.The Indian embassy in Beijing announced the decision effective July 24 on Weibo, China’s microblogging site, on a day the 2 countries also held another round of diplomatic talks on border affairs, expressing satisfaction with the “general prevalence of peace and tranquillity in the border areas, leading to gradual normalization of bilateral relations”.India and China have had frequent high-level engagements since Modi’s meeting with President Xi Jinping in Kazan last year, following the agreement to complete the disengagement of troops at the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh. The decision to restart tourist visa services for Chinese nationals is the second significant step towards normalisation, after the resumption of Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.“This is a positive move. Easing cross-border travel serves the interests of all parties. China will maintain communication and consultation with India to further facilitate travel between the two countries,” said the Chinese foreign ministry.Chinese foreign minister and special representative (SR) for boundary talks Wang Yi is expected to visit India soon for next round of SR talks with NSA Ajit Doval and, with the thaw in ties holding up, Modi himself is likely to visit China for the SCO summit on August 31-September 1. If it happens, this will be Modi’s first visit to the country in 7 years. During his recent visit to China, Jaishankar had said, while citing the complex international situation, that as neighbouring nations and major economies, an open exchange of views and perspectives between India and China is very important.In the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination (WMCC) talks on India-China Border Affairs, according to an Indian readout, the 2 sides agreed to maintain regular exchanges and contacts on issues related to the boundary affairs at the diplomatic and military levels through established mechanisms.The focus was also on the upcoming SR talks for which Wang will be in India. “The two sides also prepared for the next round of the Special Representatives' Talks on the India-China Boundary Question to be held in India later this year,” said the Indian readout. Doval had travelled to China for the last round of SR boundary talks in December, 2024. Doval and Wang had then reiterated the importance of maintaining a “political perspective of the overall bilateral relationship” while seeking a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable framework for settlement of the boundary question, and resolved to inject more vitality into this process.","India and China have had frequent high-level engagements since Modi’s meeting with President Xi Jinping in Kazan last year.

Personal finance author Robert Kiyosaki has once again raised alarm over the state of the global financial system, urging investors to abandon fiat currencies and instead turn to real assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin.In a fresh social media post on X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author reiterated his long-standing criticism of central banks, warning that the US economy is on the brink of a historic collapse.“Stop saving FAKE $,” Kiyosaki wrote, advising his followers to “Start saving real gold, silver, Bitcoin.” Referring to his well-known principle, he added: “Rich Dads Rule: ‘Savers are Losers.’”Kiyosaki slammed the US Federal Reserve for repeatedly responding to financial crises by expanding the money supply, calling it a form of “printing fake money.” He listed several examples including the 1987 market crash, the 1998 collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the 2019 repo market seizure, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Silicon Valley Bank crash, claiming that in each instance, the Fed’s solution was the same, print more money.“It’s not a new crisis... it’s the same crisis getting bigger,” he argued, describing what he sees as a pattern of systemic failure. He warned that America has now become “the biggest debtor nation in history...because of the FED,” and reaffirmed his belief that “The Biggest Crash in history is coming… soon.”According to ET, Kiyosaki has consistently positioned himself as a critic of modern monetary policy and a staunch advocate for alternative stores of value.His posts in recent months have included bullish predictions for silver, with the author claiming the metal is still “significantly undervalued” and suggesting that its price could double.Kiyosaki’s warnings echo a broader scepticism held by some financial commentators about the sustainability of high debt levels and the long-term value of fiat currency in a low-interest, high-liquidity environment.While his views are controversial, they continue to resonate with a growing number of investors seeking protection from perceived monetary instability.This latest post reaffirms Kiyosaki’s core message, steer clear of cash and paper assets and instead prioritise tangible alternatives to safeguard long-term wealth.(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own.

Morgan Rielly, Brandon Carlo, and Nazem Kadri linked to Toronto Maple Leafs trade talks

Toronto Maple Leafs front office stays aggressive in NHL offseason roster overhaul

FAQs:

1. Has Nazem Kadri ever played for the Maple Leafs?

2. What position does Morgan Rielly play?

With Mitch Marner now headed to the Vegas Golden Knights, the Toronto Maple Leafs are entering an aggressive new phase of roster construction. General manager Brad Treliving has already begun reshaping the team, but more changes could be coming. According to reports, the Leafs are now actively exploring potential trades involving Morgan Rielly, Brandon Carlo, and a possible reunion with Nazem Kadri.The inclusion of Morgan Rielly in trade discussions has raised eyebrows. As one of the longest-serving members of the team, Rielly has been a cornerstone of the Leafs' blue line. However, his $7.5 million cap hit and no-move clause create complications. Still, the front office is reportedly gauging whether he’d consider waiving it, especially if it opens the door for a different style of offensive defenseman, such as Erik Karlsson.Brandon Carlo’s name has also surfaced, which is surprising given that he was a recent addition to Toronto’s defense corps. Carlo offers value as a 6-foot-6 shutdown defender with a team-friendly cap hit and strong penalty-killing ability. He could be a key piece in acquiring a top-six forward, an area the Leafs are keen on improving after Marner's departure.Meanwhile, conflicting reports continue to swirl around Nazem Kadri.Some insiders suggest Calgary isn’t looking to move him, but others believe a strong enough offer could sway the Flames. Kadri, who spent a decade in Toronto and remains a fan favorite, is believed to be open to waiving his no-move clause if it means returning to the Leafs. However, other teams like Montreal may also be on his shortlist.Treliving appears committed to transforming the Leafs into a more balanced and goal-heavy team. While none of the above deals are confirmed, Toronto’s willingness to explore them signals that the organization is not clinging to sentiment or past loyalties. Names like Calle Jarnkrok and David Kampf have also been floated, but the Rielly-Kadri-Carlo trio represents the team’s most substantial possible shake-up yet.Nothing is finalized, but it’s clear the Maple Leafs are in full motion this offseason.

BENGALURU: A flashy garage featuring Rolls-Royce cars, once owned by Bollywood stars Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan, has now cost a Bengaluru-based realtor and politician nearly Rs 40 lakh in unpaid taxes.On Wednesday morning, a team of RTO officials swooped down on the Vasanthnagar residence of Yusuf Sharif, also known as KGF Babu, armed with evidence that he was operating Maharashtra-registered luxury cars in Bengaluru without paying the required state taxes.KGF Babu purchased a RollsRoyce Phantom from Amitabh Bachchan and a Rolls Royce Ghost from Aamir Khan. Officials said in 2021, field staff from the RTO impounded the Rolls-Royce bearing registration number MH 02 BB 0002.However, the vehicle was released shortly afterward, allegedly due to the intervention of higher-ups in the department. The department collected a penalty of Rs 5,500 before releasing the vehicle.This decision irked junior officials, who were not convinced by the move and believed it was a strong case for recovering the pending tax. After a gap of four years, on Wednesday, the RTO once again visited KGF Babu-this time with substantial proof that the cars were still being used in the state without paying the applicable taxes.An official said: ""Out-of-state registered vehicles must pay road tax if they are used in Karnataka for over a year. A notice was issued in 2021 for the luxury car purchased from Amitabh Bachchan. The other car, bought from Aamir Khan, has been in use since 2023, and we have gathered sufficient evidence of its operation within the state.After briefing KGF Babu about the rules and clarifying his queries, we asked him to pay the tax. He paid by cheque on the same day. For MH 02-BB-0002, Rs 19.8 lakh was collected, and for MH 11-AX-0001, Rs 18.5 lakh was paid.""The official said that in 2021, when the initial tax demand was raised, KGF Babu claimed that the vehicle he purchased from Amitabh Bachchan was in Karnataka only for a month and would soon be returned to Mumbai permanently.""After the vehicle was impounded and later released, he briefly sent it back to Mumbai but soon brought it back to Bengaluru. We now have sufficient records of the vehicles' usage on Bengaluru roads, including footage captured by traffic surveillance cameras.""Later, KGF Babu told the media: ""I have a passion for buying cars from celebrities. I bought these cars from Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan. I already paid lifetime road tax for these vehicles in Maharashtra-Rs 50 lakh for one and Rs 35 lakh for the other. I wasn't aware that I had to pay tax again in Karnataka. I run a business in Mumbai, and these vehicles were registered to my office address there. They operate in Mumbai for 15 days and in Karnataka for the other 15 days. ""He added: ""On Wednesday, officials from the transport department visited my house without any prior notice. They informed me of the applicable tax, and I cleared the dues immediately. I made a mistake out of ignorance. I urge others who own vehicles registered outside Karnataka to voluntarily approach their local RTOs and clear any pending tax dues.""","Yusuf Sharif, also known as KGF Babu, bought cars from Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan.

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power. Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, says he would study the physical sciences if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025.

Poll Do you support the removal of financial sanctions on athletes caught doping? Yes, it's a fair decision. No, there should be consequences.

Salient Features of the bill

An independent Appeals panel, the non-imposition of financial sanctions on athletes caught doping and ensuring the operational independence of the nation’s anti-doping watchdog are some of the key highlights of the ‘National Anti-Doping (Amendment) Bill 2025’, which was introduced in Parliament by sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Wednesday.The bill was tabled in the Lok Sabha after the govt addressed objections raised by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), which included reducing the extensive powers granted to the proposed ‘National Board for Anti-Doping in Sports’ under the legislation.The original bill, introduced by then sports minister Anurag Thakur and passed by both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in 2022, faced significant scrutiny from Wada for sustained govt interference and undermining the independence of the National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada). The govt’s continued control over Nada and the Appeals panel through the formation of the anti-doping Board led Wada to threaten a ban on India by disaffiliating the nation as its member and derecognising the National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) in Delhi.Following intense discussions between the sports ministry under Mandaviya and Wada officials, an amended version of the bill was introduced without substantial govt interference.Prior to the bill’s introduction, supervision and control over Nada were exercised by a governing body chaired by the sports minister. The Lausanne-based Wada, while revising its anti-doping Code, ensured that National Anti-Doping Organisations (NADOs) remain free from any govt overreach, citing conflicts of interest when NADOs are controlled by their respective union govt.Once the legislation becomes an Act, the anti-doping Board will no longer oversee the Appeals panel as was the case in the original bill passed in Aug 2022. Additionally, a clause in the previous bill that allowed the imposition of financial sanctions, including proportionate recovery of costs from athletes, was removed after Wada objected to it.“The amended bill seeks to enhance institutional and operational independence of the Appeals panel and Nada to ensure autonomy in their decisions pertaining to operations, investigations and enforcement activities,” stated the bill’s objectives.The amended version includes: “The Board may call for such information from the Disciplinary panel and the Appeals Panel on its operations and issue such directions, as may be necessary, for the effective and timely discharge of their functions with respect to Anti-Doping Rule Violations under this Act. Provided that such directions shall be limited to procedural efficiency of the Disciplinary Panel and the Appeals Panel and shall not, in any case, interfere with their decision making process. ”The amended bill comes as India topped Wada’s 2023 testing figures last month, analysing 5,000 or more samples.* To promote and strengthen the anti-doping measures in sports and to provide a statutory framework for the operation of the Nada, NDTL and for creation of the National Board for Anti-Doping in Sports.* Enhance institutional and operational independence of the Appeals Panel and Nada to ensure autonomy in their decisions pertaining to operations, investigations and enforcement activities.* Further align the provisions of the National Anti-Doping Act, 2022 with international best practices and the Wada Code.* Provide that such of the provisions of the Wada Code as are set out in the Schedule shall have the force of law in India","The ‘National Anti-Doping (Amendment) Bill 2025’ was introduced in Parliament by sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Wednesday. The bill was tabled in the Lok Sabha after the govt addressed objections raised by Wada. The original bill, introduced by then sports minister Anurag Thakur and passed by both the Lok and Rajya Sabha in 2022, faced significant scrutiny from Wada for sustained govt interference.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122872088,imgsize-27592,width-400,resizemode-4/122872088.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Delhi University's 2025 admission season has seen an unexpected reshuffle of its most sought-after courses. While BCom (Hons) remains firmly in the lead with 48,336 first-preference applications in the initial round, it is the rapid ascent of BSc (Hons) Zoology that is turning heads.The programme surged to third place with 12,722 top-choice applications, overtaking the traditionally popular English (Hons). With 15,295 applications, Political Science (Hons) was in second place.Last year, the three most preferred courses were BCom (H), BA (H) English, and BA (H) Political Science while Zoology (H) didn't figure even in the top five courses. However, this year appears to mark a decisive turn for the subject.An increasing number of students are getting drawn to life sciences, driven not only by academic interest but by a growing desire to engage with the world in more purposeful and tangible ways. According to Professor Rita Singh, head of DU's zoology department, this rising interest is no accident.""There are compelling reasons why students are choosing zoology more now than before.Zoology offers a wholesome understanding of life - whether it is biodiversity, drug design or toxicology,"" she explained. ""Conceptual clarity is key, and zoology provides that foundation - right from how receptors work to understanding environmental toxins like endocrine disruptors. This core knowledge gives the subject a strong edge. ""She added that the Covid pandemic was a turning point in how students perceived life sciences. ""During the pandemic, students realised that the disciplines addressing immunity, vaccination, genetics and PCR were all rooted in zoology. Now, those interested in setting up diagnostics startups or small biotech ventures are turning to this subject. It offers interdisciplinary strength, hands-on experience and opens doors across research, healthcare and industry. ""Singh also noted that the subject's integration with the new National Education Policy, especially the fourth-year research option, is encouraging more students to engage deeply with the discipline.""It is not just about animal biodiversity anymore. Students are learning how physiology links with environmental science, how allied fields like biotechnology and medicine intersect - and how zoology can be a bridge to all of them. It offers a truly multidisciplinary future.""The surging popularity of zoology reflects a broader generational shift. Students today are viewing education through the lens of purpose and real-world application. For many, the subject is a launchpad into diverse fields - from scientific research and wildlife conservation to sustainable entrepreneurship.""My interest in zoology and wildlife began with books and deepened through environment-related videos on YouTube. I have always admired those who speak up for the voiceless - people committed to protecting animals and nature. What draws me most is the hands-on fieldwork which resonates with my belief that work should be both meaningful and fulfilling.There are many ways to serve the environment, but the most powerful path is one that brings both purpose and joy,"" said Shreya Singh, a BSc (Hons) Zoology final-year student.Experts say this trend is rooted as much in practical ambition as it is in passion. Dr Sanjiv Mullick from Dyal Singh College's zoology department highlighted the applied nature of the subject. ""Zoology has highly applied branches like economic zoology - fisheries, sericulture, apiculture.These are fertile grounds for entrepreneurship. Many students today want to launch their own ventures in fishery science or silk and honeybee production,"" he said.","Delhi University's 2025 admission season has seen an unexpected reshuffle of its most sought-after courses.

How the attack works



Three Chinese state-sponsored groups behind global attack



What organisation should do



Microsoft has issued a warring to organisations that are using on-premises SharePoint servers. The tech giant has confirmed that the hackers are exploiting vulnerabilities in its on on-premises SharePoint servers to deploy ransomware. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence team has identified a specific actor, designated Storm-2603 , as being responsible for these new ransomware campaigns. Earlier, the exploration of SharePoint vulnerabilities led of data exfiltration , but the latest observations suggest motivated financial attacks leveraging the Warlock ransomware. Hackers are using the Warlock ransomware to paralyze networks and demand cryptocurrency payments.In an updated blog post Microsoft explains that the attack starts with the exploitation of an internet-facing on-premises SharePoint server. This initial breach grants Storm-2603 access to the environment, often facilitated by a payload named spinstall0.aspx. Once the hacker gains access they then move ahead and deploy ransomware.Microsoft has confirmed that SharePoint Online is not affected, but on-premises versions—including SharePoint 2016, 2019, and Subscription Edition—remain vulnerable if not patched.Microsoft identified three China-linked groups—Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon, and Storm-2603—as exploiting critical vulnerabilities in SharePoint servers that rendered customers running the software on their own networks vulnerable to attack. The breaches affected organizations across multiple sectors, including government agencies, energy companies, consulting firms, and universities spanning from the US to Europe and the Middle East.No sensitive or classified information was reportedly compromised in the National Nuclear Security Administration breach, according to sources familiar with the matter. The semiautonomous Energy Department arm responsible for producing and dismantling nuclear weapons was targeted alongside other federal agencies including the US Education Department.Microsoft has also shared some guidelines for users to protect their on-premises SharePoint Server environment. The company has asked the users to:- Enable Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) integration and deploy Defender AV on all SharePoint servers- If AMSI cannot be enabled, Microsoft recommends disconnecting servers from the internet- Use Defender for Endpoint to detect post-exploit activity and monitor for suspicious file creation like spinstall0.aspx","Microsoft has issued a warring to organisations that are using on-premises SharePoint servers.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

The publicly-owned franchise’s annual report, a rare financial window into the league, confirms the NFL’s national income surpassed $13.8 billion, propelled by record-breaking media rights, live sports dominance, and strategic streaming expansion.NFL games remain one of the few live events Americans consistently tune in for, and the league has capitalized on that with historic media contracts. According to Packers president Mark Murphy, “A big part of it obviously is TV. How people watch TV is changing dramatically.” That shift helped push the NFL’s national revenue to an all-time high, as newer streaming models complemented existing broadcast deals.While tech-driven innovation has expanded reach, traditional television still dominates. Murphy added, “The vast majority of our national revenue is coming from broadcast television,” noting that the NFL’s hybrid media approach is helping maintain consistent growth—targeting an annual 7% increase across its revenue streams.Beyond the national windfall, the Packers posted strong gains in local income. Their total revenue jumped 9.9% year over year to $719.1 million, with local revenue climbing 13.7% to $286.4 million—boosted significantly by hosting a ninth regular-season home game at Lambeau Field. These surges reflect how well the franchise has balanced national exposure with hometown loyalty.Operational profits also told a strong story, rising to $83.7 million, a 39.3% increase, while the team’s corporate reserve fund reached $579 million, up 8%. These numbers highlight Green Bay's healthy financial backbone and their ability to convert NFL momentum into local economic power.With over half of the Packers’ total earnings sourced from the league’s national revenue share, the financial strategy of the NFL has become essential to every franchise’s stability. “That’s mostly the growth in the national TV deals,” Murphy noted, emphasizing how broadcasting remains the league’s financial engine.The numbers, now set to be shared at the team’s shareholder meeting, underscore why the NFL’s structure is considered one of the most lucrative in sports. And as the NFL pivots further into digital partnerships while holding strong on network television, the league appears poised for even more growth.Also read: “Get paid soon”: CeeDee Lamb pressures Jerry Jones as $45M Micah Parsons standoff shakes Cowboys camp He is the president and CEO of the Green Bay Packers, the only publicly owned team in the NFL.Because they are publicly owned, unlike other privately held NFL franchises.It offers rare, official insight into the NFL’s actual revenue distribution—data no other team is required to release.","The NFL's national income surpassed $13.8 billion, propelled by record-breaking media rights, live sports dominance, and strategic streaming expansion.

They say the deal feels like it’s “inside the five‑yard line,” meaning almost done.The plan is for NFL owners to possibly vote in early August.

BENGALURU: When Karan Vaidya, co-founder of AI infra startup Composio, promised a Porsche to anyone who referred a product engineer who joined their San Francisco team and stayed for three months, it sounded like a spiel.""Not kidding,"" he wrote in the now-viral X post, complete with a photo of a black Porsche model he had in mind.Just hours later, Roy Lee, co-founder of Cluely, another early-stage AI startup, chimed in with his own no-nonsense offer.

This same week, Microsoft reportedly poached 24 AI researchers from Google DeepMind, including Amar Subramanya, the former engineering head of Gemini team who is now a corporate VP at Microsoft AI. Meta hired three DeepMind experts who had helped build a language model that achieved gold medal-level performance in the International Math Olympiad.Meta has also been aggressively staffing its new Superintelligence unit, reportedly offering compensation packages of over $100 million to lure top researchers from OpenAI and Anthropic.""There's a real risk that we're overpaying for momentum and mistaking it for durability,"" said Manav Garg, co-founder and managing partner at Together Fund.""High-visibility compensation moves can bring in mercenaries rather than missionaries.

Trump vs Columbia: Ivy league school to pay over $220 million in landmark settlement; campus protests curbed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vs-columbia-ivy-league-school-to-pay-200-million-in-landmark-settlement-campus-protests-curbed/articleshow/122868828.cms,"



Columbia University will now be paying more than $220 million along with making major policy changes as part of a settlement with the Trump administration. The deal follows allegations of civil rights violations and claims the university failed to protect Jewish students from discrimination, as reported exclusively by the New York Post.The Ivy League university will also be subjected to federal oversight, with independent monitoring in place to ensure it adheres to merit-based admissions and hiring processes. The agreement follows four months of negotiations and comes amid mounting pressure on elite universities like Harvard, which has taken the administration to court over the loss of $2.6 billion in funding linked to similar issues.As part of the settlement, Columbia will pay $200 million to the federal government to resolve discrimination claims and a further $20 million to Jewish staff who were reportedly targeted during anti-semitic protests on campus in the wake of the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel. The Trump administration is touting the payout as the largest of its kind in nearly two decades under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.As per a source cited by the New York Post, when the government pulled $400 million from Columbia in March, it put billions more in research and other funding at risk.The deal mandates that Columbia dismantle any programmes that discriminate based on race, bringing it in line with the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling that banned race-based affirmative action.It will also create new faculty positions aimed at boosting intellectual diversity and overhaul its approach to discipline, removing oversight from the faculty senate and placing it under the Provost’s Office.The settlement includes strong security provisions too. Columbia must coordinate with the NYPD to prevent incidents like the 2024 occupation of Hamilton Hall and impose a blanket ban on masked protests. Disciplinary action has already been taken, with dozens of students suspended, penalised, or expelled over recent anti-Israel demonstrations.In a further move likely to fuel debate, the university’s admissions office will now vet international applicants more closely, requiring them to disclose their reasons for studying in the US, data that will be shared with federal authorities. Columbia will also report disciplinary actions for visa-holding students under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS) and reduce reliance on international enrolment.Several academic departments and international centres, including the Center for Palestine Studies and the Middle East Institute, will now come under close scrutiny by a newly created senior vice provost role, aimed at ensuring ideological balance and compliance with federal rules.The school will also align with Title IX standards by ending policies that allow biological men to compete in women’s sports or use women’s facilities.Most of the $400 million in previously frozen federal funding will be restored once Columbia meets all conditions of the agreement. The resolution will remain in effect for three years, with a compliance monitor issuing twice-yearly updates on progress.“This agreement marks an important step forward after a period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty,” said acting president Claire Shipman.“The settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track. Importantly, it safeguards our independence, a critical condition for academic excellence and scholarly exploration, work that is vital to the public interest.”Leaked details from the talks suggest that Columbia agreed to release internal admissions and hiring data and accept the $200 million fine to avoid further loss of research funding. In March, the White House issued nine key demands as a prerequisite for federal support, including enforcement of institutional neutrality and academic diversity.The final deal explicitly bans the use of diversity narratives or racial identity statements in applications, in a move likely to send ripples through higher education.The conflict has led to dramatic leadership changes at Columbia. President Minouche Shafik stepped down in August 2024 amid escalating protests. Her interim successor, Katrina Armstrong, was removed just seven months later after publicly supporting the administration’s mask ban, while privately assuring faculty she wouldn’t enforce it.She has now been replaced by Shipman, whose past private messages questioning fears of anti-semitism and pushing to remove the only Jewish board member and quick appointment of an “Arab” member instead,have triggered a congressional investigation.Republican lawmakers are currently reviewing whether new laws are needed to hold university leadership more accountable, amid growing concerns over campus anti-semitism and ideological bias.","Columbia University has agreed to pay $220 million in a settlement with the Trump administration.

‘Stop The Killing’: Malaysian PM Anwar Urges Trump To Rein In Israel Amid Gaza Attacks

.





United States and Indonesia have agreed on a new trade deal that will reduce tariffs and allow more American goods into the Southeast Asian country.The White House said that Indonesia will also ease its export restrictions on critical minerals like nickel, copper and cobalt — which are key for electric vehicles and electronics.Under the deal, US will lower a planned tariff on Indonesian products from 32 percent to 19 percent. However, items suspected of being transshipped to avoid duties will face a higher 40 percent rate.US president Donald Trump celebrated the agreement on his social media platform, Truth Social on Tuesday, calling it a “huge win” for American businesses. He said Indonesia will cut 99 percent of its tariff barriers, making it easier for US companies to sell industrial, tech and agricultural goods there.In return, Indonesia is expected to buy American products, including Boeing aircraft, farm produce and energy.A US official said the deal could be worth at least $50 billion for the US in terms of new trade and purchases. The official also said Indonesia will no longer try to tax cross-border data flows — something the US had opposed — and will accept US vehicle safety standards.The agreement comes ahead of a 1 August deadline, when the US is set to raise tariffs on several countries. Similar trade deals have also been announced with Britain, Vietnam and the Philippines.","United States and Indonesia have agreed on a new trade deal that will reduce tariffs and allow more American goods into the Southeast Asian country.
