Clear increase in deaths

Stray dog menace

On March 26, 1993, The New York Times published a photograph of an emaciated Sudanese child stalked by a vulture. The child survived, the photograph won a Pulitzer in 1994, and the photographer, Kevin Carter, committed suicide the same year.Something else happened in ’93 that went unnoticed. The patent on a 20-year-old drug expired. This drug was the common painkiller diclofenac, found in products like Volini, Voveran, etc.Until 1993, its supply was controlled by the Swiss pharma firm Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis ), but with the patent over, generic production took off. Prices crashed everywhere. In Sri Lanka, for example, generic diclofenac cost Re 1, as against Rs 8 for the branded product in August 1995.It happened in India, too. After all, Indian generic manufacturers were driving down diclofenac’s price. The result was that in 1994, veterinary use of diclofenac became common. Farmers started using it to treat “injuries, inflammations and fevers in wounded or sick animals”. It made sense because diclofenac was cheap, easily available, and worked in 15 minutes.But then, something else that nobody had imagined happened. Indian vultures started dying in large numbers. By the time the link between vulture deaths and diclofenac in animal carcasses was discovered, it was too late. India’s vulture population was practically annihilated. From almost 40 million in the early 1990s, vultures became rare in the early 2000s.But that’s an old story. Now, a new report byresearchers Eyal Frank and Anant Sudarshan claims the loss of vultures indirectly led to hundreds of thousands of human deaths.In their paper titled ‘The Social Costs of Keystone Species Collapse: Evidence From The Decline of Vultures in India’, Frank and Sudarshan say: “The functional extinction of vultures…increased human mortality by over 4%.”It might not sound like a huge change, but we are talking about human lives here, not car mileage. If 100,000 people die every year in a country, a 4% change means 4,000 additional deaths. The researchers claim “an average of 104,386 additional deaths a year” between 2000 and 2005. They have also estimated the economic loss to the country from these additional deaths: almost $70 billion per year.Humans drove cheetahs to extinction and brought tigers to its verge without suffering serious consequences. So, why did the near-extinction of vultures prove so harmful? The answer to that question lies in the word ‘keystone’ in the title of Frank and Sudarshan’s paper. They describe vultures as a keystone species because “if they are removed, the effects on the ecosystem are potentially large”.That’s not an exaggeration. For a moment, go back to Carter’s photograph of the Sudanese child. Why was the vulture waiting for it to die? The answer is: vultures have evolved as scavengers, not predators, although occasionally you hear rumours of them killing livestock.When it comes to scavenging, they are unmatched. Frank and Sudarshan say a flock of vultures – the precise word is ‘committee’ – can reduce a 385kg cow carcass to bones in 40 minutes. Dogs and rats also scavenge but they aren’t so efficient. They leave behind a lot of flesh on the bones to rot, and dogs spread rabies themselves.So, for thousands of years, vultures shouldered the municipal task of scavenging in India’s towns and villages. Farmers reared animals, and when the animals died vultures promptly took care of the carcasses. India has always had very large livestock populations – 500 million, per the 2019 livestock census – and the report estimates the 40-odd million vultures in India till 1993 could have consumed meat equivalent to the weight of 27 million cows in a year. That’s 10.4 billion kilos of meat.By removing millions of tonnes of flesh from the environment, vultures not only contained the spread of pathogens but also curbed the numbers of other scavengers like rats and feral dogs, which spread the deadly rabies virus.As the vulture population melted away, Frank and Sudarshan say ‘animal landfills’ emerged outside towns and villages. Burying carcasses deep in the ground or incinerating them was expensive, so they were dumped “on the outskirts of population centres across India”. Sometimes, the carcasses were dumped in water, or fluids leaching from their rotting bodies flowed into water bodies.Frank and Sudarshan carefully examined death rates before and after the decline of vulture populations. For their analysis, they separately studied areas that originally had large vulture populations, and those that didn’t. The data showed areas that were unsuitable for vultures used to have marginally higher death rates (1.2 extra deaths per 1,000 people) between 1988 and 1993.The researchers suggest this might have been because the areas with fewer vultures – cooler and drier places – had a problem of rotting carcasses leading to disease and death.But when vulture numbers fell dramatically in 1996, the death rate in areas that had always had bigger vulture populations became higher by “0.65 deaths per 1,000 people”. By 2005, the gap had increased to 1.4 additional deaths per 1,000 people.And this “sanitation shock” due to the disappearance of vultures was felt more strongly in urban areas that didn’t have vast open spaces to dispose of carcasses. Also, their “significantly higher population density, and network infrastructure such as drains allowing pathogens and waste to spread rapidly” made the situation worse. Frank and Sudarshan say, “We find that urban areas experienced a larger increase in death rates relative to the combined sample.”Dog bites and rabies are big problems in India. On July 30, the government informed Parliament that there were 3 million dog bite cases in 2023, and 4.7 million rabies shots were given. Still, 286 people died.The study suggests India’s dog population multiplied when vulture populations declined. The same dead animals that vultures removed meticulously were now available to dogs to devour. And dogs, unlike vultures, breed rapidly.Frank and Sudarshan cite the spurt in demand for rabies shots after 1996 as evidence of a sharp increase in dog numbers, following the decimation of vulture populations.","Vultures have evolved as scavengers, not predators. For thousands of years, vultures shouldered the municipal task of scavenging in India. But in 1993, the patent on a 20-year-old drug expired.

"India, UK discuss Bangladesh but suspense remains over Hasina",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-asylum-suspense-uk-counterpart-calls-up-eam/articleshow/112387774.cms,"NEW DELHI: UK foreign secretary David Lammy dialled his counterpart S Jaishankar Thursday amid the suspense over where deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina , who fled to India from Dhaka on Monday, might be headed. Jaishankar said in a post on X that the leaders discussed the situation in Bangladesh and West Asia.The UK government said after the call that it remains in touch with India and other partners in the region to monitor and respond to the ""latest events"" in Bangladesh.The ministry of external affairs (MEA), however, didn’t confirm if India had discussed the issue of asylum for Hasina with the UK or any other country, saying it did not have an update on her travel plans and it was up to her to take things forward.""She was allowed to come here at very short notice. The situation is still evolving. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on her travel plans,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.In the current circumstances, it’s unlikely though that she will be able to leave Delhi in the next few days, if not longer. As Jaishankar had said in Parliament, Hasina had sought approval to come ""for the moment"" to India. While she is yet to officially apply for asylum, it’s believed that she would prefer going to the US or UK. However, it’s not possible to apply for asylum from outside the UK under their immigration rules. According to the UK, the fastest route to safety for anyone is to seek asylum in the first safe country they reach. In Hasina’s case, the first country she reached is India.It's not easy for India though to take a decision, given it can’t possibly expel Hasina, with whom successive Indian governments have had cordial ties, and allowing her an extended stay may rile the new government, something India can ill afford to do now. The media in Dhaka Wednesday reported a call by the local Supreme Court Bar Association for India to arrest Hasina and deport her back.The UK’s position on Hasina in the past was also vastly different from the way India handled her, and that has reflected in the way London has reacted to her dramatic fall. While seeking a peaceful and democratic future for Bangladesh, Lammy said after Hasina’s exit that the people of Bangladesh deserve a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events of the past few weeks. Any such probe is certain to delve into Hasina’s role, including her role to deploy troops on the streets, in the violence that left more than 400 dead in the past 2 months. The UK joined the US in declaring that the elections in January this year, in which Hasina secured her 4th term in office, were not free, fair and credible, even though India went out on a limb to defend her, mainly because of her efforts to tackle Islamic extremism.","UK foreign secretary David Lammy dialled his counterpart S Jaishankar Thursday amid the suspense over where deposed Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina might be headed.

Hasina ’s excessive use of force against the protesters was said to have hastened her departure.While discussing the threat to Indian citizens, government sources also said Thursday that the Indian high commission in Dhaka in coordination with the Bangladesh army was facilitating ""safe passage"" for Indian nationals to the border.In its first remarks on the situation in Dhaka after Hasina’s exit, the ministry of external affairs ( MEA ) underscored the primacy of the people’s interests.""The situation is evolving, and it’s been reported that this evening the interim government will be sworn in. Once those things are in place, we’d like to emphasise that as far as the Indian government and the people of India are concerned, the interest of the people of Bangladesh is foremost in our minds,"" said spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Widely seen as the principal backer of Hasina, and with the former PM still here in the absence of any asylum offer from the West, India has been treading cautiously on developments in Bangladesh. Unlike the US, India has so far not called for respecting the need to uphold democratic principles or the rule of law.However, the government has remained in touch with authorities in Dhaka, including the military, to ensure the safe of Indian citizens and the minority Hindu community. While recalling the deep concern that Jaishankar expressed for minorities in his statement in Parliament, the Indian officials also said, ""we want to make it very clear that it is the responsibility of every government to ensure the well-being of its citizens, and we hope for early restoration of law and order in Bangladesh"".According to Indian officials, the mission in Dhaka has facilitated movement of Indian nationals including project personnel across the land borders. ""Some of these situations were life threatening,"" said a source, adding movement of the members of IRCON Khulna, L&T, RITES, Tata Projects, Afcons and Transrail sirajganj was facilitated through the land border.""Mission has also facilitated consular cases including immigration. Emergency Certificates have been issued to Indian nationals to facilitate their travel in emergency cases. It hasensured that airlines continue to operate and not discontinue the services, which serves as a big enabler to ensure that people are not left stranded,"" said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.","India has so far, unlike the US, not welcomed the formation of an interim government in Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: In a move that could help expedite the launch of cutting-edge therapies in India, the Centre has decided to waive local trials for drugs and vaccines that are more advanced than current standards and have been approved in US, UK, Japan, Australia, Canada and EU. These can be launched in Indian market directly, subject to approval from CDSCO, India’s top drug regulatory body, according to an executive order issued by govt.USA, UK, Japan, Australia, Canada and EU have strong regulatory mechanisms in place for drug approval .Local trials were required in most cases until now, among other reasons, to rule out any potential difference in the safety and efficacy of drugs on Indian population. A top health ministry official said such differences can affect 0.1 to 0.2% of the population.“For that, we did not want to deprive the rest of the patients/population who may be needing those medicines, hence this decision,” the official said. “There have been multiple instances in the past when reputed firms postponed or faced delays in launch of a new drug that had been already approved in major markets such as the EU because they couldn’t undertake or complete local trials. Govt order will do away with this need,” he added.One of the examples of drug categories that may benefit from govt decision is Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy that are already approved in the US for treating leukaemia. They might get speedy approval for use in India as well. Sacituzumab govitecan, used to treat breast cancer that has spread in the body, isn’t available in India currently.

: SC to Centre

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Thursday directed setting up of a high-powered committee of the Cabinet secretary, secretaries of ministries of jal shakti, power and environment & forests along with chief secretary of Uttrakhand to reconsider the expert panel ’s report recommending approval for 28 hydro power projects.It questioned Centre’s decision not to accept the report, and to allow only seven of the projects without giving any reason.“You have to show the decision-making process is rational,” it said.A bench of Justices B R Gavai, Prashant Kumar Mishra and K V Viswanathan said the expert panel comprised members from various fields and govt did not give any reason for not accepting the report. The bench said it cannot question the decision but can certainly examine the decision-making process.“You have to satisfy that the report was duly considered and reasons were given to accept or reject the report. What compelled you to only allow seven projects? When an expert committee was appointed on the direction of the court then you have to show reasons for not accepting it,” the bench told additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, who was appearing for the Centre.Bhati told the bench there were differences of opinion among different ministries — power and environment & forests on one side and jal shakti on the other — and there was consensus on only seven projects due to which they were approved. Besides, she added, these projects were at an advanced stage of construction.The hydro power projects in the state came under judicial scrutiny after the 2013 floods. Taking suo motu cognisance, SC had banned further construction of all such projects. Taking into account the huge investments made by companies in seven projects, SC had asked the Centre to appoint an expert committee to study the environmental and ecological impact of the projects. The seven projects were Tehri Stage II (on Bhagirathi river), Tapovan Vishnugad (Dhauligangan river), Vishnugad Pipalkoti (Alaknanda), Singoli Bhatwari and Phata Buyong (Mandakini), Madhyamaheswar (Madhmaheshwar Ganga) and Kaliganga II (Kaliganga).Opposing the findings of the report, it was submitted by advocate Prashant Bhushan that members of the expert committee which approved the projects were also involved in clearing the projects before the flood disaster . He said that another panel headed by veteran environmentalist Ravi Chopra had blamed dams for exacerbating the 2013 disaster and the court should not give credence to expert panel recommendations for approving the projects, which would further damage the environment.The court asked the panel of secretaries to consider all aspects and give a hearing to all stakeholders and take a decision within six months. It directed the committee to file minutes of its meeting before the court.","The hydro power projects in the state came under judicial scrutiny after the 2013 floods.

'Vinesh Phogat to be felicitated like a medallist'

NEW DELHI: A disappointed and heartbroken Indian wrestler, Vinesh Phogat announced her retirement from wrestling on Thursday following her disqualification from the Paris Olympics. Vinesh shared an emotional message on social media.She was disqualified after being found 100 grams overweight during the weigh-in ahead of her gold medal match.“Maa, kushti mere se jeet gayi, main haar gayi.Maaf karna, aapka sapna, meri himmat sab toot chuke. Isse zyada taqat nahi rahi ab” (Mom, Wrestling has defeated me, I have lost. I lost…my courage is all broken, I don't have any more strength now),” Vinesh wrote on her social media account.""Alvida, kushti (Goodbye Wrestling 2001-2024),” she concluded.Vinesh made history by becoming the first Indian woman wrestler to reach the gold medal bout in her category on Tuesday. She was assured of at least a silver medal before the disqualification.Vinesh's disqualification from the final match against Sarah Ann Hildebrandt of the United States due to being 100gm overweight during the morning weigh-in was the most devastating setback of the day. The 29-year-old wrestler was utterly shattered by the turn of events.In response to her disqualification, Vinesh filed an appeal, requesting that she be awarded a joint silver medal. She was replaced in the final by Cuba's Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, whom Vinesh had defeated in the semifinals. Lopez ultimately lost to Hildebrandt in the championship match.As per international regulations, any wrestler found to be overweight during the weigh-in process will automatically be placed at the bottom of the final standings, regardless of their performance in the tournament.Indian Olympic Association (IOA) President PT Usha voiced her shock and disappointment over Vinesh's disqualification.""After hearing the news that Vinesh Phogat is disqualified, I am shocked and disappointed. I had come here to meet Vinesh; she is physically and medically okay. Mentally, she is disappointed. Our support staff is with her, trying their best to help her reduce weight,"" PT Usha said.Previously, Dinshaw Pardiwala, Chief Medical Officer of the Indian Olympic contingent, disclosed that Phogat was 2.7 kg over the weight limit following her semi-final bout. He mentioned that efforts were made to help her reduce weight by restricting her food and water intake.Following her disqualification on Wednesday, Vinesh also appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).According to an IOA source, Vinesh requested the CAS to award her the silver medal.""Vinesh Phogat has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against her disqualification, asking for the silver medal. CAS will give its verdict tomorrow morning,"" the source had told ANI.Vinesh is a three-time Olympian and has won gold medals in both the Asian and Commonwealth Games.For the last 12 months, she has been at the forefront of intense demonstrations against the previous Wrestling Federation of India president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who faces allegations of sexual misconduct from female wrestlers.Vinesh, a consistent competitor in the 53kg weight class, had to make the difficult transition to 50kg just a few months prior to the Games, as Antim Panghal had already secured the Paris quota spot in that category.Panghal suffered a defeat in the first round and now confronts potential deportation after attempting to grant her sister Nisha access to the Games Village using her own accreditation card.The Chief Minister of Haryana, Nayab Singh Saini, announced on Thursday that the state government will honor wrestler Vinesh in the same manner as they would an Olympic medalist.Despite not winning a medal, Vinesh will receive a reward equivalent to that of an Olympic silver medalist.Saini said in a post on X, ""Our brave daughter of Haryana, Vinesh Phogat, performed brilliantly and entered the final of the Olympics. She might not have been able to compete in the final due to some reason but she is a champion for all of us.""""Our government has decided that Vinesh Phogat will be welcomed and felicitated like a medallist. All the respect, reward and facilities that the Haryana government offers an Olympic silver medallist will be offered to Vinesh Phogat as well,"" he said in Hindi.As per the sports policy of the Haryana government, Olympic gold medalists are awarded Rs 6 crore, while silver and bronze medalists receive Rs 4 crore and Rs 2.5 crore, respectively.",Vinesh Phogat announced her retirement from wrestling on Thursday following her disqualification from the Paris Olympics.

Will be tough to cooperate with India if it helps our enemy Hasina: BNP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/will-be-tough-to-cooperate-with-india-if-it-helps-our-enemy-hasina-bnp/articleshow/112385419.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main rival of Sheikh Hasina ’s Awami League party, is clearly unhappy with India hosting the ousted Prime Minister after she fled Dhaka and arrived here on Monday.Veteran BNP functionary Gayeshwar Roy, who was a minister in the BNP-led govt in 1991, and is a member of the party’s standing committee, its highest decision-making forum, told TOI from Dhaka, “BNP believes Bangladesh and India must have mutual cooperation...Indian govt will have to understand and behave in a manner which follows that spirit. But if you help our enemy then it becomes difficult for that mutual cooperation to be honoured. Our former foreign minister (in the Hasina govt) said here before the last elections that India will help Sheikh Hasina’s return to office. Sheikh Hasina’s liability is being borne by India... Indian and Bangladesh people don’t have issues with each other. But should India promote one party and not the entire country?” Roy was replying to questions that BNP is perceived to have anti-India bias.Asked about reports of alleged attacks on Hindus and the perception about BNP being anti-minority, Roy said, “A perception has been created that BNP is anti-Hindu. BNP is made up of people from different communities in Bangladesh and stands for all religions. I have been a minister in this party’s regime and am ranked high enough in the BNP’s highest decision-making forum. BNP is a nationalist party but we believe in the individual rights of all communities.”“When I was a minister in 1991, I started the system of donations for Durga Pujas and no govt after that has stopped the policy, it is still on. It is our party’s govt that did it,” he added. On the concern about terrorist elements targeting India using Bangladesh, Roy said, “It is a perception again. Not the truth. India has helped in getting our Independence... we cannot be against India.”“We are a smaller country, we need India for many things including medical facilities, many other goods for our people, but the revenue that India earns from Bangladeshis on these accounts are also not a small amount,” he said.Asked about BNP’s equation with Jamaat-e-Islami , Roy made it clear “it’s not an ideological relationship. It is tactical support, which has to do with electoral politics.”“Awami League was in an official alliance with the Jamaat. From 2018 to 2024 we (BNP) had no relations with the Jamaat. There was Left, there was right, but there was no Jamaat with us. Sheikh Hasina took the Jamaat on board. Later she created Hefazat-e-Islam group to counter Jamaat. Today the same Hefazat is on the streets against Awami League.

But look at the persons from district judiciary who after being appointed as HC judges have a tenure of less than four to five years. They get a pension of Rs 15-25,000. Their tenure in the district judiciary is not counted. We have a slew of petitions by such retired HC judges.”“To get a pension of Rs 15-25,000 after spending the entire life in the judiciary is no social security for them. Look at the profile of such retired HC judges. They, except a few who can be counted on fingertips, do not return to practice nor do arbitration work after retirement. My earnest appeal to both of you (AG and SG) to sit down with the concerned officials (of the ministry) and examine the issue to arrive at a reasonable solution,” the CJI said.Though the AG reiterated that the issue involves multiple aspects, the SG said he and the AG would surely examine the issues involved regarding the pension. The CJI said, “We do understand the financial implications. But as the Supreme Court, we must also discharge our duties as the guardian of the judiciary,” he said and posted the matter for hearing on Aug 27.","The Supreme Court expressed grave concern over the pittance of pension received by retired HC judges, who were appointed as HC judges after spending their entire life in the district judiciary.

Why Bill proposes to repeal Section 40 of Waqf Act, 1995



NEW DELHI: ""Not running away from discussion or scrutiny"" were the words of minority affairs minister Kiren Rijiju on Thursday as he referred the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, to a joint Parliamentary committee for further discussion.The Bill was tabled in Lok Sabha with the aim to amend the Waqf Act, 1995, to address the 2013 amendment.In 2013, the definition of ""permanent dedication"" was revised, changing from ""permanent dedication by a person professing Islam"" to ""permanent dedication by any person."" This amendment is thought to have significantly broadened the scope, allowing anyone to dedicate property to Waqf boards.The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has criticized the bill as an intrusion into personal laws. BJP , in a post on X highlighted the key issues with the Waqf Act.""Allowing land to be dedicated as waqf based on usage poses risks of misuse and unauthorized claims on public land,"" it said.Once a property is designated as Waqf, it remains so indefinitely, leading to numerous disputes and claims.Other issues highlighted by the saffron party include ""enhanced powers of the Waqf Board could lead to potential overreach and disputes.""The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aims to modernize the management of Waqf properties by enhancing women's rights, ensuring equitable representation on the Central Waqf Council and Waqf boards, and reducing litigation.The bill proposes renaming the Act to ""Unified Waqf Management, Empowerment, Efficiency, and Development Act, 1995.""It aims to ensure representation for Muslim women and non-Muslims on Waqf boards and to include ""Aghakhani waqf"" and ""Bohra waqf"" alongside the existing Sunni and Shia Waqf boards.It includes a clause related to the ""welfare, maintenance of widow, divorced woman and orphan in such manner, as may be prescribed by the Central Government.""It addresses the controversial provision concerning ""waqf-alal-aulad,"" clarifying that it will not infringe upon the inheritance rights of the Waqif's heirs, including female heirs.The Bill proposes to repeal Section 40 of the Waqf Act, 1995 as it gives Waqf boards power to decide if a property falls under Waqf property.It specifies that only lawful owners with the capacity to transfer or dedicate property can create a Waqf.Waqf pertains to properties set aside solely for religious or charitable purposes under Islamic law. Once a property is designated as Waqf, ownership is transferred from the individual making the Waqf (waqif) to Allah, rendering it irrevocable.The irrevocability has led to various disputes including Bengaluru Eidgah ground, claimed as Waqf property since the 1850s, and the Surat Municipal Corporation building, which is claimed due to its historical use as a 'sarai' during the Mughal era.",Waqf pertains to properties set aside solely for religious or charitable purposes under Islamic law.

MUMBAI: A cryptic announcement by Pune-based industrialist Yohan Poonawalla and his wife Michelle about a property acquisition in south Mumbai has set tongues wagging in the city’s real estate market. A spokesperson representing the couple said they purchased a mansion in the most coveted and exclusive area of Cuffe Parade in south Mumbai. The standalone property, spanning approximately 30,000 square feet, joins a prestigious collection of mansions in the area that are typically priced between Rs 400 crore and Rs 750 crore.Despite persistent queries from TOI, the spokesperson refused to divulge the name of the mansion the Poonawallas bought.However, sources in the property market speculated that it could be the early 20th century heritage property Taraporewala Mansion where the writer Mulk Raj Anand once lived. Sources said the ground-plus-three-storey property was on sale for several years but added its price could be in the range of Rs 100 crore to Rs 150 crore only.“MYP Design Studio, under Michelle Poonawalla’s creative helm, will orchestrate the transformation of this architectural gem into the opulent Poonawalla Mansion , the couple’s secondary residence, their primary home being Poonawalla House in Pune.

ASI says Vidisha temple is a mosque,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/asi-statement-sparks-mandir-masjid-row/articleshow/112385063.cms,"Hindu groups sought permission to hold puja inside the site on August 9, but ASI cited a 1951 notification classifying it as the 'Bijamandal Mosque.' The permission was denied, causing outrage among Hindu groups.

BHOPAL: After Bhojshala , a new controversy has emerged in Madhya Pradesh , this time around the ancient Vijay Surya Mandir in MP’s Vidisha that is managed by Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ). Pictures of this temple had gone viral some time ago for its uncanny resemblance to the new Parliament building. For decades, Hindu devotees have observed religious rituals outside the site on Nag Panchami .This year, however, Hindu groups sought permission to enter the premises and hold puja on Aug 9. District collector Buddesh Vaishya forwarded their request to ASI, which responded by citing a 1951 gazette notification categorizing the site as ‘ Bijamandal Mosque ’. The collector then denied permission for worship, sparking outrage among Hindu groups.They oppose ASI’s classification of the site as a mosque, asserting that it has been a place of Hindu worship since 1972. The Vijay Surya Mandir / Bijamandal mosque site — around 60km from Bhopal and barely 10km from Sanchi Stupa — has had a tumultuous history. The ASI-Bhopal circle website says the mosque was constructed on ruins of a Hindu Temple. It is believed to have been built in the 11th-12th Century to honour the Sun God. The temple suffered significant damage during Mughal rule, particularly under the reign of Aurangzeb, after which it was repurposed as a mosque in the 17th Century. However, under Maratha rule, the mosque was relocated, and the site fell into disrepair, say locals.","Hindu groups sought permission to hold puja inside the site on August 9, but ASI cited a 1951 notification classifying it as the 'Bijamandal Mosque' The permission was denied, causing outrage among Hindu groups.

Is PMLA review plea ‘appeal in disguise’? SC to examine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/is-pmla-review-plea-appeal-in-disguise-sc-to-examine/articleshow/112385487.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court , while fixing a batch of petitions seeking review of its 2022 order on validity of various provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act , 2002, has observed whether review petition is an appeal in disguise .A bench of Justices Surya Kant, C T Ravikumar and Ujjal Bhuyan asked whether review proceedings would partake the character of an appeal even if a judgment was “gravely erred”.“Can this partake character of appeal? It is to be seen,” the bench said.The issue is of significance because of limited jurisdiction of review hearing which can be entertained only in case of error in verdict.The petitioners are seeking re-examination of the apex court’s July 27, 2022, order which upheld the stringent regime prescribed for money laundering offences and vast powers enjoyed by the Enforcement Directorate, allowing the agency to arrest people and conduct search and seizure even when no complaint has been filed, making statements made before the agency admissible in court while also putting the burden on the accused to prove his innocence.Interestingly, within a month of the order, the court decided to re-examine the verdict and issued notice to the central government in Aug 2022. It said “at least two of the issues raised in the instant petition require consideration”.In a shot in the arm for the anti-money laundering agency, a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar had validated the twin bail conditions as per which the accused could be granted bail only if there were reasonable grounds for the court to believe that he was not guilty and was unlikely to commit an offence while on bail.The provisions, which set the bar for bail very high in PMLA cases, was declared invalid by a two-judge SC bench in 2017 on the ground of being discriminatory but was reintroduced in the law a year later. In the 2022 order, however, a 3-judge bench court justified the twin conditions by saying they were also part of other laws which had stood the test of time and constitutional validity.The court had also said that it was not mandatory for ED to provide a copy of Enforcement Case Information Report, the equivalent of FIR in PMLA cases, to the accused, and it was enough if ED disclosed the grounds of arrest at the time of arrest.","The petitioners are seeking re-examination of the apex court’s July 27, 2022, order.

This is a rise of 7.3 lakh voters since the last revision of the electoral roll before the Lok Sabha polls in April.Significantly, the rise in women voters is higher than men during these four months. The number of women voters has risen by 3.9 lakh while the number of male voters has increased by 3.4 lakh between April and August, the data shows.Still, the total number of male voters outnumbers female voters in the state. The number of male voters is 4.9 crores compared to 4.5 crore women voters.The rise in women voters reflects the national trend and explains why the Mahayuti government is focusing on women ahead of the state assembly polls slated for October 2023.The government’s Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana will provide a stipend of Rs 1,500 per month to underprivileged women. The Mukhya Mantri Annapurna Yojana will provide three free cylinders annually to women from underprivileged homes. The state is also funding the higher education of girls from the OBC and EWS section. All these schemes were announced in June, in the Mahayuti government’s last budget before the polls.The number of women voters outnumber male voters in four districts , the data shows. In the Konkan near Mumbai, the district of Ratnagiri has as many as 42,247 more women voters while adjoining Sindhudurg has 1,654 more women voters than male voters.The tribal district of Nandurbar in North Maharashtra has 2,754 more women voters than male voters. The tribal district of Gondia in Vidarbha has 10,880 more women voters.The district of Bhandara which adjoins Gondia in Vidarbha could soon join this tally. It has only 1,583 more male voters than female voters. In Vidarbha’s Gadchiroli too, there are only 6,937 male voters compared to women.“Given the lack of job opportunities in the Konkan, male members of the family have traditionally migrated to Mumbai for work and they tend to register their vote in the city. The wives remain behind and retain their vote in their native district,” said a senior official from the state’s chief electoral office.Large numbers of men from the tribal belt Bhandara-Gondia also tend to migrate to the border district of Chhatisgarh. The tribal belt of Nandurbar also sees work-related migration.Officials say that the rise in the registration of women voters is the result of special drives. In 2019, the gender ratio in the state electoral roll was 911 women per 1000 men. It has now risen to 923 after the state’s electoral office focused on increasing the registration of women voters.","M Maharashtra has almost 9.4 crore voters according to the latest draft electoral roll.

The loan along with interest was repaid without any development of the 4.3 hectare land parcel, the federal auditor said in a report tabled in the Parliament on Thursday.CAG’s compliance audit report mentioned that the railway ministry in March 2018 gave “in principle” for an MoU between Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) and IRCON and get lease premium upfront by transferring the development of land lease rights to the PSUs for generation of no-fare revenue for 2017-18.Subsequently, a tripartite MoU was signed by the railway ministry, IRCON and RLDA on March 26, 2018 for transfer of leasehold rights of the land parcel. IRCON agreed to provide the upfront lease premium of Rs 2,700 crore to Rs 3,200 crore in lieu of being provided the transfer of leasehold rights for the project site and rights to undertake commercial development of the property by appointing a developer. The repayment of principal and interest was to be borne by the ministry.As per the report, RLDA and IRCON signed the 99 years’ lease agreement on March 28, 2018. However, the agreement was repudiated through a supplementary agreement on the same day stating that in view of the ongoing mutual discussion and that since the parties were examining the issue, “the grant of lease site is presently not required to be undertaken”.IRCON went ahead and borrowed Rs 3,200 crore from Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) at 8.77% interest rate and paid Rs 2,580.6 crore to RLDA on March 31, 2018. As per the terms of the MoU, railways paid the entire principal amount of Rs 3,200 crore along with interest of Rs 835 crore.The CAG in its audit found that the IRCON borrowed from IRFC despite the lease agreement being terminated. “Thus the Ministry of Railways received a lease premium for a parcel of land which was not on lease. While this was credited as non-fare revenue in FY 2017-18, it created a huge liability for repayment and finally MoR paid interest of Rs 834.72 crore.”The CAG has recommended fixing responsibility for the huge loss.","Railway ministry has suffered Rs 835 crore loss on interest paid on a loan of Rs 3,200 crore taken by its PSU, IRCON, for development of a land parcel at Bandra East in Mumbai.

Its statement of objects and reasons stated that the colonial-era legislation has become outdated and inadequate for effective management of Waqf property in modern India.Introducing the Bill, Rijiju said ""It is my good fortune that being non-Muslim, I am getting opportunity to bring a Bill for welfare of Muslims."" The Bill was later referred to a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) for wider consultations.The Union minister accused the opposition of misleading the Muslims and claimed that there were many within the opposition ranks who support the Bill but are silent due to their party's stand on the issue.""They (Opposition) are misleading Muslims. Till last night, Muslim delegations came to me. Many MPs have told me that the mafia has taken over Waqf boards. Some MPs have said that they support the bill but can't say it due to their political parties. I will not take anyone's name so that their political career is not ruined,"" Rijiju said.The Union minister asserted that the government had held multi-layered country-wide consultations before introducing the Bill.""We have held multi-layered country-wide consultations on this bill. All the backward Muslims and the chairman of the Waqf Boards of 19 states and UTs started the discussion. A discussion was held with common Muslims in 2023. At that time a meeting was held in Mumbai and suggestions were made as to what should be done to improve the State Waqf Board. In the Lucknow meeting, discussions were held with the top-level people of the UP State Waqf Board, and the views of the common people were also heard. They all said that this amendment is needed,"" Rijiju said.The Union minister asserted that no provision of the proposed Bill interfered with the freedom of any religion, nor did it violate any article of the Constitution.However, the opposition was not convinced as it called it a draconian law and a fundamental attack on the Constitution.Congress MP K C Venugopal accused the government of violating the right to freedom of religion and claimed the legislation was being brought with an eye on the upcoming assembly polls. He said people had taught the BJP a lesson -- in Lok Sabha polls -- for its divisive politics but the saffron party is continuing with the same, keeping in mind the upcoming assembly elections in states such as Maharashtra. ""It is a direct attack on freedom of religion ... Next you will go for Christians, then Jains,"" he said.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said the Bill was being introduced to appease the BJP's hardcore supporters. ""What is the point of including non-Muslims in Waqf boards when this is not done in other religious bodies?"" Yadav asked.""The truth is that the BJP has brought this Bill to appease its hardcore supporters,"" the Kannauj MP said, adding that it was brought with an eye on the polls.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)-Sharadchandra Pawar MP Supriya Sule said her party opposed the Bill as it was against a particular minority community. ""Look at what is happening in Bangladesh, there is so much pain. It is the moral duty of a country to protect minorities,"" she said.""The government should clarify the intent and the timing of the Bill. We object, withdraw this Bill. Let's discuss it and then bring a Bill that is fair and just,"" she demanded.All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chairperson Asaduddin Owaisi claimed that the House did not have the competence to make the amendments. ""It is a grave attack on the basic structure of the Constitution as it violates the principle of judicial independence and separation of powers,"" he said. ""You are enemies of Muslims and this Bill is evidence of that,"" Owaisi said.However, Rijiju strongly refuted all opposition objections and justified the proposed amendments.The Union minister said in the earlier law, there was no provision to challenge or review the order or judgement of the tribunal. Now, provision was being made for verdicts to be challenged at higher courts, the minister said.""In our country, no law can be a super law and that can't be above the Constitution. However, in the 1995 Wakf Act, there are provisions that are above the provisions in the Constitution. Shouldn't that be changed?"" he asked.""The wrongs which you have done, now, we are correcting those,"" Rijiju said, hitting out at the Congress.To justify the need for reforms in old law, the Union minister cited cases when an entire village in Tamil Nadu was declared Waqf land . Similarly, the Surat municipal corporation headquarters was declared Waqf property, he said and asked how is this possible.(With inputs from agencies)","The government justified the proposed amendments and said it aimed to empower the marginalised groups within the Muslim community.

Views on the matter have elicited a variety of reactions, from zeal to doubt. But one person who is unquestionably in support of this possible partnership is professional wrestler Lex Luger . In an interview with ""Busted Open Radio,"" the former WCW World Heavyweight Champion said unequivocally his opinion that AEW ought to take advantage of the chance to enlist McMahon.Luger emphatically stated.The company is still concentrating on its next big event, ""All In,"" which will take place at London's Wembley Stadium, despite the ongoing rumors about McMahon's connection with AEW. As the event gets closer, important matches like Will Ospreay vs. Lance Archer and Darby Allin vs. ""Hangman"" Adam Page will be featured on tonight's episode of ""AEW Dynamite"" to create hype.There were rumours earlier this summer suggesting Shane McMahon will appear on AEW. When AEW CEO Tony Khan stated that McMahon would be ""welcome"" in the promotion, these rumours began to pick up steam.

Even after the meeting, talks are still preliminary, and insiders at AEW have not been given access to the specifics.A picture of Khan and McMahon taken during their meeting was also provided by WrestleTalk, showing the two's different facial expressions: McMahon appeared serious, while Khan seemed amused.

Around 10.30 am today (local time), a park visitor reported seeing a body in Avalanche Creek below the gorge. Rangers immediately began recovery efforts. Flathead County coroner is working to confirm identity through DNA or dental records.""The search for Patil's body was challenging due to submerged obstacles such as fallen trees and rocks, which limited the rangers' ability to investigate the gorge for weeks because of water depth and whitewater conditions during spring and summer runoff. As the water level dropped, rangers used long poles to search large portions of the gorge but were unable to reach the deepest and most dangerous areas.According to Glacier National Park officials, Patil was hiking with friends above a gorge on the Avalanche Lake Trail on July 6 when he diverted from the trail. While standing on a large rock, he fell into Avalanche Creek. It remains unclear whether he slipped on a wet portion of the rock or lost his balance. Friends and witnesses saw him fall into the creek, go underwater, resurface briefly, and then be swept away by the current into the gorge.""An alert helicopter conducted aerial searches of the creek, and rangers scoured the area on July 6, recovering personal items that had washed downstream. During the past four weeks, ground search efforts have continued from the gorge to the bridge on the Trail of the Cedars,"" added the statement from park officials.Rangers used a drone multiple times to search the gorge.

As we are grappling with this grief, we also like to thank the rangers for carrying out this search. A special mention to Prem Bhandari who has been in constant touch with us for the last 27 days and supporting us. We have authorized Bhandari to arrange for Siddhant's remains to be sent to Pune and complete the formalities,"" Chaudhari told ANI.Prem Bhandari, a prominent Indian diaspora leader assisting in repatriating the mortal remains to India, stated that park officials offered their condolences to the family and hoped that recovering the body would help bring closure to loved ones.

The entire country has expected Gold...Rules are there but if a wrestler is 50-100 grammes overweight, they are usually allowed to play.

Hyd sees 115% increase in exceedance days

Call for more monitoring stns

HYDERABAD: The city's air quality is again in news for the wrong reason. A recent report by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has revealed that the city is grappling with high levels of ground-level ozone , a pollutant often overlooked in air quality discussions.Of 14 monitoring stations across the city, a staggering 10 recorded ozone levels above the WHO's recommended limit of 100 g/m³ between Jan 1 and July 18 this year.Surprisingly, the highest eight-hour average wasn't found in Hyderabad's industrial zones, but in the residential area of Sanathnagar, where levels spiked to 150.9 g/m³. This was closely followed by ICRISAT Patancheru with 145.9 g/m³ and ECIL Kapra with 140.8 g/m³.These figures were part of a study titled 'Air Quality Tracker: Ground-level Ozone' by CSE researchers Anumita Roychowdhury, Avikal Somvanshi and Sharanjeet Kaur, which analysed ozone levels in 10 major metropolitan regions in India.Delhi-NCR tops the list with 176 days of ozone exceedance, followed by Mumbai-MMR and Pune with 138 days. Jaipur, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Lucknow and Ahmedabad also struggle with 96 exceedance days, but Hyderabad stands out with a 115% increase in exceedance days compared to last year. Ground-level ozone isn't emitted from a single source. It is formed by a complex interaction between nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds emitted by vehicles, power plants and factories. These compounds undergo cyclic reactions in presence of sunlight, producing ozone that remains in the air we breathe.Environmentalists stressed the need for a broader focus on ozone pollution, noting it accounts for 20-30% of Hyderabad's total pollution, followed by PM 2.5 and PM 10. ""With more stations, we might find even higher ozone levels in Hyderabad. Delhi has nearly 58 stations, which is why their numbers are so comprehensive,"" said Narsimha Reddy Donthi, an environmentalist.Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager at CSE's Urban Lab, pointed to an unusual trend - ozone levels in Hyderabad remain elevated well into the night. Ozone should ideally decline after sunset. The city recorded 94 nights with excessive ozone levels, signalling a year-round challenge exacerbated by climate change .","Hyd sees 115% increase in exceedance days compared to last year.

How security forces plan to guard Red Fort with AI-based security system this Independence Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-security-forces-plan-to-guard-red-fort-with-ai-based-security-system-this-independence-day/articleshow/112385003.cms,"Delhi is home to many famous landmarks that showcase its rich history and cultural heritage. One of the most iconic is the Red Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built by Shah Jahan that symbolizes the power of the Mughal Empire. Another notable landmark is India Gate, which was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and serves as a tribute to Indian soldiers who fought in World War I. The Akshardham Temple is a stunning example of Hindu architecture, featuring intricate carvings in white marble and pink sandstone. Jama Masjid, constructed in the 1650s, holds the title of India's largest mosque and is an architectural masterpiece. Chandni Chowk, a market that dates back to the 17th century, remains a vibrant and bustling center of commerce. For those interested in science and astronomy, Jantar Mantar is a must-see. This 18th-century observatory is home to a collection of unique astronomical instruments. Finally, the Qutub Minar, which has stood tall since 1192, is the tallest brick minaret in the world and a testament to the city's enduring history. Together, these landmarks offer a glimpse into the diverse and fascinating culture of Delhi.

The Red Fort will be equipped with cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) security systems for the upcoming Independence Day celebrations on August 15.Central intelligence agencies and security forces recently conducted a comprehensive review meeting at the Red Fort to assess and refine security preparations for the Independence Day celebrations.The advanced AI-powered security measures will incorporate a range of sophisticated features, including video analytics, automated crowd estimation, and facial recognition technology . Security agencies plan to install over 700 CCTVs and 150 cameras with video analytics capabilities in and around the historic fort complex.The new system boasts an impressive array of functionalities designed to bolster security efforts. These include vehicle number plate recognition , face detection and matching against watchlists, real-time people movement counting, intrusion detection, audio monitoring, and the ability to identify abandoned objects in public spaces.An official involved in the planning stated that AI-enabled cameras will be strategically placed at entry and exit points to provide accurate, real-time estimations of crowd sizes within the venue.One of the key components of the upgraded security apparatus is an advanced facial recognition system. This technology can identify individuals from both live camera feeds and recorded video footage, efficiently matching faces against existing watchlist databases. The system's capabilities extend to detecting multiple faces in group images and searching for similar faces across a network of cameras, significantly enhancing the ability to track and identify persons of interest.In addition to facial recognition, a new number plate recognition system will be implemented. This technology will conduct continuous 24/7 video processing to detect and record vehicle plates in real-time, adding another layer of security and monitoring to the overall setup.While the AI-based systems represent a major technological leap in security measures, human personnel will continue to play a crucial role in maintaining safety during the high-profile event. Over 10,000 security personnel from Delhi Police and paramilitary forces are slated for deployment around the Red Fort and other key locations in central and north Delhi .",The Red Fort will be equipped with cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) security systems for the upcoming Independence Day celebrations on August 15.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"

China looks to its shipyards to beat US in any future war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/china-looks-to-its-shipyards-to-beat-us-in-any-future-war/articleshow/112389335.cms,"US strategist worried

Industrial repair battle

LONDON: In a newly built drydock on China's Changxing Island Shipbuilding Base outside Shanghai, the world's largest amphibious assault ship has sprung from nothing to an imposing hull that experts say might launch as soon as 2025.If that assessment derived from satellite photos proves correct, the construction of China’s first 076 Class assault ship – dubbed the “Yunan” class – will be yet another reminder of the breakneck speed of Beijing’s military buildup.It is bringing one of the world’s largest warships into existence in less time than it currently takes US or European shipyards to refit a much smaller ageing frigate or destroyer.It will also likely stoke the fears of those who believe Beijing is now preparing in earnest for a major conflict, most likely one sparked by a deliberate invasion of Taiwan .According to US officials, Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered his military to be ready to conduct that operation by 2027 – a suggestion Beijing denies – but has not yet made a firm decision to launch military action.Constructed in 2005, the Changxing Island Shipbuilding Base - owned by the government-run China State Shipbuilding Corporation – has been a hugely ambitious effort and is now in a third stage of expansion that has also seen it build China's third aircraft carrier – the “Fujian” – between 2015 and 2022.That ship began its sea trials in May – but the speed with which the shipyard is now turning around landing vessels represents a dramatic uptick in warship construction.Commercial satellite photos indicate that the drydock in which the new 076 Class is being built only opened in October as part of what appeared to be a dramatic new expansion of the port facilities.They turn out both military and civilian vessels at a speed that now worries Beijing’s potential adversaries and rivals, particularly the United States – and could give it a ready edge in any conflict.The latest imagery - provided by private satellite firm Maxar for the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies - suggest that it is roughly 263 meters long and 43 meters wide (867 by 142 feet) - slightly smaller than an aircraft carrier such as the USS Nimitz or Ford class, or China’s new Fujian – but notably bigger than the new USS America class equivalent assault ships.Like the “America” class, the new 076 looks to be capable of carrying troops and landing craft as well as drones and combat jets. It would be able to flood the inside of its hull to launch an amphibious assault while potentially also conducting air operations with catapults and helicopters.Since 2019, China has launched four such vessels of the slightly smaller 075 class, with two declared ready for combat over the last year and another four said to be on order.That output rate is beginning to alarm US counterparts. In raw tonnage when it comes to warships, the US Navy remains considerably larger than its Chinese counterpart. In total, the US retains almost three million metric tons of warships of 1,000 tons or more, compared to barely a third of that for China.That includes 10 nuclear aircraft carriers and their battle groups – all bigger and more powerful than China’s three carriers so far. Only Beijing’s fourth carrier, still under construction, is expected to be nuclear-powered, giving it much greater endurance.The US also retains a much larger force of atomic-powered submarines, both ballistic missile-carrying variants capable of remaining unseen for months and smaller torpedo and cruise missile-carrying attack subs.Still, when it comes to the sheer number of warships, China has now overtaken the US as the largest navy in the world, with 234 vessels over 1,000 tons compared to the Americans' 219, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. China also now has more combat logistics and support vessels than the US military: 167 versus 126.That is starting to worry US strategists.While the US Navy is spread around the world, including two aircraft carriers now in the Middle East in the event of a conflict involving Israel and Iran, Beijing’s forces are largely focused on its immediate neighbourhood – and this would be even truer in a war.Any rotation there would likely involve not just warships, but elements of China’s coastguard and maritime militia - from fishing boats to giant ferries used as troop ships.What has those in Washington even more perturbed, however, is Beijing’s ability to build and repair vessels.One recent unclassified slide released by US naval intelligence estimated that China’s total shipbuilding capacity was now more than 632 times that of the USUS officials warn that Beijing can call on dozens of shipyards larger and more effective than the notoriously troubled Huntingdon Ingalls facility in Newport News, Virginia, the largest US military shipyard.When it comes to warships, Beijing is now outbuilding the US to a remarkable degree.Between 2003 and 2023, China more than doubled its guided missile destroyer fleet to 42. Over the last 10 years, it has launched 23 new destroyers compared to only 11 built by the US Since 2017, China has built eight guided missile cruisers while the US completed none.That naval production capacity is backed up by an even larger civilian shipbuilding sector.In 1999, Chinese shipyards accounted for only five percent of merchant shipping tonnage globally each year. Now, that proportion stands at over 50 percent, with Chinese yards attracting almost 60 percent of new merchant ship orders last year.That contrasts with the United States, which produces just 15-25 new merchant vessels every year, less than five percent of the global total.China has also bitten into the dominance of Japanese and Korean shipyards, which once held over half the global market between them but, last year, only around 40 percent, according to trade data produced by the United Nations .US commanders believe they still have a technical edge over China’s navy in a range of areas.One recent set of war games run by the Center for Strategic and International Studies predicated on a Chinese invasion of Taiwan showed Beijing losing 52 major surface warships compared to between seven and 10 US equivalents.Those war games, though, showed China much more able to take those losses than the US, both because of its significantly larger fleet and much greater abilities to carry out repairs.Aside from limited facilities in Japan, which might well be vulnerable to Chinese attack, the US would need to get any seriously damaged warships back to either Hawaii or San Diego - longer journeys across the Pacific Ocean - for repair.From next year, the US will begin trialing repairs of warships in allied Asian dockyards - most likely South Korea and Japan, although India’s shipbuilding facilities have also been touted as a potentially invaluable resource in any big conflict.US commanders have also been paying particularly close attention to Ukraine’s war with Russian invaders, particularly its use of missiles and unmanned drones to sink much of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet while forcing much of the remainder to withdraw firmly from the war zone.The Pentagon’s Project Replicator – announced last year – aims to mass-produce the latest unmanned systems in any major war with China. This would effectively build a parallel production pipeline capable of operating much faster than existing defence manufacturing facilities.Such technology might redress the balance in the US favour – but Beijing is also investing in such systems, and would be fighting in its own backyard.As retired US Navy Captain Sam Tangredi wrote in a US naval journal in January 2023, ""The side with the most ships almost always wins.""The US is headed into uncharted territory in Southeast Asia, and Beijing is betting that overwhelming force of numbers might help it win any conflict - or even allow it to achieve its goals without firing a shot.","Newly built 076 Class assault ship could launch as soon as 2025.

The blaze, which began on July 24, has rapidly grown to become California’s largest wildfire this year.Thousands of firefighters from across the country, including Utah and Texas, are battling the fire, which is now 34% contained.The fire is spreading northeast through Lassen National Forest, fueled by critically dry conditions and steep terrain, making containment efforts challenging.Eric Kurth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sacramento, noted that while hot, dry weather has hampered firefighting efforts, a shift to cooler temperatures and higher humidity is expected, which could aid in slowing the fire’s progress. “It’s not a dramatic change. It’s slow. But each day is getting a little better,” Kurth was quoted saying by NYT.The Park Fire ignited near Chico, a town in Butte County, north of Sacramento. The blaze quickly expanded, ballooning to over 1,20,000 acres within a day and nearly doubling in size shortly after. Authorities have determined the fire was caused by arson, under unusual circumstances: a man pushed a burning car into a gully, igniting the surrounding area.The suspect, Ronnie Stout, 42, of Chico, was arrested on July 25 and charged with felony arson and arson with aggravating factors. Stout, who has prior felony convictions for child molestation and robbery with great bodily injury, faces a potential sentence of 25 years to life if convicted.Butte County, home to 2,10,000 residents, has a tragic history with wildfires. The 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest in California’s history, decimated the town of Paradise, killing 85 people. In 2021, the Dixie Fire burned nearly 1 million acres in the Feather River Canyon.Despite the region’s history of fires, the area where the Park Fire is burning had not experienced a blaze in many years, leading to dense vegetation that is fueling the fire. Record heat and two rainy winters have also contributed to an abundance of dry vegetation across California.The fire’s rapid spread and the difficult terrain have complicated firefighting efforts. Jahaira Zaragoza, a spokesperson for Cal Fire, highlighted the challenges, including lava rock formations and steep, remote areas that are hazardous for firefighters to access.The Park Fire is now the fourth-largest wildfire in California history, covering an area approximately 14 times the size of San Francisco. It is on track to surpass the Mendocino Complex Fire, which burned over 4,59,000 acres in 2018, as the third-largest in the state.However, the Park Fire still falls short of the August Complex Fire, the largest wildfire in California’s history, which burned over 1 million acres in 2020.Wildfires are a natural part of the ecosystem in the western United States, but climate change is exacerbating their frequency and intensity. Experts warn that the heat and dryness linked to climate change are creating conditions for larger, more destructive wildfires, and that wildfire seasons are becoming longer.California’s history of wildfire suppression and the construction of homes near forests have also contributed to the state’s increasing wildfire activity. This year, wildfires have already consumed about 7,91,000 acres in the state, significantly more than the 1,12,000 acres burned at the same time last year.Experts caution that this season could be particularly dangerous, with conditions ripe for more large-scale wildfires in the coming months.","The Park Fire is the largest wildfire currently burning in the United States.

"Ready to join politics, I’m already at forefront: Hasina’s son",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/ready-to-join-politics-im-already-at-forefront-hasinas-son/articleshow/112389252.cms,"As attacks on Awami League leaders continued in Bangladesh , Sajeeb Wazed Joy , son of former PM Sheikh Hasina, said he is ready to enter politics . Joy had earlier said he had no intention of joining politics.Talking to TOI over phone from his residence in Washington , DC on Thursday, Joy said, “I will do whatever it takes to save the party and its workers.If there is a need for me to join politics, I will not refrain from that. My mother would have retired from politics after the current term. I never had any political ambition and was settled in the US. But the developments in Bangladesh in the past few days show that there is a leadership vacuum. I had to get active for the sake of the party and I am at the forefront now.”His statements came after Khaleda Zia was released from house arrest and her son Tarique Rahman, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s acting chairman, is returning to Dhaka.Speaking on the day that an interim govt led by Nobel Prize winner Md Yunus took charge of Bangladesh, Joy said, “I am sure the Awami League will take part in the election and we might even win. We have the largest supporter base in Bangladesh.” Claiming his mother has no plan of seeking asylum in any country, he said, “For the time being, she is in India. She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim govt decides to hold an election in the country. I am thankful to PM Narendra Modi for saving my mother’s life at such short notice.”On Thursday, Joy’s sister Saima Wazed also made it clear she will continue in her role as the WHO regional director. “Heartbroken with the loss of life in my country Bangladesh that I love. So heartbroken that I cannot see and hug my mother during this difficult time. I remain committed to my role as RD WHO,” she wrote on X. In a later post, she wrote, “To everyone who has shown concern: as much as I would love to see Ma, I don’t want to compromise her whereabouts in any way.”Joy stressed there was a need for “introspection”. “There definitely were mistakes. When you run a country, a lot of decisions are made every day. Awami League believes in introspection and we were ready for that. But we did not get a chance to do that this time. We never realized the situation would escalate so fast even after accepting their demands,” Joy said.He also said an alliance of BNP and Jammat will not be able to save the minorities. “If the Awami League is not in power, the eastern border of India will not be secure. If there is an alliance of BNP and Jamaat, that may not be good for India as Jamaat will not refrain from militancy,” Joy said, requesting India to mount pressure on Bangladesh to hold elections soon.","Sajeeb Wazed Joy, son of former PM Sheikh Hasina, said he is ready to enter politics.
