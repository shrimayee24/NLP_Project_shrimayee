Museum’s new initiative turns ancient artefacts into teaching tools,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/museums-new-initiative-turns-ancient-artefacts-into-teaching-tools/articleshow/112961058.cms,"When Anna Anguissola, an associate professor of classical archaeology at the University of Pisa, walked around the Key Gallery at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya ( CSMVS ) earlier this year, she thought she’d be talking about what she already knew inside out. Instead, she found herself rethinking her own work. How the same concepts she had studied for years—like the human form and deities as well as contexts and materials—suddenly took on new meaning when seen through the lens of other cultures.Back in Pisa, Anguissola has been shaking things up in her department inspired by what she learnt in Mumbai. “Starting this semester, I've introduced short modules of direct observation of artworks following the strategies we experimented with in Mumbai,” she said. These changes include group discussions, hands-on class activities and creative exercises like writing ‘museum captions’ that she believes is yielding “unexpected results.”This shift in perspective is precisely what CSMVS aimed for with their new international academic programme of turning museum galleries into interactive classrooms where objects become more than just artefacts behind glass.In February, CSMVS teamed up with the University of Cambridge’s Fitzwilliam Museum and Global Humanities Network for a first-of-its-kind partnership between museums and universities to establish new ways of teaching with museum objects.The initiative was part of the larger 10-month exhibition titled ‘Ancient Sculptures: India Egypt Assyria Greece Rome’, a first-of-its-kind global co-curation project in the country, that showcased our interconnected histories through art and sculpture from The British Museum in London, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, and The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles alongside Indian institutions like Delhi’s National Museum, Bihar Museum in Patna, and District Museum in Madhya Pradesh. Running since December, the exhibition will continue till October 1.Split into two phases—one for university faculty and another for students—the programme brought together experts in history, epigraphy, numismatics, linguistics, art, literature as well as curators from India, Egypt, Turkey, Greece, and Italy, representing the very cultures featured in the Ancient Sculptures exhibition. Flipping the script on the chalk-and-talk tradition, CSMVS mapped out lessons that allowed participants to get up close with the sculptures rather than simply reading from textbooks.The five-day program for university faculty involving 23 Indian universities, was built around daily themes, each shedding light on a different facet of ancient cultures. The goal — according to Neal Spencer, deputy Director of collections and research at the Fitzwilliam Museum and academic lead on the faculty program — was to use museum objects as teaching tools to unlock stories about ancient societies, their artists, and the people they depicted.“Looking closely at an object shows you that you can come back again and again to looking at it in a different way if you start with the object rather than start with your idea or your text,” he explained.Themes ranged from ‘Fashioning Forms’ which examined how ancient cultures gave physical form to gods, humans, and other entities, to ‘Visual & Narrative’ on how these static objects conveyed stories, beliefs and myths. Other themes challenged participants to examine the complex relationship between art, environment and society.“Learning to engage with sources and objects not just as distant artefacts but sensory experiences,” as an important part of pedagogy is something that Manjiri Kamat, a professor of history at the University of Mumbai, began to rethink and now plans to integrate into her teaching.After the faculty program, focus shifted to post-graduate students in June, with 16 students from six universities across India taking part in a similar structure, focusing on daily themes and gallery sessions, where they examined the similarities, differences, and subtle details that made each piece unique.“The academic program will continue to be international for a global perspective on how India interacted with the rest of the world and how cultures and ideas travelled. By involving source country experts, the learnings and conversations are more contemporary,” explained Vaidehi Savnal, curatorial lead for education and public programmes at CSMVS.“We’re working with colleges and universities in Mumbai to integrate this new approach into their curriculum,” says Savnal, adding how this new approach taps into India’s New Education Policy, that advocates practical learning and field visits. So far, 20 students from the University of Mumbai have already completed a month-long ‘on-the-job’ training at the museum with hands-on experience of visitor mapping and digital content creation.Looking ahead, Savnal says that the next phase of the Ancient World Project will involve at least three similar programmes each year. “We plan to expand beyond Mumbai to collaborate with more museums and universities,” she adds.",CSMVS teamed up with the University of Cambridge’s Fitzwilliam Museum and Global Humanities Network for a first-of-its-kind partnership between museums and universities to establish new ways of teaching with museum objects.

"North India likely to see heavy rainfall in September, cautions IMD",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/north-india-likely-to-see-heavy-rainfall-in-sept-cautions-imd/articleshow/112957620.cms,"NEW DELHI: Continuing its Aug trend, monsoon rainfall in most parts of the country in Sept is likely to be ' above normal ', with some states, including Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and parts of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, expecting extremely heavy rainfall that could lead to floods and landslides, India Meteorological Department said Saturday. India reported 16% more than 'normal' rainfall in Aug, the fifth highest in the month since 2001 and 29th highest since 1901.Good rains (287mm) in Aug, however, could not bring down the overall temperature during the month as it reported the highest average minimum temperature and fourth-highest average mean temperature since 1901.This can be attributed to variation in spatial distribution of rainfall - northwest India got 32% more than 'normal' rainfall in Aug (second highest in the month since 2001), whereas south peninsula received merely around 1% more than normal rains in the month.Though the country as a whole is likely to get 'above-normal' rainfall in Sept, in certain areas - north Bihar, northeast UP, most parts of northeast India, extreme northwest India and many parts of south peninsular India - it is likely to be 'below normal'. Overall, the four-month (June-Sept) monsoon season, as predicted in mid-April, will be logged as 'above-normal' rainfall activity.Good rains in Aug, mainly in 'monsoon core' zone (rainfed areas), already had its positive impact on kharif sowing. Total acreage of the season is well on course to cross 'normal' (average of past five years) sown area, indicating possibility of a higher foodgrain output in the crop year. Good rains in monsoon season also mean adequate soil moisture and enough water in reservoirs to feed rabi (winter-sown) crops.La Nina phenomenon has, however, not yet formed. It is now expected to be formed by Sept-end, but it won't have any effect on the current rainy season as the summer monsoon may, by that time, be in its withdrawal phase.La Nina during Sept-Nov generally weakens the northeast (winter) monsoon in southeast India.""It is, however, too early to predict its impact. We would be able to say anything on this by Sept-end. We'll also see how the La Nina will lead to cyclonic conditions,"" said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD.On the reasons for heavy rainfall in Aug, he said six low-pressure systems formed during the month (out of that one became a deep depression and another a cyclone) could be one of the major influencing factors. Aug generally sees an increase in trend for the 'break' (pause) days of monsoon, but such a phase was missing this time and the month could see one of the highest number of active days in the recent past. Earlier such high numbers of active days were observed in 2020 and 2022.Mohapatra said, ""Above-normal maximum (day) temperatures are likely over most parts of the country, except for some areas in northwest India, south peninsular India, and some pockets of east-central India, where normal to below-normal maximum temperatures are likely.""","Some states, including Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and parts of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab, expecting extremely heavy rainfall that could lead to floods and landslides. India reported 16% more than 'normal' rainfall in Aug, the fifth highest in the month since 2001 and 29th highest since 1901.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112957622,imgsize-37014,width-400,resizemode-4/112957622.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday vowed to press ahead with reforms , with a focus on high growth and stable policies , to realise the dreams of a developed country and asserted that the “resolve has got only stronger” in his third term.“I can only assure that the resolve is stronger and like our citizens, govt is full of hope and confidence,” he said, in yet another put-down to suggestions that lower numbers in the Lok Sabha would sap his ambition and energy for reforms.At the inaugural ET World Leaders Forum, Modi described the third decade of the 21st century as a “lift-up decade for India” and sought support from business leaders to take forward the country’s development story.“By 2047, we have vowed to make India a developed country. We want more and more Indian companies to emerge as global brands ,” he said.Delivering a speech with his trademark high energy, Modi said, “By 2047, we have vowed to make India a developed country.

Our promise is to focus on high growth, you promise high quality. Think big, we have to write many success stories together.”The PM took on the opposition over its taunts of a diminished NDA majority in Parliament, saying voters, especially women and youth, have voted for continuity in a year when several countries around the world that went to elections have voted for change.Describing India as the biggest land of opportunity, he told the audience comprising Indian and global CEOs that the country respects wealth creators, a statement meant to comfort businesses.PM identified four pillars for building the foundations of a developed country or Viksit Bharat. He highlighted the push towards skilling and education, focus on making India a global food basket, thrust on green energy, and the drive to turn India into a major tourist destination along with development of technology. “To have at least one Made-in-India food product on every dining table around the world this is our resolve.”India has been a major driver of global growth, he said, pointing out that its economy has expanded 90% during the last decade, compared with a 35% increase in the size of the global economy. “Today, India’s progress is making global headlines… India has often outperformed both predictions and its peers.”","“By 2047, we have vowed to make India a developed country.

AI-powered device helps treat man with clot in blood,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-powered-device-helps-treat-man-with-clot-in-blood/articleshow/112957367.cms,"NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old man suffering from acute pulmonary thromboembolism ( PE ) due to a blood clot in his leg was successfully treated with a new AI-powered device .Pulmonary thromboembolism, a form of pulmonary embolism (PE), occurs when a blood clot moves through the bloodstream and lodges in the lungs, potentially leading to irreversible harm. Doctors said that PE is among the most severe complications associated with blood clots.When a clot reaches the lungs, it can obstruct blood circulation and may result in significant damage or even death.Dr VS Bedi , chairman of vascular surgery at Sir Gangaram Hospital , treated the patient using a device designed to remove blood clots with remarkable accuracy.""The AI in the machine helps it target only the clots, avoiding sucking of normal blood and reducing the risks of severe blood loss causing hypotension and other complications associated with older methods,"" he explained.Conventional treatments for pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) have been associated with significant risks, often requiring procedures that carry dangers like bleeding and the need for repeated interventions.The patient arrived at the hospital complaining of chest pain, breathing difficulty, and swelling in the left leg, which had persisted for three days. After seeking treatment at other hospitals without relief, the patient turned to Sir Gangaram Hospital.Upon arrival, the patient was quickly taken for thrombosuction using the AI-powered device, which functions like a vacuum machine, sucking out all blood clots with minimal blood loss.This approach eliminates the need for inferior vena cava (IVC) filter insertion and thrombolytic agent infusion, both of which can have dangerous side effects, such as internal bleeding in the brain, intestines, and other bleeding disorders.","A 28-year-old man suffering from acute pulmonary thromboembolism ( PE ) due to a blood clot in his leg was successfully treated with a new AI-powered device.

"India clears Singapore Airlines’ FDI, paves way for Vistara merger into Air India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-clears-singapore-airlines-fdi-paves-way-for-vistara-merger-into-air-india/articleshow/112910958.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Indian Govt has approved foreign direct investment ( FDI ) by Singapore Airlines into Air India , paving the way for the merger of Vistara into AI by the end of this calendar year.In a statement, SIA — which owned 49% in Vistara and will own get 25.1% stake in the merged AI by investing Rs 2,059 crore in it, said on Friday: “SIA confirms the Indian Govt has approved its proposed FDI into the enlarged Air India Group, as part of the ongoing merger of Air India and Vistara.This approval, along with other governmental and regulatory approvals received to-date, marks a significant development towards the completion of the merger.”“SIA and its partner Tata Sons aim to finalise the merger by the end of 2024. Upon completion, SIA will hold a 25.1% stake in the enlarged Air India Group. SIA and Tata Sons are firmly committed to supporting the growth and success of the Air India Group, which post-merger will have a significant presence in all key Indian airline market segments (full service, low-cost, international, and domestic). This merger will reinforce SIA’s multi-hub strategy, and underscore its long-standing commitment to India through a direct stake in this large and rapidly growing aviation market,” the statement added.Only FDI approval was remaining for the merger as all other nods from agencies like the Competition Commission and DGCA are already in place. Tatas will have remaining 74.9% stake in AI.After Govt FDI nod, AI-Vistara will shortly communicate timelines of the merger to passengers. People who have booked tickets on Vistara flights post the date of merger will be informed that their flight will be on Air India along with the changed flight number of AI and its time.Sources say the date of merger is likely to be after Diwali (Nov 1) as the airline will avoid taking any chances during the peak festive travel season. “There will be a decent window between post Diwali and the onset of fog that usually happens after Dec 20 which leads to flight disruptions. Ideally the merger should happen in that space to sort out any merger teething issues like informing passengers booked on Vistara their changed AI flight details before fog adds further complexity to the equation,” said sources.Vistara has 70 aircraft which will continue to fly in the airline’s livery. The same will changed to AI’s new livery when the aircraft go in for heavy checks. “Taking out aircraft just for painting purpose and letting capacity take a hit makes no sense. Also Vistara aircraft have a better cabin product than that of AI’s old planes,” said sources.Vistara had earlier reached out to passengers informing them about the transfer of frequent flyer miles to AI’s loyalty programme. The movement of personnel has already started, with many Vistara employees now operating from AI’s new Gurgaon headquarters.Are there chances that passengers who have booked on a certain class of Vistara, say business or premium economy, on a flight that has to operate after the date of merger being shifted to economy on the AI flight they take as the latter’s business may be full or it may not have a premium economy? “There are little chances of such things happening,” said sources.AI management had last considered toyed with the idea of postponing Vistara’s merger. The reason: They wanted AI planes to be upgraded first and till then retain Vistara as the better product carrier. However given mounting concerns among Vistara employees about AI officials getting all key posts in the merged airline, that plan was shelved. So even as AI remains very much a work in slow progress, the merger is now going to happen before the end of this calendar year.","The Indian Govt has approved foreign direct investment ( FDI ) by Singapore Airlines into Air India.

This brings the total number of Indians rescued from Laos by the Indian authorities to 635 as they continue to warn against fraudulent job offers.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-112952092,imgsize-1221479,width-400,resizemode-4/112952092.jpg"

Despite ongoing pumping, the issue remains.

MUMBAI: Breach Candy residents have raised concerns over sea water seepage due to digging of an underground car parking facility for 850 vehicles at the Amarsons exit of the coastal road .Nigum Lakhani, who lives in the neighbourhood, said that he has been noticing constant seepage of sea water despite pumps deployed to throw back this water into the sea.""They have dug a deep trench on reclaimed land. Now there is constant sea water inflow from the ground level joints. There are pumps working 24x7 to pump out the sea water but this is on for more than a month. I had written to the authorities for clarification but there was no reply.""The underground parking facilities along the coastal road will be for 1,857 cars spread across four locations, Amarsons at Breach Candy, NSCI Worli, near Bindu Madhav Thackeray Chowk, and another opposite Dr Annie Besant Road in Worli.BMC officials said a sea wall was constructed with ""geotextile membranes"" that are porous. ""That will allow water to pass through. The car parking facility is still in the excavation stage,"" said a BMC official.Namrita Mehta, another local resident, said she would have preferred a Miyawaki forest instead. ""A car park is only going to add to more vehicles in the area.

Last Indian minister visit to Pakistan was in 2015

Foreign minister S Jaishankar said Friday the era of uninterrupted dialogue with Pakistan was over, emphasizing India’s policy of not engaging Pakistan till the time it takes sustained and irreversible action against terrorism. Interestingly, Jaishankar also said India is not passive on the Pakistan issue and will react accordingly to positive and negative developments in the relationship.The MEA officially confirmed Friday Pakistan had invited PM Narendra Modi for the SCO heads of government meeting in Islamabad in October.This is the first invite for Modi to visit Pakistan since Islamabad’s abortive bid to host the SAARC summit in 2016.With the PM restricting his participation to the SCO heads of state summit, it remains to be seen if there’ll be a high-level representation from India. Jaishankar had participated in the last meeting in Kyrgyzstan.""The era of uninterrupted dialogue with Pakistan is over. Actions have consequences. Insofar as J&K is concerned, 370 is done,"" said the minister, speaking at a book release. On whether India is content with the current level of relationship, the minister added, ``maybe yes, maybe no…we are not passive. And whether events take a positive or a negative direction, either way we will react"".While India is expected to attend the SCO meeting, the level of participation is not clear yet. ToI had first reported on August 25 that Pakistan had invited Modi.""India has received the invitation for attending the Heads of Government Summit of SCO hosted by Pakistan. As and when we have an update, we will share it with you,"" said the MEA spokesperson.The practice so far, as far as India is concerned, has been for Modi to participate in the heads of state summit and depute senior ministers, mostly external affairs, for the heads of government meeting.Jaishankar had represented India at the last heads of government meeting in Bishkek in 2023. Pakistan is hosting the event this time as it holds the rotating chairmanship of the council of the heads of government.The last time an Indian foreign minister visited Pakistan was in 2015. The visit, however, was followed by the Pathankot airbase attack that put paid to any hope of a revival of the dialogue process between the 2 countries.The recent terror attacks in Jammu may also restrain India from considering a high-level participation, even though it sees SCO as playing an important role for regional security. The SAARC summit process has also remained stalled for the past 8 years as Modi doesn’t want to visit Islamabad, which has to host the meeting, because of Pakistan’s support to cross-border terrorism.",Pakistan has invited PM Narendra Modi for the SCO heads of government meeting in October.

Vadhvan Port: PM Modi lays foundation stone for India’s largest deep-water port,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vadhvan-port-indias-largest-deep-water-port-pm-modi-foundation-stone-top-facts-highlights/articleshow/112913145.cms,"Here are the top facts about the port

Situated in close proximity to Dahanu town in Palghar district, Vadhvan Port is poised to become the largest deep-water port in the country. The port will offer direct access to international shipping routes, thereby reducing transit times and associated costs.

The primary objective of the port is to establish a world-class maritime gateway that will boost the country's trade and economic growth.

The port will cater to large container vessels, offer deeper drafts, and accommodate ultra-large cargo ships.

Vadhvan port will be equipped with deep berths, efficient cargo handling facilities, and modern port management systems.

Vadhvan Port is expected to enhance India's maritime connectivity and further strengthen its position as a global trade hub.

The Vadhvan Port, which is estimated to cost Rs 76,220 crore, will be the third major port in Maharashtra, alongside the existing Mumbai Port and the Jawaharlal Nehru Port.

The proposed location for the Vadhvan Port is in the Dahanu Taluka of Palghar district, and it will be developed as a joint venture between the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority and the Maharashtra Maritime Board. The port is expected to cover an area of 17,471 hectares, with 16,906 hectares falling within the port limits.

The Vadhvan Port is anticipated to alleviate some of the pressure on the Jawaharlal Nehru Port, which is currently the largest container handling port in India.

The strategic location of the proposed port is considered advantageous due to its proximity to Gujarat, Rajasthan, and central India, as well as its accessibility to most of India's cargo destination locations.

The construction of the Vadhvan Port will involve the reclamation of 1,448 hectares from the sea, and it has been planned at a location with a deep draft of 20 metres. None of the major ports in India currently has a comparable draft, which limits the berthing of mega shipping vessels and results in certain shipping lines bypassing India. In comparison, the Jawaharlal Nehru Port has a draft of 15.5 metres, which is the deepest among the existing major ports in the country.

The project is anticipated to generate significant employment opportunities, stimulate local businesses, and contribute to the overall economic development of the region.

The development of Vadhvan Port incorporates sustainable practices, focusing on minimizing environmental impact and adhering to stringent ecological standards.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday laid the foundation for construction of the Vadhvan Port project , estimated to cost around Rs 76,000 crore, in Maharashtra 's Palghar.Before departing for Maharashtra, PM Modi called the 'Vadhvan Port project' a ""very special project""""A very special project that will contribute to India’s development. It will also reaffirm Maharashtra’s pivotal role as a powerhouse of progress,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.","The Vadhvan Port, which is estimated to cost Rs 76,220 crore, will be the third major port in Maharashtra, alongside the existing Mumbai Port and the Jawaharlal Nehru Port.

Why has Brazil decided to block Elon Musk's X in the country: Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/why-has-brazil-decided-to-block-elon-musks-x-in-the-country/articleshow/112939781.cms,"What led to X's suspension in

Brazil

?

Alexandre de Moraes ordered the ""immediate and complete suspension"" of the social media platform until it complies with all court orders and pays the outstanding fines.

Justice Moraes had ordered that X accounts accused of spreading disinformation—many of which belong to supporters of former right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro—must be blocked while they are under investigation.

Justice de Moraes had previously warned Musk that X could be banned if the company did not comply with the directive to appoint a local representative.

The social media platform was operating without a local representative since early August.

In response to the Supreme Court's orders, Global Governance Affairs tweeted on X that Alexandre de Moraes threatened their legal representative in Brazil with arrest if the company did not comply with his censorship directives. They claimed this threat was made in a secret order, which they have shared to expose his actions.

Earlier on Thursday, the Supreme Court froze the local bank accounts of Musk's Starlink satellite internet company. The dispute over X has since brought the platform to the brink of being shut down in one of its key markets, ultimately resulting in its suspension on Friday.

X’s global government affairs page stated on the same day, that it anticipated Justice Moraes would order a ban, pointing to its non-compliance with a legal directive that it argued would censor the judge’s political opponents.

De Moraes also criticised Musk for showing a lack of respect for Brazilian sovereignty and the judiciary, accusing him of acting as if he is above the country's laws.

In response, Musk's platform had shut down all its offices in Brazil, citing ""censorship"" by the judge. Despite these closures, the platform's services remain accessible to users in the country.

Musk's feud with justice de Moraes

A Brazilian Supreme Court justice has ordered the suspension of tech-giant Elon Musk 's social media platform X on Friday.Justice Alexandre de Mores directed internet service providers and app stores to block access to X within five-days, saying, that the platform wil remain inaccessible until it complies with his directive. He also imposed daily fines of 50,000 reais ($8,900) on individuals using VPNs to circumvent the block.Justice de Moraes and Elon Musk have been publicly feuding for months after X failed to comply with court orders to block certain accounts accused of spreading "" fake news "" and hate speech.X claimed that Moraes threatened to arrest one of its legal representatives in Brazil if the company did not comply. Meanwhile, Musk has used X to voice his strong opinions against Justice de Moraes, labelling him ""an outright criminal of the worst kind, masquerading as a judge.""The dispute began in April when the judge ordered the suspension of dozens of X accounts for allegedly spreading disinformation.“Free speech is the bedrock of democracy, and an unelected pseudo-judge in Brazil is destroying it for political purposes,” Musk fired back with a scathing remark.",A Brazilian Supreme Court justice has ordered the suspension of tech-giant Elon Musk's social media platform X on Friday.

Jon Moxley channels ICONIC anti-hero in SHOCKING AEW transformation

Jon Moxley ’s surprise return to All Elite Wrestling (AEW) on the Aug. 28 episode of Dynamite sent shockwaves through the wrestling world. The former AEW World Champion’s in-ring promo, delivered with a chilling intensity, left fans buzzing with anticipation.While the exact direction of Moxley’s storyline remains unclear, a recent revelation from wrestling journalist Bryan Alvarez suggests that the inspiration for his character’s evolution may come from a cinematic source.Alvarez hinted on a recent episode of Wrestling Observer Live that Moxley’s new persona could be influenced by the 1991 Australian film Romper Stomper .“Romper Stomper. Australian cult classic, 1992,"" Alvarez explained. ""[Moxley] was playing Russell Crowe in this, in what he was doing.""The film, directed by Geoffrey Wright, follows a group of neo-Nazi skinheads who clash with Vietnamese immigrants in a racially charged neighborhood. While it’s uncertain whether Moxley will incorporate elements of neo-Nazism into his AEW character, his history of drawing inspiration from movies provides a potential roadmap for his future storylines.Moxley’s previous feud with CM Punk, which was heavily influenced by the plot of Rocky III, showcased his willingness to blend cinematic narratives into his wrestling persona. However, that storyline reportedly caused tension between Moxley and Punk, with the latter expressing his displeasure over the reference.As Moxley’s AEW journey unfolds, fans will be closely watching to see if his character’s evolution is indeed inspired by Romper Stomper and how he will incorporate those elements into his on-screen persona. The film’s themes of violence,prejudice, and social unrest could provide a rich source of material for Moxley to explore, potentially leading to a compelling and thought-provoking storyline.Moreover, the contrast between Moxley’s current character and the potential influence of Romper Stomper could create a fascinating dynamic. The film’s anti-hero protagonist, played by Russell Crowe, is a complex figure driven by anger and frustration. If Moxley were to adopt a similar persona, it could lead to a compelling exploration of his character’s inner turmoil and motivations.Ultimately, the extent to which Romper Stomper will influence Moxley’s AEW storyline remains to be seen. However,the possibility of such a cinematic influence adds an intriguing layer of depth to his return and raises the stakes for his future endeavors.","Jon Moxley’s surprise return to All Elite Wrestling (AEW) on the Aug. 28 episode of Dynamite sent shockwaves through the wrestling world.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job. Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public. Musk has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-96413764,imgsize-26192,width-400,resizemode-4/96413764.jpg"

* IT, Auto stocks shine

* Q3 results season starts

* Positive global cues

* China stocks rise

* Rupee gains

(With inputs from agencies)

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%. Gauges in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea led gains in the session, while Japan was closed for a holiday.""Wall Street climbed in anticipation of a less aggressive US Fed as wage growth slowed and service activity contracted, fuelling bets that inflation is moderating. Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led a rally in tech shares as comments by Guo Shuqing, party secretary of the People’s Bank of China, that a clampdown on the sector is coming to an end likely gave traders further conviction.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sees Chinese stocks extending their rally on policy pivots in areas including housing and internet regulation.The rupee gained 29 paise to close at 82.37 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, supported by a weaker greenback overseas and a firm trend in domestic equities.""In the last couple of days, the rupee has underperformed among its regional peers amid a headwind of wide current account deficit and foreign fund outflows. But now, looking at the recent high-frequency data and rebound in the risk assets, we could see the rupee start catching up with the other Asian currencies,"" Dilip Parmar, Research Analyst, HDFC Securities told PTI.","The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
