NEW DELHI: Election Commission's special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls just months before assembly polls has been challenged in Supreme Court with Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) telling the court that the decision has been taken arbitrarily with an impractical timeline and that it would disenfranchise lakhs of people, particularly from marginalised communities. This is against free and fair election, the organisation said.ADR, on whose pleas SC has in the past passed multiple orders to bring in electoral reforms, said in its petition that SIR's requirement for citizenship documentation disproportionately affects marginalised communities, including Muslims, SCs, STs and migrant workers, as Aadhaar and ration cards are not acceptable. Many people who didn't have the requisite documents might not be able to procure it within the short time period fixed by EC, it said.""The SIR order, if not set aside, can arbitrarily and without due process disenfranchise lakhs of voters from electing their representatives, thereby disrupting free and fair elections and democracy in the country,"" the petition said.

As per estimates, over three crore voters and more particularly from marginalised communities could be excluded from voting due to the stringent requirements as mentioned in the SIR order.

NEW DELHI: Two people, a 25-year-old civil services aspirant and a 30-year-old lab technician, were killed in the massive fire at Vishal Mega Mart in central Delhi's Karol Bagh on Friday. According to the fire service, the building lacked a valid fire certificate and a case of negligence has been registered by police.The deceased were identified as Kumar Dhirender Pratap Singh and Pawan Gautam. Singh, originally from Sonbhadra in Uttar Pradesh, was found dead inside the elevator, where he is believed to have suffocated after getting trapped, while Gautam, an ITI graduate from Aligarh who worked as a lab technician, was found on the second floor.According to Delhi Fire Service, the blaze was reported at 6.44pm on Friday. Minutes later, Singh's brother, Vikram, received a desperate message from his trapped sibling. ""At 6.51pm, my brother texted me about being stuck in the lift,"" Vikram revealed to TOI. ""He pleaded, ‘Kisi tarah se bachalo, main lift mein fasa hua hoon. Bohot suffocation ke kaaran saans lena mushkil ho raha hai' (Please save me however you can, I'm trapped in the lift.I feel suffocated and cannot breathe)'.""Vikram, who was in Sonbhadra, immediately contacted his brother's friend to rush to Karol Bagh. ""She went and requested authorities to check the lift around 7pm. They told her they had done it and hadn't detected anyone inside,"" he claimed. His body was eventually recovered at 2.30am on Saturday. ""He was unconscious when we saw him. He was shirtless and in his vest, maybe because he used his shirt to cover his face to avoid the smoke,"" said Vikram. ""I wish I had been there to go into the building and save him,"" he added.Before the tragedy, Singh had been studying in a library nearby for 4-5 hours, according to his friends. Vikram remembered his younger brother, ""He had a good nature. Our mother is a govt schoolteacher in UP and he often volunteered to teach the students whenever he visited our village.""The fire broke out in the multistorey building that housed Vishal Mega Mart, gutting its basement, ground, first, second and third floors. The structure had only two staircases and one lift, with no ventilation except the entrance. Preliminary investigations suggest the fire was caused by a short circuit on the second floor.Firefighting operations were severely hampered due to the lack of ventilation in the building. Fire officers had to use JCB machines to break open the front-facing parts of the upper floors to extinguish the flames, with 15 fire tenders and 90 firefighters engaged in the fierce struggle to control the massive blaze.TOI reached out to Vishal Mega Mart for a response, but the company had not replied at the time of filing this story.","Two people, a civil services aspirant and a lab technician, were killed in the massive fire at Vishal Mega Mart in central Delhi's Karol Bagh on Friday.

Cheema made his submissions before the court of special judge Vishal Gogne, which is hearing arguments on the point of cognisance of the chargesheet filed against Sonia Gandhi , Rahul and others in National Herald money laundering case.""In post-Independence period, it (AJL) was never a commercial institution. We (AICC) were trying to retrieve an institution which is part of the freedom movement heritage.

Cheema said ED's allegations were ""crude lies"".The senior advocate said ED made unwarranted inferences against Rahul by wrongly assuming that he was the person in-charge of AICC's affairs as its general secretary in 2010. According to the party constitution, AICC has several general secretaries at a point in time, and no one of them could be in-charge of its affairs, Cheema pointed out. The counsel further stated Sonia, then Congress president, was wrongly inferred as person in-charge of AICC when the loan was assigned to AJL.The arguments will continue against other accused, including Suman Dubey, Sam Pitroda, Sunil Bhandari, Young Indian and Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd, on Monday.","All India Congress Committee (AICC) was not trying to sell assets of Associated Journals Limited (AJL), the company which published National Herald newspaper.

It ranges in value from 0 to 100. A score of 0 means perfect equality. A score of 100 means one person has all the income, wealth or consumption and others have none, hence absolute inequality.

JABALPUR: In a setback to actor Saif Ali Khan and his family, who inherited Rs 15,000 crore properties owned by Bhopal's erstwhile rulers, Madhya Pradesh HC has set aside the trial court's verdict given over two decades ago, and ordered a retrial in the case.In its order passed on June 30, the single bench of HC of Justice Sanjay Dwivedi set aside the judgment and decree of the trial court which upheld Pataudis (Saif Ali Khan, his mother Sharmila Tagore and his two sisters Soha and Saba) to be the owners of the properties. It also directed the trial court to make all possible efforts to conclude and decide the matter within one year.Nawab Hamidullah was the last ruling Nawab of the princely state of Bhopal. He and his wife Maimoona Sultan had three daughters - Abida, Sajida and Rabia. Sajida married Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi and became the Nawab Begum of Bhopal. Their son, Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi, former Indian cricket team skipper married Sharmila Tagore. After Nawab Hamidullah's eldest daughter Abida migrated to Pakistan, Sajida became the owner of the properties. Later, her son Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi (Tiger Pataudi, who married Sharmila Tagore) became the successor of these properties estimated to be valued at nearly Rs 15,000 crore, which were inherited by Saif Ali and his siblings.The two appeals, one filed by Begum Suraiya Rashid and others, and another by Nawab Mehr Taj Sajida Sultan and others, all heirs of late Nawab Mohammad Hamidullah Khan, said the trial court had dismissed their suits against what they called as unfair partition of royal property. In their pleas, they stated that the Bhopal district court's judgment and decree dated Feb 14, 2000 dismissed their suits unfairly. Their lawyers pleaded that the partition of his (Nawab's) personal property should have been done between them and defendants Saif Ali, Sharmila and 16 other heirs as per the Muslim Personal Law. The appellants opposed the defendants (Pataudis) for citing the certificate issued by the Govt of India on Jan 10, 1962 in favour of Sajida Begum as the sole successor of all the private properties.Justice Dwivedi said, ""The matters are remanded back to the trial court for deciding it afresh."" ""And if so required, the trial court can allow the parties to lead further evidence in view of the subsequent development and changed legal position,"" the court ordered.","Madhya Pradesh HC has set aside the trial court's verdict given over two decades ago, and ordered a retrial in the case.

The Department of Defence said the research project would explore the use of towed array target motion analysis technology to improve the reliability, efficiency and interoperability of current surveillance capabilities.DSTG senior researcher Sanjeev Arulampalam explained that a towed array consists of a long linear array of hydrophones, towed behind a submarine or surface ship on a flexible cable. “We need to harness the best minds in innovation, science and technology to build new capabilities, to innovate at greater pace, and to strengthen our strategic partnerships.The hydrophones work together to listen to the undersea environment from various directions,” the Department of Defence cited Dr Arulampalam as saying.The project is the latest milestone in increasing maritime domain awareness cooperation between Australia and India. It is significant within the Quad framework— consisting of India, Australia, US and Japan — which seeks to counter China's growing maritime belligerence in the Indo-Pacific.The combination of target motion analysis with the towed array system is intended to manage noise corruption and explore performance improvements. The project would see novel algorithms being put to test, using the strengths and shared knowledge of the two countries. “It will involve the sharing of ideas, investigation trials, algorithm demonstrations and performance analysis,” Arulampalam said.The Department of Defence announcement comes after external affairs minister S.

Bengaluru “Water Bears”



Other experiments



He may have witnessed more than a hundred sunrises and sunsets from orbit, but for Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla , the first eight days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) have been a whirlwind of scientific discovery.While six of the seven Isro-led experiments are underway, tardigrades or “water bears” that travelled all the way from Bengaluru to the orbital lab some 400 km from Earth, have served their purpose in space.Shux, who kicked off his scientific experiments with Myogenesis — to investigate the biological pathways behind skeletal muscle degradation in microgravity inside the Life Sciences Glovebox, marked his first week in orbit by completing the study on tardigrades or “water bears”.“Shukla has successfully completed the microgravity experiment involving Tardigrades onboard the ISS,” Isro confirmed. The next step would be for the principal investigators to analyse the data obtained from experiments conducted by Shux.The study focused on tardigrades’ survival, revival, and reproductive behaviour in space. It will provide valuable insights into the underlying biological mechanisms leading to resilience of extremophile organisms in microgravity environments and has potential applications on Earth especially in the area of therapeutics,” Isro confirmed.The water bears at ISS were studied in the Voyager Tardigrades experiment designed by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).Biochemist Sandeep Eswarappa and team at IISc, who spent over five years studying tardigrades, resilient microscopic organisms that have survived five mass extinctions, discovered a Paramacrobiotus species with an astonishing defence: When exposed to lethal ultraviolet radiation, this species absorbs the harmful rays and emits harmless blue fluorescence instead.That was the first direct experimental evidence of photoprotective fluorescence in any organism. And, it is this ‘Bengaluru strain’ of the tardigrade that has flown to the ISS with Shux.Shux’s first eight days in orbit as part of the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission have been defined not just by spectacle, but also a series of intricate biological investigations that could transform both future space missions and life on Earth.The Myogenesis study, on the other hand, is progressing with planned interventions and recording of observations as per the experiment protocol. In parallel, other Indian experiments for studying selected strains of microalgae and cyanobacteria under space conditions are ongoing, contributing to research on regenerative life support systems and crew nutrition.“As part of the Electronic Displays human research study, Shux carried out daily software-based cognitive and interface assessments. The study aims to optimise crew interaction with digital systems in the unique environment of space,” Isro added.A day before the well-deserved “rest day” upon completing half his stay at the ISS, he had begun documenting the progress of the Cyanobacteria Growth Experiment, another Isro-led study analysing how photosynthetic bacteria behave in space. These tiny organisms could one day form the backbone of life support systems on long-duration missions, recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen and aiding water regeneration.Shux also helped deploy and manage samples for the Space Microalgae investigation — another study with enormous potential. Microalgae, already valued on Earth for their rapid growth and nutritional content, are being cultivated in orbit to observe how microgravity influences their metabolism, genetic activity, and biomass yield. These hardy organisms may serve as future spacefarers’ food, fuel, or even pharmaceutical source.",Astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla completed study on tardigrades or “water bears’ on the International Space Station (ISS) The study will provide valuable insights into the underlying biological mechanisms leading to resilience of extremophile organisms in microgravity.

Robert is also being probed for his links with Bhandari, who fled to London when multiple agencies started investigating him in 2016.The judgment came on the ED's application filed under the Act in 2019. The court said the ""fugitive"" tag is to an individual who has committed schedule offence or offences involving an amount of Rs 100 crore or more and who has absconded or refused to return to avoid criminal prosecution.This will allow ED to confiscate his properties anywhere in the world and bar Bhandari, who is wanted by Indian agencies in multiple cases, from filing or defending any civil proceedings in India.The judge dismissed Bhandari's counsel's argument that the UK high court's order disallowing ED's plea for his extradition makes him eligible to stay in London, and therefore, FEO won't apply to him. ""The said argument is without any substance as the extradition failure will not make any difference as the extradition of the accused was one of the means to bring the accused to India to face trial in the said offence under Section 51 of the Black Money Act,"" the judge said.The court stressed Bhandari wilfully refused to return to face criminal prosecution, and said, ""...this court is satisfied that the total value of the schedule offence is Rs 100 crore or more i.e. the schedule to the present FEO Act which is Section 51 of Black Money Act.""The court also rejected Bhandari's contention that declaring him a fugitive economic offender entails very serious consequences, effectively amounting to economic death penalty.

Two more traffickers arrested in Friday's raids

Rs 45 lakh per victim for illegal entry to US

NEW DELHI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Saturday denied media reports suggesting that its team conducted a raid in McLeodganj, Himachal Pradesh in connection with the security of Dalai Lama or any Khalistani terror financing case on Friday.In a sharp clarification, the NIA said the search conducted in McLeodganj on Friday was entirely related to an ongoing investigation into a human trafficking case dubbed the 'US Donkey Route' network, a method used to illegally send people to the United States via multiple countries.""The search had no connection either with HH Dalai Lama or with any case related to Khalistani terrorists, and reports to the contrary in a section of the media are completely false,"" the agency said in a statement.Earlier, the NIA confirmed that two accused traffickers were arrested during the searches conducted simultaneously in Himachal Pradesh and Delhi.The accused were identified as Sunny alias Sunny Donker, a resident of Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh and Shubham Sandhal alias Deep Hundi, originally from Ropar, Punjab, currently residing in Peeragarhi, Delhi.Both are reportedly close associates of Gagandeep Singh alias Goldy, a key accused who was earlier arrested in March this year.The local police were duly informed and accompanied the NIA team during the McLeodganj operation, the agency said.According to NIA's investigation, the accused charged victims up to Rs 45 lakh each, promising legal entry into the US.

"Dalai Lama issue: India can’t be compliant to China or seen as insensitive to Tibetans, says Robert Barnett",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dalai-lama-issue-india-cant-be-compliant-to-china-or-seen-as-insensitive-to-tibetans-robert-barnett/articleshow/122270325.cms,".

As someone who has studied Tibet closely, were you surprised by the Dalai Lama’s recent announcement regarding his succession, especially given his earlier remarks suggesting he might be the last incumbent?

Tell us about the history of this contentious golden urn method of picking a successor.

How do you anticipate Beijing will respond to this announcement? If China proceeds to name its own successor, are we looking at the possibility of two Dalai Lamas?

The Dalai Lama has suggested that his reincarnation could be found outside China. If that successor emerges from the Tibetan diaspora in India, what kind of diplomatic and political challenges might this pose for New Delhi?

How do you interpret China’s recent efforts in Tibet — including large-scale infrastructure projects, population resettlements, and the campaign to re-educate Tibetan children?

STRAP: Just days before his 90th birthday on July 6, the Dalai Lama — the revered spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism — declared that he would have a successor. The announcement is more than a theological decision since China has long sought control over the succession process. Neelam Raaj spoke to Robert Barnett, a leading Tibet scholar at SOAS, London, for insights into this high-stakes contest between faith and power.For many years, the Dalai Lama has been reminding the public that he can choose from innumerable options and alternatives in terms of his succession. Sometimes he expressed this in a light-hearted way, such as saying he might come back as a butterfly, while at other times he referred to not returning at all, or he listed little-known theological alternatives, such as transmitting his consciousness to another adult through a process called “trulwa” or emanation. But all of these alternatives were reminders that in Tibetan Buddhism it is the individual lama, and the karma of that individual lama, which decides how or whether a lama returns. Of course, these have all been messages to China and its rulers that their claim to have the sole right to control reincarnations makes little sense in the religious context. The Dalai Lama had also always said that the decision about whether he returns would depend on the wishes of his followers, and his officials spent the last year or more getting written opinions from the wider Buddhist community about that request.This process was partly ceremonial – it reflects a very traditional understanding that a lama reincarnates only if his or her followers request for him or her to do so. So, no one doubted that the community would ask the Dalai Lama to return, and his decision to reincarnate is not a surprise. But here again the Dalai Lama seems to be sending a message to China, namely that, unlike Beijing, his decisions and his legitimacy are not based on the use of force or the resort to traditional authority, but on processes of consent and consultation.Contemporary Chinese officials say that in 1792-3 an order was given by the then emperor of China requiring Tibetans to use a golden vase or urn as the final stage in deciding between three children identified as candidate reincarnations of a high lama. After reciting appropriate prayers, the winning name would be drawn from the urn. This claim is correct, and , , the golden urn system was used scores of times in Tibet and Mongolia and other areas to select reincarnations up until the early 1900s. The current Chinese government claims that it is thus merely invoking a long-running legal precedent that requires Tibetans today to only use the same system and at the same time to recognise that only the Chinese government can authorize and select reincarnations. However, there are major weaknesses in this claim. Firstly, there had been scarcely any mention or use of the golden urn system for nearly 100 years before Beijing abruptly reintroduced it in 1995. Secondly, the emperors in the past who were involved with reincarnations and the golden urn were not Chinese and their governments were not Chinese – they were Manchus and were Buddhist believers, and were regarded by Tibetans at the time in many cases as emanations of the Buddha. Thirdly, it is not clear that use of the urn had meant in the past that the government in Beijing was seen by Tibetans as a sign of imperial sovereignty; according to the pioneering work of the historian Max Oidtmann, the process seems to have been more one of cooperation between Tibetans and the Manchus rather than one imposed on the former by the latter. And fourthly, the Manchu involvement in reincarnations seems to have been often understood by Tibetans as a kind of available option at times of dispute, rather than a law they were required to follow. And in general, religions and their believers tend to give priority to traditions and beliefs, rather than state laws. So, Beijing’s invocation of 18th-century Manchu-Tibetan religious relations as proof of Chinese sovereignty today describes a world that seems vastly different from the contemporary situation.It seems very likely, now that the Dalai Lama has announced that there will be a 15th Dalai Lama, that China will feel required to assert its sovereignty in these matters by naming its own Dalai Lama. So we are looking at a future, after the lifetime of the present Dalai Lama, where there will be two competing Dalai Lamas. But this will not be like a medieval competition between two rival popes, because only one of these Dalai Lamas will have been selected according to religious traditions and with the imprimatur of the previous Dalai Lama – the one who will be selected by the exiles. The Chinese candidate will have been selected by the Chinese state, whose rulers are by definition atheists if not, at times, outright enemies of religion. So, the Chinese candidate is at risk of having limited credibility among the Buddhist community and worldwide. Yet we might want to keep in mind that everything we are reading about is at some level a process of signalling to China. So the Dalai Lama’s announcement is also an indirect reminder that if China wished to, it could still offer him a settlement. That settlement is actually easy to imagine, in theory: the Chinese could simply return to the position they took on reincarnation in the 1980s and the early 1990s, when they claimed only the right to confirm the choices made by the relevant lamas and did not claim any role in the reincarnation process or selection itself. But few people currently expect today’s Chinese leaders to make concessions.The succession of the Dalai Lama has become a controversy because of Beijing’s claim in 1995 to have sole authority over that process. Why did it make that claim, which is clearly one that would lead to conflict and dispute? One theory is that Chinese foreign policy strategists see an advantage in using this issue to advance China’s aims abroad. According to this theory, the succession issue provides a new opportunity for China’s diplomats to seek compliance from other governments – it provides an entry-point for China to call on those governments to support its claims and to denounce any claims or actions by the Tibetan exiles. If so, it’s a clever move, because most governments have few exiles and few Buddhists in their population. Such governments might feel it less costly to comply with China’s request than to refuse on what for them will seem a minor or obscure issue. But this is not, of course, the case for India, for whom such a request would have major implications in terms of soft power, international diplomacy, religious respect and even border negotiations. Whatever happens, India will be the chief focus among all nations of China’s strategic interests in this matter, and will likely come under significant Chinese pressure. India’s policy makers and diplomats will certainly be deploying all their skills and resources in order to find a way to respond to those pressures without seeming compliant to China or insensitive to Tibetan or religious priorities.It used to be rather difficult for outside analysts to characterise Chinese policies in Tibet – they varied, being sometimes extremely harsh and in other ways and at certain times less so. But since 2014 a new policy has emerged under Xi Jinping which is clear: minorities, including the Tibetans and others, are to be gradually “integrated” (jiaorong in Chinese) into the larger Chinese “community” or nation (Zhonghua minzu). It has also become clear that Xi Jinping has ordered this process to begin from early childhood, because since 2021 his government has required all kindergartens – and kindergarten attendance is more or less compulsory these days for children aged 3-5 or so – to teach primarily or solely in the Chinese language. These schools and preschools increasingly teach children about Chinese or Communist history and values, rather than Tibetan ones. So there are serious concerns about the extent to which the next generation of Tibetans, Uyghur, Mongols and others within China will have substantive knowledge of their mother-tongue or their culture. At the same time, China has been moving many thousands of rural and nomadic Tibetans to settlements in or near towns, or to remote border regions, sometimes for very unclear reasons, and this too is likely to have a dramatic impact on cultural traditions and identity. There will be practical benefits for some of these relocated people, in terms of work, medical access and knowledge of Chinese, but there is much uncertainty about the overall effect of what is an ongoing process of massive social and cultural engineering.","The Dalai Lama has suggested that his reincarnation could be found outside China. If that successor emerges from the Tibetan diaspora in India, what kind of diplomatic and political challenges might this pose for New Delhi?

‘It’s Up To Them’ Owaisi Ready To Join Mahagathbandhan In Bihar Elections, Says NDA Must Go

EC uploads 2003 rolls, says most voters need not worry

Opposition says revision targets the poor, migrants

EC Trying To Push NRC 'Through Backdoor'- TMC Blasts Poll Body, Alleges 'Nazi' Action | Bihar Polls

Massive on-ground push by all parties

NEW DELHI: A fresh controversy has erupted in poll-bound Bihar over the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of the state's electoral rolls, a process the Election Commission of India (ECI) insists is legally mandated, even as opposition parties allege it could end up deleting ""tens of lakhs"" of genuine voters, especially the poor, migrants, and those on the margins.While the EC said that the revision, happening after 22 years, is in line with the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, opposition parties claim the timing is suspiciously close to the assembly polls and could ""skew the voter base"".""There is nothing more transparent in a democracy than the law. “Despite apprehensions of some persons, SIR will ensure that all eligible persons are included,” Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar told TOI.As part of the roll-revise process, voters may be asked to submit documents to support their claims, not just for themselves, but also for their parents if their names are mentioned. Each document must be self-attested and submitted separately for the individual, father, and mother.However, there's one major relief: If a person's name appears in the Bihar electoral roll dated January 1, 2003, that alone will be treated as sufficient proof, no additional documents will be needed in that case.Highlighting the exclusion of Aadhaar from this voter revision process, Congress's in charge of Bihar Krishna Allavaru accused the EC of ""acting under government pressure"".""Whenever the government faces a crisis, its agencies begin such actions,"" he said.""It is strange that the very voters who elected this government are now being asked to prove their identity. By excluding Aadhaar from this voter revision process, eight crore people are being asked to submit documents they don't have,"" the Congress leader added.Trying to calm nerves, the EC clarified this week that 4.96 crore out of Bihar's 7.89 crore registered voters won't need to submit parental documents during the revision. This includes those already listed in the 2003 electoral rolls or born to such electors.To make things smoother for booth level officers (BLOs) and voters alike, the EC has uploaded the 2003 Bihar rolls on its website for easy access.On Wednesday, leaders from 11 opposition parties, including Congress, RJD, TMC, DMK, SP, JMM, and Left parties, met the Election Commission, calling the revision ""disastrous"". They warned that the EC’s guidelines on verifying if someone is ""ordinarily resident"" in a constituency may disqualify large sections of migrants, who form a major chunk of Bihar’s electorate.The opposition argued that a revision this close to elections casts doubt on the EC’s intentions. But interestingly, despite their public opposition, these parties have joined the ground-level process, appointing thousands of booth level agents (BLAs) to keep watch.Contrary to their protests, opposition parties have gone all in. The RJD has deployed 47,143 BLAs, second only to BJP's 51,964. Congress has appointed 8,586, while Left outfits like CPI(ML), CPM, and CPI have sent in their own agents. On the NDA side, JDU, LJP, and RLSP have mobilised more than 30,000 BLAs in total.The election commission claimed it was determined to follow Article 326 of the Constitution, which mandates that only Indian citizens aged 18 or above and ordinarily resident in a constituency should be enrolled.“SIR is in line with Article 326. It’s a straight question (to the parties criticising SIR): Do you agree with Article 326 or not?"" a senior EC official said.","The Election Commission of India (ECI) is revising Bihar's electoral rolls. Opposition parties claim the timing is suspiciously close to the assembly polls and could ""skew the voter base"" If a person's name appears in the 2003 electoral roll dated January 1, 2003, that alone will be treated as sufficient proof.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122242903,imgsize-137068,width-400,resizemode-4/122242903.jpg"

Explained: How Jane Street made a staggering Rs 735 crore profit in Indian markets in just a day?

(AI image)

What did Jane Street do to make Rs 735 crore single-day profit?

On January 17, 2024, the Bank Nifty index commenced trading considerably lower at 46,573.95, down from its previous closing value of 48,125.10. ""Media reports claimed that this fall may be attributed to the market's apparent disappointment with the results announced by HDFC Bank after market close on January 16, 2024,"" SEBI noted.

The regulatory body identified a dual-phase approach that enabled Jane Street to accumulate a net profit of Rs 734.93 crore within several hours of trading.

During the initial trading period—""Patch I""—the organisation allegedly purchased Bank Nifty constituent stocks and futures valued at Rs 4,370 crore, which SEBI noted was considerable relative to typical market trading volumes. These acquisitions resulted in price increases, causing market participants to incorrectly interpret it as a market recovery.

""At a time when participants in index options markets are misled by the above support for Nifty Bank, JS Group builds effectively Rs 32,114.96 crores of bearish positions in the much more liquid Nifty Bank index options by buying cheap Put options and selling expensive Call options,"" the order said.

During the subsequent phase—""Patch II""—Jane Street disposed of almost all its long-term holdings. ""The sales are aggressive, in a manner that pushes down prices in the component stocks and hence the index. JS Group books losses in intraday cash/ futures market trading,"" the SEBI order alleged.

The profits generated from index options significantly outweighed the equity losses. When the Bank Nifty index declined from its morning peak, put options increased substantially in value whilst call options decreased. ""Profits in index options more than compensate for the JS Group's losses in intraday cash/futures trading,"" SEBI said.

Jane Street ‘Manipulation’ Pattern

Jane Street Group, the US trading powerhouse that was slapped with a trading ban in Indian markets on Friday, made a whopping Rs 735 crore single-day profit during a January 2024 trading session, according to a SEBI order published that day.The substantial earnings were part of Jane Street's total profits of Rs 36,502.12 crore across various market segments in India from January 2023 to March 2025. SEBI's detailed investigation specifically highlights January 17, 2024, when the organisation allegedly implemented a sophisticated ""Intra-day Index Manipulation"" scheme involving the Bank Nifty index and its components, resulting in significant gains from index options, according to an ET report.Jane Street employed identical ""Intra-day Index Manipulation"" tactics during 15 out of 18 days under SEBI's scrutiny. For the remaining three instances, they implemented an ""Extended Marking the Close"" approach, which continued for three additional days in May 2025, even after receiving SEBI's warning notice.Also Read | Jane Street ban: Why has SEBI barred US-based trading firm, which made multi-thousand crore profit, from India’s securities markets? Explained Following a National Stock Exchange advisory in February 2025, the ""JS Group persisted with similar trading activities, disregarding both the Exchange's cautionary communication and their own pledges,"" as stated by the regulatory authority.While the NSE concluded its investigation, SEBI took stringent measures. The regulator issued orders on Friday prohibiting Jane Street and four related entities from participating in Indian securities trading, whilst directing banks to restrict their account withdrawals. Additionally, SEBI initiated proceedings to seize Rs 4,840 crore in purported unlawful profits.The investigation highlights worrying aspects about India's derivatives market structure, where global entities utilising sophisticated algorithms and high-speed trading techniques compete against individual retail options investors. SEBI's investigation revealed Jane Street's dominant position, noting they ""consistently running what appeared to be by far the largest risks in 'cash equivalent' terms in F&O particularly on index option expiry days. ""The regulatory body emphasised the substantial magnitude of Jane Street's market activities in cash and futures segments. They observed that the firm understood that Nifty Bank would likely decline by day's end, considering their planned strategy to aggressively liquidate their morning acquisitions and beyond.SEBI pointed out that other market participants remained uninformed about these developments, leading them to engage in transactions whilst the Nifty Bank index was being artificially sustained at elevated levels temporarily.","Jane Street Group made a whopping Rs 735 crore single-day profit during a January 2024 trading session.

‘Tesla gave me a future’: Ex-employee on how the company transformed his life

Ex-Tesla employee quits due to Musk’s politics

An emotional exit after 7 years



Respect for the company, not the leadership

After seven years of working at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, former engineering technician Trae Cervantes has made the difficult decision to step away from the company, citing moral discomfort with CEO Elon Musk ’s recent actions. Cervantes, who began his career as a production associate in 2018, steadily advanced to an engineering technician role before formally resigning in March 2025. His departure was not spurred by workplace conditions or job dissatisfaction, but rather by a growing unease over Musk’s political involvement and public conduct.In an interview with Business Insider, Cervantes reflected on both the opportunities and challenges he experienced at Tesla. He joined the company during the high-demand ramp-up of the Model 3 production line and described his early days as physically taxing but professionally rewarding.“I started out on their production line for the Model 3 and I moved up from there,” Cervantes said. “When I started out, it was gruelling work. It was pushing heavy things up and down aisles. I was on my feet for 12 hours a day, but they also give you three to four days off a week to recover.”Tesla supported Cervantes' growth over the years, offering him access to professional development programs, including certifications in advanced manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma through local college partnerships.Cervantes credits Tesla with helping him build a career despite having no formal education or technical training before joining the company.“I was getting paid the most I'd ever gotten in my adult life,” he said. “No education, no real skills to speak of, and Tesla offered me opportunities to take charge of my life and grow my career.”He highlighted how the work culture at Tesla—particularly among peers and supervisors—was largely positive and focused on efficiency, learning, and advancement.“I stayed because they kept treating me well. I didn’t have a reason to leave for a long time,” Cervantes noted.However, Cervantes' sentiment toward the company began to shift as Musk became more active politically and made several high-profile public moves, including acquiring Twitter and engaging in voter-related controversies.“What I took issue with the most was the giveaway for prospective voters,” he said, referring to a public campaign Musk promoted. “It seemed so morally wrong. I didn't want to be associated with that.”The turning point for Cervantes came when Musk's public image, behaviour, and political commentary became more prominent in association with Tesla’s identity.“Last year, I started to be ashamed to tell people where I work,” he admitted.While Cervantes did not go into detail about every incident that caused concern, he made it clear that the cumulative effect of Musk’s public actions led him to feel ethically conflicted about remaining with the company.Cervantes decided to leave Tesla without securing another job. He described his final conversation with his supervisor as emotional and honest.“I have to leave. I can't do this anymore. It's getting to a point where I feel like I'm compromising myself morally by walking through those doors every day,” he recalled telling his manager.The decision was not taken lightly. “I’m not going to lie, I cried a little. Seven years is a long time, and Tesla wasn’t always a bad thing for me,” Cervantes shared.While Cervantes walked away from his position at Tesla, he was careful to clarify that his issue was not with the company’s workforce or its mission, but with its leadership.“There are plenty of good people at Tesla. I didn’t leave the place because of the company. I left because of the face of the company,” he stated, referring directly to Elon Musk.","Trae Cervantes worked as an engineering technician at Tesla's Gigafactory in Nevada for seven years.

What is the Einstein visa? How Melania Trump qualified for a visa reserved for Nobel-level talent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-einstein-visa-how-melania-trump-qualified-for-a-visa-reserved-for-nobel-level-talent/articleshow/122204926.cms,"

What is the EB-1 or 'Einstein' visa?

How did Melania Trump qualify for the Einstein visa?

The larger debate: Loopholes, privilege, and policy





When Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the “Einstein visa,” in 2001, it raised eyebrows and continues to stir debate. Reserved for individuals with “extraordinary ability” in fields such as science, arts, education, business, or athletics, the EB-1 green card is typically associated with Nobel laureates, Olympic medalists, or globally recognized experts. Melania, a Slovenian model at the time, was not widely known for groundbreaking accomplishments, prompting questions about how she met the high bar required. So, what exactly is the Einstein visa, and how did the former First Lady qualify for a program meant for the world’s best and brightest?The EB-1 visa is a US employment-based green card designed for individuals who can demonstrate extraordinary ability in specific fields, or who are recognized as outstanding professors, researchers, or multinational executives. Applicants must prove “sustained national or international acclaim” and either win a major international award (like a Nobel Prize) or meet at least three of ten criteria set by US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). These include published work, media recognition, contributions to a field of major significance, or commanding a high salary compared to others in the same field.While the standards are rigorous, the process is subjective.Immigration officers ultimately decide if the evidence supports a claim of extraordinary ability. This subjectivity has sparked debate over how consistently the criteria are applied and who benefits most from its loopholes.Melania Trump, then known as Melania Knauss, was living in New York as a model when she applied for the EB-1 visa in 2000. It was approved the following year. Though she was featured in magazines and had some runway experience, she had not received prestigious modeling awards or reached the supermodel status typically associated with international acclaim. Critics argue her qualifications were modest compared to the visa's intent.Democratic Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett recently reignited the controversy, questioning whether Melania’s case truly exemplifies merit-based immigration. Her approval has drawn comparisons to other questionable EB-1 recipients, including Playboy models and niche artists who managed to craft narratives aligning with the visa’s requirements.Experts note that while the visa is often seen as exclusive, it can be awarded to applicants whose accomplishments, though not widely known, are well-documented and strategically framed within a narrow field. In Melania’s case, her successful petition may have emphasized uniqueness in her modeling niche, media presence, or professional trajectory.The EB-1 program, limited to around 40,000 visas annually, has been praised for attracting top global talent. But its subjective evaluation process has also made it vulnerable to exploitation. Legal experts and immigration attorneys admit that certain applicants with the right legal guidance can tailor their portfolios to meet the criteria, even without widely celebrated achievements.Adding to the irony, Melania later used her citizenship to sponsor her parents for green cards through “chain migration,” a policy her husband, Donald Trump, has publicly opposed. This contradiction has further politicized her immigration journey and raised broader questions about fairness, privilege, and transparency in the US immigration system.","Melania Trump received an EB-1 visa, often dubbed the ‘Einstein visa,’ in 2001.

The gaming division employed about 20,000 people as of January 2024.The latest cuts represent Microsoft's fourth mass layoff in the gaming division within 18 months, following the company's $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition in October 2023. Microsoft previously eliminated 6,000 positions in May, targeting product and engineering roles, plus an additional 300 workers in June.The company cited the need to ""remove layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness"" while redirecting resources toward artificial intelligence development. Microsoft's AI-related expenses reached approximately $80 billion in the last fiscal year as it competes in the generative AI market.“We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the spokesperson said.Affected employees will receive severance packages including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources, with priority consideration for other positions within Microsoft's broader organization.","Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees Wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year. The cuts, affecting less than 4% of Microsoft's global workforce, hit the Xbox gaming division particularly hard. Microsoft also shuttered The Initiative studio and canceled the highly anticipated Perfect Dark reboot and fantasy game Everwild.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122217520,imgsize-27682,width-400,resizemode-4/FILE-A-Microsoft-logo-is-seen-on-a-screen-as-people-listen-at-an-event-at-Microsoft-headquarters-May-20-2024-in-Redmond-Wash-AP-Photo/Lindsey-Wasson-File.jpg"
Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan may be planning this 'big change' in company's chip manufacturing business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-may-be-planning-this-big-change-in-companys-chip-manufacturing-business/articleshow/122214957.cms,"Why Intel’s new CEO may not be ‘happy’ with chipmaking process promoted by ex-chief



Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers. This potential shift deviates from his predecessor's plans and could involve substantial investment. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, two sources familiar with the matter revealed that this new strategy for Intel's foundry business would involve offering outside customers a newer generation of technology. Analysts also reportedly believe that this next-generation chipmaking process would position Intel more competitively against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) in securing large clients like Apple or Nvidia.After taking over as the company’s new CEO in March, Tan has been reassessing the company's investment in its 18A chip manufacturing process, which was promoted by former CEO Pat Gelsinger .The Reuters report cited sources to claim that Tan has expressed concerns that 18A is not attracting enough external clients and may result in a major financial write-off if Intel stops marketing it to new customers. Intel has already spent billions on developing 18A and its variant, 18A-P.While Intel continues using 18A for in-house chips and select commitments to companies like Amazon and Microsoft , Tan may be shifting focus to the 14A process, the Reuters report claims.Intel believes 14A could offer a stronger competitive position against Taiwan-based rival TSMC, whose N2 and N3 technologies are already in production or close to it, the report adds.As per the Reuters report, Tan is expected to present strategic options to Intel’s board, potentially by this month. However, a final decision may not come until later in the year due to the high stakes involved.Meanwhile, Intel continues restructuring under Tan’s leadership, with steps including new engineering hires and streamlined management. Last year, Intel posted a net loss of $18.8 billion, which was its first unprofitable year since 1986, as it works to regain ground lost in past tech transitions.","Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers.

"OPEC+ oil output: Group to raise supply by 548,000 bpd in August; cites strong demand, low inventories",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/opec-oil-output-group-to-raise-supply-by-548000-bpd-in-august-cites-strong-demand-low-inventories/articleshow/122275118.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

The OPEC+ alliance of oil-producing nations, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, decided on Saturday to increase crude output by 548,000 barrels per day in August, accelerating the unwinding of voluntary production cuts amid signs of a stabilising global economy and firm market fundamentals.At a virtual meeting, eight members of the 22-nation group, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman, agreed to raise supply levels, citing low oil inventories and a steady global economic outlook as key factors for the decision, as per news agency AP.The production hike marks a faster pace than previous months, when the group approved increases of 411,000 bpd for May, June, and July, and just 138,000 bpd in April. With the August addition, the bloc will have restored nearly 1.92 million bpd of the 2.2 million barrels they initially cut in April under a phased 18-month schedule set to run through late 2026.According to news agency Reuters, the move comes amid mounting pressure from global consumers and the United States, which has urged producers to increase supply to ease fuel prices. The alliance, which controls about half of the world’s oil output, began cutting production in 2022 to stabilise the market, but has shifted course in 2025 to reclaim market share and respond to rising demand.The price of Brent crude futures settled at $68.30 per barrel for September delivery, while US West Texas Intermediate crude closed at $66.50 for August contracts. Oil prices had briefly spiked following the recent 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran but have since dropped back, partly due to a US-brokered peace deal that followed American strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.The OPEC Secretariat, in a statement, reiterated that the August increase was in line with an earlier agreement made in December 2023 to gradually restore the 2.2 million bpd cut. That delay had originally been attributed to weak global demand and rising competition from non-OPEC producers.According to CNBC, the eight producers involved in Saturday’s meeting are implementing two sets of voluntary cuts alongside the coalition's broader policy. One, totalling 1.66 million bpd, remains in effect until end-2026, while the second, which initially curbed an additional 2.2 million bpd until March, is now being rolled back in monthly increments.As per Reuters, tensions within the group have risen recently, as some members such as Kazakhstan and Iraq, exceeded their targets in recent months, prompting internal disagreements.Kazakh output, in particular, rebounded strongly in June, reaching historic highs.The UAE, which received approval for an additional 300,000 bpd increase outside the main quota, has also been pushing for a larger share of future production, signalling internal recalibrations as the alliance adjusts to a changing market.The next meeting of the eight-member sub-group is scheduled for August 3, where further steps in the production schedule may be finalised.","The OPEC+ alliance of oil-producing nations, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, decided on Saturday to increase crude output by 548,000 barrels per day in August.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices jumped on Monday after declining for previous 3 sessions with the benchmark BSE sensex gaining nearly 850 points amid positive trends in global markets.The 30-share BSE sensex zoomed 846.94 points or 1.41% to settle at 60,747.31. During the day, it jumped 989.04 points or 1.65% to 60,889.41.The broader NSE Nifty climbed 241.75 points or 1.35% to end at 18,101.20.From the sensex pack, Mahindra & Mahindra, HCL Technologies, IndusInd Bank, Tata Consultancy Services, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Infosys, Reliance Industries and Axis Bank were the major winners.Both indexes posted their biggest intraday gains in nearly two months after logging a weekly loss of over 1% each in the first week of 2023.TCS was 3.4% up ahead of its results, while Titan was the top loser on the Nifty 50, falling 2.1% after the jewellery maker reported quarterly sales growth below expectations.Metals rose 1.43% on hopes of demand recovery after top metals consumer China reopened its borders.Shares of Reliance Industries also witnessed strong buying today as the stock jumped 2.34%.""These gains were also absorbed by the domestic market, with IT being the biggest gainer ahead of the release of sector earnings, as the favourable US economy boosted sector optimism,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told news agency PTI.IT sector stocks advanced 2.83%, making it the best-performing sector among the other 13 major Nifty sectoral indexes.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is about to kick off the Q3 results season later today.The quarterly earnings reports of top IT firms Infosys, HCL Tech and Wipro are due later this week.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed as much as 1.9% on Monday, taking its advance from an Oct. 24 low to more than 20%.

Furthermore, the December payrolls rising higher than anticipated increased the possibility of a softer landing for the US economy,"" Nair told PTI.Stocks in China have made a strong start to 2023 after being caught in a downward spiral for much of last year amid concerns over the economic toll from virus restrictions. Easing regulatory risks and more support measures to revive the troubled property sector have lent an additional boost to the market, helping the Asia rally.A gauge of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong climbed 2% Monday, taking its gain for the year to nearly 9%.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

Paying schoolgirls to have babies: Russia gives financial incentives for teen mothers- part of worldwide trend,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/paying-schoolgirls-to-have-babies-russia-gives-financial-incentives-for-teen-mothers-part-of-worldwide-trend/articleshow/122265741.cms,"Representative image (AP)

Cash, citizenship and babies: A worldwide trend

Favoring the ‘desirable’ and shaping society through the womb







Amid country’s declining birthrate, several regions in Russia have started paying pregnant schoolgirls over 100,000 roubles (around £900) to give birth and raise their children, news agency PTI reported.The initiative, recently expanded to ten regions, is part of a broader demographic strategy aimed at reversing the country’s declining birthrate.The scheme builds on a policy introduced in March 2025 that initially applied only to adult women. With Russia’s fertility rate at just 1.41 births per woman in 2023- well below the 2.05 needed to sustain population levels- the government is now widening its approach.Public opinion is split. A survey by the Russian Public Opinion Research Centre, as reported by PTI, found 43% of Russians support the policy, while 40% oppose it. Critics argue that encouraging teenage pregnancies raises ethical concerns, while supporters view it as a necessary step to counter population decline.President Vladimir Putin has made population growth a national priority, equating it with military strength and territorial expansion.However, the ongoing war in Ukraine has worsened demographic challenges.An estimated 250,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict, and hundreds of thousands of young, educated men have fled the country to avoid conscription, many of whom could have been future fathers.Alongside financial incentives, the Russian government has ramped up moral pressure. It has reintroduced the Stalin-era motherhood medal for women with ten or more children, banned the promotion of childlessness (""child-free propaganda""), and imposed restrictions on abortions in private clinics.Public criticism has grown against women who delay or avoid motherhood in favor of education or careers.Russia’s demographic concerns reflect a global trend. By 2050, over 75% of countries are expected to face population decline due to low fertility rates. In response, many governments have adopted pronatalist policies.In the US, President Donald Trump has proposed paying women $5,000 to have a baby, part of a broader push to encourage larger families, supported by figures like Elon Musk.Hungary offers tax breaks and subsidised mortgages to families with three or more children. Poland provides families with 500 złoty (£101) per child for the second child onwards.However, the effectiveness of such policies has been mixed. In Poland, for example, higher-income women are less likely to respond to financial incentives due to concerns over career setbacks. Spain, taking a different approach, has addressed population decline by easing pathways to citizenship for migrants, especially from Latin American countries.Critics argue that many pronatalist policies are shaped more by ideology than economics. Governments often aim to encourage births among groups they deem ‘desirable,’ based on race, religion, or socio-economic status, reported PTI.Hungary’s benefits are limited to heterosexual, high-income couples, while Spain has favored Spanish-speaking Catholic migrants over African applicants.Globally, these efforts frequently involve attempts to influence women's personal choices. While framed as economic necessity, many of these policies carry deeper political agendas—seeking to mold future populations by encouraging childbirth among selected groups and imposing constraints on women’s reproductive freedom.","Several regions in Russia have started paying pregnant schoolgirls over 100,000 roubles (around £900) to give birth and raise their children.
