NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut on Wednesday criticised Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis ’ visit to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, calling it a “picnic” and questioning the relevance of the conference.“Chief ministers from various states in India are having a picnic in Davos,” Raut said. “The Davos conference is ridiculous from an Indian perspective.”Raut also raised questions over the chief minister signing agreements with Indian companies during the visit, stating that such deals could have been finalised in Mumbai.Raut told reporters, “The chief ministers from across the country are having a picnic in Davos. He (CM Fadnavis) will pay attention to the mayoral elections after that is over. The Davos conference is ridiculous from an Indian perspective. Chief ministers from many states meet there, they talk to each other, and Indian industries go to Davos and sign agreements, on taxpayers' money.”“They go to Davos every year. They should tell the nation and their states how much is spent on their travel. This could have happened sitting in Mumbai.If the figures (of the investment and job creation) being given are true, then I welcome them,” he added.Devendra Fadnavis is currently in Davos to attend the WEF annual meeting.Responding to Raut’s remarks, CM’s wife Amruta Fadnavis dismissed the criticism as baseless. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event in Mumbai, she said, “I can never understand his (Raut’s) language. But I will only say this much that someone who goes for a picnic does not hold conferences and meetings daily from 6 am to 11 pm to bring investment to India and Maharashtra, and boost employment.”“So I feel that this statement of his, like all his other statements, is baseless,” she said.Amruta also underlined the importance of the Davos summit, saying it is an international platform where representatives from across the world meet to discuss their countries and explore business opportunities. “Going there, I believe, is the duty of the head of every state in India,” she added.Devendra Fadnavis has been credited with the BJP -led Mahayuti alliance’s performance in the recent municipal corporation elections. The BJP emerged as the single largest party in the 227-member Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, winning 89 seats.","Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut criticised Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’ visit to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.

Monks and nuns may have renounced all trappings of worldly life — and many of them do not vote — but they, too, are being called for SIR (Special Intensive Revision) hearings, mainly for listing their spiritual gurus’ names under the ‘name of parent’ column in the electoral records.Taking cognisance of the inconvenience faced by monastic orders, the Election Commission (EC) has directed district election officers (DEOs) to conduct hearings at ashrams and religious institutions, instead of asking monks to travel to designated centres. In cases where supporting documents are unavailable, the DEO — who is the district magistrate — has been authorised to act as a quasi-judicial authority and clear voter applications.The issue surfaced after several monks received hearing notices due to address and identity mismatch, caused by years of transfers between ashrams. Eighty-two-year-old Swami Muktikamananda, adhyaksha of the century-old Gadadhar Ashram (Ramakrishna Math) in Bhowanipur, south Kolkata, said his voter ID card and Aadhaar were linked to a Ramakrishna Math in Bankura (more than 200km from Kolkata), where he had stayed for an extended period.“I was initially asked to attend a hearing in Bankura, but after intervention by electoral officials, I submitted my enumeration form in Bhowanipur itself,” he said.Last Wednesday, around 90 monks attended a special SIR camp organised at Belur Math, with hearings held at the Abhedananda Convention Centre. Participants included residents of the Belur headquarters as well as monks from centres such as the Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama in Narendrapur. While monks of the Ramakrishna Math and Mission do not vote, they seek inclusion in electoral rolls to avoid complications in visa applications and administrative work.Monks from Bharat Sevashram Sangha (BSS) and Iskcon, many of whom do vote, have also received SIR notices. Swami Mahadevananda of BSS said several monks had listed founder Acharya Swami Pranavananda’s name as their parent, triggering document mismatches. General secretary Dilip Maharaj said monks without passports attended a special hearing on Jan 20 at the Ballygunge headquarters.Iskcon spokesperson Radharamn Das said monks who had earlier voted in Kolkata had been asked to submit fresh documents from their native places across India and abroad.Voters in Jhargram and West Midnapore — in Bengal’s Jangalmahal, about 150km from Kolkata — have, over the years, learnt how to coexist with elephants. It’s a sort of mutual respect, born out of a certain wariness — and a tacit understanding: “Stay out of my hair, and I’ll stay out of yours.”During the SIR, regular elephant movement has coincided with a sudden rise in human movement — residents with voter detail anomalies are having to travel far and wide to arrive at hearing centres, a highly unsafe exercise. And, so, the poll body said yes when the two district administrations wanted to set up multiple hearing centres, located near human settlements, across six assembly constituencies.Similar arrangements are also being planned in elephant-heavy pockets of North Bengal.In West Midnapore, voters from select Jangalmahal villages will attend hearings at the Pirakata Community Hall, under the jurisdiction of Salboni police station. Salboni BDO Ruman Mondal said residents of villages such as Kalsibhanga, Satpati, Kalaimuri, Garmal, Lalgaria and Bhimpur were directed to appear at the new centre from Jan 15.Medinipur Sadar subdivisional officer Madhumita Mukherjee said it was a deliberate decision to choose the additional centres based on how close they were to villages, so that hearings could be conducted based on real-time elephant movement.“Ten additional centres have been set up in the district, including a consolidated venue catering to villages from two assembly constituencies in elephant corridors,” said Bijin Krishna, the DM of West Midnapore. In Jhargram, special hearing centres have been established at 10 high schools across the Nayagram, Gopiballavpur, Jhargram and Binpur constituencies. The DM, Akanksha Bhaskar, said the measures were taken in the interest of public safety.In the North Bengal districts of Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, North Dinajpur and South Dinajpur, employment records issued by tea gardens and cinchona plantations are valid proofs of identity and residence for workers and their families.Labourers in tea and cinchona estates — many of whom have lived in makeshift quarters for generations — have struggled to produce conventional documents, such as land records or formal proof of address.As a result, during SIR hearings, they have been unable to come up with those documents, leading to fears of disenfranchisement. Plantation employment records are routinely maintained by garden authorities, and now that they have been recognised by the commission as a bona fide voter eligibility document, it’s come as immense relief for workers.Netas across the political spectrum welcomed the move, but while BJP MP Jayanta Roy called it an “excellent step”, TMC’s Rajya Sabha MP, Prakash Chik Baraik, said the move ought to have been taken long ago, and that the delay had caused unnecessary panic.Members of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) have welcomed EC’s decision to conduct doorstep verification, amid concerns over document availability and identity mismatch.In Totopara, home to the Toto community (the state’s smallest PVTG) in North Bengal’s Alipurduar, residents said the move has eased anxieties over land and identity records. “Many families do not have land khatiyans, while migrant workers lack links to ancestral property. We were worried, but the EC has taken extra care,” said Bakul Toto, secretary of the Toto Kalyan Samiti.Similar issues have surfaced among the Birhor and Lodha Shabar communities. Around 300 Birhors live in south Bengal’s Purulia district — across Balarampur, Baghmundi and Jhalda-I blocks, with 181 adults listed in the 2024 Lok Sabha electoral rolls. In forest-dependent areas, many Birhor families now reside in permanent houses provided by the state, but discrepancies in records have triggered SIR hearings.Lodha Shabar members — spread across West Midnapore and Jhargram — are also receiving notices. The community comprises over 1 lakh people across nearly 17,000 families. District administrations had flagged concerns over whether members possessed sufficient documentation, following which the EC, on Dec 31 last year, instructed DEOs to conduct physical verification.In West Midnapore, Lodha Shabar residents have been attending hearings at block development offices. In the Keshiary block, multiple villagers were summoned despite having submitted details during the enumeration. “We produced voter ID, Aadhaar and family details at the hearing,” said Basanti Dandapat of Lengamara village.West Bengal Lodha Shabar Development Board chairman Balai Naik said teams were visiting villages to reassure residents. “There is no need to panic. In cases of spelling errors or linkage issues, officials will verify details on the ground,” he said.Similar “special public hearings” have been ordered for sex workers as well, as many of them lack identity proof.Officials said district election officers have been instructed to hear such cases separately and adopt a facilitative approach, recognising that many sex workers have been disconnected from their families for decades or do not know their parents’ names.For 55-year-old Baby Khatun, who has lived in Sonagachi, Kolkata’s largest red light district, since she arrived there at the age of 10, the hearing notice triggered panic. “I only remember that my family lived in Kidderpore. I don’t know my parents’ names,” she said. With no immediate relatives, she listed her landlord as her guardian.“How can I produce a family tree? I don’t even know their names. I’m afraid my name will be deleted,” she said.Rekha Das, another sex worker, has a voter and Aadhaar cards but faced difficulty enrolling her son, a first-time voter, because the form requires the name of a blood relative from the mother’s side. “I have documents, but no family records,” she said.EC officials said the concerns were genuine and assured no eligible voter would be struck off the rolls solely for lack of documents, stressing that SIR was aimed at inclusion, not exclusion.","Monks and nuns are being called for SIR (Special Intensive Revision) hearings.

Stock market today: Indian equity benchmarks, Nifty50 and Sensex, closed lower on Wednesday as investors booked profits amid weak global cues and cautious sentiment ahead of key macro triggers. The Nifty50 slipped 75 points, or 0.30 per cent, to close at 25,157.50, while the 30-share BSE Sensex declined 270.84 points, or 0.33 per cent, to settle at 81,909.63.Heavy selling in select banking, financial and auto stocks dragged the benchmark indices lower on Wednesday, even as gains in a handful of index heavyweights capped sharper losses.Among the Sensex pack, ICICI Bank, Trent, Bharat Electronics, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Larsen & Toubro, State Bank of India and Maruti emerged as the top laggards.

IIT Kanpur

campus saw 30% of suicides over 2 yrs, fix accountability at top level: Alumnus

MUMBAI: The death of a student by suicide at IIT-Kanpur on Tuesday again swivelled the spotlight on a mental health crisis on the campuses of India's premier technical institutions: over a dozen young lives lost every year on average over the past five years.At least 65 students have taken their own lives across the Indian Institutes of Technology between Jan 2021 and Dec 2025, show figures kept by the Global IIT Alumni Support Group. As many as 30 suicides were recorded in the past two years (see box), raising concerns about institutional responsibility, and accountability. The deaths have occurred across undergraduate, PG and doctoral programmes, often followed by official statements attributing them to ""personal"" or ""academic"" stress.Student bodies and alumni said such explanations flatten a more complex reality: one shaped by 'relentless evaluation', competitiveness, isolation and, in some cases, caste or language-based exclusion. Faculty members privately admit that warning signs are often missed, and interventions tend to arrive when distress has already reached a critical stage.The numbers at IITs sit within a far larger national tragedy.India recorded more than 13,000 student suicides in 2023, according to NCRB data, which translates into roughly 36 incidents every day.Supreme Court has formed a task force to address mental health concerns and prevent student suicides. Dheeraj Singh, an IIT Kanpur alumnus (2004 batch) and founder of the Global IIT Alumni Support Group, called for direct accountability at the highest level. “The hon’ble Supreme Court has reaffirmed that mental health is an integral part of the Right to Life under Article 21,” he said.“Further, in the Saha vs State of Andhra Pradesh case, the court has ordered that student mental health be treated as a constitutional and institutional responsibility,” Singh added.Singh wants accountability and hopes it will drive a change in mindset towards mental health.“Given that this is the ninth suicide death on IIT Kanpur campus (in 2 years), education ministry is urged to hold the director accountable for the serious state of mental health and consider bringing in a new head to improve the situation,” Singh said.The IIT Kanpur alumnus argued that figures show 30% of the suicide deaths over the last two years have been at IIT Kanpur, which is the highest toll in any of the 23 IITs in the country. IIT Kharagpur was a close second, recording seven suicides during this period.IIT Bombay, Singh pointed out, had only one suicide during this period though it has a higher number of students enrolled than Kanpur.","At least 65 students have taken their own lives across the Indian Institutes of Technology between Jan 2021 and Dec 2025.

The wishlist: What comes next for India?

“Ecstatic! Hell yeah, I’ve been waiting for this all my life.” Linkin Park fan Joel’s words almost encapsulate the emotions of all the Indian millennials and Gen Zs who have been waiting to see the iconic rock band live.“They've been with me from my tiny MP3 player to my current smartphone,” he adds.“They have ruled all my yearly music wraps. Seeing them perform live is a dream come true for all nu metal fans,” says Saurav Kumar, who has been a fan since 2007.The year 2026 is packed with events and shows that bring the musical soul of fans to life. The rock septet is also set to perform at Lollapalooza 2026, which is also supercharged with other headliners like Playboi Carti, Fuji Kaze, and many more artists on the lineup.Legendary performers like The Lumineers and John Mayer will be setting their solo stages for the Indian fans this year too.What’s exciting is that these events talk about the musical schedule for just two months into the year.Keeping 2025 in hindsight, the year that set the stage for global superstars like Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Travis Scott, Akon and many more in the Indian soil, it is only left to our imagination what the rest of 2026 holds.This only goes to show that India is no longer an afterthought for the global artist tour venues, but a very significant stop.Or as Naman Pugalia, the chief business officer for live events at BookMyShow, puts it, “India is no longer a wildcard on the touring circuit but a permanent hotspot.”India has rapidly moved to become a primary market for major international music artists when weighing their tour route. In 2017, when Justin Bieber announced India as his stop, the Beliebers had a meltdown.Hosting international stars has not been a new thing for India.In 1996, the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, performed in Mumbai. However, the event was very much driven by novelty or an elite audience. But the landscape is shifting swiftly, and the change is driven by both the global promoters and a homegrown audience ready to show up for the live experience in sizable numbers.Naman Pugalia says, “India has become one of the fastest-growing live entertainment markets globally, with a population of 1.4 billion and a rapidly expanding base of global music fans.”And the excitement is palpable, putting in perspective the enthusiasm and active participation of the audience who are ready to cross borders, quite literally, just to see their favourite artists live.Swadha Shankar, who travelled all the way to Ahmedabad from Delhi, shares, “Watching the artists, who filled the silence of your early life with ambition and music that shaped your personality, keeps the flame of passion burning within you.”“Concerts offer collective energy. Music creates a shared experience beyond cities and cultures,” says Gursshheen Gahllen, who most recently attended the Akon concert in Delhi.However, it is not only passion driving the genre, but India has also rapidly developed its infrastructure and management capabilities, which have strengthened the logistical backbone of these live experiences promised to the crowd and have gained more credibility in the eyes of international headliners.Pugalia shares the importance of ever-evolving production standards, which ultimately shape the entertainment ecosystem for these events.“As a rapidly growing economy, India has been a prime hotspot for international artists to connect with an abundantly populous fan community. With the ever-evolving infrastructure for concerts, festivals and live entertainment shows in the country, artists are now joining the bandwagon to woo passionate Indian fans.”India stood the test of quality in front of major touring acts.Coldplay, during their India stop in 2025, added more dates to accommodate the high demand, with each show being a sell-out. Ed Sheeran’s revisit to India also reaffirmed the stance that India can move tickets at global scale.The buzz in India today is unignorable — and it’s not just audiences feeling it. It’s drawing artists to embrace their roots.Tyla’s Mumbai show was a case in point. With Indian lineage in her family, she stepped out not only as a global artist but as someone reclaiming a piece of heritage. She wore a bindi, spoke to the crowd, and the arena erupted.It is not only the passion that is driving the young crowd to these musical gatherings. Logistically, accessibility and awareness have shaped the fulfilment of their interests on a great scale.Affluent millennials, typically aged between 25 and 40 with rising disposable incomes, form the core audience for these concerts. They are willing to stay updated, buy tickets and get onboard with the firsthand experience of witnessing it all live.“When my friends first asked me to join them for a concert in 2022, I got very curious. ‘What could be the difference between streaming on a phone and seeing them live?’” says Mohammad Sarim, “And since then, I have attended more than 15 concerts by different artists.”Music fans are no longer passive consumers through online platforms; they are very inclined to follow artist journeys and travel to cities for shows. This contributes significantly towards boosting an economy that can cater to the quality demands of hosting these global stars.“35% of Coldplay’s audience in Ahmedabad came from non-metro cities, underlining the fact that demand extends far beyond traditional urban hubs,” said Naman Pugalia when asked about the shift in Indian audience towards the live experience.This is not only driving ticket sales, but the travel pattern is shaping a new “concert tourism” market.“We travelled in a luxury sleeper bus from Delhi to Ahmedabad. A friend joining from Mumbai through his connections was able to arrange lavish rooms when Ahmedabad was out of rooms,” Swadha shares about her travel and accommodation.This movement of fans across states has turned concerts into economic events that extend beyond ticket sales, benefiting airlines, hotels, transport services, food outlets and local vendors.According to the EY–Parthenon and BookMyShow report, India’s Rising Concert Economy, India’s organised live events segment crossed Rs 12,000 crore in 2024 and is projected to grow at around 18–19% annually over the next few years.The broader media and entertainment sector crossed Rs 2.5 trillion in 2024, with live events among its fastest-growing segments, according to the FICCI–EY Media & Entertainment Report.Ticketing data also shows Tier-II cities now contribute close to 35–38% of demand, reflecting a sharp expansion beyond metros.For global artists, India’s scale compensates for relatively lower ticket pricing. Volume over price has become the Indian formula, making the market commercially viable while culturally powerful.While international stars have been creating a frenzy, the Indian superstars are not falling behind. 2025 not only saw a big gathering for the foreign names, but the household names also sent waves of wonder during their Indian and international stages.Diljit Dosanjh’s high-voltage “Dil-Luminati” tour powered through North America, Europe, and the Middle East, with sell-out arena dates across cities such as Vancouver, Toronto, Houston, Los Angeles, London, and Dubai.AR Rahman continued to draw packed houses with his “Harmony of Hearts” shows across India and major overseas markets, including the US, Canada, the UK, and the Gulf. Sunidhi Chauhan’s “I Am Home” tour kept venues buzzing from Mumbai to Melbourne.Arijit Singh sold out arena nights in Dubai, London, Birmingham, Sydney, and Toronto, underlining his unmatched global pull. And the world took notes. His international footprint most recently showed up with his Ed Sheeran collaboration on the superhit “Sapphire.”And this is only part of the story: Shreya Ghoshal, Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, and several others continue to command international stages with ease.Historically, India was not a default stop on world tours.While Indian fans resonated deeply with global music, logistical challenges, visa delays, security concerns and weak event management often deterred artists.Metallica’s cancelled 2011 India show remains a cautionary tale. The event was postponed and later called off entirely, triggering riots and arrests, and damaging India’s reputation among global promoters.But stakeholders have gradually worked to flip that script.“We’ve spent years working closely with global promoters, agents and artist teams, ensuring India is not just a stop but a destination that matches global benchmarks,” Pugalia says.Audience management has also improved.“There were clear signboards, route guides and transport information shared with tickets,” Gursshheen notes. “There was a large team managing queues and seating.”Yet challenges remain.“Parking, public washrooms and security are still issues,” Sarim says. “I’ve lost two phones at concerts.”Recent incidents, including physical altercations at concerts like Karan Aujla’s Gurgaon show, highlight the need for better civic sense and crowd discipline.As demand continues to outpace infrastructure, experts stress that long-term success will depend not just on fan passion, but on governance, public conduct and sustained investment in large-capacity venues.For many touring artists, India has evolved from a novelty stop to a meaningful fan engagement market. Several trends illustrate this shift. From global streams to live public reception clearl reflect the massive shift in people’s reception.Brands and sponsors are also walking the extra mile to elevate the experience by extending the space to a shared experience with merchandise, interactive spaces, photobooths and other amenities designed for the fans to not just attend the shows but an extension of it.Among all this, for an economy like India, affordability plays a huge role. However, population scale compensates for that gap, placing India in a competitive space.Dua Lipa's Mumbai concert in November 2024 drew 35,000 fans, generating crores despite the discounted tiers. Enrique Iglesias' Oct 2025 MMRDA show was also sold out in hours to lakhs of millennials, turning volume into viable economics where Western acts once saw losses.“With the introduction of the variable pricing model, we have been able to drive a shift in the ‘late-buying’ pattern, where customers have begun making the most of early bird offers or introductory prices,” said Pugalia.This positions India as a market with both cultural influence and commercial viability.India is transitioning from a wildcard destination to a stable touring market.Fans of artists like BTS and Khalid have been waiting to find India on their tour lists. While BTS shared Mumbai being one of the venues for their cancelled Map of the Soul ON:E concert due to the pandemic, their 2026 tour calendar still does not list India as one of their stops.The wishlist for the Indian fans, however, is long.“Charlie Puth!” Sarim speaks up in a heartbeat when asked about who he wishes to see live in India. “Artists like Taylor Swift , Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, and Shakira would find an audience here that is ready and enthusiastic,” Gursshheen shares her list of favourites she awaits.When asked about what drives the artist's plan and how the pitch is prepared, Naman Pugalia shares a meticulous list: “The curation of an artist roster has numerous moving parts and is a fruit of long months of labour. Global touring routes of artists, discovery of new sounds and performers for a landscape, research and matching of potential artist names with the Indian consumer palate and appetite, streaming popularity in a market and deducing from it as also significant diversity across the roster are key factors of consideration. ”Development and repurposing of venues are consistently underway. The touring frequency for concerts in India is seeing a new rise. The long-term seems promising to witness India positioned as a permanent stop on the world touring maps of major artists.Venues are being upgraded, touring frequency is rising, and the momentum is undeniable.But the journey is far from complete. Infrastructure gaps, crowd management challenges and civic behaviour remain critical hurdles. India’s rise as a global concert hotspot will ultimately depend on whether scale is matched with responsibility.","The year 2026 is packed with events and shows that bring the musical soul of fans to life. Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Travis Scott, Akon and many more in the Indian soil. India is no longer an afterthought for the global artist tour venues.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126819023,imgsize-1156523,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Illicit mining has to be stopped at all costs,"" said a bench of Chief Justice Surya Kant, and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi.On Dec 29, the bench took suo motu cognisance of environmentalists' concerns over its Nov 20 order accepting the 100-metre-elevation definition of Aravali hills and ranges, and stopped all mining, including renewal and grant of new leases, across the Aravalis in four states. It also put on hold its earlier order allowing preparation of a management plan for sustainable mining.The SC will also constitute an expert body for Aravalis, which will function under the apex court.The bench asked amicus curiae K Parameshwar, additional solicitors general Aishwarya Bhati and K M Nataraj, and senior advocates, including Kapil Sibal, to suggest names of experts — environmentalists, geologists, naturalists and forest experts – within four weeks.These names will help the court form an expert body to carry out an “exhaustive, holistic and scientific” examination of the Aravali Hills and Ranges for a comprehensive definition to protect its “structural and ecological” integrity. “The expert body will work under the direct supervision and control of the Supreme Court,” the CJI-led bench said in its order.Till the expert body is formed, a comprehensive study is conducted and recommendations submitted to the court, the states shall “take all possible steps to stop illegal mining activities and prosecute the offenders,” the court said. Refusing to entertain multiple intervention applications, the bench said it would not allow certain vested interests to derail the attempts to preserve and protect Aravali ranges, which is the last defence against Thar desert extending its debilitating influence on the fertile Gangetic plain. Issues that had pricked the court’s mind and led to reopening of the issue are – whether the 500-metre separation between two Aravali Hills created a structural paradox for the Range; whether it broadened the non-Aravali areas within the Range to allow unregulated mining activities; and, the sanctity of the 100-metre-elevation definition. Another issue flagged by court was: “Whether the widely publicised criticism asserting only 1,048 hills out of 12,081 in Rajasthan meet the 100-metre-elevation threshold, thereby stripping the remaining lower ranges of environmental protection, is factually and scientifically accurate?”","The Supreme Court on Wednesday said illegal mining continues in the Aravali hills and ranges despite its ban.

Power ministry's draft policy moots automatic revisions of tariff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/power-ministrys-draft-policy-moots-automatic-revisions-of-tariff/articleshow/127055685.cms,"Draft power policy proposes end to distribution monopoly

NEW DELHI: The power ministry's draft National Electricity Policy (NEP) 2026, released Wednesday, has proposed an annual reset of tariffs, including an index-linked automatic revision in case the regulator fails to act to ensure sound financial health of power utilities, while seeking to limit cross-subsidies for manufacturing units and railways, in an attempt to make tariffs reasonable.While underlining that coal-based generation will remain critical, it has backed nuclear capacity addition with the involvement of the private sector and suggested that atomic energy could emerge as a source for captive plants, replacing thermal.The draft has retained focus on renewable energy capacity addition and also laid emphasis on storage, apart from drawing up a robust cybersecurity blueprint to guard critical infrastructure from rising threats, especially from overseas actors.The overall focus of the draft National Electricity Policy 2026, is on enhanced power availability, with annual per capita consumption projected at 2,000 kWh by 2030 and at over 4,000 kWh by 2047, compared with the current 1,460 kWh.It also aligns with India’s climate commitments, including reducing emissions intensity by 45% from 2005 levels over the next five years and achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, which will require a shift to low-carbon energy.Although the 40-page draft has performed lip service to “consumer-centricity”, it has underlined the need to provide competition in distribution areas. “In line with the intent of the (Electricity) Act, monopoly in distribution will be phased out by allowing multiple players. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and the listing of utilities shall be promoted. The central govt shall extend necessary support to facilitate the implementation,” the power ministry said, while recognising its limitations and urging state electricity commissions to act.There is significant emphasis on ensuring timely tariff orders by regulatory bodies, cost recovery and reduction in losses. “From FY2026-27, state commissions must ensure that tariffs fully reflect costs without creating regulatory assets. Tariffs must be linked to a suitable index for automatic annual revision which operates if no tariff order is passed by the state commission… Free power supply should be avoided and subsidies should be paid in advance,” it said.According to the ministry, the first NEP, issued in Feb 2005, had addressed core challenges such as demand-supply gaps, limited electricity access and inadequate infrastructure. Since then, the sector has seen transformational change, with installed generation capacity rising four-fold alongside significant private sector participation, while per capita electricity consumption reached 1,460 units in 2024–25. Officials said that despite these achievements, the power sector continues to face challenges, with distribution companies accumulating losses of nearly Rs 6.9 lakh crore and outstanding debt nearing Rs 7.2 lakh crore. They added that cross-subsidisation has resulted in high industrial tariffs.The policy further focuses on cybersecurity, technology adoption and skill development, and proposes the introduction of a distribution system operator to facilitate network sharing and the integration of distributed renewables, storage and vehicle-to-grid systems. It also suggests a utilisation-based framework for the allocation of transmission connectivity, along with appropriate regulatory mechanisms to ensure optimal use and prevent the speculative holding of connectivity. The draft adds that a strong regulatory framework must be in place to support market monitoring and surveillance and prevent collusion, gaming, or market dominance. “It provides a robust framework for industry, investors and the govt to collaborate in building a resilient, consumer-centric and globally competitive power sector,” said Sambitosh Mohapatra, partner and leader, climate and energy, PwC India.","The draft has retained focus on renewable energy capacity addition and also laid emphasis on storage.

""Actually, clearly in the first group,"" he said, arguing that the country is simultaneously building capability across all five layers of the AI stack - applications, models, chips, infrastructure and energy.The minister said the real economic value of AI did not lie in building ever-larger models but in enterprise-level deployment. ""ROI (return on investment) doesn't come from creating a very large model; 95% of the work can happen with models which are 20 billion or 50 billion parameters,"" he said, adding that India has a bouquet of such models deployed across sectors to improve productivity and efficiency.He also questioned the assumption that ownership of large frontier models translates into geopolitical leverage. ""Does creating a large model give you geopolitical power? I don't think so,"" he said, noting that such models can be switched off and may even become financially unsustainable.""The economics of this fifth industrial revolution is going to come from ROI - deploying the lowest cost solution to get the highest possible return. ""A key constraint, he said, is access to compute. To address this, India has empanelled around 38,000 GPUs under a public-private partnership model to create a common national compute facility. The system is govt-enabled and subsidised, allowing students, researchers and startups to access compute at roughly one-third of global costs.Outlining India's broader approach, the minister said the focus is on four pillars: a shared compute facility, a free bouquet of practical AI models, large-scale skilling with a target of training 10 million people, and helping the IT services industry pivot towards AI-driven productivity.On regulation, he stressed the need for a techno-legal framework rather than laws alone. ""Detecting deep fakes with the accuracy which can be taken to a court and be properly judicially checked"" is essential, he said, adding that India is developing tools to mitigate bias and ensure proper unlearning before enterprise deployment.",IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw challenged the view that India sits in a secondary tier of AI powers.

On Oct 8 last year, SC stalled the project on a petition jointly filed by five retired Indian Forest Service (IFS) officers and NGO ‘People for Aravalis’ , who through advocate Shibani Ghosh had alleged that the project would spell doom for the already damaged crucial Aravali range.Amicus curiae and senior advocate K Parameshwar flagged three issues — impact of the project on water table of the area, species and afforestation, and sourcing of animals. “All these three issues raise sufficient doubt that the project should not be implemented,” he said.The bench said since no work has commenced yet on the ground, it would be ideal that the entire project and its feasibility, both from environmental and ecological aspects, is examined threadbare by the CEC and report be given to the court.“If the CEC opines that the project is ecologically and environmentally harmful, then that is the end of it,” the court said, adding that the interim stay on the project would continue till further orders.The petitioners had said, “The proposed zoo safari entails large-scale construction of permanent structures and facilities, including administrative blocks, research and laboratory centres, guest houses, staff quarters, animal enclosures, hotels, restaurants, recreational and commercial establishments, as well as extensive infrastructure facilities such as roads, electrical and communication networks, and firefighting systems. ”“Large-scale development of this scale within the Aravali region would inevitably result in severe and irreversible ecological damage to an already fragile ecosystem, which is home to rich floral and faunal diversity,” they said, and alleged that the zoo-safari project is being funded with the compensatory afforestation funds, which is impermissible.The petitioners said a project primarily aimed at revenue generation through large-scale commercial and recreational activities in this eco-sensitive region is bound to undermine the ecology and hydrology of the Aravali region.","Haryana’s senior additional advocate general Lokesh Sinhal told a bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that the state wanted to commence work only on 3,500 acres.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has sought responses from Haryana govt and Mahira Buildwell (formerly Czar Buildwell) after an association of homebuyers from economically weaker sections accused the developer of an affordable housing scheme in Gurgaon, under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban), of cheating them.Accusing Czar Buildwell and its successor Mahira of obtaining a licence through fraudulent means, including submission of forged bank guarantees and fabrication of signatures, the petitioner association said the builder has carried out only 5-7% of the construction work, siphoning homebuyers' funds.SC is already dealing with a large number of cases in which builders, in collusion with financial institutions and banks, have duped homebuyers by misusing the subvention scheme. It has ordered a CBI probe into these cases, leading to registration of 28 FIRs against builders.The bench led by CJI Surya Kant also sought responses from Haryana RERA, Enforcement Directorate, Axis Bank and Canara Bank. The petitioner association alleged that its members had paid a substantial amount to the developer for a standardised dwelling unit. It said, “Due to the failure of competent authorities to carry out due diligence and the lackadaisical attitude towards enforcing statutory schemes, the members/allottees had to face substantial hardships and financial and mental stress.Despite recurring and periodical collection of funds by the developer from the allottees, the developer has failed to carry out time-linked construction, as mandated in the scheme.”“Despite multiple complaints, representations, and even contempt proceedings, the respondent authorities, including the Centre, Haryana, director of town and country Planning, HARERA and banking institutions have failed to take remedial action,” it said.","Supreme Court has sought responses from Haryana govt and Mahira Buildwell.

Census to count ‘near endangered’ Kashmir Markhor population to begin in Feb,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-to-count-near-endangered-kashmir-markhor-population-to-begin-in-feb/articleshow/127040013.cms,"SRINAGAR: A census to count the elusive Kashmir Markhor, the world’s largest wild mountain goat, will begin in early Feb as J&K’s wildlife department seeks more data on the population of the species that is categorised as ‘near threatened’.“The census will start from Kazinag National Park,” said Dr Tanushree Srivastava, senior manager and head of Jammu and Kashmir projects at Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), which is conducting the census in collaboration with the wildlife department. WTI is a well-known wildlife conservation group that works in close coordination with Union and state govts.Considered to be the largest wild goat in the world, in India the Markhor is found only in J&K. According to Srivastava, the last census was carried out in 2023, during which WTI estimated the Markhor population in Kazinag National Park to be 221, while the sightings in Hirpora and Tatakutti wildlife sanctuaries remained very low.Kazinag National Park lies on the northern bank of the River Jhelum near the Line of Control (LoC) in Baramulla district, about 70 km northwest of Srinagar. The Hirpora sanctuary is located in the Pir Panjal range, 70 km southwest of Srinagar, in Kashmir’s Shopian district, and the Tatakutti sanctuary in Jammu’s Poonch district.In 2004, WTI carried out the first survey to assess the Markhor population and distribution in all its historical sites. Dr Srivastava said it was after WTI’s field surveys that Markhor was recorded in the areas adjacent to the Hirpora sanctuary after 60 years. “We follow the double-observer survey method to estimate the Markhor population, as this method has been globally recognised,” she said. Understanding the population status of the species is crucial for planning future conservation efforts, she added.As Markhor inhabits rugged terrain in areas close to the LoC, WTI needs special permission from the Army for the census work due to security concerns. “The Army has been very supportive in giving due permissions to survey these areas, and also providing full security during the exercise,” Srivastava said.","Census to count Kashmir Markhor, the world's largest wild mountain goat, will begin in early Feb.

NEW DELHI: Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar on Wednesday utilised the India International Conference on Democracy and Election Management (IICDEM) 2026 — which got underway here with the participation of delegates from 70 nations — as a forum to showcase the successful conduct of special intensive revision (SIR) in Bihar, citing the zero appeals received after publication of the final electoral roll, and the subsequent assembly election that witnessed zero repolls.“Pure electoral roll, including each and every eligible elector as per law, is essential to strengthen democracy and all elections which will be held on the basis of that electoral roll. The second segment is the conduct of elections, which becomes a very challenging, logistical affair, because a large number of people have to obey and follow the electoral laws and the instructions issued by the EC,” Kumar said while highlighting how the Bihar election had delivered on both the fronts.Stating that the purpose of the IICDEM 2026 is to not only celebrate democracy but also understand the future path, challenges, the expectations of the electors and how to make the electoral process smoother, transparent, free and fair, the CEC explained to the foreign delegates, which included top representatives of 42 electoral management bodies and 27 ambassadors/High Commissioners, how Indian elections have become one of the largest exercises on the planet in terms of logistics, numbers and transparency.“More than a billion voters, (with) 640 million exercising their franchise at more than a million polling stations….and roughly. 1.8-2 crore people involved in the exercise, is a feat,” he underlined.Election commissioner SS Sandhu described the faith placed by citizens in electoral management bodies (EMBs) as precious, saying that it is the collective responsibility of EMBs to preserve it.Election commissioner Vivek Joshi said IICDEM-2026 brings together EMBs, researchers, students and practitioners who view elections from different angles, to brainstorm on all issues related to democracy and electoral management.Earlier, secretary general of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (international IDEA) Kevin Casas-Zamora welcomed India’s chairship of International IDEA, saying that India must share with the world how it has managed the odds to build a legacy of “free and fair elections, respect for the rule of law, tolerance, secularism, press freedom and all the things that make a democracy worth”.Recalling how recent elections across many countries witnessed political polarisation, illicit funding flows, online and offline aggression and digital misinformation, Casas-Zamora also raised concern over outright election denialism, with politicians from the US, Peru, Georgia, and Bangladesh “using spurious arguments to question credible results”. He said that 2024 saw 1.6 billion people casting ballots in 74 national elections, including India. “Yet, global electoral turnout that year was down nearly 10 percentage points when compared to 15 years before, while around 40% of elections suffered some form of dispute over their credibility,” he pointed out.Casas-Zamora however said elections had also helped reverse democratic backsliding in Poland, Senegal, Guatemala and Brazil. “Democracy can be restored as long as electoral routes for political change remain open,” he emphasised.Speaking on the theme of IICDEM 2026 — democracy for an inclusive, peaceful, resilient and sustainable world — DG IIIDEM Rakesh Verma said that it reflects a broad and multi-dimensional understanding of what democracy must deliver in the 21st century.The participants viewed glimpses from the upcoming docu-series, “India Decides” produced in collaboration with Warner Bros.

"Eyeing net zero future, Niti Aayog releases roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium, cement, MSME sectors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eyeing-net-zero-future-niti-aayog-releases-roadmaps-for-decarbonisation-of-aluminium-cement-msme-sectors/articleshow/127019307.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt think tank, Niti Aayog , on Wednesday released roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium, cement and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) sectors, aimed at guiding the country towards a net-zero emission future through sustainable processes.The move comes in the backdrop of the country's climate action commitments under the Paris Agreement and the govt's recent decision to set greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity reduction targets of traditionally high-emitting sectors including aluminium, cement, petrochemical and textile to meet specific reduction goals by 2026-27 compared to a 2023-24 baseline.“These roadmaps will not only help these sectors reach their emission intensity reduction targets but also contribute immensely towards achieving India's net-zero goal (carbon neutrality) of 2070,” said an official in the environment ministry.B V R Subrahmanyam, CEO, NITI Aayog, while releasing these roadmaps, emphasized that these roadmaps would serve as reference manuals for India to achieve its unique goal of becoming a developed country as well as decarbonising the industry simultaneously.Globally, cement production is a significant source of carbon emissions. In 2023, cement manufacturing contributed roughly 2.4 GtCO2e emissions worldwide.India’s production of cement resulted in roughly 246 MtCO2e of emissions which was around 6% of national GHG emissions.Similarly, production of aluminium accounted for about 2.8% of India's total GHG emissions in 2023. The country's domestic demand for aluminium is projected to increase sharply from 4 million tonnes in 2023 to over 37 million tonnes by 2070, almost three times the projected global growth rate.MSMEs, which have over 36% share in manufacturing, too rely heavily on fossil fuels to meet their energy and process requirements, resulting in approximately 135 million tonnes of carbon emissions (MtCO2e) in 2022 alone.Keeping this in view, the roadmaps for the cement, aluminium and MSMEs sectors are intended as practical planning tools, outlining how each sector can move step by step toward more sustainable, lower-carbon modes of production. It carries various recommendations and solutions which help decarbonise these sectors.“The move will also help India navigate through the European Union’s carbon border tax on GHG intensive (emission generated during production) goods such as aluminium and cement by reducing carbon footprints in the manufacturing processes of these sectors,” said the official.EU’s carbon border tax - Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) - is a tool to put a price through imposing border tax on such goods that are entering the 27 EU nations. If India does not take steps to decarbonise these sectors, they will attract a tariff burden on such products and impact the country’s exports.Under the decarbonisation strategy, the cement sector will reduce its carbon intensity from 0.63 tCO₂e per tonne of cement to approximately 0.09-0.13 tCO₂e per tonne by 2070. The roadmap for the sector proposes to prioritize the use of refuse-derived fuels, clinker substitution, scaling up of Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and effective implementation of carbon credit trading scheme to enable deep decarbonisation in this sector.The decarbonisation roadmap for aluminium sector identifies three phased solutions - transition to renewable energy-round the clock (RE-RTC) power and enhanced grid connectivity in the short term, adoption of nuclear power in the medium term, and long-term integration of CCUS.The roadmap for green transition of MSMEs focuses on three key levers: deployment of energy-efficient equipment, adoption of alternative fuels, and integration of green electricity.Observing that MSMEs are important members of domestic and international supply chains, Suman Bery, vice chairperson, NITI Aayog, urged prioritizing technology adoption, access to affordable finance, skilling & regulatory reforms, and increased participation of female workforce to achieve overall competitiveness of the sector.","Govt think tank, Niti Aayog released roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium, cement and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) sectors.

Identification and survey of all small drains connected to Najafgarh and Shahdara drains will be completed through drone survey by the end of January.The survey of remaining drains will be completed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) by June 2026, the chief minister said.The Delhi government set a 2028 deadline to connect all 1,799 unauthorised colonies to the sewerage network.The chief minister highlighted that coordination with neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh is essential to cleaning the Yamuna.""Six drains from Haryana account for 33 per cent of the total contaminated water in Najafgarh, while four major drains from Uttar Pradesh discharge into the Shahdara Drain, accounting for approximately 40 per cent of the total contaminated water,"" she said.Gupta added that she would discuss this issue with the chief ministers of both states to find a solution.""Currently, 37 sewage treatment plants in Delhi are treating 814 million gallons per day (MGD) of contaminated water, which is sufficient as per the current requirement. But keeping in view the future needs, the government has set a big target of increasing this capacity to 1,500 MGD,"" the chief minister told the meeting.The capacity of the treatment plants would be improved by 56 MGD by December 2027 by improving old machines. Moreover, 170 MGD capacity would be added by setting up 35 new small decentralised sewage treatment plants, she addedAdditionally, new plants near drains of 460 MGD capacity will be added by December 2028.""The biggest benefit of this will be that untreated sewage will no longer flow into the Yamuna. As sewage treatment capacity increases, more of the city's wastewater will be cleaned and then released into the river,"" Gupta said further.The chief minister also informed the meeting that work on laying sewer lines in unauthorised colonies and JJ clusters was being expedited.""Out of 675 JJ clusters, work has been completed in 574, while arrangements for single-point sewage collection are being made in 65 clusters. In addition, sewer network work in all 1,799 unauthorised colonies will be completed in a phased manner between December 2026 and December 2028,"" Gupta added.During the meeting, the chief minister directed the irrigation and flood control department to immediately identify suitable land to set up four bio-mining and processing plants for the scientific disposal of silt removed from roads and drains.","The Delhi government will increase its overall sewage treatment capacity to 1,500 MGD by 2028.

While the concession agreement was to be signed within three months, a delay in processes saw it signed on Tuesday.The project will create a constellation of 12 satellites, data from which will be used for applications ranging from climate change monitoring and disaster response to agriculture, infrastructure planning, maritime operations, and national security, where there are huge gaps so far as having eyes in the sky is concerned.The consortium will implement the project through Allied Orbits. “As part of the project, PierSight will build synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites, Pixxel will build hyperspectral & high resolution optical satellite, Satsure will make multispectral satellites, and Dhruva will develop ground stations,” Gaurav Seth, PierSight CEO and co-founder, told TOI.Over the next four to five years, the consortium is expected to invest more than Rs 1,200 crore to create the 12-satellite constellation in low-Earth orbit.The project is designed to enhance India’s data sovereignty and reduce dependence on foreign imagery. All satellites will be manufactured in India, launched on Indian rockets, and controlled from ground infrastructure within the country.IN-SPACe described the programme as a paradigm shift in India’s space policy – one that places private enterprise at the heart of building national capability. In addition to meeting India’s own needs, the consortium is expected to be allowed to sell analysis-ready data and value-added services commercially.","The agreement was between IN-SPACe and Allied Orbits — the special purpose vehicle (SPV) created by the consortium of Pixxel Space, Piersight Space, Satsure Analytics India, and Dhruva Space.

"Draft NEP 2026 proposes indexed power tariffs, curbs cross-subsidies",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/draft-nep-2026-proposes-indexed-power-tariffs-curbs-cross-subsidies/articleshow/126954708.cms,"'Stanford Ranks Us Third': Ashwini Vaishnaw Fires Back At IMF For Callinf India Second Tier In AI

New Delhi: The ministry of power on Wednesday released the draft National Electricity Policy (NEP) 2026, proposing automatic annual tariff revisions linked to a suitable index if state regulators fail to issue tariff orders, exemption of cross-subsidies for the manufacturing sector and railways, renewable energy capacity addition through market-based mechanisms and captive power plants, and a strong regulatory framework to prevent collusion, gaming and market dominance.Inviting stakeholder feedback, the ministry said the proposed policy aims to transform the power sector in line with the government’s vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047. Once finalised, the policy will replace the existing NEP notified in 2005.According to the ministry, the first National Electricity Policy, issued in February 2005, addressed core challenges such as demand-supply gaps, limited electricity access and inadequate infrastructure. Since then, the sector has seen transformational change, with installed generation capacity rising fourfold alongside significant private sector participation. Universal electrification was achieved by March 2021, a unified national grid became operational in December 2013, and per capita electricity consumption rose to 1,460 kWh in 2024–25. Power markets and exchanges have also enhanced flexibility and efficiency in power procurement, the ministry said.“Despite these achievements, persistent challenges remain, particularly in the distribution segment, including high accumulated losses and outstanding debt. Tariffs in several segments remain non-cost-reflective, and high cross-subsidisation has resulted in elevated industrial tariffs, adversely impacting the global competitiveness of Indian industry,” the ministry said in a statement.The draft NEP 2026 sets ambitious targets, aiming to raise per capita electricity consumption to 2,000 kWh by 2030 and over 4,000 kWh by 2047. It also aligns with India’s climate commitments, including a 45% reduction in emissions intensity from 2005 levels by 2030 and the goal of net-zero emissions by 2070, necessitating a decisive shift towards low-carbon energy pathways.The policy proposes a comprehensive overhaul of planning and finances. Distribution companies (DISCOMs) and State Load Despatch Centres (SLDCs) will prepare advance Resource Adequacy plans at utility and state levels, while the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) will draw up a national plan to ensure capacity adequacy. On the financial front, tariffs are proposed to be indexed for automatic annual revision, with greater recovery of fixed costs through demand charges to reduce cross-subsidies across consumer categories. Manufacturing units, railways and metro railways may be exempted from cross-subsidies and surcharges to boost competitiveness and lower logistics costs, while consumers with contracted loads of 1 MW and above could be exempted from the universal service obligation. The policy also calls for stronger dispute resolution mechanisms, tighter market monitoring, measures to bring AT&C losses down to single digits, shared distribution networks, creation of a Distribution System Operator, and improved grid operations through functional unbundling of state utilities and alignment of state grid codes with national standards.On generation and infrastructure, the policy emphasises rapid expansion of renewable energy through market-based routes, captive plants and large-scale deployment of storage. DISCOMs may install storage for small consumers to achieve economies of scale, while bulk consumers install their own, with provisions for peer-to-peer trading of surplus power and storage. Renewable and conventional power are to be treated at par in scheduling and deviations by 2030. The roadmap also supports market-based deployment of battery and pumped storage, domestic manufacturing of storage components and incentives such as viability gap funding. Thermal plants will be supported through storage integration and repurposing of older units for grid support, with exploration of direct steam utilisation for district cooling and industrial processes. Nuclear generation will focus on advanced and modular reactors, including small reactors for commercial and industrial use, to reach 100 GW by 2047, while hydro development will prioritise storage-based projects for flood control, irrigation and energy security. Transmission reforms include adoption of advanced technologies, compensation to address right-of-way issues, parity in transmission tariffs for renewables by 2030, and utilisation-based allocation of connectivity. The policy also mandates a robust cybersecurity framework, domestic storage of power sector data, structured data sharing with real-time visibility of distributed energy resources, and a transition to indigenously developed SCADA systems and domestic software for critical applications by 2030.","The draft NEP 2026 sets ambitious targets, aiming to raise per capita electricity consumption to 2,000 kWh by 2030.

Centre revises norms to address land value disputes in transmission line projects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-revises-norms-to-address-land-value-disputes-in-transmission-line-projects/articleshow/126953598.cms,"NEW DELHI: Addressing concerns of landowners that their properties were valued at circle rates—significantly lower than prevailing market prices—while calculating compensation for the right of way (RoW) required for laying transmission lines, the Union ministry of power has approved the engagement of land valuers to arrive at an agreeable amount.According to officials, the power ministry has amended its March 2025 guidelines, which had proposed the formation of a Market Rate Committee (MRC) in states lacking a mechanism to determine land values for interstate transmission projects. Under the revised norms, the MRC will engage three land valuers—one each nominated by the affected landowners, the transmission service provider and the district magistrate—who must submit their reports within 21 days.Of the three, two reports will be selected through a lottery system for evaluation and for determining the reference market rate. Officials said that if the difference between the two selected valuations is less than 20% of the lower value, their average will be taken as the benchmark. If the difference exceeds 20%, the reference rate may be fixed at 10% above the lower valuation.If either the landowners or the transmission service provider rejects the proposed amount, the third valuation will be considered, and the reference rate will be set as the average of the two lowest estimates.“The MRC will determine the final compensation based on the reference market rate arrived at after the valuation. The cost of the professional fee paid to the valuers will be included in the RoW compensation,” an official said.","The Union ministry of power has approved the engagement of land valuers to arrive at an agreeable amount.

PM Modi Flags Off India’s First Vande Bharat Sleeper Train Between Howrah-Guwahati In Bengal

NEW DELHI: Indian Railways ’ first Vande Bharat sleeper train attracted widespread attention for its modern features and promise of faster overnight travel. However, Indian tourists were quick to prove a lack of civic sense, as a video showing litter on the newly inaugurated train emerged.The high-tech Vande Bharat Sleeper, connecting Howrah and Guwahati, was flagged off on Saturday. A passenger-recorded video from Malda shows plastic packets and spoons scattered across one of the coaches.Sharing the video, X handle @Indianinfoguide wrote, “People litter on vande bharat Sleeper train within hours of its inaugural run. Just see the civic sense.”Several social media users criticised the commuters for their behaviour. One commented, “honestly, this was an expected behaviour from the citizens of India.”Another added, “India doesn’t need enemies. We sabotage ourselves just fine. From breaking rules to trashing infrastructure, from apathy to entitlement, we do more damage internally than any external force could. The real national security threat isn’t always at the border. It’s our collective indifference to the country we live in.”Some users were more casual, with one writing, “Expected !! What’s new here…Wait for orange gutka stamps.”According to the Ministry of Railways, the first commercial run of the Vande Bharat Sleeper between Kamakhya and Howrah saw all tickets sell out within hours of bookings opening.The train’s launch followed the flagging off of India’s first Vande Bharat Sleeper by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Malda town in West Bengal on January 17. The service aims to make long-distance overnight travel faster and more comfortable while improving connectivity between eastern India and the Northeast.The semi-high-speed, fully air-conditioned train will operate six days a week, except Wednesdays from Kamakhya and Thursdays from Howrah. It will complete the Howrah–Kamakhya journey in about 14 hours, making it the fastest train on the route. Key stops include Malda Town, New Jalpaiguri, New Cooch Behar, and New Alipurduar.The service is expected to significantly benefit passengers travelling between West Bengal and Assam, particularly those undertaking overnight journeys.","The high-tech Vande Bharat Sleeper, connecting Howrah and Guwahati, was flagged off on Saturday.

This is the third time in the last three months that ED has written to the state govt pointing out alleged corruption in municipal administration and made corruption charges against Nehru.The probe agency mentioned that in its earlier letter written to govt on Oct 27 last year, it had brought to its notice the alleged malpractices in the exams and selection process for officers and staff (2024-25, 2025-26) of MAWS dept of Tamil Nadu.Its note had provided purported “evidence of bribes of Rs 25 lakh to Rs 35 lakh being collected from each candidate” and shared details of 150 such candidates, which were seized from a close associate of KN Nehru. Based on this, the agency had sought a probe regarding the appointment of 2,500 candidates.ED had written to the state govt again on Dec 3, alleging “manipulation and corruption” in govt contracts in MAWS dept.It provided additional evidence of purported tender rigging and bribery amounting to 7-15% of contract values.“The present note (letter) deals with evidence relating to corruption in transfer of govt officers/engineers of MAWS by KN Nehru and his associates,” ED is believed to have pointed out.This report, the letter said, also provides direct evidence of money laundering of Rs 365.87 crore by the minister and his family and close associates through various means. The minister had earlier denied all the allegations and termed ED’s actions as being politically motivated.Sources said the agency pointed out in its letter that the bribes were utilised for luxurious lifestyle, creation of personal assets, political expenditure, etc. by its beneficiaries. The proceeds of crime were laundered through the hawala network, both within and outside the country, to keep the identity of ultimate beneficiaries a secret and leave no money trail.The agency claimed that it had seized the evidence during searches at several premises of relatives and associates of KN Nehru across Chennai, Trichy and Coimbatore in April 2025 in connection with its investigation into a bank fraud case based on an FIR registered by CBI-ACB, Chennai.The predicate offence, i.e. the case registered by the CBI-ACB, eventually collapsed after the accused settled their loan which was outstanding with the bank.",ED has written a letter to the Tamil Nadu govt asking it to register an FIR against municipal administration and water supply (MAWS) minister KN Nehru.

Silver prices surged to a record high on Monday, crossing the Rs 3 lakh-per-kg mark in futures trade for the first time. Gold also rebounded sharply, recovering from last week’s losses.On the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), silver futures jumped Rs 13,553, or 4.71%, to a record Rs 3,01,315 per kg. Gold futures rose nearly Rs 3,000, or over 2%, to hit a fresh all-time high of Rs 1,45,500 per 10 grams.The rally in precious metals followed renewed geopolitical concerns after US President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on several European countries over Greenland.In response, the European Union is preparing retaliatory tariffs worth €93 billion, as reported by ET, citing a Financial Times report. The renewed tensions revived demand for safe-haven assets after easing US-Iran frictions last week had briefly reduced investor interest in gold and silver.Global prices also touched record levels. Spot gold rose 1.7% to $4,673 an ounce, while silver climbed around 3% to about $94 per troy ounce, marking fresh highs in international markets. Silver futures in the overseas market jumped more than 6% to a record $94.35 per ounce.Analysts said that silver has been outperforming gold in recent sessions, supported by strong industrial demand and favourable global trends. Some also pointed to currency movements as an additional factor. The dollar index rose for a third straight week, ending at 99.20, while the USD-INR January 28 futures contract closed higher at 90.8325 on the NSE.Gold, which does not offer interest income, typically benefits when interest rates are low. However, expectations that rate cuts may be delayed have raised the opportunity cost of holding the metal. Despite this, heightened geopolitical risks have continued to support prices.Market participants said precious metals could remain volatile in the near term, with prices driven by developments on the geopolitical front, currency movements and shifts in investor risk appetite.","Silver prices surged to a record high on Monday, crossing the Rs 3 lakh-per-kg mark in futures trade for the first time.

Retail participation was also strong.Market participants had widely expected a strong listing, supported by high grey market premiums and the company’s strategic role in India’s steel value chain.Analysts said that the debut reflected confidence in Bharat Coking Coal’s dominant position in the domestic coking coal segment.Gaurav Garg, research analyst at Lemon Markets Desk, said the response to the issue highlighted investor belief in the company’s long-term prospects.“The strong response to the Bharat Coking Coal IPO underscores investor confidence in the company’s monopolistic position in India’s coking coal segment and its long-term demand visibility,” he said.Garg added that the anchor book provided early validation, while heavy non-institutional participation signalled expectations of listing gains.Bharat Coking Coal is India’s largest producer of coking coal and the only significant domestic supplier of prime coking coal, a key raw material for steel production.Incorporated in 1972, the company operates 34 mines across the Jharia coalfields in Jharkhand and the Raniganj coalfields in West Bengal, comprising both underground and opencast operations. Its key customers include steel producers and power companies.As of April 2024, the company’s estimated coking coal reserves stood at about 7.91 billion tonnes, accounting for nearly 21.5% of India’s total coking coal resources. In FY25, Bharat Coking Coal produced around 58.5% of the country’s domestic coking coal output.The company has steadily ramped up production in recent years. Coal output increased from 30.5 million tonnes in FY22 to about 40.5 million tonnes in FY25, supported by mine expansions, the reopening of discontinued underground mines and efficiency improvements at coal washeries.On the financial front, Bharat Coking Coal reported revenue of Rs 14,401–14,402 crore and a profit after tax of Rs 1,240 crore in FY25. While earnings have seen some volatility due to fluctuations in coal prices and costs, the company remains debt-free and cash-generative. As of September 2025, it had total assets of Rs 18,711 crore and a net worth of Rs 5,831 crore.Following the listing, Coal India’s shareholding in Bharat Coking Coal has reduced to about 90% from 100%, improving the public float while retaining government control.As a wholly owned subsidiary earlier, BCCL has benefited from Coal India’s technical expertise, financial strength and operational scale.Analysts see the stock as a long-term play linked to India’s infrastructure push and growth in steel demand, though they caution that near-term performance will depend on broader market conditions and trends in coal pricing.“The scarcity value of a pure-play coking coal producer and steady demand from the steel sector support favourable secondary market sentiment,” Garg said. He added that investors should track earnings consistency over time.","Shares of Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) made a strong debut on the stock exchanges on Monday. The company’s Rs 1,071 crore initial public offering drew overwhelming investor demand. The stock listed at Rs 45 on the NSE, a premium of 95.6% over the issue price of Rs 23.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126670509,imgsize-121210,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Gold price prediction today:

may continue to scale fresh peaks in the coming days on ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, says Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

He shares his views and recommendations for gold investors and key levels to watch out for in the near term:

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Gold and Silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs, as intensifying geopolitical risks and shifting US monetary expectations fuelled strong safe-haven demand through the week. Escalating unrest in Iran, where over 500 people were reportedly killed, renewed US threats of military action and tariffs on countries trading with Iran, and the arrest of Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro injected both short- and long-term uncertainty into global markets, supporting central bank buying and investor inflows into precious metals. With this President Trump has also levied tariffs on major EU nations with a threat to increase the same after June 1st if the deal to buy Greenland does not go through.Gold prices marked a low of around ₹141,000 and reversed sharply from there, as mentioned previously till prices are sustaining above ₹138,000 momentum for prices will remain on higher side. On lower end, immediate support remains at ₹143,000 and ₹140,000.Bollinger bands which were flat have expanded with prices on the higher side showcasing a positive run through expectations. This surge is more convincing as prices are rising along with a surge in volumes showing the buyers strength. The target of ₹145,000 is achieved, however any closing above the same could take the prices higher towards ₹148,000 and ₹152,000 from a medium to long term perspective.Despite a relatively firm dollar, Gold and Silver continued to mark record highs as geopolitical tensions, weak economic data, policy uncertainty, and easing inflation sustained safe-haven appeal. Focus this week will be on US inflation, GDP and speech from President Trump which could keep the volatility along with updates on uncertainties mentioned above.","Gold and Silver prices continue to surge higher marking record highs.

Budget 2026 for taxpayers: Five fixes that can make taxes less taxing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-for-taxpayers-five-fixes-that-can-make-taxes-less-taxing-explained/articleshow/126666769.cms,"The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe.

By Nishant Khemani

One return, one choice

Cut the sting in foreign remittance TCS

NPS withdrawals: clarity needed on taxability

Level the NPS field under the new regime

Time for

joint tax returns

(Nishant Khemani is a chartered accountant and Managing Partner of the Saturn Consulting Group)

Every Union Budget comes with its share of grand announcements, but for ordinary taxpayers, the real test lies in the fine print. As Budget 2026 approaches, expectations are modest yet meaningful: simplify compliance, nudge long-term savings, and stop treating convenience as a luxury. Here are five changes that could make the tax system smarter, softer and more sensible.The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers. Instead, it has spawned a parallel paperwork universe. Form 10-IE, required to opt in or out of the new regime, is a classic case of procedural overkill. Many taxpayers either forget to file it or file it incorrectly, losing out on the more beneficial regime. The fix is simple: embed the option directly into the ITR. A single return, a clear choice, no extra forms. Ease of doing business should also mean ease of filing taxes, especially for salaried individuals who neither game the system nor enjoy paperwork.A 20% TCS on foreign remittances under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme was introduced to plug tax leakages. The intent is understandable, but the dosage is excessive.For genuine remittances for family support the high TCS blocks liquidity and creates avoidable stress. A more balanced approach would be to reduce TCS to 10%, or introduce a slab system: lower rates up to, say, ₹50 lakh, and higher rates thereafter. Compliance should be encouraged, not coerced.Recent changes to NPS withdrawal rules are a welcome step. Subscribers can now withdraw up to 100% of the corpus if it is within ₹8 lakh, and 80% if it exceeds that limit. This adds flexibility and makes NPS more attractive.But there’s a catch—or rather, a question mark. Till now, only 60% of the corpus was tax-free on maturity. How will the additional 20% be taxed? The Budget should clarify this and remove the ambiguity. Ideally, the extra withdrawal should also be tax-free, reinforcing NPS as a credible retirement pillar rather than a tax puzzle.Under the new tax regime, deductions are scarce, making Section 80CCD(2), the employer contribution to NPS, a rare oasis. However, the additional ₹50,000 deduction under Section 80CCD(1b) is still unavailable in the new regime. Extending this deduction, and enhancing it to ₹1 lakh under the new regime, would send a strong signal. Global evidence is clear: tax incentives drive long-term savings. A stronger NPS today means lower old-age dependency and reduced fiscal pressure tomorrow.India’s tax system still treats married couples as financial strangers. Introducing joint tax returns, with a higher exemption threshold for married couples, would recognise modern household economics—especially double-income families. Such a move would put more disposable income in the hands of families, improve tax equity and align India with global best practices. After all, if households plan together, why shouldn’t they file together?In sum, Budget 2026 doesn’t need fireworks. It needs fine-tuning. Fewer forms, fairer taxes, clearer rules, and smarter incentives could go a long way in making taxation less intimidating—and more humane.","The new versus old tax regime choice was meant to empower taxpayers.

Canada PM's speech rocks Davos: Trump in crosshairs; big 'unite' message for India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-pm-mark-carneys-speech-rocks-davos-trump-in-crosshairs-big-unite-message-for-india-greenland-denmark/articleshow/126975092.cms,"‘Rules No Longer Protect': Canada's Carney Blasts Trump Tariffs Over Greenland | FULL SPEECH





Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Wednesday delivered a hard-hitting speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, taking aim at President Donald Trump’s approach to global politics while calling on ""middle powers"", including India, to unite as the existing world order weakens.Speaking at the forum, Carney warned that the US-led system which has underpinned global politics and trade for decades is no longer merely evolving but breaking apart. “We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,” he told an audience of political leaders, financiers and corporate executives, drawing a rare standing ovation.According to a government official who spoke to the New York Times on condition of anonymity, Carney wrote the speech himself—a notable departure from the usual practice, in which speeches of this scale are typically drafted by senior staff with input from the leader.During the speech, Carney who as worked as the governor of Canada and England's central banks, argued that the “rules-based international order” is fading, replaced by an era in which “the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must”, a direct nod to the growing use of tariffs, supply chains and financial systems as tools of coercion. “Call it what it is: a system of intensifying great power rivalry where the most powerful pursue their interests using economic integration as coercion,” he said.Without naming Trump, the Canadian leader’s message landed amid rising tensions triggered by the US president’s threats to impose sweeping tariffs on allies and his renewed push to wrest control of Greenland from Denmark. Trump has also previously referred to Canada as the “51st state” and imposed tariffs that have hit key Canadian sectors such as steel, aluminium, autos and lumber.Carney cautioned against appeasement, warning that smaller and mid-sized nations can no longer assume that compliance will bring protection. “There is a strong tendency for countries to go along to get along… to hope that compliance will buy safety. It won’t,” he said. “The middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, we’re on the menu.”He acknowledged that Canada had benefited from American dominance in the past, crediting “American hegemony” with providing “open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security, and support for frameworks for resolving disputes”. But he said that bargain no longer works in a world where integration itself has become a vulnerability.Carney’s speech was also a rebuke to transactional diplomacy and one-on-one bargaining with major powers. “Great powers can afford for now to go it alone… Middle powers do not,” he said, warning that bilateral negotiations with hegemons often amount to “the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination”.Instead, he laid out a strategy of collective resilience, calling for “different coalitions for different issues based on common values and interests”. That approach, he said, would apply to defence, trade, critical minerals, technology and climate policy.India featured prominently in this vision. Carney confirmed that Canada is negotiating a free trade pact with India as part of a broader effort to diversify away from overwhelming dependence on the United States. He also cited negotiations with ASEAN countries, Mercosur, Thailand and the Philippines.""The past few days we've concluded new strategic partnerships with China and Qatar. We're negotiating free trade pacts with India, ASEAN, Thailand, Philippines and Mercosur. We're doing something else to help solve global problems. We're pursuing variable geometry, in other words, different coalitions for different issues based on common values and interests,"" the Canadian PM said.On security, Carney reaffirmed Canada’s support for Greenland and Denmark, declaring: “Canada stands firmly with Greenland and Denmark and fully supports their unique right to determine Greenland’s future.” He added that Ottawa’s commitment to Nato’s Article Five was “unwavering”, even as Trump has threatened tariffs against European allies backing Denmark.","Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered a hard-hitting speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Coin and bar purchases have strengthened as people look to gold as a hedge against broader market risks and currency fluctuations, a common pattern when global volatility intensifies. For tourists and non-resident buyers, the UAE traditionally offers competitive gold pricing compared with some overseas markets, owing to tax-free status and strong quality standards. This factor continues to attract cross-border buyers despite elevated price levels.

Gold continues its striking run in early 2026 and on January 20 in the UAE, prices hit fresh highs, reflecting an intensifying global rally in precious metals influenced by geopolitical uncertainty, safe-haven demand and market sentiment. Local retail rates in Dubai and across the Emirates rose sharply alongside world bullion benchmarks, illustrating how international financial trends are directly shaping prices at the UAE’s jewellery souks and retail counters.According to updated market tables, 24-carat gold in the UAE climbed steadily through the day, hitting approximately AED 573.75 per gram by evening on January 20, up from about AED 562.85 the day before. Likewise, 22-carat gold moved higher, with evening pricing near AED 525.94 per gram. Silver and other precious metals also showed gains.This continued climb came as global spot gold set fresh record levels above USD 4,700 per ounce, driven by surging safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions, notably tariff-related market fears between major economic blocs and persistent macroeconomic uncertainty. Gold futures and spot prices hit unprecedented highs on January 20, with spot gold reaching over $4,737 per ounce and investors seeking security amid volatility.Market analysts point to a constellation of global pressures that have bolstered gold’s appeal, including -Locally, Dubai’s gold market has mirrored these global trends, with gold prices jumping by around Dh45 in 20 days in January, crossing Dh565 per gram before pushing into the Dh570+ range on January 20.Analysts noted that the rally in Dubai is not based on a single spike but a persistent ascent in demand and pricing that has reshaped consumer behaviour and investment strategies across the Emirate’s souks.The impact of rising gold prices is visible among both retail buyers and investors:Dubai is not alone in this dynamic. Markets in India, another major gold hub, recorded significant gains as well, with gold prices reaching historic highs with strong upward momentum on January 20.24K gold in India hit roughly ₹149,680 per 10 grams, reflecting a notable rise tied to the same global safe-haven pressures that are influencing UAE pricing.Across Gulf markets, gold continues to reflect regional interconnectedness with global financial trends, with Dubai serving as a key reference point for prices in neighbouring Saudi Arabia , Qatar, Kuwait and other GCC states. The sustained gold rally presents both opportunities and challenges:Gold’s strong performance hints at wider market sentiment, with traders pricing in continued geopolitical risk and financial market caution. The dynamics seen in the UAE gold market align with global trends in bullion markets, where prices have repeatedly hit all-time highs.Analysts will be watching several key drivers through the rest of the first quarter. Global political developments like any escalation or resolution in high-profile tensions will sway safe-haven demand. Currency markets or shifts in the US dollar and other major currencies can influence gold’s price attractiveness. Interest rate expectations and central bank policy moves remain a critical catalyst for precious metal pricing.With gold already setting new thresholds in early 2026, continued volatility will likely keep both shoppers and investors engaged. Whether prices stabilise, retreat or climb further will hinge on macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions in the coming weeks and months.","Gold futures and spot gold hit unprecedented highs on January 20 in the UAE.

UAE plans 95-day paid maternity leave for government jobs — is private sector next?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-plans-95-day-paid-maternity-leave-for-government-jobs-is-private-sector-next/articleshow/126973178.cms,"UAE to extend paid maternity leave to 95 days under new proposals / AI Generated Image

The ""why"" behind





UAE authorities are moving to extend paid maternity leave for government sector employees to 95 days, following discussions in the Federal National Council (FNC) aimed at strengthening family-friendly workplace policies. The proposal was raised during a session reviewing the performance of the Ministry of Community Development, with lawmakers calling for longer leave, flexible work options and stronger protections for women.The move comes as part of wider social reforms focused on family stability and employee wellbeing. While the extension is expected to apply first to federal government entities, officials confirmed that no decision has yet been taken on the private sector. Any expansion beyond government roles would require amendments to the UAE Labour Law, which currently governs private-sector maternity leave.In a recent session of the Federal National Council (FNC), UAE lawmakers called for a significant expansion of paid maternity leave beyond current entitlements, aiming to better support working women and families.Currently, under the UAE Labour Law, female employees are entitled to 60 days of maternity leave, with the first 45 days fully paid and the next 15 days at half pay, plus additional unpaid leave for medical needs.But lawmakers argue this falls behind evolving workplace needs and global standards. They proposed increasing paid maternity leave to 98 days, a change that would align more closely with modern expectations for work-life balance and family care.This proposal reflects wider trends in the UAE. For example, in Abu Dhabi, Emirati women in the private sector have already gained up to 90 days of paid maternity leave under a voluntary programme that supplements salary support during this period.Supporters say longer leave supports mother-child bonding, better health outcomes and gives women greater confidence to return to work after childbirth.Alongside leave extensions, lawmakers urged federal authorities to formalise flexible and remote work policies in both public and private sectors for key groups.These include:Parliament members want jobs to be officially classified by whether they are suitable for flexible or remote work, and for set timelines to approve such requests, especially for mothers returning from leave.Proponents argue flexible arrangements help women stay employed, reduce stress, and build more inclusive workplaces, particularly for families juggling childcare and elder care.In the same discussion, lawmakers emphasised the importance of strengthening protections against domestic abuse.The UAE introduced Federal Law No. 13 of 2024 on Domestic Violence, replacing earlier legislation and broadening the scope of what constitutes abuse.Under the new law:Lawmakers said these protections must be paired with better support systems for victims, including counselling, shelters and easier access to legal help, to make the law truly effective.The push for expanded maternity leave and stronger abuse protections reflects a broader focus on family stability, women’s rights and workplace fairness in the UAE’s evolving legal landscape.At this stage, the proposed extension of paid maternity leave to 95 days is focused on the government sector, as discussed by lawmakers during the Federal National Council session. The proposal is aimed at improving work-life balance for women employed in federal and government entities, where leave policies are set directly by the state.For the private sector, no official decision has been announced yet. Private-sector maternity leave continues to be governed by the UAE Labour Law, which currently provides 60 days of maternity leave 45 days with full pay and 15 days with half pay, with additional unpaid leave in specific medical cases.These discussions aren't just about rules; they are about building a ""future-ready"" society. Lawmakers highlighted that when mothers feel supported by 90 days of paid leave, productivity actually rises because they return to work more focused and physically recovered. Similarly, a stronger domestic abuse law acts as a deterrent, keeping families intact and protecting the mental health of the next generation.By addressing these two issues simultaneously, the FNC is signaling that the UAE’s 2026 agenda is focused on human capital. Whether it's the right to a safe home or the right to care for a new baby, the proposed changes aim to make the UAE one of the most family-friendly places to live and work globally.","UAE authorities are moving to extend paid maternity leave for government sector employees to 95 days, following discussions in the Federal National Council.

IAS officer shunted over dog-walking row returns: Sanjeev Khirwar appointed Delhi MCD commissioner; focus on roads and strays,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/ias-officer-shunted-over-dog-walking-row-returns-sanjeev-khirwar-appointed-delhi-mcd-commissioner-focus-on-roads-and-strays/articleshow/127089141.cms,"Also read |







NEW DELHI: Sanjeev Khirwar, a 1994-batch IAS officer, was appointed as the new municipal commissioner of Delhi, more than three years after he was shifted out of the capital following a dog-walking row. He is likely to take charge on Thursday.Khirwar was moved out of Delhi in 2022 after he was embroiled in a controversy over walking his dog at the Thyagaraj Stadium.Athletes and coaches training at Thyagraj Stadium in Delhi had alleged that they were asked to wrap up training earlier than usual, by 7pm, as Khirwar and his wife, Rinku Dugga, also a 1994 batch IAS officer, had to walk their dog there. Khirwar was Delhi's principal secretary (revenue) at that time.Then Thyagraj administrator Ajit Chaudhary had refuted the allegations and said the official time for athletes to train was till 7pm and coaches and athletes would leave after that. Khirwar, too, had denied the allegations, terming them ""absolutely incorrect."" However, athletes claimed they usually used to train until 8.30pm, but were forced to wrap up their training by 7pm, disrupting their routines. He was subsequently transferred to Ladakh.In Ladakh Khirwar served as principal secretary handling key departments, including health and medical education. He was transferred back to a post in Delhi earlier this month from Ladakh as part of a major revamp of AGMUT-cadre IAS and IPS officers. Khirwar will succeed Ashwani Kumar, a 1992-batch IAS officer of the AGMUT cadre, who was transferred to J&K earlier this month.Khirwar previously served as private secretary to the Union minister for women and child development between 2009 and 2014.His wife Rinku Dugga, too, was transferred in 2022 to Arunachal Pradesh, where she served as principal secretary of the indigenous affairs department. She was given compulsory retirement in Sept 2023.","Sanjeev Khirwar, a 1994-batch IAS officer, was appointed as the new municipal commissioner of Delhi. He is likely to take charge on Thursday.

Explained: China's population is not falling; it's collapsing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/explained-chinas-population-is-not-falling-its-collapsing/articleshow/126970791.cms,"China’s Condom Tax Shocks the World Amid Birthrate Drop as India Surges Ahead in Population Rankings

What the latest numbers show

How China went from controlling births to desperately promoting them

Gender imbalances from a cultural preference for sons

Generations of “only children” with no siblings and fewer cousins

Rapid ageing, as births slowed and life expectancy increased

A shrinking workforce, particularly in urban centres

Why Chinese families aren’t having more children?

1. Economic Pressures

2. Shifting Social Norms

3. Lingering Policy Legacies

4. Cultural Timing Factors

Beijing’s response: Subsidies, tax tweaks and social engineering

Cash subsidies: e.g., 3,600 yuan (≈$500) per child in certain regions

Tax changes: condoms are now taxed at 13% after losing VAT exemption

Tax exemptions: for kindergartens, daycare centres, and matchmakers

Propaganda campaigns: promoting “positive views” on marriage and childbearing

Five-year plan targets: calling for reduced child-rearing costs and expanded support

The economic consequences: Getting old before getting rich

1. Slower Economic Growth

2. Pension and Healthcare Strains

3. Industrial Transition Challenges

Global implications: Demographics as strategy and status

So what comes next?

Make family life affordable

Reform pensions and welfare

Reduce pressures on working parents

Encourage marriage and childbearing

Sustain economic stability





China has had population control policies, which are now resulting in a declining population rate. To tackle that, it has now come up with some out-of-the-box ideas.From taxing condoms to proposing a dating course in the curriculum, the ideas seem bizarre. However, for a nation trying to cope with population decline after limiting families to just one, China is doing it all.New government data released this week shows that China recorded its lowest birth rate since 1949 communist revolution, the year Mao Zedong established the People’s Republic. The country’s total population fell for the fourth straight year, dropping to 1.404 billion in 2025, about three million fewer than the year before, reports by news agency AP cited government data.The workforce is shrinking, pension bills are rising, and Beijing is scrambling to reverse a trend that it spent years embedding in the structure.China logged a birth rate of 5.63 per 1,000 people in 2025. The number of babies born that year was recorded as 7.92 million, which fell by 17% from 2024.2024 did reflect a small uptick in births, but it dipped sooner than policymakers could claim the credit for it.China’s fertility rate, or the average number of children a woman is expected to have, reinforces the picture.While Beijing last published an official fertility rate of 1.3 in 2020, independent estimates place it closer to 1 today, far below the 2.1 needed to maintain population size.For comparison, South Korea’s fertility rate is roughly 0.7, Japan’s is around 1.26, and the United States’ is roughly 1.6.The consequence? Retirees overpower the younger population.For centuries, population size was viewed as a strategic asset in China. Mao famously declared in 1957 that the nation’s 600 million people were its greatest strength, even as he warned about the difficulty of feeding them.But by the late 1970s, after years of famines and economic turmoil, Chinese leaders saw population growth as a threat to the country’s modernisation goals.In 1980, four years after Mao’s death, Beijing introduced the one-child policy, a sweeping population control measure that limited most urban couples to one child. The policy remained at affect for 3.5 decades leaving deeper demographic marks:The policy then welcomed two children by 2015 and three children by the year 2021.The end of the one-child policy didn’t spark a baby boom. Instead, it collided with a society that had grown more urban, educated and economically cautious.Several factors now weigh on prospective parents:The cost of raising children in urban China from housing, education, healthcare to extracurriculars soared. With the economy slowing and youth unemployment high, many households simply feel they cannot afford multiple children.Marriage rates are falling, and many young Chinese, especially women began opting to delay or skip marriage and childbirth. Work pressures, competitive schooling and long commutes leave little space for large families.Families that grew up under the one-child policy internalised small-family norms. Parenting styles also shifted toward heavy investment in a single child, sometimes called the “little emperor” phenomenon.The Chinese zodiac bases its calendar by assigning an animal to each lunar year. In 2025, births were further tempered by the Year of the Snake, considered less auspicious for childbirth.With young families reluctant to expand, the Chinese state has turned to financial and behavioural incentives.Recent measures include:China definitely walked the extra mile to make childbirth cheaper and instilling it in the social structure. But subsidies hardly compensate for the to real costs, and experts say the changes do not address structural challenges.Why exactly is China pushing the population increase?Statistics show China is ageing fast. The country now has 323 million people aged over 60, about 23% of its population, and that share is rising.Economists warn that the workforce is shrinking while the number of dependents grows.This shift raises several risks:China reported 5 per cent annual economic growth in 2025. However, many analysts expect that to slow down. With tightening labour supply, productivity gains goes on to taper.More retirees mean pressure on state pensions and healthcare systems. Economists say China will eventually need to reform its pension system and broaden its tax base to cope with the higher government expenditure.Beijing is trying to move from labour-intensive factories to high-tech manufacturing. But, in the consumer-driven economy, the high-tech automation cannot fully replace human workers in the short term.The worry is encapsulated in a phrase common among scholars: China is “getting old before it gets rich.”Population size has long been a tool of Chinese statecraft. Under Xi Jinping , it is again framed as an element of national power. The nation built a “great wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion people.”That framing has gained geopolitical relevance since India surpassed China in population in 2023. The two Asian rivals compete for leadership positions in the Global South, and demographic heft influences markets, diplomacy and military planning.A shrinking population may not immediately diminish China’s influence, but it complicates long-term projections about innovation, consumption, and defence.China faces a demographic conundrum that has no easy fix. Similar problems have appeared in Japan and South Korea, but China’s scale makes the challenge unprecedented.Ultimately, reversing the decline depends on whether the state can:But demographers warn that once fertility rates fall below a certain threshold, they rarely rebound. Amid the shift, aggressive state interventions pose next to no avail either.For a country whose leaders once tried to limit births at all costs, Beijing now finds itself asking a new and unexpected question: How do you persuade people to have more children in a society that has grown used to having fewer?","China recorded its lowest birth rate since 1949 communist revolution, the year Mao Zedong established the People’s Republic.

India has a river that flows backwards: Know which river it is,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/travel/india-has-a-river-that-flows-backwards-know-which-river-it-is/articleshow/126525975.cms,"The Narmada river flows in the opposite direction and here’s why

The origin of the Narmada River

The reason why the Narmada flow westwards

What landscapes does the river support

Dams and projects that lie on the river

Natural sites found along the Narmada

Narmada and its importance for faith and culture





India’s river systems are usually described as following a clear pattern. Most major rivers rise in the Himalayas or the central highlands and travel eastward to the Bay of Bengal, a rule taught early in geography lessons and seldom challenged. Yet one notable river defies this logic. Flowing westward across the subcontinent, it reshapes landscapes, livelihoods, and belief systems along its course. Far from obscure or insignificant, this river is long, deeply revered, and extensively studied, though its direction often surprises first-time learners. The Narmada stands apart not for its size or speed alone, but because its westward journey is dictated by geology rather than convention.The Narmada is the river that flows west instead of east. It is the fifth-longest river in India, spanning around 1,310 kilometres. The Narmada River does not empty into the Bay of Bengal like the Ganga or Godavari do. It travels steadily westward from its source until it eventually reaches the Arabian Sea. The Tapi is another prominent example of the few big Indian rivers that follow this path. The idea that the Narmada runs ""backwards"" originates from the fact that the majority of the region's rivers flow in the opposite direction, eastward.The Narmada River begins near Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh. The location is forested and serves as a pilgrimage site. From here, the river begins to move westward. It runs across Madhya Pradesh, briefly crosses Maharashtra, and finally enters Gujarat. Its trip ends near Bharuch, where it enters the Arabian Sea. The river's character alters as it travels. In some areas, it cuts through hills and small valleys, but in others, it spreads out and slows. The upper stretches feel isolated, whereas the lower ones feel settled.Geology shapes the Narmada's flow direction. It flows across a rift valley caused by previous tectonic action. The valley slopes east to west. Water follows the slope. The Vindhya Range sits to the north of the basin, while the Satpura Range extends to the south. Because the river passes through this gap, it behaves differently than many others. It does not form a wide delta. Instead, it creates an estuary where it joins the sea.The Narmada basin covers varied terrain. The upper areas are hilly and forested, with fewer people living nearby. Further west, the land becomes flatter and more open. These plains are fertile. Farming depends heavily on the river here. Crops such as wheat, pulses, and cotton are common. The river also supplies drinking water. Over time, canals and reservoirs have extended its reach. Towns and cities along the river rely on it in quiet, everyday ways.Several large dams have been built along the Narmada. The Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat is the most widely known. Others include the Indira Sagar Dam and the Omkareshwar Dam in Madhya Pradesh. These projects generate electricity and supply water for farming and households. They have also changed how the river flows. Over the years, they have been linked to debates about land, displacement, and environmental impact. These discussions continue.The river is also associated with well-known natural features. Near Jabalpur, it passes between tall marble cliffs known as the Marble Rocks. Close by, there is Dhuandhar Falls that send water crashing down in a thick spray, especially during the monsoon. Although these places are not vast, they leave an impression. The river here feels contained. The sound carries. The landscape holds it in place.For numerous individuals, the Narmada signifies more than merely a river. Temples in Maheshwar, Omkareshwar, and Amarkantak attract pilgrims year-round. Some individuals undertake the Narmada Parikrama, an extensive pilgrimage along its banks. The river is regarded as a living entity. Its trajectory has remained consistent across generations. Throughout its extent, faith, establishment, and customary practices persist in expanding around it.","The Narmada is the fifth-longest river in India, spanning around 1,310 kilometres.

Blue Davos 2026: What it means and why 2026 is being called the ‘Year of Water’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/blue-davos-2026-what-it-means-and-why-2026-is-being-called-the-year-of-water/articleshow/126787725.cms,"AI-generated

What is Blue Davos and why water dominates the Davos 2026 agenda

Extreme water events are becoming more common

Long term data show rising pressure on freshwater

Flood exposure is growing alongside scarcity

Oceans are warming faster than expected

Economic stakes are drawing new attention

New approaches are beginning to surface





A theme known as ""Blue Davos"" is beginning to emerge at the World Economic Forum 's annual meeting, signifying that water-related issues are no longer marginalised in international discourse. The connections between rivers, oceans, glaciers, and groundwater as a one stressed system are receiving more attention. The food supply, commercial routes, public health, and economic stability are all under pressure, frequently simultaneously. In 2026, the UAE will host just the third UN Water Conference in nearly 50 years, raising hopes that long-standing issues may finally find political attention and financial support. The tone is more about acknowledging boundaries that are become increasingly difficult to ignore than it is about declaring crises.At Davos, water is no longer framed as a narrow development issue or a footnote to climate policy. Under the Blue Davos label, it is being treated as a core condition for economic resilience and political stability. Briefings point to disruptions across the water cycle that are appearing more often and lasting longer. Flooding, drought and pollution are touching supply chains, energy systems and cities in uneven ways.Bringing oceans and freshwater into the same discussion reflects a broader scientific view that changes in one part of the system tend to echo elsewhere, sometimes far from where they begin.Recent events have made the pattern harder to ignore. In late 2024, rivers in parts of the Amazon basin dropped to unusually low levels, while Spain dealt with its most serious flooding in decades. Similar contrasts appeared in other regions, occasionally within the same country. Water arrives suddenly and destructively in some places, while it retreats for months in others. Researchers often describe this less as a series of isolated shocks and more as a hydrological cycle that is drifting out of balance, shaped by accumulated stress rather than a single breaking point.Longer records reinforce that impression. Since 1900, the share of global land affected by dry conditions has more than doubled, according to OECD data. This expansion strains drinking water supplies and agriculture at the same time. Large lakes offer another signal. Around half of the world’s biggest lakes no longer recover easily after periods of stress. River basins show similar instability, swinging between unusually high and low flows instead of staying within familiar seasonal ranges.Flood risk has increased alongside water shortage. World Bank estimates suggest roughly 1.8 billion people face exposure to significant flooding during a one-in-100-year event, most of them in low and middle-income countries. Even shallow flooding can interrupt housing, transportation, and daily work. These impacts are often felt most severely in areas where sanitation and access to safe drinking water are already unreliable. What emerges is not a single global picture but a patchwork shaped by income, geography and infrastructure.The ocean side of the cycle is shifting as well. Ocean warming has accelerated sharply since the 1980s, bringing effects that include ice loss, rising seas and acidification. Glaciers are losing hundreds of gigatonnes of ice each year. These changes influence weather patterns and coastal economies, sometimes far inland. The scale of these links helps explain why Blue Davos treats marine and freshwater issues as parts of the same problem rather than separate tracks.Water also carries economic weight that is becoming harder to overlook. Estimates place the annual value of water ecosystems at around 58 trillion dollars. Investment, however, has not kept pace. Only a small share of global water funding comes from private sources, leaving gaps in infrastructure and resilience. Projections suggest that close to a third of global GDP could be exposed to high water stress by mid century. These figures are nudging the conversation toward risk and long term stability rather than short term fixes.Some responses are beginning to appear. Water-focused microfinance schemes have helped millions gain access to safe taps and sanitation. Industry groups are testing cooperation at the river basin level, while ocean-related innovation is attracting more investors than in the past. Funding linked to the blue economy has grown quickly over the last decade, driven partly by recognition that degradation carries financial risk. These efforts do not resolve the wider imbalance. They sit alongside uncertainty and long timelines, as attention slowly builds toward 2026.","Water is no longer framed as a narrow development issue or a footnote to climate policy.
