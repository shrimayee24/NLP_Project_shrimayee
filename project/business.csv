‘India does not become an electoral autocracy if Yuvraj cannot get power’: PM Modi to TOI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-does-not-become-an-electoral-autocracy-if-yuvraj-cannot-get-power/articleshow/109674796.cms,"In an exclusive interview with Diwakar, Akhilesh Singh and Sidhartha, PM Narendra Modi took time off from his hyperkinetic electoral campaign to speak on a range of hot-button topics. Talking after the second round of polls, a confident PM said

NDA

was well on course to cross the 400+ target, with

reaching the 370 mark — the goal his party set keeping in mind the emotions linked to the abrogation of Article 370.

TOI: What is your assessment after two rounds of polling? Are you still hopeful of crossing the 400 mark?

PM Modi

:

One of the main reasons we want to win 400 seats is to protect the rights of SCs, STs and OBCs in our country. We want a thumping majority so that the evil designs of the opposition to take away their reservation and rights, and give it to their vote bank are foiled. PM Modi on need for 400 seats

But the opposition says you are aiming for a super majority because you want to change the Constitution?

When you set 370 seats as the target for BJP and 400 for NDA, did you do so because you were concerned that complacency may set in among party cadres and even voters? You seem to have enlisted voters, setting a target for them as much as for yourself. But the optimistic ‘Abki Baar 400 Paar’ pitch and target of 370 seats for BJP also carries the risk of generating cadre complacency. Did you ever think that it might harm the party?

For me, guarantee is far more than a word. It is a very sacred expression. It is linked to my hard work and my credibility. It is anoutcome of my entire life in public service. PM Modi on Modi ki Gurantee

Rahul Gandhi

has said that it is too hubristic and BJP is headed for the ‘India Shining’ moment of 2004 when it had crashed to a shock defeat. Your comments? Unlike in 2004, when BJP pushed away allies, the party has this time enlisted new ones

The results from the South will see multiple myths broken this time. Our mind-share has already increased and you will seethat our vote share and seat share will also increase in a huge way. PM Modi on South India

How do you assess your prospects in south India? You have made a big push in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

Last time, BJP swept Karnataka but it suffered a big setback in the assembly polls. The talk is that your tally from the state will shrink. What is your assessment?

Congress’s guarantees played a big role in its victory in the assembly polls in Karnataka and Telangana. Do you think ‘Modi ki guarantee’ can trump them?

If we really want to ensure people’s growth, we just need to remove their barriers and empower them. This unleashes their entrepreneurial potential as we have seen in our country; even in tier-2, tier-3 cities which are giving rise to a lot of startups and sports stars. These reasons are why wealth redistribution, wealth tax, etc, are never successful because they never remove poverty, they just distribute it so that everyone is equally poor. PM Modi on equitable growth

Congress has accused BJP of attempting communal polarisation in Karnataka and elsewhere while BJP has charged it with appeasement. How is this playing out?

Ram Mandir is an emotive issue for the people of our country. It is a civilisational struggle of 500 years which has been resolved and prayers of generations of Indians have been answered. PM Modi on Ram Mandir

Is one nation, one poll going to be on the top of your ‘to do’ list in the third term? What about UCC? Will the Centre be an enabler or leave it to states?

We should not consider this sinister plan of Congress an idle threat — the threat is very real and stands to hurt our nation irreversibly. This is a clear example of Maoist thinking and ideology. It is saddening to see Congress and its Yuvraj carrying forward such Maoist vision which is a recipe for disaster. Our constitution protects the property of all minorities. This means that when Congress talks of redistribution, it cannot touch the properties of minorities, it cannot consider waqf properties for redistribution but it will eye the properties of all other communities. This will sow complete and irreversible communal disharmony. PM Modi on wealth redistribution

Your opponents in Karnataka and elsewhere have raised the issue of a NorthSouth divide, claiming the Centre discriminates against southern states. Do you see merit in it or is it driven by their need to fund their guarantees?

What is your worry about the current pitch for redistribution of assets? You have said the govt should not be expropriating wealth and assets of people and that a plan to do that is a reflection of the Maoist vision which has caused havoc in so many countries. Do you see this as a real threat?

Uniform Civil Code is one of the core agendas of our party. Already, BJP govts in the states are mulling over its implementation. Uttarakhand has become the first state to implement UCC. It is clear that separate laws for communities are detrimental to the healthof society. We cannot be a nation, where one community is progressing with the support of the constitutional norms, while the other community is stuck in a time warp due to appeasement. We will do everything in our capacity to make Uniform Civil Code a reality in India. PM Modi on UCC

As the size of the Indian economy grows, there are discussions about equity and inequality. You don’t seem to see wealth tax and inheritance tax as solutions.

Because the opposition is not able to get power, they start defaming India on the world stage. They spread canards about ourpeople, our democracy and our institutions. India does not become an electoral autocracy if the Yuvraj cannot automatically get power. PM Modi on Autocracy

Barring Ram Mandir, there has been no emotive issue in play this time around. You seem to be optimistic that people will consider improvements in their lives and prospects and give you a ‘positive’ vote. Cases relating to Kashi and Mathura temples are in court. Rather than wait for a lengthy legal process, can these issues be sorted out by discussions between religious leaders of both communities?

Improvement of living standards is an emotive issue which is resonating strongly in this election. A large number of people of this country are seeing for the first time that they can have a better future and achieve their dreams, which is an emotive issue for them. PM Modi on other emotive issues

In 2019, welfare schemes ranging from Ujjwala to PM Awas Yojana had reached people for the first time on a big scale. Voters endorsed the schemes and voted for BJP. This time, the schemes are not so new or unique. Will delivery of schemes still be a factor that will influence voter choice the same way?

SC has given a good closure to the issue, highlighting the importance of EVMs. Oppn always wants to drag the nation towards the era of booth capturing, which is possible only through paper ballots. PM Modi on allegations around EVMs

Sections of the opposition like INDIA consistently raised questions over the credibility of EVMs. They had alleged tampering in 2014 and, again, in 2019...

Opposition often alleges that there is threat to democracy and also that the country is moving towards being an ‘electoral autocracy’. The charge has found takers in many foreign capitals. Do you see it as a challenge?

The govt has been accused of misusing investigating agencies, particularly ED and CBI, to harass political opponents. It has also been alleged that ‘tainted’ politicians turn clean as soon as they join BJP.

One nation, one poll is going to ensure that as a nation our time, effort and resources get invested more productively towards nation-building. PM Modi on One Nation One Poll

In Delhi, we have a situation of a sitting CM being in jail. Although the law is silent on this, it is against convention. Do you see this becoming a precedent?

NDA-appointed governors have been at loggerheads with some opposition-governed state govts which have accused Raj Bhavans of interfering in their work. How would you respond to these allegations?

In the last 10 years, we have built a solid foundation for the nation’s growth to take flight. That is why I say that what you have seen till now is only a trailer. There is a lot that I want to do. PM Modi on last 10 years.

You have attempted to expand the concept of employment beyond govt jobs to selfemployment. Do you see your attempt succeeding in view of the entrenched bias for govt jobs?

Your vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’ in 2047 is still 23 years away from becoming a reality. By the time it is realised, you will be close to 95 years. Still, to your supporters and many others, you are central to that vision.

You have been credited with raising India’s global stature with a more assertive and ambitious foreign policy. Tell us about your experience of having steered India in a conflict-ridden world in which the pursuit of our national interests seemed, at least to some of our partners in the West, to be at odds with the rules of the international order?

I will not comment much as the cases are sub judice. But we are committed to develop our cultural heritage. Our manifesto speaks about the aim to boost cultural tourism across the country and develop temple spaces & cultural spaces of all religions in India as world-classdestinations for pilgrimage and tourism. The massive development taking place in our temple towns will not onlyhelp the pilgrims but also the local economy. PM Modi on Kashi and Mathura temple demand

If your assessment is proven right, you will equal Pandit Nehru’s record of scoring three straight wins. Your views on this rare feat also in view of the contrasting backgrounds you both came from.

I have done more than 70 rallies and roadshows so far, after the announcement of polls. Everywhere I have gone, I have seen an unprecedented display of love, affection and support. It is this support of the people that gives us confidence that we are on track to cross the 400 mark. The people have seen what we can deliver and we believe that the people want a better tomorrow, and they know that a vote for BJP means a vote towards development.The opposition is down and out after two phases of polling. In the first phase, it was out and after the second phase, it is out. For us, one of the main reasons we want to win 400 seats is to protect the rights of SCs, STs and OBCs in our country. We want a thumping majority so that the evil designs of the opposition to take away their reservation and rights, and give them to their vote bank are foiled.It is ironic that people who have changed the Constitution the maximum number of times are saying that we will change the Constitution. But before asking such a question, you should analyse my track record. You should study my work and actions right from the time I became CM and see if you find any such thing done by me. It is unfair to me if someone makes an allegation and you take that allegation on face value and start asking me questions on it.The party’s slogans reflect the sentiments of the people. It is the collective voice of the citizens who recognise our efforts and want to see even further change. But the genesis of this ‘Abki Baar, 400 Paar’ slogan is very interesting and emotional. Article 370 has been a very emotional issue for us, our karyakartas and the people of India. People have waited for generations for this to happen. Abrogation of Article 370 has been a driving force for our karyakartas for decades. When people saw that our govt did this, it made them very emotional and the feeling among people was that we should give 370 seats to the party which abrogated Article 370. And hence, the slogan, ‘Abki Baar, 400 Paar’ for the NDA emanated from among the people. It was an organic and a never-seen-before phenomenon where people are themselves setting a target for our victoryAs a karyakarta myself, I can attest that no complacency sets in within BJP. All top leaders of our party are constantly in the field, among the people. Our karyakartas are putting in huge efforts. In fact, in several places, you would find only BJP karyakartas at the booths. We are also seeing a large number of people who are passionate about the country taking time out to volunteer for BJP in cities as well as villages. This kind of support from society is helping us immensely. A new phenomenon that is being seen is the beneficiaries not only voting for us in large numbers, but also motivating others in their circle to do the same.The Congress party’s Yuvraj should be the last person to be talking about hubris. But it is true that now the Congress party is dependent only on shocks and surprises. Their only hope is that there will be some miracle to make them win the elections. Even their most veteran and important leaders have given up and conceded the elections. Each election is based on contemporary issues and, so, comparing them is not correct. In 2024, not only have we got new allies but we have unprecedented support of the people, which gives us the confidence of a spectacular win.The prospects are very good. It is not I who made a big push, it is, in fact, the other way round. The people of south India have made a big push to create space for BJP. Wherever you go in the South, the acceptance and affection shown by the people has been unprecedented. People in south India have seen govts of only Congress or regional parties. They have seen how these parties have perpetuated only corruption, nepotism, misgovernance, divisiveness, vote-bank politics and a very regressive approach to governance. People have also seen their hate for Indian culture and heritage. As a result of these reasons, people are fed up of Congress and regional parties.On the other hand, people have seen our governance at the Centre and have also seen the impact of our welfare schemes reaching them. They see a ray of hope in BJP and are seeing BJP as a credible alternative. BJP was the single largest party in south India in 2019 and this time it will be the single largest party by a huge margin. The results from the South will see multiple myths broken this time. Our mind-share has already increased and you will see that our vote share and seat share will also increase in a huge way.We have been hearing this talk in every election. People who are talking about our tally shrinking have shrunk to 50-odd seats themselves. People of Karnataka and BJP have a special relationship. The support for BJP saw a massive increase in 2019 and this time, our 10-year record of delivering strong economic growth, strong national security and strong welfare programmes will ensure NDA will win all 28 seats in Karnataka. NDA has been further strengthened by the addition of JD(S).Congress leaders are busy fighting to become CM while the state is suffering. The Congress govt has deceived the people of the state through faulty and half-baked implementation of their promises. People of Karnataka are fed up with the increasing lawlessness in the state and with the halt in progress of important infrastructure projects. They are fed up with the increasingly long power cuts and lack of water. People of Karnataka are repenting their vote to Congress in the state election. They will once again place their trust in the proven Modi guarantee.For me, guarantee is far more than a word. It is a very sacred expression for me. It is linked to my hard work and my credibility. It is an outcome of my entire life in public service. When I speak about guarantee, it pushes me to work even harder for the people. When I attach such importance to my guarantees, naturally people also realise it. People see that whatever guarantee Modi gives, he fulfils it, no matter what the circumstances. From providing tap water connections to rations, from building houses for the poor to expressways, Modi is delivering on the guarantees made to people. There are no ifs and buts to Modi’s guarantees. For the Congress party, their promises are just a way to fool people to gain their votes. They have neither credibility nor the intention to fulfil their promises. They had given many guarantees since Independence. Look at what happened to the biggest guarantee given by their tallest leader: the one of removal of poverty in 1971. Successive Congress PMs had spoken about removing poverty but nothing happened for decades. The poor were living without basic necessities like a house, toilet, water connection. Corruption continued unabated. Countries which became independent around the same time as India marched way ahead of us in terms of their economies. India was considered as one of the ‘Fragile Five’ nations before we came to power. So, for the people, there is no comparison between Modi’s guarantees and Congress’s broken promises.Media should look at actions and not allegations. Look at what all has happened in Karnataka. Bomb blasts, brutal murder of a daughter, attack on people doing bhajan-kirtan... During bomb blasts, the state govt tried its best to mislead people. In the murder of the daughter, the media is showing how the father is going around asking for justice. He is from the Congress party, but still he is not getting justice. If this is not appeasement, what is it? It is not polarisation to show that Congress has violated the Constitution and enacted laws providing reservation on the basis of religion. Our Constitution clearly prohibits reservations based on religion but the Congress govt in Karnataka reversed the law passed by BJP to provide reservation to OBCs and gave it to Muslims, classifying all Muslims as OBC. Even the National Commission for Backward Classes, a constitutional body, criticised this as against principles of ‘social justice’.The Congress govt in Telangana has recently said that it will replicate this move. This proves that Congress wants to reduce the reservation provided to SCs, STs and OBCs across the country and give it to minorities. What else can one expect from a party whose prime minister said that minorities have the first right on resources of this country?For the longest time, govts have been driven by electoral considerations rather than national considerations. Every year, there would be some or other election taking place and the priority would always be to win the next election, even if it meant trading off the long-term interests of the people of India. It is a matter of concern for us. One nation, one poll is going to ensure that as a nation, our time, effort and resources get invested more productively towards nation-building. A high-level committee, under the chairmanship of former President Ram Nath Kovind, has already submitted a report to President (Droupadi Murmu) prepared after extensive consultations with stakeholders and experts and research on implementing one nation, one poll. In our third term, one will see concrete steps being taken on the matter.Uniform Civil Code, too, is one of the core agendas of our party. Already, BJP govts in states are mulling over its implementation. Uttarakhand has become the first state to implement UCC. It is clear that separate laws for communities are detrimental to the health of society. We cannot be a nation where one community is progressing with the support of constitutional norms while the another community is stuck in a time warp due to appeasement. We will do everything in our capacity to make Uniform Civil Code a reality in India.Raising the false bogey of discrimination is their way of diverting and distracting from their corruption and misgovernance. People of Karnataka proudly sing Jaya Bharata Jananiya Tanujate, Jaya he Karnataka Maate (Victory to you Mother Karnataka, the daughter of Mother India). Does Congress really think its move to further divide India will be accepted by the immensely patriotic people of Karnataka? Every patriotic Indian will reject this artificial and false divide that Congress is trying to create. Congress, in partnership with the Left, has left Kerala nearly bankrupt and is now seeking to do the same in Karnataka and Telangana. It has just been one year since Congress came to power in Karnataka and they have already done serious damage to its thriving economy. Debt incurred by the state govt has massively increased and their empty promises have not resulted in providing welfare to people. In fact, their misgovernance has spooked investors and led to flight of capital from Karnataka. There has been a 46% reduction in FDI and 80% reduction in funds for startups compared to last year in the state.We should not consider this sinister plan of the Congress party like an idle threat, the threat is very real and stands to hurt our nation irreversibly. This is a clear example of Maoist thinking and ideology. It is saddening to see the Congress party and its Yuvraj carrying forward such Maoist vision which is a recipe for disaster. You would have seen the Yuvraj saying that we will do an X-ray. This X-ray is nothing but raiding every home. They will raid farmers to see how much land they possess. They will raid the common man to see how much wealth he/she has earned through hard work. They will raid the ornaments of our women. Our Constitution protects the property of all minorities. This means that when Congress talks of redistribution, it cannot touch the properties of minorities, it cannot consider waqf properties for redistribution but it will eye the properties of other communities. This will sow complete and irreversible communal disharmony.This is something we have to be very careful about, we cannot let anyone harm the country and its people, whatever reasons they may have. Our nation, the welfare of each and every one of our citizens is our first and foremost priority. Our govt doesn’t design policies to benefit a majority, we do not make policies that will benefit minorities; we make policies that benefit our nation and its 140 crore citizens without discrimination.I do not think they are solutions by any stretch of imagination. These are actually dangerous problems disguised as solutions. Would you work day and night if the govt will take away your money in the name of redistribution? Today, we are empowering 3 crore women to become Lakhpati Didis. Such policies will ensure that women don’t become Lakhpatis and their aspirations don’t progress. If someone has taken a Mudra loan and is progressing, his growth will be stunted. Our street vendors who are now growing due to our policies will also not be able to grow. Today, we are the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world. Such policies will kill the startup revolution by our youth. This policy is a way to please their vote bank.If we really want to ensure people’s growth, we just need to remove barriers and empower them. This unleashes their entrepreneurial potential as we have seen in our country; even in tier 2 and 3 cities, which are giving rise to a lot of startups and sports stars. These reasons are why wealth redistribution, wealth tax etc have never been successful: they never removed poverty, they just distributed it so that everyone is equally poor. The poor remain stricken with poverty, wealth creation stops and poverty becomes uniform. These policies sow discord and block every road to equity, they create hatred and destabilise the economic as well as social fabric of a nation.Yes, Ram Mandir is an emotive issue for the people of our country. It is a civilisational struggle of 500 years which has been resolved and the prayers of generations of Indians have been answered. But you are wrong in saying there is no other emotive issue. A ‘mahila’ getting a tap water connection, LPG connection, toilet and becoming a Lakhpati Didi and having the power to dream of a better future is an emotive moment for her and her entire family. For a youth who wants to start his own business and provide for his family and has aspirations to further expand his operations, getting a collateral-free Mudra loan is also a big emotive moment. A ‘kisan’ getting his ‘samman’, a father being able to provide the best treatment to his child due to Ayushman Bharat Yojana, a street vendor opening a second cart due to PM-SVANidhi and transacting entirely on UPI: all these mark emotive moments for the entire country. Improvement of living standards is an emotive issue which is resonating strongly in this election. For a large number of people of this country, they are seeing for the first time that they can have a better future and achieve their dreams, which is an emotive issue for them.As far as Kashi and Mathura are concerned, I will not comment much as the cases are sub judice. But we are committed to developing our cultural heritage. Our manifesto speaks about the aim to boost cultural tourism across the country and develop temple spaces and cultural spaces of all religions in India as world-class destinations for pilgrimage and tourism. The massive development taking place in our temple towns will not only help the pilgrims but also the local economy.If you look at our manifesto this time closely, you will observe that we have not only expanded our schemes but have also reinvented them as per the current aspirations of the poor. Take Mudra Yojana for example. We brought around an entrepreneurship revolution through this scheme and now we will double the loan amount to match the aspirations and requirements of our entrepreneurs. Take electricity for example. We ensured electricity reaches more than 3 crore households and 18,000 villages for the first time. Now we have come up with the PM Suryaghar Muft Bijli Yojana to ensure that people get free electricity. Take startups for example. We brought proactive policies and ensured that startups get all support. Now we want to make India a startup hub.So, you can see that there is continuity because we don’t want to change our direction when we are successful. But we are reimagining the scale and scope of schemes. The poor who are exiting poverty should not lapse into poverty again. The progress achieved should continue. This approach will ensure that people’s aspirations are also fulfilled and also help achieve a Viksit Bharat. Our manifesto has only things which are achievable. We don’t believe in making false and unrealistic promises that cannot be delivered.I think our Supreme Court has given a good closure to this issue. The Supreme Court judgment speaks in detail about the importance of EVMs and the transparency they bring. The opposition always wants to drag the nation towards the era of booth capturing, which is only possible through paper ballots. I don’t think the members of INDI Alliance have ever been bothered about logic and reason when it comes to EVMs. For them, EVMs have always been the convenient scapegoat after defeat. Let us see if it will be any different this time.This is an example of the scorched earth policy that our opposition is following. Because the opposition is not able to get power, they start defaming India on the world stage. They spread canards about our people, our democracy and our institutions. India does not become an electoral autocracy if the Yuvraj cannot automatically get power. Just because he has to fight elections and the people of India are not impressed by him doesn’t make India less democratic. I don’t think there are many takers for such charges in foreign capitals. They often are more in sync with reality than the ‘certificate shops’ in their countries. When I engage with world leaders, I see genuine admiration for our democratic process and our institutions. When they deep dive into the scale and speed of our electoral process, they are awed by our efficiency.It is my request to the media to first do research on these allegations. Instead of introspecting why its functionaries are leaving in hordes, Congress is making such excuses. There are many politicians with no ED or CBI cases against them who have left Congress and joined us. The fact is that just a small fraction of the agencies’ cases is related to political figures. Of the corruption cases probed by the ED, only 3% involve politicians. The remaining 97% are linked to officials and criminals. Action is being taken against them too. Over the last 11 years, out of 10,622 preliminary inquiries and regular cases being investigated by the CBI, only about 1-1.5% of the total cases involved politicians. This debunks the claim of a politically-motivated modus operandi. Another interesting fact is that before 2014, the ED attached assets worth only Rs 5,000 crore, whereas in the last 10 years that amount has increased to more than Rs 1 lakh crore.Most importantly, no ongoing investigation has been closed simply because the person involved has joined a particular party. Corruption is a serious problem, and we’re dealing with it seriously. We have come a long way in our battle against corruption in the last 10 years and are now at an inflection point. Investigations by our central agencies also extend to high-profile bureaucrats, resulting in the identification and attachment of proceeds worth over Rs 16,000 crore. These numbers show the agencies’ commitment to being fair and effective in tackling economic offences.I think it is the media’s responsibility to show the people the full perspective on this issue, how people of Delhi are suffering, and what the courts have said about the case. I am optimistic that this will not become a precedent. I feel other politicians won’t be so lacking in morals and will not go to this extent.Congress party, which converted Raj Bhavans into Congress Bhavans, has no right to speak about the sanctity of the governor’s post. Before I took on the role of prime minister, I was chief minister of a state for more than a decade. In those years, I worked under Congress governors. I respected them and they respected me, despite our differences, and this was the case for many years. Perhaps for the first time since India’s Independence, we’re seeing this level of unprecedented attacks on our governors in various states. We must understand that the governor acts as a bridge between the Union and state govt, bringing in much-needed balance in administration to an otherwise diverse and vast nation. It is very unfortunate that in certain states, we are hearing about workers of political parties stopping the governor’s convoy, and in some states, even throwing petrol bombs at the Raj Bhavan. This kind of behaviour is alarming and unacceptable. When such incidents happen, they raise serious concerns about the overall law and order situation in the state. It indicates a breakdown of authority and respect for the rule of law.As far as Raj Bhavan’s interference in state affairs goes, we need to take a look at history. Which party and people in power misused Article 356 the most to paralyse state machineries that they disagreed with? Which prime minister used Article 356 fifty times to topple elected govts led by opposition parties? And this begs the question: How many elected state govts have been toppled unethically since 2014? None. Instead, there has been a rise in cooperative federalism, with efforts to foster better relations between the Centre and states. The governor represents the constitutional authority of the state, and their position should be respected by all parties, regardless of political differences.Our efforts have been to expand the spectrum of opportunities for the youth, be it public sector, private sector or entrepreneurship. Our 10 years will be remembered for creating the maximum number of opportunities across all three segments. Rather than argue that one kind of job is better or another, we have focused on improving the overall pool of opportunities available for the youth. The results are visible. The annual Periodic Labour Force Survey data shows us that between 2017 and 2023, the labour force participation rate has increased from 49.8% to 57.9%. The unemployment rate has gone down from 6% to 3.2%. Between 2017 and 2024, over 7 crore new EPFO subscribers have been added. Over 8 crore new businesses have been started with Mudra alone and each business has supported 1-2 people. This means more than 15 crore opportunities have been created. Now add to this Startup India, Stand-up India loans and SVANidhi loans, the entrepreneurial sector itself has completely transformed. We have opened several new avenues for the youth. Space sector, which was not even thought about some years ago, is flourishing today.Our gig economy is thriving and employs lakhs of people, with over 20% engaged in highly skilled jobs. Our digital economy is also growing exponentially with over 6 crore jobs generated till 2019; a number that may double in the next few years. A recent report has said that in the past decade, the real estate sector has seen the creation of over 3 crore new jobs. I regularly attend Rozgar Melas which is the largest-ever drive to give govt jobs where we have given recruitment letters to lakhs of youth.India becoming Viksit Bharat is not Modi’s vision. It is the vision and will of 140 crore Indians that when the nation celebrates the 100th year of Independence, it should be a developed nation. I find myself extremely fortunate that I have been an instrument to realise the dreams and aspirations of my countrymen. The speed and scale of our work reflects our eagerness to take the nation to new heights. Our model of saturation shows our commitment to open the doors of prosperity for every family. Our push towards technology and newer opportunities is ensuring that our yuva shakti reaches its full potential. Our borders today are more secure than ever, our nari shakti is the one leading social change, our infrastructure is acquiring global standards and our economy is turning more and more aatmanirbhar. In the last 10 years, we have built a solid foundation for the nation’s growth to take flight. That is why I say that what you have seen till now is only a trailer. There is a lot that I want to do. Let me assure you, Modi is blessed by 140 crore Indians. He will not stop till the dream of Viksit Bharat is achieved.Shouldn’t the goal of our foreign policy be to advance our national interest? Our approach to foreign policy is ‘nation first’. And when we talk about our rise through a ‘nation first’ approach, it doesn’t threaten the world. The world feels the rise of India is good for the world. The world only respects those who stand for themselves. No one respects those who cannot even stand for their national interest. So when we conducted our foreign policy as per our national interest, initially it would have come as a surprise to many. For example, when we went into trade deal discussions looking at our interests in mind, our partners and even the media were surprised to see us doing so. Our partners have realised that it is normal for nations to stand for their national interest. Doing so, in fact, increased their respect for India. They came to terms with a new reality where India is very cognisant of what is good for its people and what is not. Today, the world respects India for being able to ensure that fuel and energy prices for its citizens stayed in control despite the global conflicts.Whenever I meet world leaders, I see that their interest and attraction for India is increasing. They see the situation in their countries and compare it with how India is a nation brimming with optimism and opportunities. I see genuine respect for India and Indians. Yes, the world is today filled with conflicts and chaos, but there are islands of calm and growth like India. India’s role is more important in the world than ever before.To be honest, I do not know about these records. It is your work to analyse such trends. I just keep doing my work. But since you have asked this question, I would urge you to do an analysis of this. You could look at the political landscape at that time, the opposition parties and their leaders. You could look at the level of awareness among people for their rights as well as their education levels. You can look at the media presence.

NEW DELHI: Four years into the face-to-face military confrontation in eastern Ladakh, which also triggered tensions all along the Line of Actual Control, there has been no let-up in the way China continues to build border infrastructure and dual-use ‘Xiaokang’ villages, strengthen military positions and deploy additional aircraft at its air-bases facing India.Latest satellite imagery , intelligence reports and other inputs show this ongoing Chinese activity in all the three sectors of the 3,488-km LAC , stretching from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh, defence and security establishment sources told“People’s Liberation Army ( PLA ) is relentlessly consolidating its military positions and support infrastructure in various depth and staging areas along the LAC, including near the buffer zones created after troop disengagements in eastern Ladakh,” a source said.China, for instance, recently completed construction of a road from the north of Samzungling to the Galwan Valley, providing the PLA with a 15-km shorter alternate axis to rapidly build-up troops in the area.A no-patrol buffer zone was created around Patrolling Point-14 in Galwan Valley three weeks after the violent clash in which 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese troops were killed there on June 15, 2020.Similarly, sources said, PLA has been progressively strengthening military and transport infrastructure to the rear of the other buffer zones on both banks of Pangong Tso, including the Kailash range, and Gogra-Hot Springs, all of which have largely come up in areas that India considers its own territory.PLA has also been focussing on last-mile connectivity through roads, bridges, tunnels and helipads to its forward positions, while also constructing new bunkers, camps, underground shelters, artillery positions, radar sites and ammunition dumps in other stretches of the LAC. “This increased PLA activity is especially being seen in the eastern sector, across Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh and Naku La in north Sikkim,” another source said.India, of course, continues to match the PLA with “mirror military deployments”, while it has also majorly cranked up infrastructure and capability development along the frontier, as earlier reported byChina has also offset some of its air combat disadvantage due to high-altitude terrain constraints by deploying additional fighters, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft and drones after upgrading its airfields like Hotan, Kashgar, Gargunsa, Shigatse, Bangda, Nyingchi and Hoping, among others, with new and extended runways, hardened shelters, fuel and ammunition storage facilities.Latest inputs, for instance, show two new JH-7A fighter-bombers and three Y-20 heavy-lift aircraft, among others, deployed at Hotan in Xinjiang to add to the almost 50 J-11 and J-7 fighters, five Y-8 and Y-7 transport aircraft and KJ-500 AEW&C (airborne early-warning and control) aircraft already present there.Sources say new Chinese dual-use ‘Xiaokang’ border villages are also regularly being built and older ones being “populated” along the disputed stretches of the LAC, especially in the eastern sector, to reinforce PLA positions as well as lay claim to territory.China has been building as many as 628 such border defence villages to fortify the borders of the Tibetan Autonomous Region with India and Bhutan over the last few years, as earlier reported by“All this clearly indicates PLA will continue to permanently station troops in forward locations along the LAC, even if eventually there is some sort of disengagement at the two major persisting face-off sites at Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh,” a source said.It was on May 5-6 in 2020 that dozens of Indian and Chinese soldiers were injured in the first major clash that erupted on the north bank of Pangong Tso after the PLA’s well-planned multiple incursions into eastern Ladakh caught India off-guard initially.Four years later, there are currently 50,000 to 60,000 PLA troops with heavy weaponry forward deployed in the western (Ladakh) and central sectors (Uttarakhand, Himachal) as well as 90,000 soldiers in the eastern one (Sikkim, Arunachal).","China continues to build border infrastructure and dual-use ‘Xiaokang’ villages, strengthen military positions and deploy additional aircraft at its air-bases facing India.

His background includes studying at University of Jaipur and obtaining an MBA from Delhi University before working as an international manager for HSBC. A posting in London in 2006 solidified his decision to settle in UK, attracted by London’s multiculturalism and opportunities.Motivated by personal experiences, including a mugging in London, to stand in the elections, the father of two is the lone Indian-origin candidate. “I have run large businesses. I have sat on many boards. I will bring in new money. I understand money. The others don’t. For me London is like a global bank,” he said.Confident in his ability to lead, Ghulati pledges to scrap the controversial ULEZ policy introduced by Khan, which charges drivers of the most polluting vehicles £12.50 (Rs 1,300) per day to drive in London. He also advocates for rent controls and incentivising developers to build social housing, along with the creation of social impact funds.Ghulati, originally from GK2 in New Delhi, said Asian voters, including Muslims, backed him. “I am the strongest voice for Gaza,” he asserted.","Tarun Ghulati is the lone Indian-origin candidate in London mayoral elections.

RANCHI: The Birsa Munda airport in Ranchi will implement new parking charges from May 1 to curb vehicular rush near passenger terminal. It has also identified a new parking lot which can accommodate 350 vehicles, it said in a statement.To curb the menace of excessive charge by parking agents, airport sources also maintained that they are working on a plan to introduce Fastag system, which will also get implemented soon.""There have been reports that passengers get fleeced by the parking agency. Fastag will end those,"" said an official, adding that the additional parking lot is aimed at keeping lanes at the terminal buildings uncluttered. ""We are seeking help of the local administration to ensure proper implementation of vehicular movement and parking plans from May 1 onwards,"" he added. According to the communique, private vehicles entering for pick-up and drop will not have to pay for entry and exit for 10 minutes. Earlier, it was only for five minutes.Different parking rates have been devised as per the vehicle category. For example, a two-wheeler has to pay Rs 10 for first 30 minutes and Rs 15 for 30 minutes to 2 hours. Thereafter, two-wheelers will be charged Rs 5 per hour after 2 hours (120 mins). ""The parking rate beyond 7 hours up to 24 hours will be 300% of the 30 minutes to 120 minutes,"" read the statement (see detailed price chart on ).The BJP and JMM locked horns over a helipad outside the Birsa Munda airport in Ranchi.BJP's Rajya Sabha MP Aditya Prasad Sahu said: ""We have seen helicopters taking off and touching down at Ranchi airport during elections. But this is the first time helicopters are flying out from a helipad at Khelgaon in Hotwar. This has been done with the support of the Ranchi DC (deputy commissioner) and SDO.""Retorting to BJP's charges, the JMM said the helipad at Hotwar was designated to them by the Airports Authority of India and not the district administration.

Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.",Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. The current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-97110937,imgsize-18004,width-400,resizemode-4/97110937.jpg"
"'Divest from Israel': Columbia, Harvard say no to student demands",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/divest-from-israel-columbia-harvard-say-no-to-student-demands/articleshow/109645691.cms,"A cause celebre is ringing out across Harvard Yard, Columbia’s South Lawn, Yale’s Beinecke Plaza and UC Berkeley’s Sproul Plaza: Disclose and divest.And university students say they won’t stop protesting against Israel until that demand is met.“We’re willing to risk suspension, expulsion and arrest, and I think that that will put pressure,” said Malak Afaneh, a law student at University of California, Berkeley, and a protest organizer.She and her fellow pro-Palestinian demonstrators want universities to cut their investments in everything tied to Israel and weapons that fuel the war in Gaza. That means funds run by BlackRock, Google as well as Amazon’s cloud service, Lockheed Martin and even Airbnb.It’s a long-shot demand — university administrators and lawmakers have for decades rejected the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement against Israel, viewing it as antisemitic because it calls into question the legitimacy of the Jewish state and singles out the policies of one country.It’s fiercely opposed by many donors and alumni, and what’s more, acting on the BDS concept is discouraged by laws in more than half of US states, including New York and California. That’s unlikely to change anytime soon.“I have consistently opposed all forms of antisemitism, including discrimination against and demonization of the people of Israel through the BDS movement ,” said California Assembly Democratic Caucus Chair Rick Chavez Zbur. “I would strongly oppose any attempts to change laws protecting against such discrimination.”Yet it’s gaining proponents, especially among students at elite universities since Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel and sparked the conflict in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.They’re chanting on college grounds, waving Palestinian flags, wearing keffiyehs and beating drums. Encampments have sprouted on campuses, including at Harvard where about 30 tents currently stand in front of the John Harvard statue, according to the Harvard Crimson.Some protesters, including at Columbia and Berkeley, have threatened Jewish students and expressed support for Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the US.All that has left universities struggling to balance the right to free speech with the need for maintaining order and ensuring the safety of students. But on the question of divestment, they are unmoved.Harvard, which has the largest US endowment at almost $51 billion, made clear this month it “opposes calls for a policy of boycotting Israel and its academic institutions.” Brown refused to acknowledge BDS demands while students led an eight-day hunger strike. Yale this week wouldn’t even consider a proposal to divest from weapons makers and instead police rounded up protesters outside of the Schwarzman Center, arresting more than 40 students.BDS supporters take inspiration from the drive to isolate South Africa during the apartheid era — including actions taken at the time by Columbia, Michigan State and California universities — and recent pushes for colleges to address fossil fuel holdings.This time at Michigan State, where groups of students are camped in tents in People’s Park, there’s no appetite for severing ties with Israel.“Divestment would conflict with stewarding the institution’s financial health, would increase investment risks, and limit returns and jeopardize the assurance resources will continue to be available now and for future generations,” said Sandy Pierce, chair of Michigan State University’s board, speaking earlier this month at a Board of Trustees meeting.Columbia in February declined a proposal to withdraw financial support from Israel, months before students set up tents on the Morningside Heights campus and created a standoff with the university that resulted in more than 100 arrests.Ray Guerrero, 27, who’s studying for a masters in public health, helped pen the divestment proposal for the Columbia University Apartheid Divest coalition. The group has a litany of demands, including cutting ties to Israeli academic institutions, defunding public safety and reparations for the indigenous people of New York. Guerrero understands the goals are lofty for the immediate term, but stresses the main focus for now is disclosure and divestment around Columbia’s $13.6 billion endowment.Layla Saliba, a 24-year-old studying for a masters in social work, is part of CUAD’s research team, which she said has been studying the school’s financial disclosures, including its tax forms and 13Fs disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission.“We were only able to get about 0.6% of their investments as public information,” she said.The latest 13F discloses just $47 million of its holdings, with the vast majority stock in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. That leaves billions of dollars undisclosed.“That’s really concerning because our endowment, yes, it’s funded by benefactors, it’s funded by donors, but a portion of that is also funded with our tuition dollars,” Saliba said. “And we feel that as students, we need to have more transparency on that.”Universities say the protesters’ claims aren’t accurate.The University of California, which opposes any boycott of Israel, said in a statement that tuition fees are not used for investments. College endowments are almost always funded with donations and investment gains. What’s more, they fund financial aid for students and other operating expenses such as teacher salaries.And the challenge isn’t just ideological. Endowments typically don’t hold large concentrations of single stocks as they used to decades ago, when activists targeted companies operating in South Africa.Endowments have long relied on external managers, including private equity firms and hedge funds. Almost 700 institutions hold about $840 billion in endowment assets. They also use ETFs, index funds or mutual funds that pool hundreds of stocks and bonds.With private equity, a school’s money may be locked up for several years, without an option to withdraw, while hedge fund managers can rapidly move in and out of securities without disclosing their trades to investors.“These active strategies are not buying stocks to hold on for the long term,” said Philip Zecher, chief investment officer of Michigan State University’s $4 billion fund. “They’re looking to make money off trading. It’s not like your grandmother buying AT&T stock and sitting on it for 50 years.”The fight against fossil fuel investment, a cause championed by students for decades, also shows how hard it can be to implement divestment. Universities largely haven’t switched strategies to sell holdings, which are frequently tied up in long-term private equity funds, even as they’ve committed to policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on campuses.Despite the setbacks and opposition, some pro-Palestine protesters are undeterred.“It seems like a no for now, but students will keep pushing,” said Lumisa Bista, a junior studying astrophysics at Yale, who was among protesters at the university who slept overnight at Beinecke Plaza this week. “I’ll keep pushing.”","Protesters want universities to cut investments in everything tied to Israel and weapons that fuel the war in Gaza.

In a statement that underscores the change in corporate America, Garcetti said, ""The old joke was you could not become a CEO in the US if you are Indian, now the joke is you cannot become a CEO in America if you are not Indian, whether it is Google, Microsoft or Starbucks, people have come and made a big difference.""During an interview at the American Center, the envoy highlighted the US's commitment to fostering people-to-people ties, particularly through educational exchanges, which he described as having the potential to ""last a lifetime."" Garcetti revealed that the US mission in India is gearing up to handle an increased number of student visa applications this year, reflecting a continuing trend of rising interest among Indian students in American education.Further commenting on the visa process, Garcetti recalled President Joe Biden's directive to reduce visa wait times for Indians, saying, ""He did! It is the first time, I think in American history that a President has told an ambassador—get those visas waiting time down."" The ambassador also noted the enthusiastic support for this initiative among Americans who are keen on strengthening ties with India.Highlighting the depth of the educational ties, Garcetti noted, ""I think nothing ties our countries and our people together, more than our exchange students."" He elaborated on the profound impact of these exchanges, explaining how they facilitate mutual understanding and respect between the two nations.The ambassador also touched on the logistical challenges of reducing visa wait times but framed these challenges as positive indicators of the strong desire among Indians to engage with the US. Last year, the US issued a record 140,000 student visas to Indian applicants, the highest in the world, demonstrating the significant demand and the successful efforts of US consular services to meet these needs.Garcetti’s comments were made during a pre-departure orientation for Indian students at the American Center, highlighting the ongoing commitment to fostering educational exchanges that build long-lasting relationships between India and the United States.","US ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, has emphasized the remarkable success of Indian immigrants in the United States.

Have you heard the one about Trump? Biden tries humor on the campaign trail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/have-you-heard-the-one-about-trump-biden-tries-humor-on-the-campaign-trail/articleshow/109671313.cms,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden is out to win votes by scoring some laughs at the expense of Donald Trump , unleashing mockery with the goal of getting under the former president's thin skin and reminding the country of his blunders.Like a comic honing his routine, the Democratic president has been testing and expanding his jokes over the past few weeks.It started with jabs about his Republican opponent's financial problems, and now Biden regularly pokes fun at Trump's coiffed hair, his pampered upbringing and his attempt to make a few extra bucks by selling a special edition of the Bible.The jokes are the latest attempt to crack the code on how to clap back at Trump, whose own insult comedy schtick has redrawn the boundaries of what is acceptable in modern politics. Few have had much luck, whether they try to take the high road or get down and dirty with Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president.""This is a constant challenge,"" said Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to former President Barack Obama. Trump is ""not someone who plays by the rules. So it's up to Biden to figure out how to adapt and play by new rules of engagement.""So far, Biden has been trying to thread a delicate needle to boost his chances of a second term. He uses humor to paint Trump as a buffoon unworthy of the Oval Office, but the president stops short of turning the election into a laughing matter.Sometimes he finds that a few jokes can energize an audience even more than a major policy victory and draw precious attention away from an opponent who otherwise commands the spotlight even while stuck in a New York courtroom for his first criminal trial.The latest example came at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner on Saturday night. After years of Trump constantly needling Biden as ""sleepy"" and mocking his age (Biden is 81, Trump is 77), Biden lobbed the insult back after Trump appeared to doze off in court.Biden nicknamed his rival ""Sleepy Don,"" adding, ""I kind of like that. I may use it again.""""Of course the 2024 election's in full swing and yes, age is an issue,"" he said. ""I'm a grown man running against a 6-year-old.""Trump didn't seem to appreciate the ribbing, posting on his social media platform that the dinner was ""really bad"" and Biden was ""an absolute disaster.""But jokes at the annual black-tie affair, which also features a professional comedian (this year it was Colin Jost of NBC's ""Saturday Night Live""), are nothing new. The real meat of Biden's routine comes during campaign speeches in which he devotes a few moments to taking digs at Trump in between recitations of policy proposals and legislative accomplishments.""Remember when he was trying to deal with COVID? He suggested: Inject a little bleach in your vein,"" Biden said Wednesday to a labor union, describing Trump's guidance from the White House during the pandemic. ""He missed. It all went to his hair.""In Tampa, Florida, the day before, he assailed Trump for the Supreme Court's ruling that overturned abortion protections - with three justices nominated by Trump voting in the majority of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization - and then pivoted to the former president's hawking of a $60 ""God Bless the USA"" Bible.""He described the Dobbs decision as a 'miracle,'"" Biden said of Trump. ""Maybe it's coming from that Bible he's trying to sell. Whoa. I almost wanted to buy one just to see what the hell is in it.""Biden rarely references Trump's court cases, but jokes about financial problems that began soon after the former president was ordered to pay $454 million in a civil case in New York.""Just the other day,"" Biden said at a fundraiser in Dallas last month, ""a defeated-looking guy came up to me and said, 'Mr. President, I need your help. I'm being crushed with debt. I'm completely wiped out.' I had to say, 'Donald, I can't help you.'""Even when Biden tries his hand at humor, he rarely strays far from talking about policies. He likes to note that he signed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law - after his opponent failed to do so despite repeatedly holding White House events to drum up support for an idea that never materialized.""He promised 'Infrastructure Week' every week for four years and never built a damn thing,"" Biden said this month to a group of laughing union members.The dilemma is that Trump, who tells voters the whole American political system is hopelessly corrupt, can get away with name-calling that would backfire on other candidates. During his rallies, Trump imitates Biden as a feeble old man who cannot find the stairs after giving a brief speech, and he calls the president ""crooked"" and ""a demented tyrant.""The Republican's campaign said the insults will only intensify as Biden tries to give them a taste of their own medicine.Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, said Biden is ""shuffling his feet like a short-circuited Roomba,"" referring to the robot vacuum, while failing to address the ""out-of-control border"" and ""runaway inflation.""Rick Tyler, who worked on the presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2016, said voters have a double standard because expectations are different for Trump, who first became famous as a real estate developer and the star of the reality TV show ""The Apprentice.""""Celebrities don't really have standards, and Trump is in that lane,"" Tyler said. For a politician going up against Trump, ""it's like trying to play a sport with the wrong equipment.""Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., found that out the hard way in the Republican primary in 2016. After Rubio joked about Trump having ""small hands"" - suggesting that another part of him was small, too - Trump swung back by saying, ""I guarantee you there's no problem.""""Nobody has ever beaten Trump by getting in the ring with him,"" said Alex Conant, communications director for Rubio's campaign.Karen Finney, who advised Democrat Hillary Clinton in her 2016 White House run, said Trump can bait opponents into ""communicating on his terms, not your terms.""""It's the kind of thing where you have to have a balance,"" she said. ""You could spend all day just responding.""But if Trump's humor is blunt, Biden sometimes tries to get the most mileage by staying subtle. During a Pittsburgh stop earlier this month, Biden spoke elliptically about Trump's trial, betting his audience was already in on the joke.Trump, he said, is ""a little busy right now.""","Biden regularly pokes fun at Trump's coiffed hair, his pampered upbringing and his attempt to make a few extra bucks by selling a special edition of the Bible.

US Police departments experience increase in officer numbers post-Covid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-police-departments-experience-increase-in-officer-numbers-post-covid/articleshow/109662346.cms,"NEW DELHI: A survey conducted by the Police Executive Research Forum ( PERF ) reveals a notable development in police departments across the United States. After experiencing a historic exodus of officers following the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 killing of George Floyd , Police departments are now seeing an increase in their ranks.In 2023, more sworn officers were hired than in any of the previous four years, while fewer officers resigned or retired, law enforcement agencies responded to a survey by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF).The death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020 in Minneapolis triggered widespread protests against police brutality and intensified scrutiny of law enforcement nationwide.The exodus of officers resulted in departments reallocating resources, redirecting personnel from investigative tasks and quality of life concerns like abandoned vehicles or noise violations to address rising crime rates. Consequently, some areas experienced slower response times or limited emergency responses due to shortages, according to police officials.“I just think that the past four years have been particularly challenging for American policing,"" said Chuck Wexler, executive director of PERF, a nonprofit policing think tank based in Washington, DC ""And our survey shows we’re finally starting to turn a corner.”Individual departments are turning that corner at different rates, however, according to Wexler, who noted many are still struggling to attract and keep officers.As a whole, the profession “isn't out of the woods yet,” he said.The survey shows that while small and medium departments had more sworn officers than they did in January 2020, large departments are still more than 5% below their staffing levels from that time, even with a year-over-year increase from 2022 to 2023, according to Associated Press survey with several unions and police departmentsThe survey also showed smaller departments with fewer than 50 officers are still struggling with a higher rate of resignations and retirements.The survey asked only for numbers, Wexler said, so it's hard to say whether those officers are leaving for larger departments or leaving the profession altogether. He also said smaller departments, which account for 80% of agencies nationwide, were underrepresented in the responses PERF received.Several larger police departments have raised officer salaries and introduced incentives like signing bonuses to attract experienced officers willing to transfer, a competitive edge smaller departments lack. However, a dozen smaller departments have dissolved, forcing municipalities to depend on state or county assistance for policing. Despite offering competitive pay, even some of the highest-paying large departments are facing challenges in recruiting new hires.“I don’t think it’s all about money. I think it’s about the way people perceive their job and feel they are going to be supported,” Wexler said. “You have West Coast departments that are paying six figures, but still seeing major challenges in hiring.”Maria “Maki” Haberfeld, chair of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says departments have been too focused on officer numbers . She worries some are lowering education requirements and other standards to bolster numbers instead of trying to find the best people to police their communities.“Policing is a real profession that requires more skills and more education than people can understand,"" she said. ""It’s not about tattoos or running a mile in 15 minutes. It’s really more about emotional intelligence, maturity and making those split-second decisions that don’t use deadly force.”Haberfeld also cautioned that any staffing gains made through incentives could easily be erased, especially as officers, including some in riot gear, have been seen breaking up protests against the Israel-Hamas war at universities across the country.“In policing, it takes decades to move forward and a split second for the public attitude to deteriorate,” she said.PERF's survey showed a more than a 20% drop in resignations overall, from a high of almost 6,500 in 2022 to fewer than 5,100 in 2023. They are still up over early pandemic levels in 2020, however, when a few more than 4,000 officers resigned across all responding departments.","In 2023, more sworn officers were hired than in any of the previous four years. Law enforcement agencies responded to a survey by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) The death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020 in Minneapolis triggered widespread protests against police brutality.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109662357,imgsize-31480,width-400,resizemode-4/109662357.jpg"
Pakistan: PM Shehbaz Sharif raises wheat procurement target amid farmer protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-pm-shehbaz-sharif-raises-wheat-procurement-target-amid-farmer-protests/articleshow/109664872.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has finally responded to farmer protests in his country over delays in the grain's buying process by ordering an increase in the wheat procurement target from USD 1.4 million tonnes to USD 1.8 million tonnes, Dawn reported.Further, Sharif has instructed the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited (Passco), Pakistan's national grain procurement and storage agency, to expedite the buying process to assist growers.According to Dawn, these directives were issued by the Prime Minister before his departure for Saudi Arabia to attend the World Economic Forum meeting, as per a statement from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).The official press release stated that decision ""a big relief"" for farmers, adding that it was taken following complaints from wheat growers.""The prime minister has taken the initiative keeping in view the problems confronting the growers regarding the sale of wheat,"" it said.In addition to raising the wheat procurement target, Sharif instructed Passco to prioritize transparency and facilitate growers, as per Dawn.A bumper crop output has been projected for this season and wheat threshing has already begun in most parts of Punjab, the largest wheat-producing province in the county.However, farmers raised complaints against the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited that it was not purchasing wheat and flour mills were ""exploiting them"" by offering rates lower than the government-mandated support price for their crops.The Sindh and Balochistan governments have established the support price at (Pakistcurrency) PKR 4,000 per 40kg, while the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab governments have set it at PKR 3,900 per 40kg.Farmers expressed frustration as their production costs have doubled over the past year, yet they are compelled to sell their produce at last year's rates or even lower.This contentious issue has sparked heated debates in both the National and Punjab Assemblies this week.The National Assembly was told that official procurement has slowed as the caretaker government imported wheat despite having a bumper crop.National Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer admitted the decision was ""wrong"", and the prime minister has already ordered an inquiry into it.He added that the ministry would write letters to provincial governments to procure maximum wheat from the farmers.Opposition member Sheikh Waqas Akram warned the government that farmers would be on the streets soon and ""the rulers would not be able to face the brunt"".The farmers have staged protests in several areas and demanded the government increase the support price.Addressing a press conference earlier this month, the Kisan Board Pakistan president, Sardar Zafar Hussain, urged the government to procure at least five million tonnes of wheat in the current season and raise the support to PKR 5,000 per 40kg.He alleged that the government was ""deliberately delaying"" the procurement campaign because of which the prices in the open market were declining.",Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered an increase in the wheat procurement target from USD 1.4 million tonnes to $1.8 million tonnes.

Foreign talent to make up for unskilled bureaucrats in Pakistan: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/foreign-talent-to-make-up-for-unskilled-bureaucrats-in-pakistan-report/articleshow/109661493.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan 's Cabinet has relaxed rules to hire foreign consultancy firms to make up for 'unskilled' bureaucrats and speed up official efforts to bring investment for various projects in the cash-strapped country from the Gulf and other nations, according to a media report. The decision was taken to support the Special Investment Facilitation Council ( SIFC ), the top civil-military body created last year to bring investment into the country.According to The Express Tribune, the Cabinet relaxed the public procurement legal framework to hire foreign consultancy firms to strengthen the SIFC to prepare various projects before offering them to foreign investors.""The foreign consultancy firms will be hired for five years as a replacement for Pakistani bureaucrats who are found lacking in project planning and execution, according to government sources,"" the paper reported.However, the decision will reflect poorly on the working of the bureaucracy, which could not provide quality assistance to the SIFC.The Cabinet has approved a summary through circulation on the advice of the SIFC, which recommended granting exemption due to the poor capacity of Pakistan's federal bureaucracy, confirmed a senior government official on Saturday.In case of circulation, the summary is approved without discussion in the regular cabinet meeting.The sources said that due to an incapacitated bureaucracy, Pakistan was struggling to prepare projects for investment by Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Kuwait.The development came a week after Pakistan offered highly lucrative returns to Saudi Arabia for getting a USD 5 billion investment.The government was jubilant over its presentation to the Saudi delegation, which appreciated Islamabad's preparedness compared to the past.However, the bureaucracy is not trained in certain skills and compared to the Pakistani delegation the Saudi Arabian delegation was far better prepared.One of the reasons for the lack of effective and efficient bureaucracy is that generalists are appointed as the secretaries of the economic ministries.These bureaucrats, mostly Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) officers, get expertise on the job and then they are moved to any other ministry.A federal secretary can at any time be appointed as secretary of finance, secretary of power, secretary of planning, secretary of the board of investment and secretary of petroleum without a requisite set of expertise.","The decision was taken to support the Special Investment Facilitation Council ( SIFC ), the top civil-military body created last year to bring investment into the country.

MANILA: South and Southeast Asia braced for more extreme heat on Sunday as authorities across the region issued health warnings and residents fled to parks and air-conditioned malls for relief.A wave of exceptionally hot weather has blasted the region over the past week, sending the mercury as high as 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) and forcing thousands of schools to tell students to stay home.The Philippines announced on Sunday the suspension of in-person classes at all public schools for two days after a record-shattering day of heat in the capital Manila.In Thailand, where at least 30 people have died of heatstroke so far this year, the meteorological department warned of ""severe conditions"" after temperatures in a northern province exceeded 44.1C (111.4F) on Saturday.And in Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam, India and Bangladesh, forecasters warned that temperatures could exceed 40C in the coming days as people endured searing heat and stifling humidity.""I dare not go out in the daytime.

She was happy her school was open. But I was tense,"" said Lucky Begum, whose daughter is enrolled at a state-run school in Dhaka.""The heat is too much,"" she told AFP. ""She already got heat rashes from sweating. I hope she does not get sick.""The suspension of in-person classes in the Philippines came after Manila witnessed its highest temperature ever recorded, with jeepney drivers also planning a nationwide strike on Monday and Tuesday.The temperature in the capital hit a record 38.8C (101.8F) on Saturday, with the heat index reaching 45C, data from the state weather forecaster showed.The heat index measures what a temperature feels like, taking into account humidity.Many schools in the Philippines have no air-conditioning, leaving students to swelter in crowded, poorly ventilated classrooms.The hot weather persisted on Sunday, with many flocking to air-conditioned shopping malls and swimming pools for relief.""This is the hottest I've ever experienced here,"" said Nancy Bautista, 65, whose resort in Cavite province near Manila was fully booked.""Many of our guests are friends and families. They swim in the pool to fight the heat.""March, April and May are typically the hottest and driest months of the year in the region but this year's conditions have been exacerbated by the El Nino weather phenomenon.""All places in the country, not necessarily just Metro Manila, are expected to have hotter temperatures until the second week of May,"" Glaiza Escullar of the state weather forecaster told AFP.Camiling municipality in Tarlac province, north of Manila, recorded a temperature of 40.3C (104.5F) on Saturday -- the highest in the Philippines this year.As the mercury rose, Gerise Reyes, 31, planned to take her two-year-old daughter to a shopping mall near Manila.""It's hot here at home.

To address the basic needs of the Afghan population, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has requested a budget of USD 3.6 billion, according to Khaama Press.Last month also, the WFP had raised concerns about a significant increase in malnutrition cases, especially among women and children stating that 1.2 million women were reportedly dealing with malnutrition.According to reports from the World Food Programme, a concerning 1.2 million women are currently facing malnutrition throughout the nation. The organization highlights the worsening malnutrition crisis among children in Afghanistan through a touching video on social media.Earlier this month, the UNHCR has described the situation of human rights, specifically focusing on the rights of women and girls, as well as religious and ethnic minorities in Afghanistan, as very ""grave"" and pushed for immediate requirement for humanitarian assistance for the Afghan people to stay alive.Compounding the humanitarian crisis, reports have emerged of forced deportations of Afghan refugees from neighboring countries, including Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey. Upon their return, these refugees encounter numerous challenges, such as a lack of access to essential resources like clean water, shelter, employment opportunities, and healthcare.The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan has significantly deteriorated since August 2021.Many individuals are worried about the limitations on freedoms and human rights violations, particularly towards women, as the Taliban takes back control.The Taliban's policies, which include forbidding women from entering the workforce and from attending school, have exacerbated the already severe humanitarian situations in the nation. As a result of their exclusion from public life, these women's well-being and the general stability of Afghan society have been greatly affected.The United Nations labelled the country as a ""graveyard of girls' hopes"", as per a TOLOnews report.Another contributing factor the humanitarian problem in Afghanistan is said to be the ineffective strategies of the current government in addressing the well-being of the Afghan population.(With inputs from agencies)","The World Food Programme has been providing food and cash assistance to six million people in Afghanistan every month.

BANGKOK: Stretching their fingertips to the reddening sky, hundreds of yoga devotees rolled out their mats on the runway of Bangkok 's main airport Saturday, practising their downward dog as early morning flights rumbled overhead.The unusual event on the airport's third runway -- which is still under construction -- saw the workout paired with beverages as participants were offered coconuts, iced teas and water to incorporate into their routines.Some 500 yoga-goers and camera-ready influencers began arriving at 5:00 am, making their way in the dark to their mats on the runaway.As the sun rose, yoga instructors guided the group through two workouts, cheerily enthusiastic despite the pollution, industrial setting, and occasional flight roar.""Today is going to be very special,"" an instructor blared, before urging participants to ""put your coconut in the air!""""Feel like a beautiful bird,"" she said, as a plane rumbled along the concrete and lifted into the air behind the participants.While many present were influencers -- and perhaps more focused on getting the perfect shot than the perfect lunge -- most seemed to have come for a laugh.""This was something fun, this was a nice event,"" said lawyer Rugeradh Tungsupakul, attending with a friend.""Right now, because of our jobs, we are too busy to go to a yoga studio,"" she told AFP.Although Rugeradh was worried about pollution -- a perennial issue in smoggy Bangkok, which regularly ranks among the world's most polluted cities -- she said they had checked the air quality before arriving.""Right now, it's not too bad,"" she explained.Although there were a few men scattered in the crowd, the workout was dominated by women.Most were clad in the ubiquitous yoga uniform of black leggings and cropped white t-shirts -- in this instance emblazoned with the word ""BREW"" for Brew Yoga which organized the event.""This is a very special event for me,"" said instructor Pavadee Komchokpaisan, 30, adding it was the first time yoga had been done on the runway.""We have so many people come here to just join the yoga class, and take a picture on a runway,"" she told AFP, praising Bangkok's yoga community.One of those receiving instruction was Precious, who has lived in Bangkok for the past four years, and said she was invited thanks to her Instagram-famous cat Ernest.""He's been to Switzerland, Botswana, South Africa, so obviously this seemed kind of appropriate,"" she told AFP.She figured she was unlikely to ever be asked to do yoga on an airport runway again.""Why not?!"" she asked.","Hundreds of yoga devotees do yoga on runway of Bangkok's main airport.

Since its inauguration in 2013, Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, which was financed by China EXIM Bank, has been a subject of controversy because of its low flight numbers, environmentally sensitive location, and ongoing financial losses.The management of the airport will be transferred to Shaurya Aeronautics (Private) Limited from India and Airports of Regions Management Company from Russia for a period of 30 years as per a statement from the cabinet, without disclosing the value of the deal.Sri Lanka is in discussions with China EXIM Bank to reorganize the airport loan, which is a portion of the $4.2 billion borrowed for various infrastructure projects. The airport was constructed while former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was in office, and he aligned the country more closely with China.","Sri Lanka will transfer the management of its $209 million Chinese-built airport to two Indian and Russian companies.

NIA arrests UK resident for 2023 London high commission attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/nia-arrests-uk-resident-for-2023-london-high-commission-attack/articleshow/109605265.cms,"NEW DELHI: National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) has arrested a key accused involved in last year’s violent attack on Indian high commission in London. The suspect — identified as Inderpal Singh Gaba , a resident of Hounslow in the United Kingdom — was arrested upon arrival in Delhi on the basis of a look-out circular issued against him earlier.The development is significant given the agency, in a first, has arrested a British resident for a crime that happened under the UK’s jurisdiction.“While the move affirms the growing coordination between law enforcement agencies of both countries, it is also being considered a major deterrent that will ensure there is no repeat of such breach of security, disrespect to the Indian flag or any threat to Indian interests abroad,” said a senior officer.NIA’s investigation in the case so far has revealed that the incidents in London on March 19 and 22, 2023, were parts of a larger conspiracy to unleash vicious attacks on Indian missions and its officials.The attacks were found to be in retaliation to the action taken by Punjab Police against pro-Khalistan separatist Amritpal Singh, who was arrested in March last year. Govt had taken strong objection to the developments and summoned the senior-most diplomat in UK high commission in London and demanded an explanation on the absence of security.The high commission was attacked by a group of 50 persons, who committed criminal trespass, disrespected the Indian flag, damaged public property and caused injuries to officials at the high commission.The attack was allegedly organised by Gurcharan Singh, Dal Khalsa, UK; Avtar Singh Khanda of KLF, Jasvir Singh and their associates, both Indian and foreign nationals, who were identified during the probe.An NIA team visited the UK in May 2023 to probe the attack. Subsequently, a crowdsourcing of information was also carried out to identify and collect information about the UK-based entities and individuals involved in the incident, based on which the agency identified many of the attackers. Around a dozen lookout circulars were issued, and a manhunt was initiated.Last August, NIA had raided 31 locations in Punjab and Haryana to “unravel and unearth full contours of the conspiracy” behind the March attack. In Oct, UK’s Metropolitan Police had arrested a suspect, whose identity was not revealed, and was later released on bail.NIA had earlier said it was leaving no stone unturned to pinpoint culpability in the London attack and arrest the perpetrators, their associates and their supporters, based in India and abroad. The raids had also led to the seizure of digital data containing information related to the accused persons involved in the attack.","Inderpal Singh Gaba was arrested upon arrival in Delhi on the basis of a look- out circular issued against him earlier.

"As tourists move in, Italians are squeezed out on holiday island of Capri",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/as-tourists-move-in-italians-are-squeezed-out-on-holiday-island-of-capri/articleshow/109671950.cms,"Capri: Famed for its blue seas, breathtaking views and cove-studded coastline, the Mediterranean island of Capri has been a tourist haven since the early years of the Roman empire. Unlike in the imperial heyday, when emperors made it their exclusive playground, Capri now attracts visitors from around the world, clogging its narrow alleys, packing the piazzas and blocking the beaches during summer months.As many as 16,000 tourists a day pour onto the rocky isle in peak season, outnumbering the 12,900 residents.Most are day trippers, but increasing numbers stay the night as ever more homes are given over to holiday lets , bringing its own problems. ""Capri is becoming a dormitory for tourists,"" said Teodorico Boniello, head of the local consumers' association. ""There are more people coming than we can cope with and families can't set down roots because they can't afford to stay.""Capri is a microcosm of many European holiday hotspots. Locals depend on visitors for their livelihoods, but the advent of mass tourism risks turning their picture-perfect beauty spots into blobs of shuffling humanity.Some Italian towns and islands are starting to push back, albeit gently. Venice last week became the first city in the world to introduce an entrance fee for visitors in peak periods, Florence has banned new holiday lets in the city centre and Cinque Terre park on the Italian Riviera started charging 15 euros for access to a popular coastal footpath to tackle overcrowding. Capri has doubled its visitors' fee from 2.5 euros to 5 euros from April through to Oct, which outsiders pay when they catch a ferry from nearby Naples or Sorrento.""We are looking to persuade more people to visit during winter,"" Capri mayor Marino Lembo said. But such a fee looks unlikely to dissuade tourists from travelling to an island which has more than four million tagged photos on Instagram, drawing in an endless flow of visitors. Moreover, locals say it will do nothing to help ease the housing crisis , which forces many essential workers to live on the mainland.Antonio De Chiara, 22, wakes up daily at 5.20am in his hometown near Naples in order to be sure to catch the 7am ferry, which takes 50 minutes to reach Capri. Around 400 other commuters join him on the ride across the bay. ""It would be lovely to live in Capri, but it is very difficult. Even if I could find a place, the rent would take up all my salary,"" said De Chiara, who recently got a job as a child therapist on the island. Stefano Busiello, 54, teaches maths in a Capri high school but lives in Naples and has commuted back and forth for 20 years. ""I have never even tried to find a house here. I could never afford one and things are getting harder."" Only 20% of staff in his school actually live on Capri, he said. Roberto Faravelli, who runs a Bed and Breakfast near the port, says people like himself might be willing to rent their properties to workers if the region offered incentives to close the gap on lucrative holiday lets. reuters","As many as 16,000 tourists a day pour onto the rocky isle in peak season.

Three Venice patriarchs became popes in the 20th century.Francis's visit comes on the same weekend as Venice launches a new entry fee for day-trippers, aimed at easing the pressure of tourism on the UNESCO World Heritage site.As a guest, the head of the Catholic Church will be exempt from buying a five-euro ($5.30) ticket, but non-resident pilgrims visiting for his mass will have to pay.The pontiff, who uses a wheelchair, has suffered increasing health problems in recent years, from knee pain to surgery for a hernia and on his colon.Despite his health, the Vatican is planning an ambitious 12-day trip to Asia in September, taking in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore.Before that, the pope is due to make two other trips within Italy, to Verona in May and Trieste in July.",Pope Francis visits a prison for women in Venice ahead of a mass in the watery city.

China's share in India's industrial goods imports jump to 30% from 21% in last 15 years: GTRI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-share-in-indias-industrial-goods-imports-jump-to-30-from-21-in-last-15-years-gtri/articleshow/109666104.cms,"NEW DELHI: A recent report by the economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative ( GTRI ) highlights India's rising reliance on Chinese industrial products like telecom, machinery, and electronics. Over the past 15 years, Beijing's share in New Delhi's imports of these goods has increased from 21% to 30%. This growing trade deficit with China raises concerns, with significant implications for both economic stability and national security.From 2019 to 2024, India's exports to China have stagnated at around USD 16 billion annually, while imports from China have surged from USD 70.3 billion in 2018-19 to over USD 101 billion in 2023-24, resulting in a cumulative trade deficit exceeding USD 387 billion over five years.Ajay Srivastava, founder of GTRI, emphasized the need for the Indian government and industries to reassess their import strategies. He suggested fostering diversified and resilient supply chains to mitigate economic risks. This, he stressed, would not only support domestic industries but also reduce dependency on single-country imports, particularly from geopolitical competitors like China.""Over the last 15 years, China's share in India's industrial product imports has increased significantly, from 21 per cent to 30 per cent.""This growth in imports from China has been much faster than India's overall import growth, with China's exports to India growing 2.3 times faster than India's total imports from all other countries,"" the report said.In the fiscal year 2023-24, India's total merchandise imports reached USD 677.2 billion, with China contributing USD 101.8 billion. This indicates that China constituted 15% of India's overall imports. Of these imports from China, USD 100 billion, equivalent to 98.5%, comprised major industrial product categories.""When compared to India's global imports of these industrial products, which total USD 337 billion, China's contribution is quite significant, representing 30 per cent of India's imports in this sector. Fifteen years ago, China's share was just 21 per cent,"" it added.New Delhi's growing dependence is particularly notable in key sectors such as electronics, telecom, electrical products, machinery, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, iron, steel, base metals, plastics, textiles, clothing, automobiles, medical supplies, leather goods, paper, glass, ships, aircraft, and other remaining categories. From April to January in the fiscal year 2023-24, the electronics, telecom, and electrical products sector witnessed the highest import value, totaling USD 67.8 billion, with China accounting for USD 26.1 billion of that amount.""This represents a substantial 38.4 per cent of the total imports in this category, indicating a heavy dependence on Chinese electronic goods and components,"" it said.In the machinery sector, China's contribution amounts to USD 19 billion, representing 39.6% of India's imports in this category. This underscores China's significant role as a machinery supplier to India, noted Srivastava.India's chemical and pharmaceutical imports totaled USD 54.1 billion during the period, with China accounting for USD 15.8 billion, or 29.2%. This highlights China's importance as a provider of chemical and pharmaceutical products to India.Similarly, in the plastics and related articles sector, total imports amount to USD 18.5 billion, with China supplying goods worth USD 4.8 billion, comprising 25.8% of total imports in this sector.Srivastava also highlighted that half of India's imports from China consist of capital goods and machinery, emphasizing the critical need for focused research and development in this area.He emphasized the urgency of upgrading industries related to intermediate goods like organic chemicals, APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), and plastics, which constitute 37% of imports. Meanwhile, consumer goods account for 12% of imports, with raw materials representing less than 1%.The report highlighted that numerous products imported from China, including textiles, apparel, glassware, furniture, paper, shoes, and toys, belong to categories dominated by micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). It suggested that many of these items could potentially be manufactured domestically.""Overall, India imports a broad array of products from China, from high to low technology items, highlighting significant gaps in India's industrial capabilities across various sectors,"" it added.Chinese companies have significant involvement in India's energy, telecommunications, and transportation sectors, playing vital roles in areas such as smartphones, electronics, electric and passenger vehicles, solar energy, and engineering projects. According to the report, while imports were previously conducted by Indian firms, the entry of Chinese companies into the Indian market is expected to lead to a rapid increase in industrial product imports.""As the Chinese firms operating in India will prefer sourcing most requirements from their parent firms, Indian imports will rise sharply. For example, in the next few years, every third electric vehicle (EV) and many passenger and commercial vehicles on Indian roads could be those made by Chinese firms in India alone or through joint ventures with Indian firms,"" the report said.The large-scale entry of Chinese automakers into India will impact the domestic auto/EV manufacturers, firms working in the EV value chain space and battery development, it added.","A recent report by the economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative ( GTRI ) highlights India's rising reliance on Chinese industrial products.

NEW DELHI: Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrived in China on Sunday on a surprise visit to the country, which is also the second biggest market of the electric vehicle giant, the Chinese state broadcaster reported. This is his second visit to Beijing within a year.This also comes days after he postponed his visit to India citing ""Tesla obligations"". He was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and announce plans to enter the Indian market.According to China broadcaster, Musk's visit was at the invitation of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, where he engaged in discussions with Ren Hongbin, the council's head, to explore further collaboration opportunities and other pertinent topics.Tesla's presence in China has significantly expanded in recent years, with the company establishing a robust foothold in the country's rapidly growing electric vehicle sector. Despite Musk's controversial reputation in the West, Tesla's electric vehicles have gained popularity among China's middle-class urban demographic.Musk's visit coincides with a heated price war among industry players striving to gain an edge in the fiercely competitive EV market. This dynamic environment is further highlighted by the ongoing Beijing auto show, where automotive innovations and market strategies are showcased.Last year, China's domestic automotive giant BYD surpassed Tesla as the world's leading seller of electric vehicles during the fourth quarter. While Tesla regained its top position in the first quarter of this year, BYD continues to dominate the Chinese market, emphasizing the significance of local competition amidst global industry players.Tesla has yet to provide official confirmation or details regarding Musk's visit to China, despite earlier requests for comment from international media outlets.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrived in China on Sunday on a surprise visit to the country.

"From myth to reality: King Tutankhamun’s tomb 'curse' mystery solved, experts claim",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/from-myth-to-reality-king-tutankhamuns-tomb-curse-mystery-solved-experts-claim/articleshow/109665268.cms,"NEW DELHI: The mysterious deaths of several excavators who discovered King Tutankhamun 's tomb in Egypt in 1922 have puzzled archaeologists for over a century, with many attributing the fatalities to the infamous ""Pharaoh's Curse ."" However, a recent study by Ross Fellowes, published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration (JSE), suggests that the true cause of these deaths may be linked to toxic levels of radiation and poisonous waste that have been present in the tomb since its sealing more than 3,000 years ago, reported by NY Post.According to Fellowes, the radiation levels inside Tutankhamun's tomb are so high that anyone exposed to them could develop a fatal dose of radiation sickness and cancer. ""Both contemporary and ancient Egypt populations are characterized by unusually high incidences of hematopoietic cancers, of bone/blood/lymph, for which a primary known cause is radiation exposure,"" he wrote in his study. This radioactivity is not limited to Tutankhamun's tomb, as ""unusually high radiation levels have been documented in Old Kingdom tomb ruins"" throughout Egypt, including sites at Giza and Saqqara.The study suggests that the ancient Egyptians who built these tombs may have been aware of the toxic hazards, as evidenced by the eerie warnings carved on the walls. ""The nature of the curse was explicitly inscribed on some tombs, with one translated presciently as, 'they that break this tomb shall meet death by a disease that no doctor can diagnose,'"" Fellowes noted. Other translations, such as ""forbidden"" due to ""evil spirits,"" may have further contributed to the belief in supernatural curses associated with these ancient sites.The mysterious deaths of Lord Carnarvon , who funded the excavation, and several others after the unsealing of Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922 have only intensified these fears. Carnarvon died within weeks of entering the tomb, while Howard Carter, the first person to walk inside, succumbed to Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1939, possibly due to radiation poisoning. In total, six of the 26 people present at the tomb's opening died within a decade from various causes, including asphyxia, stroke, diabetes, heart failure, pneumonia, poisoning, malaria, and X-ray exposure.The discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb is considered one of the most fascinating finds in Egyptology, providing a glimpse into the Egyptian royalty's voyage into the afterlife. The tomb contained five thousand items, including solid gold funeral shoes, statues, games, and strange animals, and it took excavators ten years to clear the treasure.Tutankhamun, who took the throne as pharaoh around nine or ten years old, ruled between 1332 BC and 1323 BC but died by the age of 18. Although there are no surviving records of his death, it is suspected that he suffered from several health issues, possibly due to his parents, Akhenaten and Nefertiti, being brother and sister.","Mysterious deaths of several excavators who discovered King Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt in 1922 have puzzled archaeologists for over a century.

"Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 projects to be adjusted as needed, finance minister says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabias-vision-2030-projects-to-be-adjusted-as-needed-finance-minister-says/articleshow/109664680.cms,"RIYADH/DUBAI: Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, will adjust its Vision 2030 plan to transform its economy as needed, scaling back some projects and accelerating others, its finance minister said on Sunday.Speaking at the World Economic Forum's special meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth and Energy for Development in Riyadh, Mohammed Al Jadaan said the kingdom's focus is on ensuring the quality of future economic growth, and recognises that the challenges it faces require flexibility.""There are challenges... we don't have ego, we will change course, we will adjust, we will extend some of the projects, we will downscale some of the projects, we will accelerate some of the projects,"" Jadaan said.Saudi Arabia is accelerating efforts to diversify its economy away from oil under a plan known as Vision 2030. It aims to develop sectors such as tourism and industry, expand the private sector and create jobs.Non-oil activities vastly outperformed oil sector expansion last year growing by 4.4%, while the overall economy shrank by 0.8 per cent on the back of cuts to oil production and lower prices.Saudi Arabia is projected to grow 2.6 per cent this year, a downward revision from 4 per cent forecast in October, the IMF said in its latest regional outlook report on the back of continued output cuts.In the medium term, non-oil growth is expected to come in over 5 per cent a year, Jadaan said in February, although the kingdom is likely to continue to rely on hydrocarbon revenue to drive investments into expanding non-oil activities.On Sunday, Jadaan re-emphasised the role of an expanded private sector in delivering Vision 2030.""Vision 2030 is about empowering the private sector. The government role is to be out of business - the government role is to make policies to enable the private sector but not to actually do the business."" The Arab World's largest economy needs oil at $96.2 to balance its 2024 budget, the IMF forecast.","Saudi Arabia is accelerating efforts to diversify its economy away from oil.
