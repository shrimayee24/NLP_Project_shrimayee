NEW DELHI: A giant effigy of US President Donald Trump was paraded through the streets of Nagpur on Saturday as part of the Marbat festival, with locals using the celebration to protest against the 50% tariffs recently imposed on Indian imports.Visuals from the procession showed residents chanting slogans, holding placards and wheeling the towering Trump figure through the city. “Tariff lagakar humein jo daraye, Bharat ki takat usse rulaye (Those who try to intimidate us with tariffs, India’s strength will make them weep),” read one placard. Another protester said, “The tariffs imposed on our goods will only ruin their business.”Some participants carried placards accusing Washington of hypocrisy, one of which read, “American uncle imposes restrictions on India, yet ends up taking Russian products itself.”The effigy, built with clay and hay, wore a dark red suit, white shirt and yellow tie, and was decorated with marigold garlands and posters. At one point, it was spun in circles and brought face to face with another effigy, drawing cheers from the crowd.The Marbat festival, which dates back to the late 1800s, is an annual Nagpur tradition where locals parade effigies to symbolically drive out evil and highlight contemporary political, social and economic issues.Over time, it has evolved into a blend of protest, satire and entertainment.Trump announced a 25% reciprocal tariff against India in early August after trade talks failed, followed by another 25% levy to be enforced later this month over India’s continued purchase of Russian oil during the Ukraine war. India has strongly opposed the measures, calling them “unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable,” while signalling it will maintain energy ties with Moscow.“If you have a problem with India buying oil or refined products from Russia, don’t buy from us. Nobody forces you. Europe buys, America buys, so if you don’t like it, don’t buy it,” India responded.(With inputs from agencies)","A giant effigy of US President Donald Trump was paraded through the streets of Nagpur on Saturday.

Uttarkashi Cloudburst Horror: Flash Floods Sweep Away Village, People Seen Running For Their Lives

DEHRADUN/HALDWANI/ALMORA/RUDRAPUR: In Uttarakhand, each monsoon brings devastation-roads wash away, homes collapse, and there is widespread destruction. This year, the monsoons have been particularly harsh, as the disasters at Dharali, Tharali, Harsil and Syanachatti show. Amid this annual havoc, children are among the most vulnerable, forced to study in crumbling govt schools despite crores being sanctioned for repairs year after year. Most recently, a tranche of Rs 20 crore was released for this purpose, yet the reality on the ground remains bleak.For many children, the classroom has become less a place of learning and more a daily struggle for safety-amid collapsing walls, leaking roofs, and the threat of wild animals straying in. Education minister Dhan Singh Rawat, taking cognisance of the issue, recently directed repairs to be completed by March 2026, allotting Rs 2 crore each to seven districts and Rs 1 crore each to the rest six. But state-watchers say this is nowhere close to what's required and the estimated cost for repairs exceeds Rs 72 crore. ""We've received proposals from nearly 1,400 schools. We are sending the remaining demand to the govt.Repairing these schools and ensuring safety is a priority,"" said Mukul Sati, director of secondary education.In Dehradun, officials admit that 227 primary and 44 secondary schools require urgent repair. In Sinyali, the boundary wall of a school was washed away in heavy rain, leaving the premises exposed. In Chukkhuwala, parents have been raising alarm about their local intercollege. ""The ceiling here has cracks. Each downpour weakens it further. We worry for our children's safety,"" said Amit Verma, a parent.In Udham Singh Nagar, 55 schools have officially been declared dilapidated. In Kashipur block, nine schools shifted classes to anganwadi centres and makeshift premises after rainwater poured through cracked roofs and walls. In Jaspur's Rajkiya Primary School, nearly three feet of water flooded the campus during a recent spell of rain, forcing children to wade through water to reach classrooms. A primary school in Maldevta, on the outskirts of Doon, damaged in the 2022 tragedy, is yet to see repairs.(Inputs by Tanmayee Tyagi in Dehradun, Sonali Mishra in Haldwani, Aakash Ahuja in US Nagar, and Yogesh Nagarkoti in Almora)","In Uttarakhand, children are among the most vulnerable, forced to study in crumbling govt schools.

Poll What should be the priority for international agencies in combating terror financing? Stricter monitoring of fund flows Stronger global cooperation

NEW DELHI: After suffering severe setbacks during Operation Sindoor , Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror outfit has launched a massive fundraising drive in that country under the garb of building over 300 mosques to replicate Lashkar-e-Taiba’s decentralization policy, security officials said.The JeM has come out with a new mechanism with the support of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to collect funds.It is using digital wallets like ‘EasyPaisa’ and ‘Sadapay’ controlled by its founder and most wanted terrorist Masood Azhar ’s family members to bypass scrutiny by global agencies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the officials said citing inputs from across the border.The Rs 3.91 billion fundraising drive would secure JeM’s operational and weapons financing for at least a decade, they said.Indian armed forces carried out missile strikes on terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in the early hours of May 7 in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack Pakistan retaliated and the intense border skirmishes continued till May 10 before the two countries reached an understanding to end the hostilities.The officials said the JeM’s headquarters ‘Markaz Subhanallah’, along with four other training camps -- Markaz Bilal, Markaz Abbas, Mahmona Joya, and the Sargal training camp – were destroyed during the Operation Sindoor.While Pakistan’s government has announced funding to rebuild these destroyed facilities, the JeM has launched an online fundraising campaign through digital wallets to collect Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new markaz buildings under the garb of constructing mosques across Pakistan, the officials said.On social media platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, JeM-linked proxy accounts and those used by JeM commanders have posted posters, videos, and a letter from Masood Azhar, urging supporters to donate wholeheartedly as each mosque requires Rs 12.5 million (Rs 1.25 crore) for construction and smooth running, they said.According to the officials, several of the digital wallet accounts were found linked to the mobile number of Azhar’s brother Talha Al Saif (Talha Gulzar) and JeM Haripur district commander Aftab Ahmad based in Khala Batt Township.They said another fundraising channel was linked to a mobile number run by Azhar’s son Abdullah Azhar (Abdullah Khan) while in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, JeM commander Syed Safdar Shah is collecting donations for the organization’s markaz via a number registered near Melwarah post office, Oghi, Mansehra district. In addition to these three accounts, over 250 EasyPaisa wallets are reportedly being used to raise funds for the JeM’s fundraising campaign.Alongside social media appeals, the terror outfit circulated an audio recording of Azhar’s brother, Al Saif, via its official propaganda channel, MSTD Official, urging supporters to contribute Rs 21,000 per person, the officials said. The speech was delivered at a gathering at Markaz Usman-o-Ali during a Friday congregation on August 15.In the audio clip, Al Saif also instructed the establishment of 20 new markaz this year, as part of JeM’s overall target of 313 centres, the officials said citing JeM’s organizational posters and videos. To build these mosques, the officials said the JeM may have two key motives -- first, to replicate LeT’s vast markaz network, decentralising its training camps so that future Indian strikes would have minimal impact on its terror infrastructure in Pakistan.Second, to establish secure, lavish safe houses for Azhar and his family to allow Pakistan to maintain plausible deniability about their whereabouts, the officials said. Under this plan, three-four large markaz centres would function as safe houses, medium-sized facilities would serve as training camps, and the remainder would handle logistics, allowing JeM to operate nationwide while Pakistan’s government continues to deny Azhar’s presence, they said.While JeM claims each markaz will cost Rs 12.5 million, estimates suggest a Markaz Bilal-sized facility costs only Rs 4-5 million.Larger markaz like Subhanallah or Usman-o-Ali may cost around Rs 100 million, but it is unlikely all 313 will be this large. If built, with three large markaz and 310 smaller ones, the total construction cost would be about Rs 1.23 billion (Rs 123 crore) leaving a large surplus for weapons purchases, the officials said.Given JeM-Hamas-TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban) connections and leadership meetings, the officials said the surplus could be used to acquire advanced weaponry and maybe attack drones or quadcopters used by TTP.It is widely known that Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI helps JeM procure arms cheaply from the black market, the officials said. “Today, JeM’s arsenal already includes machine guns, rocket launchers, and mortars.Thus this Rs 3.91 billion campaign could heavily bolster its arms stockpile,” an official said. In 2019, Pakistan was placed in grey list by the international watchdog working on blocking terror financing and accordingly, the Pakistani Government implemented the National Action Plan and presented to FATF that it had curbed JeM by taking its markaz under government control and placing JeM chief and his brother’s bank accounts under official watch, the officials said.It also banned cash transactions, animal hide donations, and other forms of fundraising which resulted in Pakistan getting formally removed from FATF’s grey list in 2022. Now, instead of donations going into bank accounts, the money is being transferred to the digital wallets used by Azhar’s family members and this way, Pakistan could falsely claim to FATF by showing only bank account details that JeM’s funding had been cut off, the officials said.",The JeM has come out with a new mechanism with the support of Pakistan's Inter- Services Intelligence (ISI) to collect funds. It is using digital wallets like ‘EasyPaisa’ and ‘Sadapay’ controlled by its founder and most wanted terrorist Masood Azhar ’s family members.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123444403,imgsize-1736748,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/123444403.jpg"

NEW DELHI: After a delay of more than six months, the Centre has approved negotiations for building six advanced submarines in India with German collaboration under Project 75 India.According to defence officials quoted by ANI, the defence ministry and state-owned Mazagaon Dockyards Limited (MDL) have been given clearance to begin talks with German firm ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. Negotiations are expected to start by the end of this month, with the contract likely to be finalised within six months.The decision followed a high-level meeting involving top defence and national security officials who reviewed India’s submarine programme and future fleet requirements. The proposed submarines will feature Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) systems, enabling them to remain submerged for up to three weeks, a significant capability boost for the Indian Navy Officials said the project aims not just to expand the submarine fleet but also to strengthen indigenous capability in designing and manufacturing conventional submarines. The move comes as India faces the twin challenge of modernising its fleet and countering rapid naval expansion by China and Pakistan.The Navy plans to replace about 10 ageing submarines over the next decade. In parallel, India is also pursuing nuclear submarine projects, with private sector major Larsen & Toubro working alongside the Submarine Building Centre to develop two nuclear attack submarines.With Project 75 India, the government is looking to accelerate submarine production and ensure the Navy’s operational readiness in the Indian Ocean region.","Centre gives clearance to defence ministry, MDL to begin negotiations for Rs 70,000 crore submarine deal.

These entities are now required to collect and remit duties on international postal shipments.Although CBP released initial guidelines on August 15, 2025, critical implementation details, such as the process for designating “qualified parties” and systems for collecting and remitting duties, have not yet been finalized.Due to these unresolved issues, air carriers handling US-bound international mail have expressed their inability to accept postal consignments after August 25 citing lack of technical and operational preparedness to comply with the new requirements.As a result, the Department of Posts will suspend the booking of all categories of international postal articles destined for the US with effect from August 25 except for the following:These exempted categories will continue to be accepted and transported to the US, subject to further clarifications from CBP and the United States Postal Service (USPS).The department is in close coordination with all relevant stakeholders and is actively monitoring developments.

Ethanol-blended petrol push: PIL in Supreme Court challenges nationwide sale of E20; claims 'engines are suffering',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ethanol-blended-petrol-push-pil-in-supreme-court-challenges-nationwide-sale-of-e20-claims-engines-are-suffering/articleshow/123457552.cms,"India's E20 Push



Is all petrol in India now E20?



How is E20 different from E10 or E15?



What impact does E20 have on vehicles?



What Government said?



NEW DELHI: A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the nationwide rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20), claiming that millions of motorists are being forced to use fuel their vehicles are not designed for.The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the ministry of petroleum & natural gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.The PIL argues that cars and two-wheelers manufactured before 2023 and even some newer BS-VI models, are not compatible with high ethanol blends like E20.""Direct the respondents to ensure that consumers are informed about ethanol compatibility of their vehicles at the time of fuel dispensing. Engines are suffering corrosion, fuel efficiency is dropping, and repair bills are mounting, while insurance companies are rejecting claims for damage caused by ethanol fuel,"" the plea stated.The petitioner further sought clear labelling of ethanol content at all petrol pumps and dispensing units so that consumers are fully informed about what they are purchasing.The petition highlighted that global practices differ sharply.In countries like the US and EU, ethanol-free petrol continues to be widely available, and pumps clearly display the ethanol content.In India, however, only ethanol-blended petrol is sold, and there is no disclosure of composition at dispensing units, the plea added.India has accelerated its transition to E20 fuel, a blend of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol, as part of its efforts to cut carbon emissions and reduce dependence on imported crude oil.The nationwide rollout, originally planned for 2030, has now been advanced to 2025. While the government has set ambitious targets, questions remain over the availability of compatible vehicles, supply logistics, and consumer awareness.Not yet. Many petrol pumps are still offering E10 (10% ethanol), while E20 is being gradually introduced in select regions. The government’s aim is to achieve 100% E20 availability across India by 2025.The number indicates the ethanol percentage in the fuel blend. For example, E10 has 10% ethanol, E15 has 15%, and E20 contains 20%. The higher the ethanol content, the lower the reliance on crude oil imports.According to several reports, many motorists have expressed concerns about the impact of E20 fuel, particularly on fuel efficiency.While ethanol has lower energy density than petrol, the mileage impact is relatively small. For E10 vehicles tuned for E20, the drop is just 1-2% .In other vehicles, the reduction could range between 3-6% and even that can be minimised with proper engine tuning, reported ANI.The ministry of petroleum and natural gas issued a statement rejecting all viral social media posts alleging that E20 causes a major fall in fuel efficiency.Calling the claims ""factually incorrect,"" the ministry said they lack any scientific backing or expert validation.","A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20) The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the ministry of petroleum & natural gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123458210,imgsize-58496,width-400,resizemode-4/123458210.jpg"

NEW DELHI: On the country’s second National Space Day, PM Narendra Modi on Saturday announced that India has already reached the Moon and Mars, and now it is time we “must explore deeper regions of space”. Emphasising that these unexplored areas hold vital secrets for the future of humanity, the PM announced, “Beyond galaxies lies our horizon!”“India is rapidly advancing in breakthrough technologies such as semi-cryogenic engines and electric propulsion, and very soon, with the dedicated efforts of our scientists, India will launch the Gaganyaan mission and, in the coming years, build its own space station,” Modi said in a special message, revealing India’s upcoming big missions. He also invited young citizens to join India’s ‘astronaut pool’ and help give flight to the country’s aspirations.The PM urged the private sector to come forward and build five space Unicorns in the next five years. “At present, we have five big launches every year; can we scale it to 50 rockets every year, that is one per week?” he asked the private sector. He also announced that the first PSLV rocket built by the private sector will soon be launched.Modi expressed happiness that India’s first private communication satellite is also under development and said preparations are underway to launch an earth observation satellite constellation through public-private partnership. “A vast number of opportunities are being created for India’s youth in the space sector,” he said.The PM highlighted that over 350 startups are emerging as engines of innovation and acceleration in space technology. India is, at present, hosting the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics, with nearly 300 young participants from over sixty countries.Recalling that two years ago, India became the first country to reach the South Pole of the Moon, creating history, the PM highlighted that India has also become the fourth country in the world to possess docking-undocking capabilities in space. He shared that just three days ago, he met Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, who unfurled the national flag at the International Space Station, filling every Indian with pride. He said when Group Captain Shukla showed him the tricolour, the feeling of touching it was beyond words.“Space-tech is increasingly becoming an integral part of governance in India”, Modi said citing examples such as satellite-based assessment in crop insurance schemes, satellite-enabled information and safety for fishermen, disaster management applications, and the use of geospatial data in the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan. He informed that to further promote the use of space-tech across central and state governments, National Meet 2.0 was organised on Friday. He expressed his desire for such initiatives to continue and expand.

Operation Sindoor gave us chance to use space technologies on Pakistan soil: Minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-gave-us-chance-to-use-space-technologies-on-pakistan-soil-minister/articleshow/123477995.cms,"Space minister Jitendra Singh, along with Isro chairman V Narayanan and four Indian astronauts at Bharat Mandapam on National Space Day.

NEW DELHI: Space minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday revealed during National Space Day that space technology played a significant role during Operation Sindoor While mentioning the operation during which India launched missiles deep into Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack, the minister said, “A few months ago, you saw Operation Sindoor. What you saw was the full presentation of Indian space technology from Earth to space. All you saw was the energy of two key departments — the department of space and department of atomic energy. But what is more important is that these capabilities have been achieved in the last 10 years. Technology development and technology transfer happened in the last 10 years.”“Operation Sindoor gave us an opportunity to test these technologies on Pakistan soil. And, the world got to know what has happened in the last 11 years of the Modi government,” he said.Soon after the operation, Isro chairman V Narayanan had said in May, “At least 10 satellites are working 24x7 for the strategic purpose to ensure the safety and security of the citizens of this country. Without satellite and drone tech, we cannot achieve that (operation).”Isro's satellites provide physical and navigation services for the military.Space-based navigation services of NavIC are used to guide weapons and missiles to their specific targets, Insat satellites provide weather condition information and communication services to the armed forces, Gsat services are being used for strategic communication operations and SAR satellites like Risat provide earth surveillance and observation data.While outlining Isro’s future programmes, which started in 2025 with the launch of an advanced NavIC satellite and will be followed later this year by the uncrewed Gaganyaan-1 mission with a humanoid, the minister said the two of the four astronauts will go to space as part of the manned Gaganyaan mission in 2027. “Thereafter, many more astronauts will go to space,” he said.The manned mission will be followed by Chandrayaan-4 in 2028, a mission to Venus, and the establishment of the proposed Bharat Antariksh Station by 2035. Singh said India has set its sights on placing an astronaut on the Moon by 2040, an endeavour that would symbolically mark the country’s journey towards becoming a developed nation by 2047.India plans to launch more than 100 satellites over the next 15 years, and it will be a mix of govt technology missions and private sector-led operational missions, he said while releasing a roadmap for the space sector for the next 15 years.Singh said the roadmap will guide India's space journey to 2040 and beyond, supporting the vision of Viksit Bharat by leveraging space technology for food and water security, disaster resilience, environmental sustainability and inclusive growth.",Space minister Jitendra Singh said space technology played a significant role during Operation Sindoor.

MUMBAI: Having registered a case against industrialist Anil Ambani on Thursday, CBI on Saturday carried out searches at his Cuffe Parade residence and Reliance Communications premises in connection with an alleged bank fraud that caused a loss of over Rs 2,929 crore to SBI.Sources said Ambani, promoter of the company, along with his wife Tina and their children, were at home when a team of CBI officials from Delhi arrived early Saturday. The searches concluded around afternoon.In its complaint to CBI, SBI had stated that the fraud came to light when a forensic auditor appointed by it submitted a report in Oct 2020, covering the examination period between April 2013 and March 2017.A spokesperson for Ambani denied the allegations and said the industrialist was ""selectively singled out"".CBI issued a press release stating that the accused persons, in criminal conspiracy, misrepresented and obtained sanctioned credit facilities from SBI in favour of Reliance Communication Ltd.By these acts, the accused persons are accused of committing offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal breach of trust, the CBI press release said. Ambani will duly defend himself, his spokesperson said, adding it is an over 10-year-old matter.The SBI in its complaint said the fraud took place in Mumbai. The accused persons or company, in conspiracy with each other and unknown others, obtained credit facilities from SBI by misrepresentation and deception, it stated. After disbursal, the accused misappropriated the funds by entering into transactions in violation of terms and conditions of sanction of credit facilities. Afterwards, the loans turned NPA.The spokesperson said, ""At the relevant time, Ambani was a non-executive director of the company, with no involvement in the day-to-day management. It is pertinent to note that SBI, by its own order, has already withdrawn proceedings against five other non-executive directors. Despite this, Ambani has been selectively singled out.""In its statement , CBI said that the allegations pertain to misutilisation/diversion of loan funds, potential routing of loan funds, inter-company loan transactions, misutilisation of sales invoice financing, discounting of bills of RCom by Reliance Infratel Ltd (RITL), movement of funds through inter-corporate deposits, write-off of capital advances given to Netizen Engineering Pvt Ltd (a group company of Reliance ADA Group), and creation/write-off of fictitious debtors, etc.The SBI complaint stated that in 2023, during the process of fraud identification of the account, show-cause notices were issued to the borrower and its promoters/directors to provide an opportunity for a hearing. Based on the response submitted by directors/promoters of the company, the account was classified as fraud in June 2025. While explaining the fraud, the forensic audit mentioned an instance of preference shares.On April 1, 2013, Rs 1,347.7 crore were receivable from Reliance Telecom Ltd (RTL) in the books of Reliance Infratel Ltd (RITL). RTL issued preference shares worth Rs 1,347.7 crore to RITL in satisfaction of the receivable amount on March 31, 2014. RITL sold these shares to another related company RCTNL on the same day for Rs 260 crore, thereby incurring a loss of Rs 1,087.7 crore. RCTNL received Rs 260 crore from RTL through RCom and paid the same to RITL for purchase of preference shares of RTL.","CBI carried out searches at Anil Ambani's Cuffe Parade residence and Reliance Communications premises in connection with an alleged bank fraud.

Reforms are not a compulsion, nor are they crisis-driven; it is our commitment, our conviction. We take a holistic approach for each sector and undertake reforms one by one,"" he said while addressing the ET World Leaders Forum 2025.He listed several measures taken by the govt in recent days - from a new income tax law to Jan Vishwas Bill to decriminalise more than 300 provisions of various laws and reforms in mining and shipping sectors as well as an overhaul of the GST architecture.""A major reform is underway in GST, set to be completed by this Diwali, making it simpler and bringing down prices,"" the Prime Minister said while reasserting his promise to reduce levies.Referring to the new sports bill, the new sports policy and steps taken to host mega events, the PM said, ""It is not in my nature to be satisfied with what has already been achieved. The same approach guides our reforms... we prepare for the future.We have to move forward. We are coming with an arsenal of reforms and we are working on multiple fronts.""In a speech delivered against the backdrop of headwinds of an increasingly bellicose Trump administration and geopolitical churn and uncertainties, PM Narendra Modi conveyed calm reassurance.He said India, which had failed to grasp many opportunities before 2014, now not only grabs them when they emerge but also creates new ones. “From missing the bus to being in the driver’s seat, we’ve come a long way,” he said.The govt has unleashed a series of steps in a bid to boost domestic demand and step up economic activity at a time when US President Donald Trump’s proposed additional tariffs of 50% on India’s exports to the US could have an adverse impact on labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, gems and jewellery and leather goods. Pointing to S&P’s first sovereign rating upgrade of India in 18 years, Modi said, “This means that India, due to its resilience and strength, offers hope for the rest of the world. ” He said India was contributing to around a fifth of global growth. The PM said semiconductor-related factories have started coming up in India. “By the end of this year, the first Made-in-India chip will come in the market. We are also working on Made-in-India 6G.”“Guided by the mantra of reform, perform, transform, India today is in a position to help lift the world out of slow growth.” Although he did not make any reference to US tariffs in his address, it was seen as a rebuttal of Trump’s comments on India being a “dead economy”. “The timing of the forum is perfect, and I would like to appreciate that. Just last week, from the Red Fort I spoke about next generation reforms. Now this forum is working as the force multiplier of this spirit,” he said about the ET event.Welcoming the PM to the second edition of the ET World Leaders Forum, Satyan Gajwani, chairman of Times Internet, said Modi had refused to bow in the face of opportunistic tactics and arm-twisting when others have “agreed to play ball”. He said Operation Sindoor not only gave a fitting reply but also effected a reset in how India will respond to any such provocations in future.“We are also witnessing highly disruptive policy moves from those once deemed the global guarantors of stability. These moves threaten to upend the rules-based order that has held up the world for more than seven decades. The take-home is that the global supply chain — which ensured shared prosperity to the developed and the developing worlds — cannot be taken as a given anymore,” Gajwani said.","PM Narendra Modi said the Centre is ready to unleash an ""arsenal of reforms"" on multiple fronts, while underlining the need to be self-reliant.

US ambassador announcement welcome development but concerns about dual role,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-ambassador-announcement-welcome-development-but-concerns-about-dual-role/articleshow/123475987.cms,"Sergio Gor

The announcement by President Donald Trump – 7 months after he assumed office – that he’s promoting close aide Sergio Gor to be the next US ambassador is a welcome development for India, suggesting a willingness to intensify bilateral engagement at a time the relationship seems to be in a free fall.The appointment, subject to Senate confirmation, was long overdue and the fact that Gor is a part of Trump’s inner circle should facilitate a candid engagement between the 2 sides on thorny issues like trade, Trump’s handling of Pakistan, immigration and India’s ties with Russia. The announcement about Gor also raises hopes of a Trump visit to India for the Quad summit in November, even as the relationship seems headed south because of the threat of additional tariffs on India.However, the unprecedented decision to have Gor double up as a special envoy for South and Central Asia has also caused concerns about a possible overreach by Washington on India-Pakistan affairs.The announcement by Trump was greeted with muted response in India. Jaishankar didn’t comment on the US announcement about its new ambassador to India at an Economic Times event, merely saying he had read about it. Indian officials were also cagey about offering any observation, choosing to wait for more clarity to emerge about his role.This is mainly because of the US efforts to project India and Pakistan in terms of equivalence, which India saw as blurring the lines between the aggressor and the victim, following the April 22 Pahalgam terrorist attack, and the subsequent Op Sindoor in May.These efforts have seen Trump declaring umpteen times he brokered a “ceasefire” between the 2 countries, even after PM Narendra Modi “clearly conveyed” to Trump on June 17 that neither the India-US trade deal nor any mediation proposal was discussed between the 2 sides in the build-up to the cessation of hostilities. Jaishankar reiterated Saturday it was negotiated directly between India and Pakistan after “very bad things” happened to the Pakistani airfields.India has strongly resisted past attempts by the US to assign itself any role in addressing the Kashmir issue. In 2009, the Indian government pushed back against the Obama administration, forcing it to keep India outside of the purview of Richard Holbrooke, who was appointed envoy for the Af-Pak region.Trump has offered to mediate more forcefully between the 2 countries this time and India will be alert to any attempt to use the appointment of Gor as a stepping stone by the US to impose itself on issues that India maintains can only be addressed bilaterally. As Jaishankar reiterated Saturday, there has been a national consensus for more than 50 years that India won’t accept any mediation in its relations with Pakistan.",Sergio Gor will be the next US ambassador to India. The appointment is a welcome development for India. Gor will double up as a special envoy for South and Central Asia.

PM Modi refused to give an exception to the prime minister.""""The PM is also a citizen, and he should not have special protection. Most of the CMs are from our party. If they do something wrong, they have to leave their position"" he said.""Any position, whether CM, PM or Union Ministers, cannot be above the law. What objection does the Opposition have? The nation is welcoming this revolutionary bill,"" he added.The remarks came after Union home minister Amit Shah tabled three bills in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, including the Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025.The bill seeks automatic removal of the prime minister, chief ministers, or ministers if they face corruption charges or serious offences and remain in custody for 30 consecutive days.Earlier, while addressing a rally in Gaya on Friday, PM Modi had also questioned how CMs and ministers continue in office despite being jailed, while even junior government employees face automatic suspension if imprisoned for more than 50 hours.""But a CM, a minister, or even a PM can enjoy staying in the government even from jail... Some time ago, we saw how files were being signed from jail and how government orders were given from jail,"" PM Modi said.""If leaders have such an attitude, how can we fight corruption. NDA government has brought a law against corruption, and the Prime Minister also comes under its purview,"" he added.Rijiju further said that while the monsoon session was successful for the ruling government in passing important bills, it was a ""failure from the Opposition's point of view.""Rijiju also launched a sharp attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of working in coordination with ""anti-India"" billionaire George Soros.""Rahul Gandhi is going on a very dangerous track. George Soros says that one trillion dollars are kept to destabilise the Indian government. The anti-India Khalistan force sitting in Canada, the US, the UK, and many Left organisations are conspiring to work against the country. Rahul Gandhi and Congress are working in coordination with them and weakening the country. This is very worrisome. But no one can destabilise the country under PM Modi's leadership,"" Rijiju said.""When Congress cannot win elections, then they and the forces against India together start attacking the government and the institutions so that the public loses faith in this country's institutions... They have repeatedly said that the judiciary and the Election Commission are sold to weaken them"" he added.Taking another swipe at the leader of opposition, Rijiju said even Congress MPs feel uncomfortable when Rahul Gandhi speaks in Parliament.""Rahul Gandhi kuch bolte hain, unke saare MPs bahot uncomfortable ho jaate hain.

NEW DELHI: Nobel laureate Amartya Sen raised concerns over the special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in poll-bound Bihar, cautioning that without sensitivity, the exercise could “disenfranchise” large sections of the poor and marginalised.He questioned the fairness of a bureaucratic process that requires strict documentation from citizens who may not have easy access to such papers.While acknowledging the need for administrative checks and periodic revisions, Sen stressed these must not come at the expense of fundamental rights.""Yes, it's true that from time to time various procedural tasks need to be carried out. However, in doing so, one cannot create a 'better system' by trampling on the rights of the poor,"" Sen told news agency PTI.He emphasised the importance of a just and inclusive approach, pointing out that many individuals still lack proper documentation and, as a result, are often excluded from the electoral process.""Many people don't have documents.

Q. What are the penalties for violating the new regulations?

Q. Why were these new guidelines introduced?





Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for the Care of the Affairs of the Two Holy Mosques has issued new guidelines banning all advertising and promotional activities during the distribution of iftar meals at the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina. These regulations aim to preserve the sanctity and focus on spiritual hospitality during Ramadan while ensuring health and Shariah compliance.The General Authority recently released a procedural guide detailing the conditions to obtain permits for distributing iftar meals at Islam’s holiest sites, the Grand Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Mecca and the Prophet’s Mosque (Masjid al-Nabawi) in Medina. The guidelines strictly prohibit all advertising or marketing efforts during meal service to maintain an environment centered on worship and charity.Applicants must be legally registered with appropriate authorities and submit detailed plans that meet both health and religious (Shariah) standards. Permit holders are required to serve meals within assigned zones and uphold high standards of cleanliness and public hygiene. Meals offered must be approved by the Authority, and permits are non-transferable, underscoring strict control over food distribution.The Authority reserves the right to revoke any permit immediately if violations occur. First-time infractions trigger a written warning, while repeated breaches result in permit cancellation and disqualification from distributing iftar meals for the rest of Ramadan. Such measures reflect Saudi Arabia’s broader commitment to ensure order, respect, and public health during peak times of the holy month.This move aligns with previous efforts to modernize crowd management, food safety, and religious customs during Ramadan across the Kingdom, emphasizing solemnity and service free from commercial influences. By eliminating commercial distractions and enforcing strict sanitary standards, the Kingdom aims to foster an atmosphere of devotion and respect in its holiest mosques.Advertising and promotional activities are prohibited during the distribution of iftar meals at the Grand Mosque in Mecca and the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina.Only legally registered organizations and individuals with health and Shariah-compliant meal distribution plans can obtain permits to serve iftar meals.First offenses receive written warnings, while repeated violations lead to permit revocation and disqualification from serving iftar meals for the rest of Ramadan.To preserve the sanctity and spiritual atmosphere of Ramadan, ensure hygiene and health standards, and prevent commercial exploitation at the holy sites.","Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for the Care of the Affairs of the Two Holy Mosques has issued new guidelines banning all advertising and promotional activities during the distribution of iftar meals.

"White House backs bill to deport green card holders, visa holders over past driving under influence records",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/white-house-backs-bill-to-deport-green-card-holders-visa-holders-over-past-driving-under-influence-dui-records/articleshow/123469114.cms,"AP file photo

'Thug' Indian Truck Driver Crash In Florida Sparks US Visa Freeze, Triggers Illegal Immigration Row

At present, ‘Driving under influence’ (DUI) offences, especially if they are low-level, do not automatically lead to deportation from or inadmissibility into the US, however a bill that has been passed by the House in end-July and is garnering support at the Senate level could change the scenario. Understandably, it is causing jitters among the immigrant community - including the Indian diaspora.Joseph Tsang, immigration attorney, posted on a social media platform, “A DUI could get green card holders deported, even from ten years ago! If it becomes law, anyone who is not a US citizen – be they green card holders, international students or H-1B workers could become inadmissible and deportable for having a DUI on record.”The Office of Management and Budget (attached to the White House) has officially expressed its backing of this bill - H.R. 875 or the Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act.It has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and according to immigration experts, support for this bill in its current form, is growing.Tsang strongly agrees that DUI is serious as it takes lives, it causes pain... “The intent is to make our communities safer and that is a goal we all share,” but he adds, “The core issue here is proportionality and process.This bill skips context. It skips rehabilitation. It skips due process.”A single low-level DUI from a decade ago, where no one was hurt could abruptly end an immigrant’s American dream. He illustrates: A green card holder who has a DUI from years ago on his record takes a short trip overseas. The bill is passed while he is not in the US. When the individual tries to return, he is inadmissible and cannot enter US. There is no hearing, no warning, no path forward.Landerholm Immigration, a law firm, in its alert states, “One of the most alarming parts of this bill is that you don’t even need a conviction to be targeted. If you’ve ever admitted to drinking and driving, that alone could make you inadmissible to the US. Even if the charges were dropped. Even if you took a plea. Even if it happened many years ago. This is an extremely broad and harsh standard.”“The bill turns nearly every DUI case (even a single offense) into a serious immigration issue – be it for green card holders, for undocumented immigrants, for those applying for a visa or adjustment of status, those returning from travel abroad,” adds the alert.Immigration attorneys are strongly urging those holding a green card and eligible for citizenship to begin the process immediately. They are also cautioning individuals who have a DUI on their record to approach attorneys and build up a strong defence.","A bill that has been passed by the House and is garnering support at the Senate level could change the scenario.

Trump’s tariff windfall: CBO projects $4 trillion deficit cut from revenues; could ease strain on US debt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-tariff-windfall-cbo-projects-4-trillion-deficit-cut-from-revenues-could-ease-strain-on-us-debt/articleshow/123469461.cms,"US president Donald Trump (AP)

US president Donald Trump ’s sweeping tariff hikes on imports could shrink the US deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade, the Congressional budget office (CBO) said on Friday.According to CBO, Congress’ nonpartisan analyst, higher tariff revenue would reduce primary deficits by $3.3 trillion and trim federal interest payments by $0.7 trillion. The new estimate marks a sharp increase from June, when CBO forecast a $2.5 trillion reduction in primary deficits and a $500 billion drop in interest costs.The revenue boost could help offset the effects of the Republicans’ tax-cut and spending package passed earlier this year, which CBO said will widen the deficit by $3.4 trillion over 10 years.The US federal debt stands at $37.18 trillion, treasury department data shows, and continues to climb under both Republican and Democratic administrations as spending outpaces revenue. Lawmakers must pass new spending bills by the end of September to avoid a government shutdown according to Reuters.CBO cautioned that the current top tariff rates may not last, with trade negotiations and international legal challenges still in play.Tariffs across countries and products averaged 16.7% in August, up from 15.1% in June, according to Oxford Economics. US customs and border protection has already assessed more than $26 billion in duties this fiscal year, far above the hundreds of millions collected in the previous year, the analysis found.","US president Donald Trump ’s sweeping tariff hikes on imports could shrink the US deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade.

Intel stake deal: Donald Trump secures 10% US ownership; CEO Lip-Bu Tan pledges American tech leadership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/intel-stake-deal-donald-trump-secures-10-us-ownership-ceo-lip-bu-tan-pledges-american-tech-leadership/articleshow/123466624.cms,"Donald Trump secures 10% US ownership in Intel (Picture credit: AP)

The United States government has acquired a 10 per cent holding in Intel, marking one of the most striking federal interventions in a private company since the 2008 auto bailouts.US President Donald Trump announced the agreement on Friday, describing the deal as “a great partnership for America and for Intel.”According to filings and statements, Washington is obtaining 433.3 million shares of the Silicon Valley chipmaker, issued at $20.47 apiece, well below Friday’s closing price of $24.80.On paper, the government begins with a $1.9 billion gain, as reported by the news agency AP.The $8.9 billion equity purchase is being funded through previously pledged CHIPS Act grants, together with an additional $3.2 billion from the Secure Enclave programme. When added to earlier payments, the total government commitment rises to $11.1 billion.Although the stake makes the US one of Intel’s largest shareholders, it carries no voting rights or board representation, a point Intel emphasised in its own statement. The company’s chief executive, Lip-Bu Tan, welcomed the move, saying Intel remained “deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made”, as per AFP.“We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance US technology and manufacturing leadership”, he added.The deal unfolded rapidly. Just weeks ago, Trump had urged Tan to step down over concerns about his past investments in Chinese firms. But after the Malaysian-born executive pledged loyalty to the US in a letter to employees and met with the president at the White House, the tone shifted, as per AP.By mid-August, discussions had advanced to the point where, according to the New York Times, Trump pressed Intel to part with a tenth of its equity.Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick hailed the arrangement as “historic,” arguing that it converted what had been Biden-era subsidies into “equity for the American people.”Intel shares rose more than six per cent following the announcement.Still, critics have sounded alarms. As per AP, Scott Lincicome of the Cato Institute warned the move was “a horrendous decision” that risks entangling politics with commercial choices.Tech analyst Rob Enderle called it a “slippery slope” toward nationalisation, as quoted by news agency AFP.Some investors, like Nancy Tengler of Laffer Tengler Investments, questioned whether taxpayers would see any return, warning of government meddling in corporate strategy.The intervention comes as Intel battles to recover from $22 billion in losses since 2023, large-scale layoffs, and missed opportunities in the smartphone and AI revolutions. While once a Silicon Valley titan, its $108 billion valuation is now dwarfed by Nvidia’s $4.3 trillion market capitalisation.Whether the government’s stake will help turn the company around, or simply raise new concerns about political interference, remains uncertain.As Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies was quoted as saying by the New York Times, “Once the government becomes a stakeholder, the question is: what will they do to protect their investment?”","US President Donald Trump announced the agreement on Friday.

"Who is Sheikh Jassim, the Qatari billionaire who tried to buy Manchester United but failed?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/who-is-sheikh-jassim-the-qatari-billionaire-who-tried-to-buy-manchester-united-but-failed/articleshow/123472345.cms,"Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani, QIB chairman and Qatari royal, led a £4.79bn debt-free bid for Manchester United/Image: QIB

Key Details of the Bid:

100% ownership of Manchester United

Full debt clearance

Massive investment in Old Trafford, the training ground, youth development, and community engagement

Manchester United’s stock price fell sharply after Sheikh Jassim’s withdrawal.

Legal tensions emerged: Jassim’s team sent legal warnings following “defamatory” remarks by Ratcliffe questioning Jassim’s credibility.

Manchester United’s present — INEOS, infrastructure and internal calm





Who is Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani?





Education and Military Background:

Educated at Milton Abbey School in Dorset, UK

Attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Qatari Armed Forces in August 1996

Financial and Corporate Roles:

Chairman, Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB) since 2005

(QIB) since 2005 Chairman, QInvest (Qatar’s first Islamic investment bank)

Chairman, Qatar Navigation (Milaha)

Chairman, Beema Islamic Insurance Co.

Vice-Chairman, QTerminals

Final word: Bid over, chapter closed









Two years after Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani attempted a full buyout of Manchester United , new contractual developments have sparked fresh speculation. But despite the opening, the Qatari royal and his Nine Two Foundation have ruled out a return — shifting focus to global sporting ambitions. Here's a clear breakdown of the timeline, the details of his failed bid, the new developments at Old Trafford, and who Sheikh Jassim really is.On August 13, 2025, a key clause in the deal between Sir Jim Ratcliffe, his INEOS team, and the Glazer family came into effect. Known as the “drag-along right,” this clause, buried in the fine print of Ratcliffe's agreement when he bought 25% of Manchester United in February 2024, allows the Glazers to sell the entire club — and force INEOS to sell its stake too — if a majority sale is agreed upon.This mechanism exists to prevent minority stakeholders from obstructing a sale favoured by majority owners. Despite the clause now being active, sources say a sale is unlikely at the moment due to the positive relationship between Ratcliffe and the Glazers.But given that Sheikh Jassim was the runner-up in the previous high-stakes bidding war, many wondered if the clause could reignite his interest. That speculation was short-lived.Sheikh Jassim’s camp has made it clear: they have “zero interest” in returning to the negotiating table for Manchester United. Instead, their focus has shifted to what insiders are calling “mega projects”, including Qatar’s bid to host the 2036 Olympics.Sheikh Jassim, through the Nine Two Foundation, made multiple bids to buy Manchester United starting in February 2023. The Foundation’s name paid tribute to the club’s famous “Class of ’92” and promised to return United to global football dominance.Jassim’s group reportedly submitted five total bids, with the final offer reaching around £4.79 billion. This included substantial additional funds earmarked for infrastructure and recruitment.However, the Glazers valued the club at £6 billion, and despite Jassim improving his offer, the price gap was never bridged. He eventually withdrew from the process in October 2023.Since Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s partial acquisition, INEOS has slowly begun restructuring behind the scenes. With key executive and ground-level changes implemented, Manchester United now operate from a refurbished £50 million training ground.Ratcliffe’s presence, despite being a minority stakeholder, has brought operational control and influence — especially in sporting decisions. He had previously hinted at “hidden clauses” within his agreement, likely referencing the now-activated drag-along clause.Still, despite the theoretical possibility of a full sale, there’s no active movement toward a change in majority ownership, especially with Jassim now out of the picture.Born in 1978, Sheikh Jassim is the third son of former Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and Sheikha Moza bint Nasser Al-Missned. A member of Qatar’s royal family, he has strong ties across the country’s financial and strategic sectors.Under his leadership, QIB has become Qatar’s top Islamic bank, controlling over 42% of the Islamic banking market by 2019. The bank excelled during the pandemic, showing strong financial performance and accelerating its digital transformation.Jassim’s broader interests in sports, finance, and logistics are now converging around Qatar’s global ambitions, most notably the 2036 Olympic bid. This new strategic direction signals a shift away from European football club ownership.Despite the door technically being open due to the “drag-along” clause, Sheikh Jassim’s Manchester United bid is no longer in play. His departure marks the end of what was one of the most high-profile and ambitious takeover attempts in modern football.With Qatar’s eyes now set on hosting the Olympics and other global projects, the Nine Two Foundation's footballing ambitions seem to be shelved indefinitely — closing this chapter at Old Trafford once and for all.","Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani led a £4.79bn debt-free bid for Manchester United.

Karnataka Bike Taxi Services: Karnataka’s transport minister orders aggregators to stop bike-taxi services in Bengaluru; but captains and riders happily vroom away,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnatakas-transport-minister-asks-aggregators-to-stop-bike-taxi-services-in-bengaluru/articleshow/123460902.cms,"Waive platform fee: Riders

BENGALURU: The road ahead for bike-taxi services appears to be smooth, at least for now. Crippled by lack of last-mile connectivity and uncertain auto or cab rides, customers are happily hopping on to bikes and reaching their destination without hassle.While Karnataka high court has clarified that it hasn't passed any order allowing the resumption of bike-taxi services and that the state govt is free to act against ride-hailing aggregators in keeping with existing legal provisions, the court also said individual bike owners offering taxi services or the ride captains must not be harassed by the authorities. On Friday, taxi aggregators continued to provide bike taxis on their respective platforms.Transport minister Ramalinga Reddy told TOI that aggregators must comply with the court's directive. ""Aggregators must disable bike-taxi services on their apps. We'll monitor the situation closely. If there are violations, then we'll take appropriate action,"" he said.On Thursday morning, three major ride-hailing apps — Uber, Rapido, and Ola — resumed bike-taxi services after a gap of two months. Waseem Akram K, 25, said it's a huge relief that bike taxis are back in the city.""When the service was stopped, people like me who depended on bikes during emergencies or peak traffic hours really struggled. Bikes are cheaper and far more convenient than autos or cabs. For instance, if I travel alone, paying over Rs 100 for an auto makes no sense, while a bike ride on the same route costs just Rs 49,"" he said, adding he commutes from Mahadevapura to Marathahalli every day.Even thousands of riders are relieved. They had switched to other gigs after the blanket ban on bike-taxi services came into force two months ago. Ashok K, a rider, said, ""For two months, I struggled a lot. I joined two delivery services, but earnings were poor. It took an hour to pick up a parcel and deliver it to the customer. I used to get Rs 40 to Rs 50 per delivery, which is not worth the money spent. Whereas with bike taxis, the returns are higher. I earn up to Rs 1,000 a day.""Another bike-taxi rider claimed they received a message from aggregators on Thursday that the ""high court has allowed"" bike-taxi services. ""I accepted 5-6 bookings on Thursday, and a lot more rides on Friday,"" he added.The Bike Taxi Association has requested taxi aggregators to allow riders to use their application free of cost. A press release from association president Adi Narayan said, ""We request platforms to access technology free of cost so that we can start earning a livelihood once again. For lakhs of us, your platform is our only way to connect with customers.""",Karnataka high court has clarified that it hasn't passed any order allowing the resumption of bike-taxi services.

Unconventional leadership and office creativity

Monthly “work church” meetings with grammar lessons

Other companies embracing unconventional office setups



A billionaire breaking the mold

Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company, yet she has never taken a single share for personal use. Instead, she has committed to giving away nearly all her wealth to philanthropic causes, signing Bill Gates’ Giving Pledge in 2015 to donate 99% of her fortune. Beyond finances, Faulkner has created a corporate culture that values creativity, curiosity, and learning. From whimsical themed office buildings to innovative company-wide gatherings, she proves that leadership and generosity can coexist, while setting an example for other business leaders that success can be measured not only in profits but also in positive impact on employees and society.Faulkner, together with her husband, launched Roots & Wings to provide grants to nonprofits dedicated to improving the health, education, and well-being of children and families. Since its inception, the foundation has grown into a major philanthropic vehicle: in 2020, it granted $15 million to 115 organizations, and by 2024, it projected $67 million in grants to 305 nonprofits nationwide. Faulkner intends to steadily expand giving, aiming to distribute $100 million annually by 2027. To responsibly manage the sale of her non-voting Epic shares without destabilizing the company, she established a trust that governs these transactions. This careful planning ensures that her philanthropic mission can continue without affecting Epic’s stability or long-term growth.Epic Systems’ 1,670-acre campus in Wisconsin is far from a conventional office environment. Its 28 buildings feature fantastical themes ranging from Harry Potter and Alice in Wonderland to The Wizard of Oz, organized into mini-campuses such as Prairie Campus, Wizards Academy, and Storybook Campus. Inside, employees help source artwork and whimsical installations, including chocolate chip trails leading to a mock chocolate factory, hanging bridges to treehouses, and magical sculptures scattered across the grounds. This imaginative setting reflects Faulkner’s philosophy that creativity, play, and aesthetic engagement foster learning and productivity, making the workplace not just a location for tasks but a space for inspiration and collaboration.Once a month, Epic employees gather in the underground auditorium called Deep Space for a mandatory meeting affectionately nicknamed “work church.” These gatherings cover essential business news, company updates, and operational targets. Yet Faulkner adds unique elements that transform standard corporate meetings into engaging learning experiences. For instance, she incorporates grammar lessons, teaching employees proper usage of words such as “who” and “whom,” and emphasizing communication skills alongside company strategy. By blending education with corporate updates, these meetings reinforce a culture of continuous learning, intellectual curiosity, and attention to detail, encouraging employees to grow professionally and personally within the company. Her story demonstrates that visionary leadership can redefine both corporate culture and philanthropy on a global scale.Epic Systems is part of a broader trend of companies reimagining office culture to enhance employee engagement. Wellstar Health System, for example, offers wellness rooms with massage chairs, calming music, and healthy snacks, resulting in a 10% drop in employee turnover in 2024. Nonprofit Understood designs offices specifically for neurodivergent employees, with adjustable lighting, temperature zones, and assistive listening systems to support diverse needs. Even CEOs like Jeff Bezos favor “messy meetings” over rehearsed discussions to stimulate open debate and creativity. These examples show that unconventional setups, when thoughtfully implemented, can increase productivity, employee satisfaction, and innovation across industries.While many billionaires sign high-profile pledges without fully following through, Faulkner stands apart as a rare example of commitment and action. By giving away nearly all her wealth through philanthropy, cultivating a creative and educational workplace, and fostering employee engagement through unconventional office design and corporate rituals, she sets a benchmark for responsible, visionary leadership. Her approach demonstrates that a CEO can combine financial success, ethical responsibility, and innovation to create a lasting impact—not just on a company’s bottom line, but on the lives of employees, communities, and society at large. Faulkner’s legacy shows that generosity and innovation are not mutually exclusive but can reinforce each other. Her model inspires future leaders to pursue business success with purpose, creativity, and a commitment to societal well-being.","Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

TikTok website is live in India. After a five-year absence, the Chinese short video app TikTok has sparked excitement among its former Indian user base. The platform's website has become accessible for some users in India, leading to widespread speculation of a potential comeback. However, the app remains unavailable on Google Play Store and App Store, and there is no statement from the company regarding a return.Notably, the move is not without its caveats. While some users have reported being able to access the website, others on X say it remains blocked. When the members of the Times of India tech team checked, they were able to access the homepage but not any other page.When clicked on “Newsroom” a message flashes saying, “You don't have access to this page Our services aren't available in your country or region.” Additionally, a click on “Careers” returns “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” message. The 'Contacts' link on the page too is opening. It is taking to a page that shows 'Partners', 'Media Enquiries', 'Legal Enquiries' and 'Privacy'.The development has reignited conversations around the 2020 ban. The government initially blocked TikTok along with 58 other Chinese apps, including Shareit and CamScanner, citing national security concerns. The Ministry of Electronics and IT stated that the apps were “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”Meanwhile, TikTok is also facing a ban in the US. However, President Donald Trump has said that he has American buyers ready to acquire TikTok, and he is open to extending the deadline for its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app’s US assets.The company is also laying off several employees in the UK and said that this move is part of a “reorganisation” to centralise its operations and increase its reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) for moderation.","TikTok website is live in India, some users able to access it.

What Take Two said about these job cuts



“While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,”

WhatsApp Makes Group Calls Smarter

Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of GTA 6 maker Rockstar Games, has laid off more than 80 employees at its Cloud Chamber studio. The job cuts represent about a third of the staff at the studio, which is developing the next instalment in the popular BioShock series. The layoffs, which took place this week, are reportedly part of a broader reorganisation. As a result, the new BioShock game, which was previously expected to be released in late 2026 or early 2027, will now be delayed, a report claims. The move comes after rumours claimed that Cloud Chamber had replaced its studio head and creative director due to development issues.According to a report by Bloomberg, 2K Games, the Take-Two label behind BioShock has confirmed the job cuts but did not disclose how many employees were affected. When asked for comment, a spokesperson pointed to an internal email sent to the studio's staff by 2K President David Ismailer .Ismailer wrote in his statement.The new BioShock has been in development for over a decade, cycling through multiple studios and leadership teams since 2014. After failed attempts with Certain Affinity, 2K formed Cloud Chamber in 2017, bringing in veterans and shifting development to Unreal Engine 5, which extended the timeline, the report notes.Despite promising demos, the project has faced technical hurdles, leadership departures, and narrative issues. Internal reviews deemed it solid but not exceptional, prompting leadership changes. Following layoffs at Cloud Chamber, 2K has appointed industry veteran Rod Fergusson, known as a project “closer,” to help steer the game to completion, the report adds.","2K Games has laid off more than 80 employees at its Cloud Chamber studio.

TCS responds to the layoffs



Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT services is presently facing backlash after announcing its plans to layoff around 12000 employees. Layoffs have reportedly led to protests across some cities outside TCS offices. The protests are organised by Union of IT & ITES Employees (UNITE).UNITE also took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the protests. “TCS is retrenching workers not out of necessity, but for profit. Targeting senior employees & pushing illegal layoffs is an attack on job security across IT. Workers are not numbers on a balance sheet — we demand justice!” UNITE wrote on X.UNITE supported by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), staged demonstrations this week, demanding that TCS reverse its decision and urging government intervention. “Union of IT And ITES Employees protested tofay in Chennai against the announced TCS layoff of 12000 employees and the government inaction,” wrote the Union association in a post shared on X.The union alleges that the layoffs have disproportionately targeted experienced mid-level and senior level professionals. The union also accuse the company of firing professionals with strong performance record and leadership credentials.UNITE is now planning to escalate its campaign globally if the authorise doesn’t act in time.In an official statement the India IT giant TCS said: ""TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation… As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2% of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year.""This transition is being planned with due care to ensure there is no impact on service delivery to our clients… We understand that this is a challenging time for our colleagues likely to be affected. We thank them for their service and we will be making all efforts to provide appropriate benefits, outplacement, counselling, and support as they transition to new opportunities,” added the company.TCS has also announced that it will give proper benefits, counselling, outplacement and support to the impacted employees. Along with this, the company will also be giving notice period compensation and severance benefits to the affected employees.","Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT services is facing backlash after announcing its plans to layoff around 12000 employees.

Musk said.

SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.""This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,"" Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Elon Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" Musk tweeted. ""After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he ""spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy"" and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,"" Musk said. ""It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.""Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO .Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him ""must like pain a lot"" to run a company that he said has been ""in the fast lane to bankruptcy.""""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control.","Elon Musk says he plans on remaining as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.

NEW DELHI: Microsoft Corp is reportedly planning to cut thousands of jobs, with some roles expected to be eliminated in the human resources and engineering divisions, according to media reports on Tuesday.This move follows similar job cuts announced by other tech companies, such as Amazon, Meta Platforms , Twitter, Google , Salesforce and a host of other corporations.These job cuts are being attributed to slowing demand and a worsening global economic outlook. The move by Microsoft indicates that the tech sector may continue to shed jobs in the coming months.As job cuts continue to rise in tech and various other industries, some employees are choosing to proactively seek out new job opportunities while still employed. This strategy, referred to as "" career cushioning "". Here is all you need to know on 'career cushioning'A: Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable and resilient to job loss or industry changes. This can include gaining experience in multiple areas of a field, developing a side hustle or passion project, or building a professional network.A: Career cushioning can help provide a sense of security and confidence in uncertain job markets and can also open up new opportunities for career advancement. It can also help you be better prepared if you do lose your job, making it easier to find new employment.A: There are several ways to begin career cushioning, such as:Building a diverse skill set through continuing education or volunteer workNetworking with professionals in your industry and other industriesBuilding a personal brand through social media and professional online presenceSaving money for unexpected career changes or job loss.A: Some examples of career cushioning include:-A software developer taking on freelance web design projects to gain experience in user interface design.-A marketing professional starting a blog to gain experience in content creation.-A sales representative taking on additional responsibilities in product development to gain experience in product management.A: No, career cushioning is applicable for people in any industry. It's about being proactive in preparing for potential changes in your career, regardless of the industry you're in.A: It's a good idea to review your career cushioning efforts regularly, perhaps once or twice a year. This will allow you to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your plans. Additionally, keeping an eye on the job market and industry trends can help you anticipate and prepare for any potential changes in your field.A: You can gauge the effectiveness of your career cushioning efforts by monitoring your progress in gaining new skills and experiences, as well as the feedback you receive from your professional network and potential employers. Additionally, you may find that you are better able to adapt to changes in your industry, or that you have more opportunities available to you.A: The amount of time you should dedicate to career cushioning will depend on your individual goals and circumstances, however it's important to balance the time you spend career cushioning with your other responsibilities. A good rule of thumb is to spend some time each week or month working on career cushioning activities, but not to the point that it negatively impacts other areas of your life.","As job cuts continue to rise in various industries, some employees are going for 'career cushioning' Career cushioning refers to the practice of building a diverse set of skills and experiences in order to make oneself more marketable.

Budget 2023: With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable. The Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act) provides numerous deductions for individuals. However, the current limits of these deductions are quite low compared to the increased cost of living over the years. Some of the deductions/ exemptions for which the Government could consider revision of limits are:While introducing the standard deduction of Rs 40,000, in the Union Budget 2018, the Finance Minister observed that a major portion of the personal income-tax collection was from the salaried class.The standard deduction was subsequently increased to Rs 50,000 in the Union Budget 2019. While Consumer Price Index Inflation has moderated to 5.9% in November 2022, it was at a high of 7.4% in September 2022, as compared to 4% in September 2019. Given the rise in the cost of living for individuals and since salaried taxpayers cannot claim a deduction for expenses incurred by them, the government could look at increasing the standard deduction.As a measure to encourage household savings, certain prescribed contributions to life insurance, provident fund (PF), savings instruments, repayment of housing loan etc., are allowed as a deduction up to Rs 150,000 under section 80C of the Act. The majority of this limit is usually utilised by the contribution to PF and principal repayment of housing loan; thereby leaving other contributions/ spends unutilized. This limit of Rs 150,000 was last revised in the financial year 2014–15. Hence, there is an expectation that the Government may consider revising it to Rs 2,50,000 in the current Union Budget.Deduction is allowed for contributions to pension scheme of the Central Government (such as National Pension System) as under:We have seen that the limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted by the deductions under Section 80C and may leave the taxpayers with little/ nothing to claim against their contribution under section 80CCD(1). Largely, they are able to claim only the additional deduction of Rs 50,000 under section 80CCD(1B) for their own contribution to the pension scheme. Hence, to provide some tangible benefit, the government may reconsider increasing this limit for individuals.An individual can claim deduction of Rs 25,000 for health insurance premiums paid for insuring the health of self or family, and Rs 25,000 for health of the individual’s parents. If insured is a resident senior citizen, the limit will be Rs 50,000. Medical expenses for resident senior citizens are also allowed as a deduction up to a maximum of Rs 50,000 if they do not have a health insurance. Medical expenses have substantially increased over the years especially due to the global pandemic. This has necessitated opting for health insurance plans with higher coverage and resultant higher premiums. Hence, it would be beneficial for individuals if these limits are increased.Children Education Allowance and Hostel expenditure allowance are exempt up to Rs 100 and Rs 300 per month respectively. These limits set in August 1997 continue till date. As compared to the high expenses that are incurred on school and hostel fees in the present day, the current limits are insignificant and there is a need to revisit these exemptions.The limit of Rs 2,00,000 for deduction of interest on housing loan for a self-occupied property was set in financial year 2014-15. The interest on housing loan is now much higher with increase in interest rates. Further, additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 for interest on housing loan is available to taxpayers only if stipulated conditions are met. Hence, there is an expectation that this limit will be increased to at least Rs 3,00,000 to give some relief to taxpayers. Another associated relief that could be brought in is the removal of the cap of Rs 2,00,000 on set-off of loss from house property against other heads of income.The case for a rejig in the limits is strengthened when one compares these to other countries – to take a few examples, countries such as Singapore and Germany provide for various deductions for individual taxpayers. Singapore has child relief of SGD4,000 per child, spouse relief of SGD2,000, dependent parent relief of SGD9,000 etc. These deductions are in addition to earned income deduction in the range of SGD1,000 to SGD8,000. Similarly, Germany provides for children allowance of EUR227.50 per child per month and 30% deduction for school fees subject to a cap of EUR5,000 per child. These limits are much more in tune with current inflation and cost levels.In addition, many countries provide for standard deduction/ personal allowance for individuals and some countries also permit employees to claim a deduction for the expenses incurred wholly in performance of duties and expenses incurred in working from home.The ask for changes in these limits has been coming up in the past few years as well and while the government has been making a few changes and also introduced the concessional tax regime, a greater emphasis to relook at both the limits and the types of deductions/ exemptions is the need of the hour.","With the Union Budget 2023 just around the corner, the anticipation of relief in personal taxation is inevitable.

According to the Justice Department, Shah was in Canada on a student visa before entering the US on a visitor's visa.The court document said Shah traveled to different states and picked up cash and gold from various fraud victims. He was not alone in this, he had a racket of conspirators who used to get the proceeds from this elaborate scam.Police arrested Shah after he attempted to pick up gold from his fraud victims in New Berlin, Wisconsin. Details of his co-conspirators are not yet known, but they played key roles in the scam as they posed as law enforcement officials and convinced gullible victims that they needed to transfer their assets to gold and then a courier would pick that and put it in a safety box in DC. Shah said he was just a middleman.The victims had previously given over $500,000 worth of gold to couriers the victims believed to be working with the federal government, the court document said.If convicted, Shah will face up to 20 years in prison and forfeit property in an amount equal to the value of the property involved in the offense.A New Berlin couple went to police July 30 to report that they were probably being scammed out of over $526,000 between June 11 and the end of July through a series if transactions involving gold coins. They said they had seen a TV news report about a scam involving gold coins and realized they likely were victims of itThe couple said they responded to a pop-up ad on their computer and called a number. A person told them he was a special agent with the US Treasury. He told them they were the victims of a massive fraud scheme across the US also being investigated by the CIA and Federal Trade Commission.The man requested identifying information from the couple, and sent them images of a badge and credentials to show them that they were indeed from the government. Police later determined all those were fake. Another associate of that man, identified as a “Scott Bessent,” said he was a chief investigator for the Office of the Inspector General, and the couple was advised to keep in contact with both men, whom they said had Middle Eastern accents and sounded as though they were calling from a call center, the complaint said.The couple was asked to forward gold coins to a safety deposit box opene din their name in the George W. Bush Federal Building in Washington, D.C., which does not actually exist. The couple engaged in a series of password-protected courier transactions but in the middle of the entire process, they suspected that something was amiss.Shah told police he arrived in the US on June 17 from Canada, only to be a courier for this scam. He arrived in the US in June and has done 10 or 11 jobs, including in Florida, Texas, Colorado, Arizona, Virginia, Illinois, Indiana and Milwaukee.","Roshan Shah was in Canada on a student visa before entering the US on a visitor's visa.
